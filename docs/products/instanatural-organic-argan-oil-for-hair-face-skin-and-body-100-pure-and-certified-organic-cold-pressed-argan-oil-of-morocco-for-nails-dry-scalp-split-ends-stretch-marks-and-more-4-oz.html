            <li>it doesn&#x27;t work great for this - leaves my hair greasy, and doesn&#x27;t spread well throughout.  </li>

            <li>and I have tried everything to keep them moistened and looking good.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as Josie Maran.</li>
            <li>It feels good and moisturizing and I sometimes mix it with shea butter</li>
            <li>My skin loved it.</li>
            <li>It doesnt smell that good</li>

            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>but it was not as good as this.</li>
            <li>It seems to do a good job of moisturizing my hands (which get cracked).</li>
            <li>Good for everything.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good oil for my skin, but too oily for my hair.</li>

            <li>Good quality.</li>

            <li>that because it is good for all hair types we can use it on our daughters as well as recommending it to anyone/everyone.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why peple said it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Good buy.  </li>
            <li>Nice seller and great customer service.</li>
            <li>good price and good product.</li>
            <li>The oil comes in a glass bottle, which is always a good indication of quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>Really good stuff.</li>
            <li>Really good hair and skin product</li>
            <li>Good buy for your money.</li>
            <li>Good addition in mixing body butters.</li>
            <li>This product does not contain alcohol and does a good job improving the condition of my strands.</li>
            <li>The Product is good and on Time</li>
            <li>They sent a write up of all the good things about this.</li>
            <li>Since According To The Description, It&#x27;s Good For Everything From Hair To Skin To Nails</li>
            <li>It is so good</li>
            <li>good product I recommended</li>
            <li>This is a good deal for those of you who are considering picking up the Josie Maran argan oil.</li>
            <li>Good stuff...worth trying.</li>
            <li>so I don’t know how good it would be on an oilier complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So by putting the argan oil which is GOOD oil on your skin, you are telling your skin and brain that you have oil now</li>
            <li>Good , i like it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>This can be used on your hair or skin and boy was this one good timing also.  </li>
            <li>and then some on the rest of me and I am moisturized for a good twenty four hours.</li>
            <li>and then some on the rest of me and I am moisturized for a good twenty four hours.</li>
            <li>This product is a good as another Argan oil on QVC in my opinion without the price day.  </li>
            <li>The size and price was good also.</li>
            <li>Good customer service.</li>
            <li>because again i heard it&#x27;s good for your hair</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t good for hair maybe for plants but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using an argan oil by garnier fructis on my hair for a while now and loved it</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved the price, and also the fact that it&#x27;s USDA certified</li>
            <li>The scent is light and best of all, you can use it by itself.</li>
            <li>I put this on and my skin feels good all day.</li>
            <li>and I would say it has good quality.</li>
            <li>I have been buying Insta-Natural Argan oil for a couple of years and it is the best price for the highest quality organic oil available.</li>
            <li>I loved this oil...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve used Argon oil, you know what to expect at a good price.</li>
            <li>I was imagining that this would be a good substitute for face lotion</li>
            <li>About using it on nails/hair/etc... you get the result of a good oil; you do not get access to the fountain of life and your choice of princess crown.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also good for skin and nails</li>
            <li>GOOD PRICE.  </li>
            <li>My feet have not felt this good in years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good moisturizer as it soaks in niceley.</li>
            <li>This oil works good for my hair.</li>
            <li>This product is a good quality oil.</li>

            <li>Nice results</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure which brand is good</li>
            <li>do your own experiments and  test if for yourself!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot.</li>
            <li>This oil goes on nicely and has no odor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tested it out both before showering and after and find I like my results best applying it after a shower, has really helped to reduce frizzyness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also used the oil on my boyfriend&#x27;s face and scalp/hair and he liked the way it made those areas feel.</li>
            <li>Nice product that moisturizers well.  </li>
            <li>I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with their service as well as their product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not often one sees that kind of commitment to customer satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not often one sees that kind of commitment to customer satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>All views expressed are honest and my own.</li>
            <li>Been faithfully using every night after cleansing with an Organic Rose Toner.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled that I found this product which is unscented since I do not care for scented products.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving this one</li>
            <li>Nice quality and feel (doesn&#x27;t feel like i&#x27;m putting oil on my face).</li>
            <li>Nice product and a nice price.  </li>
            <li>I liked how it did contain some frizz</li>
            <li>This is the kind you want, with Argania Spinosa.</li>
            <li>I liked the effect since my hair looked shiny and a bit tamed afterwards.</li>
            <li>I use it with the Rose Hip Oil.</li>
            <li>I am buying this along with the Rose Hip Oil and giving them to my friends as Christmas presents.</li>
            <li>I bought it for nice skin.  </li>
            <li>I do not know how effective it is to sooth scars, ( he has a cat scratch scar on his cheek)</li>
            <li>I have been using it on my face and fingernails and loving the results--</li>
            <li>It smells nice to me, kind of a musky earthy nutty smell, like a walk in the woods, but if you find the odor offensive, it&#x27;s gone in about 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does a nice job of nourishing and rejuvenating the skin...evens out skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li>My face and hair are loving it.</li>
            <li>Nice product not too greasy.</li>
            <li>I ordered it when the weather was still warm.  </li>
            <li>I love that this product is organic and therefore good for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it comes in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li>I look forward to finding more and more uses for this great oil</li>
            <li>He has a kind of rash on his cheeks.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and would be nice for the skin.  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best!!</li>
            <li>I warm the oil on my hand and just pat it on my face.</li>
            <li>Still like a food, but with a hint of fruit or something nice in it.</li>
            <li>I have purchased 3 bottles so I always have it handy.</li>
            <li>smells good; more fruity than nutty.</li>
            <li>and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.</li>
            <li>Gives my skin a nice glow with no toxins and no breakouts.</li>
            <li>My mother had me order it for her after trying some of mine and is loving it as well.</li>
            <li>The bottle has nice pump delivery system.  </li>
            <li>Even her friend&#x27;s started commenting her how nice her hair was and asked what she had been using.  </li>
            <li>She really liked this product and started recommending it to all her friends.  </li>
            <li>Nice quality Argan oil, I like it.</li>
            <li>Then InstaNatural sent me an email asking me about how much I liked it, and I spoke my mind.</li>
            <li>This absorbs so nicely into skin and hair and balanced me out.</li>
            <li>After applying it, I rub my hands together and the oil spreads nicely</li>
            <li>it made my skin feel nice...</li>
            <li>The product smells kind of nutty, kind of like Tamanu oil if you ever used it</li>
            <li>In the morning I would wake up and my skin kind of looked glowy</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>This product has a really nice smell, a bit on the nutty side.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own</li>
            <li>Good oil, use it on my hair and it feels OK</li>
            <li>No smell that I can detect, which is actually kind of nice.</li>
            <li>My skin seemed to look and feel healthier and it gave it a nice glow as well.</li>
            <li>So for me it works wonderfully for hair, not so much for my face.</li>
            <li>Now that it is warm, he climbs twice a week outdoors, and once a week indoors.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the lightweight feel of this.</li>
            <li>I Would Like To Start By Saying That I Really Liked The Bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed my nails are a lot healthier since I started using this product, which is a nice bonus!&lt;br /&gt;Feet</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Moreover, I noticed how nice it feels on my hands</li>
            <li>Their offer of superior customer service was outstanding.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice smoothing affect on the hair.  </li>
            <li>love this Argan Oil and am delighted that I was sent a sample to try.</li>
            <li>It has a nice nutty scent that isn&#x27;t too empowering.</li>
            <li>PRODUCT WAS DISCOUNTED IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST UNBIASED REVIEW</li>
            <li>Thanks to the generosity of the supplier, we have had the opportunity to test this excellent product.</li>
            <li>but I can honestly see no difference.</li>
            <li>Fast and great service!</li>
            <li>Product arrived a couple days sooner than I anticipated which was nice.</li>
            <li>I love this argan oil and am more than happy to recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>This is a nice value and generous amount.</li>
            <li>I put a drop or two in my palm, rub hands briskly together to warm the oil, then run it through my hair.</li>
            <li>I have used both the Argan and the Rose hip oil .  </li>
            <li>was sent this product to review, regardless, the review is unbiased and my own opinion.</li>
            <li>However, the condition has subsided greatly since I started using argan oil, which I mix with an odorless body lotion (it claims to be the &amp;#34;ultra healing&amp;#34; type), mostly to be able to spread the oil more</li>
            <li>Yes, I always liked Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own and are honest.</li>
            <li>nice texture to the oil&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>Plus, AJ is so nice</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Price is nice....</li>
            <li>I think that for the price, this is unbeatable!&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: this product was sent for me to review, but all opinions are my own</li>
            <li>Thanks for this wonderful product</li>

            <li>I had the chance to try out Argan oil in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I use it for face and scalp massage, and surely liked it.</li>

            <li>I am very happy with Insta Natural Organic Argan Oil.  </li>

            <li>Okay, I am going to be embarrassingly honest here.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural is by far the best company that I have come across selling argan oil.</li>
            <li>I love this amazing product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am very happy with the product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a natural way to moisturize.</li>
            <li>I love how it feels and it absorbs so nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great quality oil and an extremely economical price.</li>
            <li>May not be suitable for wearing under makeup in the morning</li>
            <li>I then notified the company directly and their customer service is excellent!  </li>
            <li>Liked the idea of being able to use on Hair and skin.</li>
            <li>This product looks good and genuine.</li>
            <li>I bought this argon oil for my face, and so far i am really happy with it!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go with smooth, silky hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>VERY HAPPY WITH IT SO FAR.  </li>
            <li>You need a natural non-comodegenic oil, and argan oil is perfect for that.</li>
            <li>works great and has stayed fresh</li>
            <li>The product itself does not have the best smell but that is something I can deal with since it is all natural.</li>
            <li>Always loved Argan oil for my hair makes it shiny and smooth the best so far</li>
            <li>This is wonderful because it is natural, and before I was using hydrocortisone and it did not even work as well as this.</li>
            <li>OK this stuff is so effective.</li>
            <li>This is a great product; it feels so nice on my skin, it&#x27;s light and smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>but it is still a nice gesture and no doubt of great help to those using argan oil for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pure 100% Argan Oil, and the good stuff, none of that binder and filler stuff!</li>
            <li>Quality seemed great and price was right.</li>
            <li>have very fine curly hair that gets frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this stuff!</li>
            <li>And the smell isn&#x27;t too strong at all!</li>
            <li>It has a delicately sweet scent that is quite pleasant (to me anyway)</li>
            <li>The more I use this the more I love it!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this argan oil!</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s a rare product that&#x27;s good for both, it&#x27;s the perfect solution for older people with acne-prone</li>
            <li>Argan oil is the best for skin of any I&#x27;ve tried, and this brand is silky and pure, and a fabulous deal, price-wise.</li>
            <li>Thanks for asking me to review this - I had heard good things, and you did not disappoint!</li>
            <li>I purchased this specific brand because it looked to be the best value and am super happy with this argan oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the product and how quickly I received it!</li>
            <li>I received an great email from the company, prior to delivery, with great tips and suggestions for the Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>Good quality, good price, but the oil has a strong smell, which I&#x27;m not crazy about.  </li>
            <li>and it comes nicely packaged in a very attractive cobalt blue glass bottle with a dropper.</li>
            <li>Even its mildly nutty smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li>this by far is my favorite, and the best value I have come across.</li>
            <li>I want the most natural products I can find for my hair and skin and this is perfect for both!</li>
            <li>Although I got this product free to review this is my honest opinion about the product based on my own experience.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It absorbs very easily into the skin and makes your skin more youthful.</li>
            <li>This is great oil and it is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Also, this company has great customer service and has very good pricing compared to some other brands out there.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased argan oil from InstaNatural, and I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, and if you use it on your skin, it is absorbed very quickly!  </li>
            <li>It is a great moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done!</li>
            <li>since I notice it makes amazing things to my skin, I was brave enough to give it a try on my hair, the result is just as good as all the reviews.</li>
            <li>My daughter, for whom the argan oil was purchased, says it&#x27;s almost as good as Josie Moran – only the smell is not as good!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and very affordable!</li>
            <li>the price!&lt;br /&gt;The price is a GREAT value.&lt;br /&gt;The company ships it out FAST!</li>
            <li>I looked online and found a pretty great deal in the product.</li>
            <li>The price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>and I swear I have fewer fine lines on my face because of it!</li>
            <li>Quick delivery!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t leave my face looking greasy and the moisture lasts all day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes my face feel very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Very light and</li>
            <li>My skin has never been softer and it is very smooth.  </li>
            <li>This oil is very light and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>Bought this based on a couple of very thoughtful reviews I read.</li>
            <li>they feel very smooth  </li>
            <li>And, the results  - a smoother, softer skin and a very light sheen in your hair - can be seen and felt seconds after applying it.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face and the rest of my body, and it&#x27;s very smooth and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I like this oil and it has a very light smell.</li>
            <li>Very smooth texture.</li>
            <li>Very light smell</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the brand, you get a lot for a good price!</li>
            <li>Great product, love it so much!</li>
            <li>I also use sum on my lips and it worked pretty good, not as  moisturising  as my lip balm but still really nice for a all in one serum.  </li>
            <li>The good thing is this oil absorbs quickly and the odor dissipates.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and it is light and leaves my hair super shiny, also great moisturizer for skin.</li>
            <li>Honestly I can&#x27;t believe how strong and healthy my nails have become in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Thank you InstaNatural for your great quality products at such a friendly price!!!</li>
            <li>It shows that the company stands by their products and that satisfying their customers is very important.  </li>
            <li>This oil is very light and has a lovely fragrance.  </li>
            <li>For me, this has the same great results with a much more pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>Fine bottle and nice flavor.</li>
            <li>like it very much!!!</li>
            <li>This  product is great because it is organic, undiluted and USDA Certified Pure Moroccan Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>Argan oil is great, and being 100 percent pure, you can use it on your skin, unlike Moroccanoil products.</li>
            <li>I use it every night to keep my pregnant belly smooth and stretch mark free!!!</li>
            <li>My skin and hair have seen huge improvements!</li>
            <li>Huge bottle for the price!</li>
            <li>My husband noticed the changes on my face, my skin looks softer and healthy.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I&#x27;ll see more firmness with continued use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my skin is smoother than before :)</li>
            <li>they love it</li>
            <li>I love this oil.  </li>
            <li>I know there are many more uses....</li>

            <li>Although I just purchased this product I have to say in two weeks time my skin and hair looks so much better.</li>
            <li>I have used this for a while, but have not seen outstanding results.</li>
            <li>more hair frizz..</li>
            <li>my hair is softer and looks healthy...</li>
            <li>I am hoping this will keep more from showing up.  </li>
            <li>but I think this works better.</li>
            <li>Plus, I really love that this oil comes with a pump bottle</li>

            <li>I think my hair does feel better, though,</li>
            <li>I took the bottle with the pump top with me in my luggage when I went traveling</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even smell it any more - I mix it with my eye cream, I mix it with my face moisturizer when I need a bit more &#x27;oomph&#x27;, and I LOVE it at night as the outer most layer of moisture before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li>I use it for a beard tamer and facial moisturizer, both of which are excellent applications.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found many uses for it.</li>

            <li>When they reached out, asking me to write a review, and I mentioned not being sure how I felt about the product yet</li>

            <li>The turgor and texture are definitely better.</li>

            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Argan oil supposedly has many benifits</li>
            <li>mostly</li>
            <li>but I make sure there is nothing else added to the oil.</li>
            <li>I use their Vitamin C serum and the Rosehip Serum and love those too.  </li>
            <li>immediately I have enjoyed softer, more supple skin on my face, and my hands as well.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks more plumped.</li>
            <li>and I simply love the results I am already witnessing.</li>
            <li>bath oil, body oil, and so many more things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I will be purchasing more of this.</li>

            <li>This stuff is very rich and moisturizing, and I love it for skin.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try InstaNatural&#x27;s brand of Moroccan Argan Oil it because I have found that is one of the most nourishing oils.</li>
            <li>I loved that even though it is an oil, my skin still soaked it up right away.</li>
            <li>As the first argan oil I&#x27;ve ever used despite all the hype, I&#x27;m pleasantly impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smooth with a pleasant mild scent of nature.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was pretty impressed on the size of this bottle, it is quite large for the asking price.</li>

            <li>It gives my hair a beautiful shine and brings out my naturally wavy texture.</li>
            <li>I was quite interested to try this oil, since according to the description, it is good for everything from hair to skin to nails to -- increasing one&#x27;s intelligence?</li>
            <li>So this is actually pretty good.  </li>

            <li>have used \\&quot;olive oil\\&quot; products for years with good results;  I have recently switched to Argan oil products; Argan oil is a much lighter product to use with wonderful result.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, kind of a light olive-y scent, and it sinks luxuriously into my skin.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper and great for hair, split ends and fine lines.</li>

            <li>I am so excited about Instanatural products!</li>
            <li>has faded significantly!</li>
            <li>It’s been hugely helpful – not only does it help soothe the dryness, it does an excellent job of helping heal the cracks at my fingertips.</li>

            <li>and I swear this is the best product for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Love the easy spray bottle.</li>
            <li>(it washes out of her hair much more easily than baby oil).  </li>
            <li>I like this more for my nails than anything and the dropper makes for easy precision targeting of my cuticles when I want to moisturize them.</li>
            <li>And Makes It More Easy To Use.</li>
            <li>Let me make sure to note though, I am a bit hyper-sensitive to smells, and have an easy to trigger gag reflex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Argan oil is wonderful on my skin and cures the dry and ichy skin.</li>
            <li>I liked me, so I was not expecting this super</li>
            <li>My nails are actually strong and healthy with nothing on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked mine before, but it&#x27;s nowhere near as good as this one.</li>
            <li>I received a genuine email from the FOUNDER OF THE COMPANY to make sure everything worked out for me, if they could help in any way, if I received my package, and if I enjoyed the product.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have found Argan oil and especially the organic kind.  </li>
            <li>I Appreciated the fast shipping and am very happy with my purchase.  </li>

            <li>but I am delighted that I have found this organic 100% pure argan oil..</li>

            <li>, I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a good thing, but it certainly does the job of moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good quilty and large bottle for the price.</li>
            <li>This is a really good deal as you get a large size for the price.  </li>

            <li>I love how smooth it makes your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great natural moisturizer that is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>The order arrived promptly &amp; it is a great product for my hair; it&#x27;s making my hair soft &amp; shiny as I used per instruction.</li>

            <li>Smells great and leaves my skin so soft</li>

            <li>Great at night after washing the face...great as a make-up remover that can get that eye makeup off without hurting those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, good comunication, good product, thanks</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>

            <li>The seller&#x27;s price is very reasonable, and customer service couldn&#x27;t be better!  </li>
            <li>The hair looked oily, super shiny and in no way suitable for leaving the house.</li>
            <li>Insta Natural 100% Pure Argan Oil from Morocco is the perfect product for skin and hair.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not here on the planet to make someone else rich, no matter how cute they are.  </li>
            <li>Other than that this oil is really great!</li>
            <li>I got compliments from the first day I used it, on how healthy my hair looked!</li>
            <li>COOL!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Argan oil has so many great uses, it is pretty much an all-purpose oil.</li>
            <li>I was originally intrigued by the affordability of the product, how it&#x27;s organic, and fully potent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my cuticles, hair, face and other body parts with excellent results.</li>
            <li>I will continue buying their other wonderful products ...</li>
            <li>How cool!</li>
            <li>Using it right after I get out of the shower, when skin is still damp, it creates a lovely sheen on the skin and also makes my feel very smooth.  </li>
            <li>It has a funky smell, but it is very mild.</li>
            <li>Spray bottle is sooo easy to apply the oil...love it.</li>
            <li>The smell also goes away very quickly.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t spread easily.</li>
            <li>but I would admit that it actually works great and leaves my skin looking healthy.</li>
            <li>The hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy and it is easy to comb.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly and does not smell.</li>
            <li>this daily to your hair for great shine and healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li>This makes it so easy to use on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I find it to be oily and doesn&#x27;t absorb easily.</li>
            <li>lightweight and easy to apply all over.  </li>
            <li>, I love that it&#x27;s great for the face, dry skin, cuticles, hair ends, and I love mixing it in with my hair conditioners, leave ins, masks</li>
            <li>The smell is very mild.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to over-do which brings on the greasy look.</li>
            <li>But the scent does fade very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Good Product, great value, useful for dry skin, hair and nails</li>
            <li>Its really easy to use</li>
            <li>The oil has a nice smooth texture when spread on the skin and is absorbed very quickly and is non-greasy but silky to the touch.  </li>
            <li>It dries very quickly and does not feel sticky.</li>
            <li>Brown pump bottle - so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice light golden color as I would expect argan oil to.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s great on my dry skin and hair, and the big bottle is perfect if you&#x27;re sharing with someone else!</li>
            <li>It has such great benefits with so many benefical uses.</li>
            <li>I could already feel the softness and it was easy for my fingers to run through my hair.</li>
            <li>Great oil&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil has always been a favorite of mine for a facial moisturizer  - it does wonders for the complexion</li>
            <li>This produt is great for so many things like acne, dry scalp, split ends, frizzy hair, stretch marks, &amp; more.</li>
            <li>in addition, it has no perfume in it and the smell is strong.</li>
            <li>Came nicely packaged, in good shape with both a solid cap And a dispenser cap.</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell that I don&#x27;t like smelling on my face all day.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural&#x27;s Organic Argan Oil does not have a strong smell and that&#x27;s why I like this one</li>
            <li>this particular oil is that it is good on softening</li>
            <li>When you apply the oil to your hair, you can smell the strong nutty scent.</li>
            <li>Nails were strong and longer than ever.</li>
            <li>It can drip, so remove excess from dropper before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance: there are no added ingredients and therefore you smell the argan which does not have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>This brand of face oil was highly recommended and fairly priced, so I thought I would try it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is also a nice size and good value for money, this oil can be pretty pricey but this particular brand is quite reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One recommendation: offer special price for two or more bottles.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with my purchase---Have been using on my face, hair and nails and find it very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It has also lessened the appearance of my scars on my face which is pretty amazing as I have some acne</li>
            <li>This is pretty amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>The oil has a bit of a nutty scent to it, which I really like.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with all of the InstaNatural products I have had the pleasure of trying out and reviewing.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this at full price :).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty nice stuff</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for another argan oil, which contained more synthetic ingredients than true argan oil.</li>
            <li>I did some research and purchased my first bottle and am thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is nice, the oil works exactly like my 43.00 a bottle Morroccan oil.</li>
            <li>I received a prompt reply from a really sweet and efficient sales associate letting me know that another bottle was on its way free of charge!</li>
            <li>had really wanted to love this oil, as I&#x27;ve heard such wonderful things about it.  </li>
            <li>The thing I love most about it is that it&#x27;s 100% pure argan oil!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in many many products you can buy, but this is pure organic Argan Oil!</li>
            <li>This is an exceptional price for such an amazing multi-use beauty tool.  </li>
            <li>This one is hands down the best yet.</li>
            <li>This is very good for dry and itching skin.</li>
            <li>Argan Oil has so many great uses, its great to have pure oil in such a large quantity.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, best organ oil by far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also using this for my baby tortoises, their shells are also healthy, thanks to this! :)</li>
            <li>, I have fine lines.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks so and it seems to soften the fine lines.</li>
            <li>am using on my face for fine lines because I read Mireille Guilliano&#x27;s book &amp;#34</li>
            <li>Less is best when it comes to argan oil.  </li>
            <li>A couple drops does just fine for my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something to change fine lines...</li>
            <li>I ordered it anyway because I wanted an organic leave in conditioning oil for my waist length-baby fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pretty sure this is the real deal, will be purchasing again, IF I RUN OUT! :)</li>
            <li>The oil quality itself is fine though.  </li>
            <li>but the smell does seem to dissipate after a while, and for overnight use, etc., it should be fine.  </li>
            <li>Even the fine wrinkles around my eyes are softer.  </li>
            <li>and although fine for my body, it made my face break out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine all-purpose</li>
            <li>Great service fast shipping thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still learning the many ways that argan oil can be used, but so far I&#x27;m very glad I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>think I&#x27;ll be ideal for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li>The oil is fine.</li>
            <li>But overall, I am extremely satisfied with my product and the amazing customer service received!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, and the pump is super convenient.</li>
            <li>Love that my items get here quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the way this oil absorbs quickly in my skin</li>
            <li>I received it quick!</li>
            <li>I am going through it WAY TOO QUICK!</li>
            <li>I have used this in my face, nails, hair and love how quickly it absorbs.</li>
            <li>I love the way it quickly absorbs into the skin..</li>
            <li>The oil dries fairly quickly and leaves your skin with a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m pregnant again, I plan to use it as a moisturizer and avoid all the chemicals that are in most lotions.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and soon afterward, if not immediately, the area looks and feels softer and more moisturized.</li>
            <li>Super pleased - skin feels so refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Has helped my skin tremendously!.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you for this product and the quick shipping!</li>
            <li>Very clear instructions on bottle and good followup from producer.  </li>
            <li>really works its magic!</li>
            <li>very well I really love it!</li>
            <li>Use it for dry skin Works great :)</li>
            <li>The oil is absorbed quickly into my skin and it is an amazing moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>100% Organic Argan Oil, this is a very light quickly absorbed product.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t bother repeating what so many others have said about this oil, I&#x27;ll just say all of the positive comments others have offered are accurate!  </li>
            <li>Light scent, great for cuticles, dry skin, hair, makeup removing, love it</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, but the water where I&#x27;m at is absoluetly filled with chlorine and chemicals and dries my hair to straw</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this regularly for just about 2 months now and have had great results.</li>

            <li>My skin is smooth and youthful.</li>
            <li>so impressed that I may well buy some more when it eventually runs out rather than buying a non-organic equivalent; given that the product is absorbed into the skin, it makes sense to avoid absorbing pesticides at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>It smells awesome and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>

            <li>This was fantastic oil.  </li>
            <li>It definitely filled in any lines and scars that I had.</li>
            <li>Additives irritate acne so this is perfect - rub a few drops over fingertips and massage into face.</li>
            <li>but i enjoy its multipurpose appeal</li>
            <li>Great product especially for the price.</li>
            <li>received a free copy of this product courtesy of the company, for the purpose of review.</li>
            <li>and it just gives skin a velvety smooth feelking.</li>
            <li>This seller emailed me a nice letter with suggested uses for the product &amp; again later to make sure I was completely satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>totally recommend,  great seller</li>
            <li>This oil is fragrance free and non-comedogenic for the face.</li>
            <li>but great product overall.</li>
            <li>It was packaged extremely securely.</li>
            <li>After shampooing her hair, I put this in and it made it look so shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>Smells earthy and makes my hair and face smooth.</li>
            <li>You can use this on different parts of your body so it is great.  </li>
            <li>The smell ISNT so great but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, smells kinda like olive oil.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so smooth</li>
            <li>to a light feel and light polish.  </li>
            <li>This oil is fabulous.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as smooth as it should of been</li>
            <li>I know what I am credible in reporting issues with skin and hair.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I love argan oil for my hair and I cannot say enough good things about this company.  </li>
            <li>II leaves my ski feeling soft and it gives good shine to my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a satisfied customer, and I anticipate being able to go longer between pedicures thanks to Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>It spreads out better, but can leave you looking like Courtney Love after a 10 day bender if you use too much.</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating and my skin has been feeling more healthy.</li>
            <li>good oil. makes hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I use it daily, and with the reasonable price, I can afford this awesome product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller suggested since I am so sensitive to the smell, using a refined version of the oil might be a good alternative.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Used on wet hair, it acts as a good conditioner and helps hair to style nicely without frizz.</li>
            <li>The benefit is fabulous looking, healthy feet that always look freshly pedicured.</li>
            <li>Again, preservatives age skin, so argan oil is a perfect all-natural solution, and the price is a lot lower than high end anti-aging products that are often less effective.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, the price is right</li>
            <li>This product is great alone, or combined with other creams for a greater effect.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted! !</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>has a pump that is very useful.</li>
            <li>The instanatural also sent a mail on tips on how to use argan oil which I found to be very useful.</li>
            <li>Very nice packaging and quality overall.</li>
            <li>Very courteous and concerned with my overall satisfaction and experience.  </li>
            <li>Very pure product :)  </li>
            <li>However, I have to admit I have from time to time enjoyed comments about my healthy head of salt and pepper hair as I&#x27;ve gotten older making me look &amp;#34;distinguished.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I recently came across a blog posting which praised argan oil as a wonderful skin moisturizer, particularly for your face.</li>
            <li>The light weight oil absorbs easily and relatively quickly...</li>
            <li>This is a huge bottle  and completely worth the investment!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Organic, cruelty free, preservative and fragrance free...and something must be said about its unique aroma.</li>
            <li>The people at InstaNatural are super nice &amp; helpful, received an email from them shortly after my purchase making sure I&#x27;m satisfied with their product.</li>
            <li>Great way to add a heat protectant before flat ironing and using the hairdryer without chemicals!</li>
            <li>this leaves my skin so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>It is also great for dry, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Luckily it cleaned out easily in the wash.</li>
            <li>I love this oil, it&#x27;s light and absorbed into skin quickly.</li>
            <li>Ordering process was easy and received order quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent size bottle in a nice packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Removes super long-lasting lipsticks easily.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and expected, great product!</li>
            <li>My skin would stay sufficiently moisturized throughout the day which is good since winter heating ravages my skin like no other.  </li>
            <li>other reviewers have noted, it does smell badly at first, kind of like mulch which is not an attractive smell.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite product!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product and I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to others as it is effective and affordable.</li>
            <li>They shipped out a new one, which I received intact, and undamaged on that same weekend on Sunday, talk about great customer service!</li>
            <li>It is perfect for my dry hands, and it really soothes my cuticles.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend Instanatural to anyone - their customer service is amazing too!</li>
            <li>I use it daily and the results are amazing!</li>
            <li>And the quantity makes it the perfect size to use for hair, whereas in smaller bottles I never felt there was enough to use on more than my face</li>
            <li>Argan Oil is one of the most gentle, light, fragrance free moisture  giving products I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive InstaNatural Organic Argan Oil for Hair, Face, Skin and Nails.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my hair, too, and originally bought it as a replacement for Moroccanoil Hair Treatment.</li>
            <li>I have been using it as carrier oil with my essential oils and am loving it!  </li>
            <li>Jose Maran may cost more but it is the real deal!</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>I fell in love with it at my first aplication....</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Some oils are good for internal use, some are great for external use like this one.  </li>
            <li>With this value, it isn&#x27;t worth it to try to use anything else!</li>
            <li>I have used this argan oil as a leave in conditioner on my hair, to moisturize my face, as as a full body oil, cuticle conditioner and to smooth knees, elbows and heels.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to write this review because it works so well on my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>I tried argan oil for the first time a couple years ago and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I was SO EXCITED to try out the oil.</li>
            <li>They are giving me the best price at about $23 a bottle for 4oz and there are usually sales on their oils.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product so far.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this oil.  </li>
            <li>Rich in Omega 3 and 9 which helps to prevent hair loss and repairs damaged hair follicles.</li>
            <li>This is the first argan oil I&#x27;ve ever used, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Since I first started using it about a month ago, my cuticles and nails are looking so much better.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fully absorbed!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Concentrate on the areas that are more drying first.</li>
            <li>That is certainly rare these days!</li>
            <li>But yeah if your on the fence whether to go with this brands argan oil compared to the hundreds on argan oils on Amazon, its worth a shot!</li>
            <li>I love to use this wonderful product on different parts of the body such as my face, neck, elbows, hands, nails, knees, feet, scalp, and hair.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this to apply on my stretch mark scars.</li>
            <li>I love Argan oil - this one comes in a bigger bottle than most with a pump top.</li>
            <li>first one in many moons.</li>
            <li>I have been using Insta Natural Argan Oil for two weeks and instantly noticed a change in my nails, a huge change, no splitting, cracking, breaking and the cuticles look great too !  </li>
            <li>I have never used argan oil and was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>After just 3 days, I noticed a significant difference in my skin</li>
            <li>Thanks InstaNatural! :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely enough to make me feel more comfortable in my own skin</li>
            <li>I went nuts and had so much fun!</li>
            <li>Even my kids love this, they apply this before going to bath as hot oil treatment for their hair.</li>

            <li>This is my first time using this brand, and must say that I&#x27;m thoroughly pleased.  </li>
            <li>A bit pricey for the amount, but well worth it!</li>
            <li>It has very strong smell when first applied but the smell goes away once absorbed.</li>
            <li>Makest skin soft and there is no scene to it at all, which is a good thing, because I wouldn&#x27;t want to be smelling my own face all day long. :)</li>
            <li>After emailing Instanaturall about this incident they were very pleasant, personal, supportive and understanding of the situation and shipped a new package to me straight away!</li>
            <li>Clean smell.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great for a dry scalp.</li>
            <li>Will probably purchase more in the future in addition to the one I have been using because the price is amazing......</li>

            <li>I find that half a dropper of oil is all I need to cover face and neck, and it&#x27;s an ideal moisturizer alone or under makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my dry hair</li>
            <li>This is great for any dry, brittle hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is perhaps the best Argan oil I&#x27;ve tried (I&#x27;ve used 3-4 different brands so far).  </li>
            <li>I applies argan oil couple drops to my clean washed hair.</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li>And most importantly, it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li>Made my hair very soft and gave it a nice smell.</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft, smooth and feels better than ever!</li>
            <li>so I was really excited to give it a try and to be true</li>
            <li>Not all oil smells good; this doesn&#x27;t smell horrid, just not lovely (and who doesn&#x27;t like to smell lovely before bed? :).</li>
            <li>light, not unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a couple pumps in my hair after I wash it and as a cuticle oil, but you can apply directly onto the skin or mix with your favorite lotion, too!</li>
            <li>I could go on and on about Insta natural products - LOVE them!  </li>
            <li>Insta Natural is definitely my &amp;#34;Fountain of Youth&amp;#34; I give Insta Natural 5 stars for amazing products and excellent customer service.  </li>
            <li>Thank you InstaNatural for making me so happy about finally having the one and only perfect facial moisturizer I&#x27;ll ever need!</li>
            <li>This argan oil is very light, no fragrance and absorbs fast.  </li>
            <li>but that dissipates right away as does the slickness of the oil, so I guess my skin and hair finds it  easily absorbable.  </li>
            <li>Also a great dry hair conditioner!  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t liked very much even if he is pure and may treat the hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice anything special about it.</li>
            <li>So what makes this product special?</li>
            <li>Nowadays, it seems that every product on the market claims to contain Argan Oil and more often than not probably doesn&#x27;t, so getting a bottle of InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Organic Moroccan Argan Oil was heaven sent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this 100% pure Argan oil.</li>
            <li>I love that its pure and organic with no detrimental ingredients.</li>
            <li>It is a bit potent in scent, but for 100% pure, what do you expect?</li>
            <li>My favorite use of InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Argan Oil was as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>What I love about this is how large the bottle is</li>
            <li>nothing too special.</li>
            <li>it right up!</li>
            <li>She was absolutely right!  </li>
            <li>The remainder goes right on my skin and rubbed into my nails!</li>
            <li>I used it as hand lotion at night and noticed my fingernails got stronger right away!  </li>
            <li>This product is great for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is colourless, relatively runny and has a pleasant mild nutty odour.</li>
            <li>I am SUPER excited to get my hands on it</li>
            <li>I appreciate that because most hair and body products are super strong and I can be real sensitive to some smells.</li>
            <li>My shipment arrived early and the product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It drips pretty much on its own</li>
            <li>I use oils all the time in my lip and skin care products and knew of their amazing ability to help heal and keep things soft.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still trying to get a refund on the full bottle</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the smell is not so good as the rest InstaNatural products.</li>
            <li>(I also understand from reviews as good as a $40 plus bottle in for about the same price</li>
            <li>A good product &amp; no customer service isn&#x27;t the way to go for me when I can get 2X the size for the same product &amp; customer service!  </li>
            <li>but they really didn&#x27;t seem to care which made me not feel confident in their company.  </li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and love that it gets rid of acne.</li>
            <li>See the full review on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>Its light and easily absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making such a good quality and affordable product.</li>
            <li>only four  times use all his eczema gone his skin smoother thank you for making really good product</li>
            <li>This oil is such good quality that I am using it on my face as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It has the true smell, feel and color of the true argan oil, since a lot of the oils in the market are diluted..</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and sleek and my cuticles have never looked this nice.</li>
            <li>The true test would be after my shower through.</li>
            <li>Love it so much.</li>
            <li>I most highly recommend that you give them a try!</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about Argan Oil from this company.  </li>
            <li>so make sure not to get to exited and apply too much</li>
            <li>Thanks insta naturals everyone and anyone would be satisfied to have this stuff.</li>
            <li>And I noticed -- much to my surprise -- that my heels looked better.</li>
            <li>also appreciated that the seller made a sincere effort to follow up on my order.  </li>
            <li>also appreciated that the seller made a sincere effort to follow up on my order.  </li>
            <li>It is good especially for Hair, Face.</li>
            <li>I was using a different brand of the argan oil and it was working good.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite it&#x27;s many benefits (there really is a lot)</li>
            <li>the full review on: maegal .</li>
            <li>This was such a good buy-</li>
            <li>Preferably store in really cool place, but not in refrigerator.</li>
            <li>I am also much better off financially and have more free time b/c</li>
            <li>Bigger container than I anticipated, so that&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter how good the product is if the outside IS CHEAP-LOOKING.</li>
            <li>It is easily absorbed without leaving my skin greasy and my skin remains  hydrated even after light washing.  </li>
            <li>The oil has the rubberband smell, which tells you it&#x27;s quality argan oil and is a nice, natural smell.  </li>
            <li>and I cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>I am orderning more for them very soon.</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T use a full pump, a lot of product comes out.</li>
            <li>I get full use out of this because i also use it on my nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li>I appreciate a company that is ready to go the extra mile to make sure that their customers are happy and is so ready to stand by their products.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you InstaNatural!</li>
            <li>works really well on my hair and skin, love it.</li>
            <li>I make a lot of my own personal care products, such as shampoo and body butter, and it works great in those too.  </li>
            <li>loved it order my second bottle today , it has a nutty smell but it fades after a minute or two.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product for its price.</li>
            <li>I told them sure why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be using this, it&#x27;s going straight in the bin.</li>
            <li>That way you could see better how much oil is coming out.</li>
            <li>Good sized bottle that will last forever.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not expecting miracles, but it is doing nice things for me so far.  </li>
            <li>As good as the Argan oil I bought at a cooperative in Southern Morocco 4 years ago</li>
            <li>I THOUGHT SHE WAS JUST GOING TO BE STUCK WITH HAVING A HEAD FULL OF NAPPY UNTAMABLE HAIR.  </li>
            <li>I am really falling in love with this product.</li>
            <li>The 4 ounce bottle is very generous, and the quality is top shelf.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad i was asked if i wanted to try this thank so much</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not at all sure that this really argan oil.</li>
            <li>Second time buyer of this product and both have been good quality.</li>
            <li>i put it in my face its really nice m hair so soft</li>
            <li>And the top is very helpful</li>
            <li>The youthful gloss from the oil turns straw like dried out long hair into beautiful shiny attractive hair.  </li>
            <li>So far i am loving the results.</li>
            <li>My doctor recommended laser surgery, but advised my skin would take a full 2 months before I felt &amp;#34;back to normal&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s really cool that you can use this for your skin AND your hair.  </li>
            <li>There are an overwhelming selection of products available for skin care, therefore it can be very difficult to know which products are best if you want healthy, glowing skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only does it appear that argan oil is a bit of a dermatological cure-all, it is one of the most environmentally friendly products around and is a very important export for Morocco.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only does it appear that argan oil is a bit of a dermatological cure-all, it is one of the most environmentally friendly products around and is a very important export for Morocco.</li>
            <li>I had an issue with another oil I ordered from Instanatural (the pump did not work, the oil was fine), and I was sent a brand new bottle free of charge and very quickly.  </li>
            <li>If the price seems a bit high, just know that you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find the more &#x27;exotic&#x27; oils in such a large bottle at a fair price unless purchasing in bulk and not everyone has the time, money, or storage for that.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, well packaged, and oil is light and easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>I am using this oil on my face, neck, and chest as my daily moisturizer because what I have read indicates it&#x27;s good at treating mild acne.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and is absorbed quickly</li>
            <li>Right now using it for face and really enjoy the way it feels.</li>
            <li>When I first used the oil, back in the beginning of March, it had a very light nutty scent which was nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many of Amazon&#x27;s Argan oils looking for a good substitute for the more expensive JM product that I love and this one is it.  </li>
            <li>It looks good product, I just used few times but it seems high quality and has no smell which is good for me..</li>
            <li>The name argan sounds like magic but in reality good extra virgin oil has the same of better property.</li>
            <li>and this was very gentle on my face, absorbed quickly, and worked great as a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My hair is very dry and brittle and this completely smoothes my fly aways!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and does exactly what it promises:  soft, silky, manageable hair and smooth moisturized skin (face and feet).  </li>
            <li>Very good product for my sensitive, rosasea facial skin.</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly,</li>
            <li>I am pregnant with my fifth baby.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth, and I love the aroma.</li>
            <li>Repairs all the damages my hair has to deal with in transforming to Super Saiyan beyond.</li>
            <li>and it seemed to heal really quickly.  </li>
            <li>Came to my home quick and in one piece.</li>
            <li>The oil absorbs quickly without leaving hair looking greasy.</li>
            <li>Love argon oil but most bottles only have a drip pour.</li>
            <li>I was lucky to get this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li>I feel better using a natural oil as opposed to a chemical filled moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my stretch marks while pregnant</li>
            <li>Sometimes I will mix a drop of my favorite essential oil in it to make it smell better.</li>
            <li>Penetrates quickly too.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a super product</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it has helped my mild acne</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay oily at all, and the mild scent goes away</li>
            <li>The product has a mild order that I don&#x27;t care for but the smell soon goes away.</li>
            <li>The bottle is super durable</li>
            <li>I also used on my son&#x27;s forehead- he is 12 and has mild acne and it cleared it up to a point he doesn&#x27;t fight me to put it on.  </li>
            <li>I use Argan Oil on my face every night,  The oil is quickly absorb into the skin and softens the winkles.  </li>
            <li>try to use it on my arms instead and although it absorbs quickly, it doesn&#x27;t nourish my skin either.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly into your hair without weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product sample.and cuticles, treats mild acne since it has Oleic acid, use it to grill vegetables, add some lemon and use as salad dressing.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>When mixed with essential oils, it makes for a wonderful potion that my skin drinks up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, so I don&#x27;t feel like a grease ball and doesn&#x27;t leave grease marks on my clothing (Almond or Olive oil don&#x27;t seem to absorb as quickly).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But I have started using it all over my body after a shower, so this second bottle will get used up more quickly :)</li>
            <li>The product absorbs quickly and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, you can use up the product fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly into hair and skin.</li>
            <li>I contacted InstaNatural immediately and they quickly sent me another bottle with 2 day shipping.</li>
            <li>I even purchased a bottle for most of my favorite people for Christmas last year.</li>
            <li>The scent is an &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; type scent, not overpowering, but smells natural - it makes me feel great that the product I&#x27;m using is all natural.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I believe the quality of the product is exceptional.</li>
            <li>I used the argan oil for my skin (face and hands) and I was impressed with the moisture that it provided (I only had to use 2 drops to cover my face and hands in the same application) .</li>
            <li>I use it for my beard and it helps tremendously in controlling the frizz (beard hair is a lot thicker and frizzier than head hair</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>it has a heavier consistency and does not absorb as quickly.  </li>
            <li>It has a mild scent that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>The oil absorbs quickly so you can use it just minutes before putting on makeup or clothes.  </li>
            <li>so I purchased InstaNatural argan oil and found it to be useful as a facial moisturizer and good for nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li>The package arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy at all, as you might think an oil would</li>
            <li>I do not like the scent of your product even though you said it would disappear quickly.</li>
            <li>i have tried different argan oil from different companies but this one is the best Argan oil i have ever used in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly into skin without any oily residue or feel.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and leaves no lingering scent to compete with perfume or body mist product.  </li>
            <li>But, the smell does go away quickly</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly which does not leave any staining.</li>
            <li>I have been using Argan oil for years and am pleased to have stumbled upon this particular brand.  </li>
            <li>It has helped my skin tremendously and now my four daughters are using it as well.  </li>
            <li>i just received the bottle today,well packaged,i took a shower and applied in my face and neck ,it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have oil in your face,the skin absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>Are you pregnant,  your glowing etc.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and is not too greasy.</li>
            <li>This has become my argan oil of choice , definitely the best around and terrific value .</li>
            <li>I think many individuals with needs similar to mine would also love this product.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s effect on my super oily acne prone</li>
            <li>Use it everywhere, absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>Absorbs quick.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this product has caused no irritation and has been a light, gentle and effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I am one of those highly allergic people and am able to use this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ok with that just because since it is an oil, I didn&#x27;t have high expectations.</li>
            <li>I love this product and highly recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li>Argan oil is highly regarded in the beauty community as one of the most luxurious hair and skin products.</li>
            <li>I use to buy a high end, well known name, Argan Oil from Sephora, that cost 3 times more then this one.</li>
            <li>First, the bottle is huge.</li>
            <li>The best part is that you do not need a lot, and that is coming from a person with a head full of thick hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even great on dark spots and</li>
            <li>The company seems great too, they emailed just to touch base and be sure I received my order and was happy.</li>
            <li>It comes with an eye dropper which is a nice touch since most other brands you have to pour it out and you tend to pour out too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just a few drops of this wonderful oil makes my skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I normally use organic coconut oil as lotion but this absorbs and feels better.  </li>
            <li>This is my second purchase from instanatural and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased and would definitely recommend this product to friends and family!</li>
            <li>Great for fading dark marks and healing or &amp;#34;coating&amp;#34; split ends of hairs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lite and fragrance free oil that does exactly what you expect....moisturize....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good for my nails and hands, as well as my grey color treated hair, concentrating on the ends.</li>
            <li>I contacted Instanatural because I might have received a defective bottle and they were quick to send me a new bottle free of charge!</li>
            <li>Seriously, why pay more!!!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think this argan oil is real or pure.</li>
            <li>My hair is strong, shiny, and vibrant, and that&#x27;s why!</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t smell great, but I&#x27;m happy that it has no artificial scent either.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended though and far superior over synthetic emollients.</li>
            <li>The new one arrived with no leak and was absolutely free!</li>
            <li>New favorite n cheaper too.</li>
            <li>Love the new dispenser pump.</li>
            <li>It goes right in, and it has a fresh, clean scent.  </li>
            <li>When you first open the bottle it smells like a plant but the smell goes away for good.</li>
            <li>It transformed my dry toenails and feels so good on my hair and fingernails too.</li>
            <li>I was going to use this for a face moisturizer before applying my make-up, but I&#x27;d likely have to wait a good 10-15 minutes before applying said make-up to let the oil soak in the skin first.</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I thought to put oil to skin first after cleansing wasn&#x27;t good idea especially in the morning.</li>
            <li>It gets absorbed quickly to your skin and hair because it doesnt make your hands oily after applying it to your hair.</li>
            <li>I really like and use it a lot more often than when I first tried it.  </li>
            <li>I really like that it has a pump which makes it easy to dispense.  </li>
            <li>Not crazy about the fragrance, but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>The oil has really soften up my nails and they are not tearing as easy as they were.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and beautiful and it finally MOVES!</li>
            <li>The scent quickly disappears once it is absorbed into the skin or hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just received my first bottle of Argan Oil about two weeks ago and so far and am loving it.  </li>
            <li>Argan oil is absorbed quickly and does not have any oily leftovers.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs easily into the skin &amp; controls my straight hair flyaways.</li>
            <li>Overall a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>I bought at Tjmax, both pure &amp; organic &amp; they work fine &amp; NO</li>
            <li>Saying that I have very sensitive skin and many allergies, and yet I had no reaction to this at all.</li>
            <li>I use it on my frizzy hair to calm it down, it works great for that.  </li>
            <li>It looks like the packaging changed - I liked the blue bottle a lot and read that it was one of the best for keeping the oil fresh, but as long as it&#x27;s dark, I think it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>There is also no scent, which is a huge positive for me.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural is my favorite brand so far!</li>
            <li>Of all the essential oils and carrier oils I use, this is my favorite!</li>
            <li>I use it as a moisturizer after shower and it feels great!Who needs chemical products if it is a better natural alternative!</li>
            <li>Really makes your hair shiney!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m feeling pretty optimistic about the results to come!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Get a better argan oil for a little more!</li>
            <li>I bought this recently and love it!</li>
            <li>I love the all natural argon oil!</li>
            <li>(read some time where some fragrance(s) actually come from and you&#x27;ll be glad they keep it all organic)!</li>
            <li>Overall pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li>First of all, packaging on this &amp;#34;liquid gold&amp;#34; is perfection!</li>
            <li>From the first day of using this oil, I noticed that my cuticles were healthier and my nails were stronger!</li>
            <li>This is really saving my hair &amp; skin from the Winter!!</li>
            <li>Multiple uses include hair, skin, nails, body and more!</li>
            <li>and I like it so much!!</li>
            <li>My curly hair is also responding nicely - it&#x27;s curling better with less frizz.</li>
            <li>It is probably one of the best I&#x27;ve use thus far and that includes Jojoba, shea butter, black Jamaican, etc.</li>
            <li>Best results for me so far are by using a pea-sized amount on the bottom half of damp hair.</li>
            <li>and I like to put it on my face, decollete and shoulders at night at wake up in the a.m. with super soft, hydrated and smooth feeling skin!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super nutrient-dense while feeling really light and absorbing immediately.</li>
            <li>but it absorbs very quickly, and leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Interesting complex smell, like a mix of chocolate and olives...hard to describe but pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face, neck and hair, my skin is softer and more radiant, my hair which tends to be dry and frizzy looks and feels a lot better.  </li>
            <li>It is absorbed so easily and fast</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves my nails healthy looking and skin soft.  </li>
            <li>From my own experience, it has not caused any breakouts (I&#x27;ve had quite a while of use--by a different brand at first, bought at Whole Foods for quite a bit more money).</li>
            <li>I received it quickly (in two days), and started using it right away.</li>
            <li>It is the first Argon oil I have used, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands, but I can say that InstaNatural has been just as great as the product they offer.</li>
            <li>This argan oil is so pure and smooth.</li>
            <li>Great for clearing up and moisturizing those little break outs once a month too.</li>
            <li>The result was great, hair looks a little shinny, moisturized and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells a little bit nutty which is great.</li>
            <li>My latest go to favorite for my hair (very dry ends).</li>
            <li>I seriously love these kind of products where you just need one little bottle to spoil your body, face and hair.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure that the pure stuff will be even better for him - especially without any added fragrance!</li>
            <li>Fantastic large size for an Organic Argan Oil --- no one else sells it in such a cost effective fashion</li>
            <li>This argan oil is very sticky,  not as smooth  as you can use it liberally as a massage oil.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer without being too heavy.</li>
            <li>My skin soaked the oil really fast and it literally goes on silky smooth on my skin and feels like &amp;#34;liquid gold.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s also not too oily / greasy like others</li>
            <li>I have used this as a facial moisturizer twice a day and my skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li>I thought it was just hype, but I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and a scar on my leg has been greatly faded.</li>
            <li>Not oily, but smooth and translucent which makes my makeup much easier to apply.  </li>
            <li>It really helps make my hair smooth and helps brighten your complexion.</li>
            <li>but it has a really, really light woody smell that is really neutral.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another great comment I must mention is that the odor disappears after a few minutes of application.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work so great on my winter dried legs.  </li>
            <li>Everyone wants smooth skin, even your feet</li>
            <li>Never have I seen such amazing customer service.</li>
            <li>I can literally walk out with no make up and still feel amazing and going back two years</li>
            <li>Amazing face moisturizer especially for winter!</li>
            <li>It really is an amazing thing these days when something actually works ...</li>
            <li>and I really like the light smell the oil does have.</li>
            <li>Huge bottle makes the price VERY affordable.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wondering what fresh Argan oil should smell like, this is it.</li>
            <li>love using this natural, organic, fresh oil on my skin.</li>
            <li>But it smells so fresh and natural that I love slathering it</li>
            <li>I have healthy hair but the natural curls make them not that manageable...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased argan oil from natural food stores as well, but some seem thicker and have more of an odor.  </li>
            <li>My skin and hair are looking soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s economical too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels on application and how it makes my skin so soft and touchable.  </li>
            <li>so far its ok</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not need much!&lt;br /&gt;Has a nutty aroma, golden color.</li>
            <li>Compared to the stuff being sold, for the prices it is totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>but I honestly did NOT like it near as much as my argan.  </li>
            <li>I am used to paying far more.  </li>
            <li>and i have enjoyed it thus far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a product that actually does what it says.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a naturalista in many ways, so of course I pounced on this exciting 100% natural product &amp; couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out for myself.</li>
            <li>hair is natural and my wavy locks have enjoyed the nourishment of this product for a month now.</li>
            <li>I have tried many and this is the beast so far.</li>
            <li>Use the Argan oil daily and have no complaints; my skin is soft and happy.  </li>
            <li>I do feel like I have to wash my hair more frequently</li>
            <li>This Argan Oil not only makes my hair smooth which I love, it also makes my hair shiny.</li>
            <li>It neither gets absorbed in skin nor goes away after washing.</li>
            <li>I find my hair to be more silky and soft.</li>
            <li>It took me by surprise, but it did wear off as soon as it was absorbed.</li>
            <li>WORTH IT</li>
            <li>Blame it on those long-ago teenage days when my hair had plenty of oil on its own.</li>
            <li>(well, really Morocco), being an avid cook, I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>The next day, her hands were exceedingly soft, though, so you win some you lose some?&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoy smoothing just a few drops on daily after showering to nourish our skin and this is an excellent moisturizer to use when styling my hair with heated appliances.</li>
            <li>It was a fresh scar from a skin biopsy</li>
            <li>This oil is completely diluted with something cheaper for sure.</li>
            <li>Its gives me soft skin.. Would love to recommend to evryone</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>We both use it directly after getting out of the shower and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>when I have used some oils that pour directly from the bottle, I had a tendency to over pour and ended up with more oil on my hands than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>The smell does dissipate as the oil is absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>The results are instant and more importantly</li>
            <li>I combine this Argan oil with rosehip oil along with a few drops of lavender essential oil to create my own night time moisturizer, which works great on my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic Argan OIl,  I actually looked at so many and researched before I bought this one.  </li>
            <li>did receive a complimentary bottle for the purpose of a review, however, I was under no obligation to post an Amazon review of it.</li>
            <li>In all seriousness, this is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It gives my nails a natural healthy shine and it&#x27;s improving the health of those ragged cuticles I mentioned.</li>
            <li>This is odorless, absorbs into my skin immediately leaving it with a natural glow, and it makes my hands look so much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few organic Argan oils, and so far I&#x27;m really impressed with this one.  </li>
            <li>I have had some success with a Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s acne product, too.</li>
            <li>and it seems like I want to get it done more frequently now.</li>
            <li>It is well absorbed not living any trace of greasy sensation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has so many benefits in it&#x27;s natural form for the body to even using it in foods.</li>
            <li>I love how soft and radiant my skin looks using this product for just two weeks.  </li>
            <li>However, I am pleased with this product so far</li>
            <li>I add a few drops of my own natural oil based perfume to make it have a more appealing smell.  </li>
            <li>It fixed my cracked heal like a magic.</li>
            <li>So, I really think that diluting this wonderful oil and put it into a smaller bottle and keep the price the same.  </li>
            <li>Works as expected, pricing is also good.</li>
            <li>Nice big bottle.</li>
            <li>If you use Argan oil on a regular basis the bottle size is nice</li>
            <li>If you want a hair and body oil that is trully natural, health and on top of that smalls</li>
            <li>So far I love this</li>
            <li>After doing some research on Argan oil, I’ve come across many sources stating the miraculous benefits of this liquid, with some going as far as to call this product “liquid gold”.</li>
            <li>Again, I have extremely sensitive skin and most products don&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have the golden color and nutty scent&lt;br /&gt;Rancid.</li>
            <li>/&gt;InstaNatural stands behind all of their products and provides some of the best customer service out there.</li>
            <li>I use the oil on my body and love the soft texture it gives.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not enough on it own to fix my hair problem.</li>
            <li>This combination completely reduces/eliminates frizz and leaves my hair soooooo smooth, brings out the curls, isn&#x27;t greasy or oily feeling and lasts all day!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bummer because it is a nice big bottle</li>
            <li>: I received this complimentary product for review.</li>
            <li>The oil is so useful for skin, hair, nails.  </li>
            <li>I am not an oil expert, but for what it&#x27;s worth I do believe this is 100% argan oil.</li>
            <li>At night, I&#x27;ve been mixing it in with my hand cream too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample.</li>
            <li>BEST QUALITY, SO useful for various parts, such as hair, face, foot etc, ans also reasonable price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the pump and would prefer a dropper bottle.</li>
            <li>It is true that its not as &#x27;greasy&#x27; as you would expect and that it soaks in pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Just received this a week back and loving it.</li>
            <li>For my face it is quickly absorbed and leaves my skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I love its lush texture.</li>
            <li>It is soft and silky and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and break out when using most face products, or from hormonal changes.  </li>
            <li>So far I am pleased with it in each use.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price</li>
            <li>Again, so worth</li>
            <li>this product is powerful...</li>
            <li>So far my favorite have been Watts, Slice of Nature and AAA.</li>
            <li>I ordered this, as well as their Organic Rose Hip oil, and both are terrific.</li>
            <li>my skin looks more radiant with a soft and supple appearance.</li>
            <li>Face become more radiant, skin is hydrated and protected and no longer sensitive.</li>
            <li>Have only been using it for about 2 weeks now, but it works great so far.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>I looked up potential products and saw that argan oil is a great natural product to use.</li>
            <li>But the bottle was sitting in the shower and, reading the label, it seemed worth trying on my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is very quickly absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>my hair much more manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say that just the Argan oil is enough.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t appear to be too oily, in fact, once on, it is so well absorbed</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely worth</li>
            <li>- this is a high quality argan oil, goes on easily and is quickly absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li>this oil is great and lived up to previous reviews!</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of using this, I’m not sure if I’ve experienced every single benefit it was supposed to provide, but I’ve seen some of my scars fade–and that’s already more than what most skin care products have done for me.</li>
            <li>My buying experience was very positive from InstaNatural.  </li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly and was shiny at first, but that also dissipated.</li>
            <li>I just love this old-school no mess way to protect and dispense restorative oils.</li>
            <li>After blow drying I used a couple more drops and it smoothed down my hair, left it with a nice little sheen and very pleasant smelling!  </li>
            <li>I have an oily skin, but the argan oil get&#x27;s absorbed very quickly, and makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>started using it on my hair and love how it moisturizers and make my hair more manageable and shiny without looking oily or greasy like some other oils do.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just due to too many pumps.</li>
            <li>Great tproduct and so much cheaper than the other SHOPPING CHANNEL brand.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased to have been told about Argan oil for my dry hair by a coworker.  </li>
            <li>It feels oily when you first put it on but quickly soaks into skin</li>
            <li>but the smell disappears pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>receiving the new bottle I noticed the plastic seal on the new bottle was much better secured and was very fresh and earthly smelling, the way it&#x27;s suppose smell.</li>
            <li>Seems pure and clean.</li>
            <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also very nice on hands and hair, whether you just use a few drops in damp hair or mix it into your conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d glad Amazon can source the same high quality for a better value.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful for dry skin, dry hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great deal for a huge bottle that will last me a long time.</li>
            <li>As good as other reviews said it was.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s alright not as good as other Argan oils that I have used.</li>
            <li>I have heard about this oil many times in the past and have really wanted to try this product to see if it was as good as it sounded.</li>
            <li>This awesome bottle of Argan Oil is 100% pure Argan Oil and can be used in your hair, body, nails and on your face, especially if you have dry skin or hair</li>
            <li>Amazon made it right</li>
            <li>Since Argon oil soaks right into my skin, I use this under my makeup providing protection and softness.</li>
            <li>I felt and noticed the difference right away.  </li>
            <li>I must add that they sent me an email right away saying that they would refund it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s right up there with the Argan Oil Hair Mask.</li>
            <li>Ordered it after I tried my daughter&#x27;s and right away</li>
            <li>I am still trying to figure out the right amount for my hair, so it won&#x27;t look greasy.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the product from amazon, instanatural shipped it right away and the package was delivered on time.</li>
            <li>I rub 5 drops in my hand and then spread it on right after washing.</li>
            <li>The price was right for this organic argan oil.  </li>
            <li>On my skin as a night time moisturizer and a leave in conditioner take the frizz right out</li>
            <li>and I would not put it on right before I go out</li>
            <li>No breakouts and 1 pump dispenses just the right amount of quantity needed.</li>
            <li>When I saw that InstaNatural had an Argan Oil, I jumped right on it.  </li>
            <li>I use it right out of the bottle on my face and neck, but also as an added ingredient in homemade body butters.</li>
            <li>I apply it right after a bath or shower.  </li>
            <li>This oil soaks right into your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel at all.  </li>
            <li>The price is right and it ships right away.</li>
            <li>I have started putting it in my shampoo bottles, applying it on my skin right out of the shower</li>
            <li>The bottle has a pump dispenser that expels just the right amount.</li>
            <li>So the day I got it I wanted to put it on right away.</li>
            <li>I literally had an area between my thumb and fingers on my right hand that had no responded to even dermatology intervention..</li>
            <li>I use it mainly as a face moisturizer and it works fabulously.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to stop using all of these very expensive products and just use this awesome oil.  </li>
            <li>I love it, it&#x27;s MUCH lighter than the olive and carrot oils that I normally used on my hair.  </li>
            <li>One of the first things you learn with modeling is that most cosmetic products are hyped far beyond their stated results.</li>
            <li>So far my skin feels hydrated and great all day long</li>
            <li>Being that it&#x27;s 100% pure argan oil, I was please to see that it&#x27;s true and nothing has been added to this product.</li>
            <li>Being a concentrated, full strength oil, the silky feeling it gives both hair and body leaves a rich sheen that is light yet lasting.</li>
            <li>I have been putting it on my nails after I peeled off my latest gel mani (I know, major no-no) and basically destroyed my nail beds.</li>
            <li>and best of all it last an entire week and completely eliminates my dirty/oily look!</li>
            <li>I love that it is organic and has no other additives in it.</li>
            <li>I love the 100% pure Organic Argan Oil by Insta Natural!</li>
            <li>And my dry, horrid cuticles and nails that got some by chance, looked and felt so much better!  </li>
            <li>This company has fantastic products AND great customer service, a combination that is hard to find these days!</li>
            <li>Let me just tell you that I have high expectations with this product since I already tried two other products from InstaNatural and they work great.</li>
            <li>but this one is more better than previous.</li>
            <li>1/2 a drop for under my eyes), although it obviously goes more quickly when also used on arms &amp; legs.</li>
            <li>I used this after my shower last night, my hair is so soft and seems to have more volume and looks healthy.</li>
            <li>However, I try now to place the smell in an olive category instead of a farm animal category and that helps my nose bare it a bit more.</li>
            <li>As a general moisturizer, I think it is a better option</li>
            <li>wife has been using it as a substitute for her usual post-shower body moisturiser and is perfectly happy with the results</li>
            <li>It comes in large bottle, has no smell, and absorbs quickly into my hair and skin.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Argon oil because I&#x27;m sensitive to most hair products,  I found that it is great on my hair, made it less flyaway, very soft and manageable</li>
            <li>Pure Argan oil is one amazing oil that is essential in my&lt;br /&gt;hair care regime.</li>
            <li>This 100% Pure Certified Organic Argan Oil is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I was provided a sample to review of insta natural 100% pure Argan oil and was extremely pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>The only downside of the oil being completely pure with no additives is that it doesn&#x27;t smell nice.  </li>
            <li>Initially it has a very strong odor when first opened.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is a minor one: I am now used to being impressed by how good the vendor&#x27;s products smell, and this is the exception in that regard alone.</li>
            <li>This oil is really awesome if you have eczema or any other dry skin issues.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the amount of money I have spent with the other brand when this product is just as good, I kind of feel like I&#x27;ve been being ripped off.</li>
            <li>The bottle is MASSIVE (most of the other oils I have come in 1oz bottles) and it seems to be of good quality.</li>
            <li>and I hope that InstaNatural Argan Oil will still be available when I need a new bottle.  </li>
            <li>Purely Organic!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s certainly helpful for the Winter months!</li>
            <li>but when you first put it on it smacks you right in the face.</li>
            <li>No junk, just pure oil!</li>
            <li>The 4-oz bottle is really large!  </li>
            <li>Mom gives InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Argan Oil 5 Stars!</li>
            <li>I works amazingly well on my dry elbows and heels.  </li>
            <li>Argan is a very \\&quot;dry\\&quot; oil which soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>Thus far I&#x27;ve only used this product on my face and it feels really good.</li>
            <li>It works really well and arrived quickly .</li>
            <li>Has a very toasted nutty scent that goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>I am going to see if I can find some good recipes for facial washes that include this natural, healthful oil.</li>
            <li>Never had my hair so soft and now it is so easy to brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought a much cheaper of this oil in my local store, it was amazing.</li>
            <li>It is great for a many things and since I am a person with semi oily skin I was skeptical.</li>
            <li>This one is clear with a strong sulfur smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I get nice moist and shiny curls after my hair is all dry.</li>
            <li>Received this &amp; just as good but less pricey.</li>
            <li>but it absorbs easily into the skin and does not immediately wash off your hands leaving them soft but not oily.</li>
            <li>It doesn’t really have a scent to it, but it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I have used a few different argan oil products for my hair this one is the best by far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I Love this oil and use it more than once everyday ...</li>
            <li>I also put some warm oil in my hair about 2 hours before washing it (my hair tends to be dry these days)</li>
            <li>This oil is light and relatively fragrance free, allowing me to also use  the oil on my hair and my body.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>many people will know, rosehips are small fruits produced by a certain type of rose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic addition to my DIY Natural medicine cabinet!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 70 and older hair and skin need this special treatment.  </li>
            <li>However, it is a nice light oil, moisturizers ok, just not for my very rough dry patches.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you for making such an amazing pure product as such a reasonable price!!!!</li>
            <li>and it got here very fast.</li>
            <li>The post-purchase customer service emails from the seller is very appreciated, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Like it very much.</li>
            <li>I would definitely not repurchase as it looks very cheap and the expiration date is no where to be found.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Argan Oil for a couple of weeks and like it very much for skin, hair &amp; nails.</li>
            <li>very reasonable price</li>
            <li>I would very highly recommend!</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to try this kind by InstaNatural, and WOW, I&#x27;m never using anything else.</li>
            <li>The oil is fresh with a very faint sweet natural aroma, a light golden color and the perfect consistency.</li>
            <li>You need so little to feel so good....</li>
            <li>Whereas before my skin had large areas of uneven coloring and bumpy textures, the most I have now aresome spots that resemble freckles more than anything.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Argan oil has a mild olive kind of a smell which is its pure form of scent so its not really bad but its not very nice fragrant either.</li>
            <li>The over the counter versions have worked better than this product, I use it mainly for my hair and as I recently cut it I wanted something more natural to nourish it.  </li>
            <li>My hair always ends up super greasy and the oil acts as some kind of holding product (like spray) leaving my hair just like a mess.</li>
            <li>I WILL be ordering more from THIS company when my bottle nears the bottom - but as much as I use, I&#x27;ve still got a good 3 or 4 months AT LEAST - to go - maybe longer since high summer will be here soon.    </li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more of this brand.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, AJ!</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I would most definitely order InstaNatural again.</li>
            <li>I received more than I follow up email from InstaNaturals which customer service is a big selling point with me.  </li>
            <li>This has pretty much healed them!  </li>
            <li>I love this Argan Oil &amp; can&#x27;t rave enough about it &amp; their customer service.  </li>
            <li>The sellers are also very helpful, providing a list of ways to take advantage of all argan oil has to offer!</li>
            <li>I love argan oil and use it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>This oil is organic and that is definitely something I love in a product.</li>
            <li>Does exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>At first its oily when applied, but it absorbs fast and within an hour dries completely and then skin feels amazingly soft and nice.</li>
            <li>My hair is now soft and smooth without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with argan oil.  </li>
            <li>I use it under my regular moisturizer and love the way it makes my skin glow.</li>
            <li>I still use it to this day, and I really like how it keeps my skin moisturized!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually my second bottle, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First time using it</li>
            <li>Its makes both my body and my face so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Must use it consistently.</li>
            <li>First time I have used this Argan oil</li>
            <li>Love this oil; use it in multiple ways: on skin and hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was damaged from using the hot iron.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more when this supply begins to wane.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using Aragon oil</li>
            <li>When I first received the oil, the seal was damaged causing some leakage; I contacted the company through email.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking about buying it, then definitely buy it, you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>It smelled like much better than any essential oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used for months now after every shower with vitamin c serum first</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it on my face because my face is already pretty oily and prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>I rubbed some onto the back of my hands to see how it would feel/soak in, and it was lovely.  </li>
            <li>I want to get my wish list ready!    </li>
            <li>i think this one is the real thing!</li>
            <li>This one with the dropper is so much handier!</li>
            <li>Thanks a million!</li>
            <li>I love the dropper--it&#x27;s essential for portioning out the oil.  </li>
            <li>(I tried another brand of argan oil without any dosing mechanism and I always used way too much and looked like I had a Jheri Curl!).  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using Argan oil.</li>
            <li>that will only reflect even more on their products.  </li>
            <li>However, this product IS exactly what it says: 100% argan oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes put extra on and leave it on for days then wash it out; feels fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love this product and look forward to trying it in different applications soon.</li>
            <li>It is competitively priced and it came exactly as stated on the web site.  </li>
            <li>First off, I absolutely love the cobalt blue bottle, it caught my eye and drew me in..</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using this product from head to toe, and have added it to my daily beauty regimen.s</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using this product from head to toe, and have added it to my daily beauty regimen.</li>
            <li>a lot of the reviewers said, real argan oil is golden in color with a nutty scent.</li>
            <li>My hair looks healthy even though I cut my hair only twice a year.  </li>
            <li>We have tried about 6 different brands of organic Argan oil, and this is our favorite.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>This is the first Argan Oil that I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>The bottle was larger than I thought so more product for the money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When you order this product you receive an e-mail of some ways you can use the product, I found that very helpful!</li>
            <li>the minute I first opened the bottle.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more.  </li>
            <li>Have you ever tried a product and instantly fell in love with it?</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;my hair is so much softer!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my hair didn&#x27;t look like a broom anymore.</li>
            <li>product is knowing that even if you fall into the bracket of people this may not work out for, the manufacturer is willing to make things right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of the many uses argan oil has, I was only really interested in one...</li>
            <li>I love this multi purpose oil,I first tried it in my hair left in on for about 20 min</li>
            <li>I have to use three times more jojoba oil to get the same effect in my curly hair.</li>
            <li>The founder was genuinely interested in my opinion of the oil and how I used it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>The next morning in my shower I wash it out, and it leaves my hair looking shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I worried at first that my pillowcase would get oily, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Made my hair feel smooth and natural.</li>
            <li>but I find this argan oil is more affordable and gives the exact same results.</li>
            <li>Still, this is an inconvenience I am willing to deal with given the price.</li>
            <li>I love using the product on my skin, especially after spending time in the sun.</li>
            <li>i am adding my favorite essential oils for my skincare.</li>
            <li>and the dropper delivers exact amounts every time.</li>
            <li>These people really understand the concept of customer service!</li>
            <li>I had bought another brand the first time</li>
            <li>first tried Argan oil on my nails and cuticles because I have always had brittle nails.</li>
            <li>Well, let me tell you, from the first time I put it on my hands, it was a 1000% difference.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more when I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for a product that could better their hair, especially curly gals like me!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more and I would suggest that you check out their web site and find out what else they have and just see how this smaller company will soon be among the favourite ones on Amazon!!!  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re really getting a 3-in-1 product when you think about it - for skin, nails, and hair!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li>oils I&#x27;ve tried are way smaller than this. :)</li>
            <li>and I think it works moderately better than the Bain De Terre hair serum I have been using for several years.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure if they were related, though.</li>
            <li>Performs exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The curls last longer and are bouncier and just overall looks more healthy.  </li>
            <li>Hair and scalp health improved noticeably the first week.</li>
            <li>For those of you unfamiliar with what that entails, let me tell you: monthly Dermatologist visits, monthly blood work, proof of 2 forms of birth control (despite being over forty, married, and husband having vasectomy), and THOUSANDS of dollars.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly as I hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>but when i tried this for the first time i was in shock.</li>
            <li>The only reason I brought this was because it is advertised with a pump top</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Really wish I&#x27;d discovered this kind of oil sooner, but better late than never.</li>
            <li>but the price and reviews helped us make the decision to order so we will most likely be ordering again.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>I love that this argan oil has a dispenser for easier use than the traditional medicinal bottle.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>, so it looks and smells exactly as it should.</li>
            <li>It has so many different uses!</li>
            <li>everytime I shower to help keep my hair soft and smooth</li>
            <li>You would also have more Argan for others who have to wait for the next batch.  </li>
            <li>with any oil product, it feels oily when it is first applied.</li>
            <li>There are no &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; ingredients in the oil---it contains Vitamin E, but is absorbed readily by the skin and not sticky.</li>
            <li>The price is right and the large bottle is a plus.  </li>
            <li>But the Argan oil has really helped alot!</li>
            <li>I used this as a hot oil treatment for my hair,  just place some oil in a container and put in hot tap water to heat and applied to my hair and after 20 minutes I washed it out.</li>
            <li>I didn’t think I would see any improvement, but I was willing to give the INSTANATURAL ORGANIC ARGAN OIL FOR HAIR, FACE, SKIN, &amp; NAILS</li>
            <li>They were conscientious enough to ask if I was pleased with their product and did it in a polite and non intrusive manner.</li>
            <li>I love the oil and have added it to my daily regime.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve written a product review.  </li>
            <li>I really like this stuff and will buy again!</li>
            <li>I love Argan oil and have tried different brands.  </li>
            <li>I am always looking for healthier alternatives to the items I use to make my skin better, younger, softer.  </li>
            <li>I have tried multiple brands of Argan Oil as a face moisturizer and my face breaks out more with this brand than others.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely helping!</li>
            <li>It works pretty well, although you have to put it on before you shower.</li>
            <li>There’s no offensive odors or anything–it just smells like oil, and it gets absorbed fast.</li>
            <li>It goes on greasy at first, (How can you not expect that..</li>
            <li>so I do love the larger size for the money savings.</li>
            <li>Have been married 35 years.  </li>
            <li>Gives a healthy controlled sheen and I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li>Actually I first heard about Argan oil from my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>Definitely try this out, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>it is so much easier to use than a dropper!  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>She has raved about it so much that I purchased one for my self today!</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I got an email from InstaNatural which is first from any maker for me.</li>
            <li>The Argon oil was exactly what my daughter in law wanted for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>It definitely compares to the more pricey brands that you find in the stores.  </li>
            <li>I Was Quite Interested To Try This Oil,</li>
            <li>It gave my hair this soft lustrous appearance and smooth feeling that I was not expecting.</li>
            <li>… it&#x27;s the real deal you can&#x27;t beat!</li>
            <li>FAST!</li>
            <li>Why spend 2-3 times more on Josie Maran when you could get the same (better in my opinion) quality for a third of the price?!</li>
            <li>I have mixed some with my mousse and that was much better.</li>
            <li>and she also seems satisfied with it as a pre-wash hair conditioner, where just a couple of drops massaged into her hair and left for 15 mins.</li>
            <li>I will be back for more from this seller</li>
            <li>First time purchasing this brand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used josie maran for years but not only do I like InstaNatural better</li>
            <li>but it does exactly the same thing leaves my skin soft and it minimizes the lines better than any cream I used before, and I find that the Argon oil works great for the dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li>It is the first time I am using the argan oil</li>
            <li>I LOVE argan oil and have been using the JM version daily for 2 years...</li>
            <li>Glad I made the switch and will definitely be buying this brand again.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face: 3 drops beneath my regular moisturizer - and on my body: about 3/4 dropper for each leg and 1/2 dropper for each arm beneath my body lotion.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this product your hair will thank you for it!!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using argan oil</li>
            <li>I added perfume to it to eradicate the funny smell.</li>
            <li>Overall, it seemed okay</li>
            <li>With the hot weather coming I am not going to have ashy legs this summer.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First Time I&#x27;ve used a product like this.  </li>
            <li>If you use this in your hair it will make it very shiny!</li>
            <li>My face has never felt so soft and smooth and my co-workers are even asking me what I&#x27;ve done, because my skin seems to be glowing.</li>
            <li>Not sure how they have such wonderful reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased argan oil.  </li>
            <li>The price is remarkable at around $20.00 for 4 oz - a much better value than the expensive face creams out there.  </li>
            <li>scents.&lt;br /&gt;The product does contain traces of tree nuts, so be aware in case of allergies or hypersensitivity.</li>
            <li>I love not having to use multiple products on my face.  </li>
            <li>I have used many different brands of Argan oil on my hair over the years.</li>
            <li>Another reviewer said this oil is \\&quot;clear\\&quot;, when real argan oil has a yellowish or golden cast to it.</li>
            <li>I have eczema and it has really helped!</li>
            <li>i just use one pump and run it through my hair, especially the drier dyed sections and it makes my hair much more manageable.  </li>
            <li>Will most likely purchase again!  </li>
            <li>Works like coconut oil but not as hot (as in hair application).</li>
            <li>The quality is evident.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>After using it our skin is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Really works to soften skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing in the future when I need more.</li>
            <li>Works really well!  </li>
            <li>The first time I applied it</li>
            <li>When added to my regular hair conditioner, it adds additional moisture and shine; love it....</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product !!</li>
            <li>well...good quality product..most likely to repeat purchase :-)</li>
            <li>The first time I did it</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I always soak my face cloth in hot water &amp; place over my argon application.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It does moisturize my face, but leaves it looking OILY, so I put it on at night after a face wash, and in the morning first thing out of the shower (quite a bit before putting on make-up).</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>then I apply a generous amount from the ends to the middle top</li>
            <li>Will more than likely purchase again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rather nutty smell which is not necessarily offensive, but it is definitely potent.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist wasn&#x27;t even aware of argan oil.  </li>
            <li>It is much better after only a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>As a hair treatment I use it overnight and wash my hair first thing in the morning, it adds shine and my hair looks and feel healthier.</li>
            <li>;))</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>The dispenser is really good at controlling output and reducing waste.</li>
            <li>After using is for a few weeks now I like it, feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday under make up, and I have good result.</li>
            <li>I am always trying to find a product that is super light because we have fine textured hair, and also very moisturizing because our hair tends to get dry and hers is also very curly.</li>
            <li>It takes a little while to absorb but thereafter feels nice for ages and leaves a pleasant, slightly nutty aroma.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so great for my skin, especially now that my skin is getting dry.  </li>
            <li>but This oil is so light and make my dry skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>Well, I was surprised AGAIN because it was absorbed quickly</li>
            <li>I appreciate how fast absorbing it is and how quickly I can get into my clothes or touch surfaces without feeling too oily.  </li>
            <li>Having no previous experience with this oil, I wasn&#x27;t sure if that was normal and discontinued using it.  </li>
            <li>sure if this is just my bottle, or others, but I do have to be super careful with the dropper.</li>
            <li>This oil is great and about a quarter of the price I usually pay!  </li>
            <li>On another note, Instanatural sent me an email with other beauty tips and after a few weeks, they sent me another email to make sure I am happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>I have used Argan oil from other vendors and this is definitely the best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>This is my very first time trying Argan Oil, actually I hadn&#x27;t even heard of it until I was offered a chance to get a bottle for free.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very mild and barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>I have an almost 2 month old daughter, so I am constantly washing my hands to make sure they are clean.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the size and packaging, but even more surprised by the fact that I couldn&#x27;t stand the stench!</li>
            <li>Packaging is good, smell is not strong at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only super good for my dry hair, I also use this stuff for my nail beds as well.</li>
            <li>Real pure argan oil is a clear golden colour, with the texture you&#x27;re expecting from an oil.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a scent but this is very natural and true to what it says it does and doesn&#x27;t have a scent at all</li>
            <li>Great Quality and last a very long time!</li>
            <li>The oil is very good for moisturizing my face, hands, and other dry spots.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i originally got it for my face has a natural moisturizer and to help minimize a rash i have on my cheeks</li>
            <li>I am planning on mixing this with other oils this winter and making my own lotion.</li>
            <li>I fact, today, after shampooing (which is always an iffy time due to frizziness and dryness) I was paid two compliments on how nice my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>It nourishes the skin nicely, however it doesn&#x27;t have any antioxidant effects or other botanic effects to improve clarity of the skin.</li>
            <li>other quick thing that I LOVE about Moroccan Argan Oil...</li>
            <li>Add the pump dispenser compared to a dropper lid and this is hands down much better!  </li>
            <li>Its a great product my skin feels nice after it it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li>After using Insta natural&#x27;s oil for a a few weeks, I&#x27;ve already seen great improvement.  </li>
            <li>Just a tiny amount of the oil is amazing at softening cuticles and making color-treated hair feel soft and &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>for nails my cuticles do not dry so easily now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I just can&#x27;t tell if it works better than using jojoba oil which I can get much cheaper from local trader store.</li>
            <li>Insta Natural is by far my favorite company.  </li>
            <li>Works as well as the more expensive varieties out there, and at a really fair price.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this argon oil was as good as a more expensive brand I bought</li>
            <li>There is no way for me to know for sure, but that smell let me know that the bottle definitely contained the real oil.</li>
            <li>I feel that it is as good as the more expensive Argon from the beauty supplies.</li>
            <li>so I can go back to the old kind.  </li>
            <li>This oil does just as good a job as any of the more expensive options that are on the market.</li>
            <li>- Rub into tired and achy feet, or just to make your feet soft and touchable, the perfect after pedicure</li>
            <li>they actually send emails to ask if your satisfied--yes, very :)</li>
            <li>got a free sample to try and it left my skin feeling fresh, radiant and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Left my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>pumps of this bottle is more than enough to lavish on your face and probably too much for bedtime kisses.  </li>
            <li>I was nervous after reading reviews about the smell it would have and honestly I have to stick my nose right in it to get the little funk that it does have.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural Argan oil is the first 100% pure Argan oil I have used.</li>
            <li>But I still gave it 5 stars as it&#x27;s an organic product that is pure, without additional ingredients, sustainably produced and does exactly what it says for my hair.</li>
            <li>so I was interested to try the pure product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first one I have tried out is the InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She has very sensitive skin and has mild rosacea</li>
            <li>I love that this oil is 100% pure and absorbs quickly, unlike other oils that just leave my hands feeling greasy for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives my hair more volume and makes it shiny and beautiful, it helps my dry hands and my nails (e.g. after using nail polish remover when they are all dry), I like it on my skin after taking a bath, when my skin is all dry</li>
            <li>My feet are super soft!</li>
            <li>I like to use it on my hair and body as it leaves everything super moisturized and soft!</li>
            <li>It is quickly absorbed by skin, which is a positive indicator for its high quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this product, it&#x27;s easily absorbed and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin oily, I used some on my hair and my kids hair, it&#x27;s organic and safe and the bottle is big and looks like it will last for a while you just need a few drops:), I would like to update my review to talk about the results when I use it for a while</li>
            <li>It soaked right in and left my elbows feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>This product is simply amazing, I was a little exceptical about having so many uses, but it actually does.</li>
            <li>She was right, the new bottle has no smell at all!</li>
            <li>I smelled the slight nutty scent that I expect of true, authentic Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>Nice oil for the skin, but it smells pretty odd.</li>
            <li>It gets absorbed very quickly, and keeps my skin moisturized and supple all day long.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy, I don&#x27;t break out and I see a positive difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I positively have noticed a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell too strong - there is a much more expensive one that smells incredible, but I&#x27;d rather pay half the price and use this product!</li>
            <li>I love the rich, nutty smell, which disappears a few moments after you apply the oil.</li>
            <li>so I use it there too &amp; it has pretty much solved that problem.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on my hair for several months, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference, but I&#x27;ll use the whole bottle to make sure.</li>
            <li>It can be used for so much, that I wasn&#x27;t aware of.</li>
            <li>It came pretty fast.</li>
            <li>At first I used too much on my face which caused a rash.  </li>
            <li>At first, I was worried, as it seems much thinner than another brand I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used to much, its trial and error like any product.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a great product that replaces other serums, oils, etc.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use more than 10 drops each time, so this 4 fl oz bottle lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I am also very please with this seller who replaced my first bottle which leaked (I did not ask for a replacement).  </li>
            <li>My face has pretty much cleared up with the use of my doctor prescribed medication combined with the Argan oil.</li>
            <li>This company got it to me within a few days; I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>First, I received my shipment early which was great because I was anxious to try it.  </li>
            <li>trust me when I say that for true natural argan oil</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a superior product to others I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>I have been using Josie Maran for over a year, and this product is just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li>This Argan oil has helped with my excessive oil,  wrinkles, even my finger nails, they have never look so good.  </li>
            <li>Got rid of the tickly frizz but its not oily or greasy and works great on itchy dry skin &amp; dry hair/scalp.</li>
            <li>I use it once every other day right out of the shower and my skin hasn&#x27;t been itchy and my hair looks healthy.</li>
            <li>The oil is high quality and a much better price than similar products I&#x27;ve seen in the store.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it, actually I already purchased two more.</li>
            <li>I did notice that the oil absorbed quickly, with no strange odors or lingering oiliness on my fingers.</li>
            <li>Very pure, high quality oil.</li>
            <li>I have not used this product on my nails as they are very strong due to the fish-oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read lots of things about how the really good Argan Oil isn&#x27;t going to be cheap, yaddah yaddah, so I must admit, I was a little skeptical about Insta Natural&#x27;s great price.</li>
            <li>I get very frizzy hair (due to highlights) and mixed a couple drops in with my styling smoother and worked great.</li>
            <li>I will most likely be ordering more of this plus checking out other products sold by InstaNatural.</li>
            <li>What can I possibly say about this lovely oil other than I love it?  </li>
            <li>I use it as a hair and skin moisturizer,  a heat protectant, to balance my oily skin,  for stretch marks,  dry chapped lips,  and much more.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly for my face and my hands as a moisturizer and it has kept my skin sane during the dry winter season.</li>
            <li>I also use this as a make up remover prior to the cleanser for easy breezy feeling.</li>
            <li>I use this on my skin and hair and makes it super soft.</li>
            <li>, I have smooth and soft skin this winter, not an easy feat in dry Colorado.</li>
            <li>The oil absorbs quickly into the skin leaving my skin feeling moist and soft.</li>
            <li>I am currently pregnant and I have been using it all over my body as a stretch mark prevention so far my skin is hydrate and</li>
            <li>I love to use it on my daughters hair because she has really dry hair</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after coming home from my stylist one day with super soft silky hair.</li>
            <li>I have started using it on my skin and nails and my skin has a glow/shine and is super soft.  </li>
            <li>I love this dry feeling oil.</li>
            <li>The number of sores have lessened, and my scalp itself is not as dry, not so itchy and is really more moisturized than it has been for quite sometime.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>The pump top, however, IS TOO SMALL TO FIT THE BOTTLE.</li>
            <li>My toenails and heals have always been a problem because I have dry skin, but even more so since we moved to Arizona.  </li>
            <li>It has tremendously improved my 7 year old&#x27;s skin problem on his face.</li>
            <li>The oil penetrates quickly and it leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a dry oil.  </li>
            <li>I mostly use it for my hair and dry spots on my face.</li>
            <li>My hair looks so shiny and healthy after I blow dry.</li>
            <li>Im super sensitive to the smell</li>
            <li>(The option is no longer available in my past order list, presumably since it&#x27;s been more than 30 days.)  </li>
            <li>I was driving in snow two weeks before Thanksgiving- my skin has been getting extremely dry and ,y hands are doing that lovely cracking thing.  </li>
            <li>I mostly use it on my hair (when it&#x27;s damp before I dry it ) &amp; face (after I wash it before bed).</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product; you get a lot for the price and the dispenser is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love this when i got it yesterday my hands weren&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li>the results after such a short period of time are very satisfying.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is a good size and lasts a long time when used only under eyes and on neck (i.e. requires approx.</li>
            <li>It has a nice slight nutty scent as all pure Argan oil.</li>
            <li>I find it to be naturally healing and fine even for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This oil leaves my skin very soft and is quickly absorbed so my skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily.  </li>
            <li>but I have never used the pure version</li>
            <li>I would recommend this brand purely for the customer service.</li>
            <li>Just pure Argan oil.</li>
            <li>I will purchase this again when needed, Thank you for this pure product.</li>
            <li>This oil is pure argan oil, nothing added.  </li>
            <li>I started using the Josie Maran 100% Pure Argan Oil</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is Organic and pure.</li>
            <li>Again, I like that it is totally pure from nature and</li>
            <li>the therapist said I should try Argan Oil (100% pure) as a moisturizer and to help my skin look  </li>
            <li>InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil of course.</li>
            <li>When buying Argan Oil, I realized I had to look for 100% pure organic Argan Oil that came in an amber glass bottle (as not to lose it&#x27;s properties by exposure to sunlight).</li>
            <li>You can come to me for all your problems and pay me a large sum of cash, or you can use this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This makes me believe it is not 100% pure argon oil.</li>
            <li>I have tried eating certain foods to help my nails, but nothing would work.</li>
            <li>100% pure.</li>
            <li>but it will certainly benefit his skin from it, regardless.</li>
            <li>This multipurpose moisturizer oil 100% pure and certified organic virgin cold-pressed argan oil can be use for softening hair/repairing/conditioning, glowing skin, and stronger nails.  </li>
            <li>So now going to end up throwing away a large portion.</li>
            <li>but I wanted one that was pure</li>
            <li>so I bought this product that is pure and was organic</li>
            <li>Large size for the price.</li>
            <li>100% Pure &amp; EcoCert</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s 100 % pure and organic.  </li>
            <li>This is 100% pure, organic argan oil; with no synthetic fragrances or fillers.</li>
            <li>Pure oil.</li>
            <li>Being weary of all the added ingredients, I looked around and realized you can buy the pure stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wanted to get the Josie Maran %100 pure argan oil, and Got a sample of it and used It, but two things.</li>
            <li>100% Pure Organic Argan Oil also known as liquid gold is a lightweight pure argania spinosa.</li>
            <li>It is used to moisturize and hydrate skin, face, Photo - Pure Organic Moroccan Argan Oilhair and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pure, absorbs well.  </li>
            <li>The InstaNatural 100% Pure Argan Oil is a multipurpose oil.  </li>
            <li>Mom gives InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Argan Oil 5 Stars!ty four hours and protects against UV rays.</li>
            <li>Would certainly buy this again.</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy this product again.</li>
            <li>The much lower price of this 100% organic product along with the positive reviews drew me in.  </li>
            <li>AND I can see some new baby hair on the sides !!</li>
            <li>It did NOT make it heavy and oily like so many products do!  </li>
            <li>I unscrewed the top to find a dropper.. like an eyedropper, only bigger, and full of the nectar of the gods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The packaging is very attractive and the 4oz bottle is much larger than expected, and should go a long way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product on my face for a few days and I will order more!</li>
            <li>I think this might be my new favorite oil, I will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li>Although argan oil is a relatively new and unfamiliar beauty product in the United States, it has actually been a skin care staple for many generations of Mediterranean women.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This works great for moisturizing the cuticles or for softening dry, rough patches of skin.</li>
            <li>When it is dry, it looks full and full of shine.</li>
            <li>The only compliant I have is it gets absorbed into your hand quickly before you can rub it onto your hair or skin.  </li>
            <li>And it is great just like all the other oils I mainly have been using this oil for my nails because they are so fragile.</li>
            <li>Natural Argan oil has a raw, green and nutty aroma, but what is so great about this type of oil is that the scent disappears minutes after being on your skin as true Argan oil absorbs very quickly and without that greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The oil comes in a nice heavy dark blue bottle, and you get 4 ounces which is more than twice the amount that most companies are selling.</li>
            <li>It works fine enough to finish the bottle</li>
            <li>it really helps my dry hair look nice and soft .&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;First bottle was fine but second bottle went rancid in matters of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to be very high quality</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it has a pleasant nutty smell that quickly fades.</li>
            <li>It really had no discernible smell, certainly nothing objectionable.  </li>
            <li>This is the pure, organic, all-natural, real deal.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and most oils or serums feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>So this product was a nice surprise of how little you need.</li>
            <li>My nails tend to get really dry and rough this time of year especially, and I love how noticeably smooth and soft my cuticles have been while using this amazing product.</li>
            <li>and I loved that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of people have complained about the smell, and it does have an earthy smell, but to me that just means that this is a pure, untreated oil.</li>
            <li>Not only is the value and size an amazing steal but the quality is nothing short than pure, and undiluted luxury.</li>
            <li>High quality argon oil ,just as good if not better than that well known brand ,would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>it feels amazing from my scalp down after I wash it out!</li>
            <li>It is not as think as the other products I have used and great for dry hair and skin.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about Insta Natural&#x27;s Argan oil is that it is very fast absorbing.</li>
            <li>Fragrance free, a few drops work to refresh, add shine, smooth tangles and facilitate combing.</li>
            <li>The dropper is great since you only need a few drops of this.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Argan oil and this one is no different.</li>
            <li>It is fine, with the dry and hot weather here in the desert, it keeps me well oiled</li>
            <li>I found it discounted at a very low price for a huge 32oz jug.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference in the look and feel of my hair, especially after I lightened my hair.</li>
            <li>but if nothing else it is an amazing product just to use as a hair product, especially for the amazingly low price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading the label, which suggests using 1-3 drops on the face, I realize I&#x27;ve been using way too much product.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really have wrinkles</li>
            <li>it really works....</li>
            <li>but I really dislike the smell.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much or hair</li>
            <li>As mentioned, this one looks absolutely identical to Josie Maran for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>But with the Argan oil It makes thing so much easier.</li>
            <li>; was too much.  </li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>i think you will really like it.</li>
            <li>, each day I place a few drops in my hands &amp; run my fingers through my hair prior to styling whether or not I&#x27;ve shampooed that day with the upshot being hair that doesn&#x27;t just &#x27;APPEAR healthy&#x27;, it IS healthy.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t help moisturize my hair as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>I really think this is bogus argan oil .</li>
            <li>, I also put some on my face and it leaves my skin supple, It really restore moisture to whatever it touches.</li>
            <li>just dont put too much toward the roots or it can look oily.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I bought some for my friend too, she loves It so much that she asked me to buy again.</li>
            <li>and it really helps moisturize.  </li>
            <li>so she&#x27;s very picky with anything she puts on her face, otherwise, it will get triggered.</li>
            <li>Then I rub my palms gently on my face and &amp;#34;smoothe in&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous product, have been using on my face and hair for several weeks, will definately be part of my beauty regimen from now on!</li>
            <li>I put it directly on my face after washing and it is absorbed within minutes...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this oil.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin very moisturized.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience using oils instead of lotions, but this product convinced me to make the switch.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really did any of the things it said it would.  </li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle and all I can say is &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Thanks..</li>
            <li>I have been using argan oil on my hands and nails before bedtime and can really notice a difference.  </li>
            <li>I really appreciate that the bottle came with a screw on cap and the pump was packaged separately.  </li>
            <li>nothing really make a difference</li>
            <li>But argan oil really shines when it comes to skincare.</li>
            <li>the smell it straight from the bottle, but the smell goes away after 15 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>Since it is much cheaper than Josie&#x27;s, I will still use it for hair and body, but will stick with Josie&#x27;s for my face.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I had heard so much on QVC about Josie Maran&#x27;s Oil, but I did not want to spend a ton of money.</li>
            <li>This helped with the dryness and also greatly improved the clarity of my skin and decreased acne, even on my chest.</li>
            <li>and my face has been much happier.</li>
            <li>but it really does keep my face moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It looks, feels, and smells like real argan oil.</li>
            <li>thank you so much for the fast shipping, will be putting a review on my blog tomarrow</li>
            <li>fast service  </li>
            <li>This winter has made my hair very brittle and frizzy, despite using 2 conditioners (Redken BodyFull and Aveda&#x27;s leave- in Damage Remedy).  </li>
            <li>I thought the email the company sent with uses for argan oil was a very helpful gesture.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Havn&#x27;t seen much difference</li>
            <li>This stuff really work, where has this been?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to use it on my hair to see if it really does make my hair shinier.  </li>
            <li>The brand at whole foods never stings my eyes.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It is not irritating or anything like that.</li>
            <li>I drop about 4 or 5 drops into my palms, rub my hands together gently and attack my tresses.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>The  dropper tends to drip too fast so be careful.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Really upsetting.</li>
            <li>and this helps keep my skin very hydrated and minimizes the look of aging.  </li>
            <li>Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Suitable</li>
            <li>How do I even begin to describe just how much</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was tighter and felt very supple.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It really ddnt do anything to my skin or hair.</li>
            <li>it really helped with keeping my hair moist..</li>
            <li>Works very well...even helps bruises.</li>
            <li>emailed me with a whole lot of ways I can use it for -hair, skin).</li>
            <li>I bought the oil for my hair, but I actually really like to use it on my face.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and the price</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need to put too much on,</li>
            <li>(&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got very upset and thought I would have to go through bunch of hassle to replace it...</li>
            <li>I wanted to give it some time before reviewing it and my skin has reacted really well to it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have had flaky scalp my whole life and even have used medicated shampoo (which did not work).  </li>
            <li>I am really liking the product</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s organic and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand and product!</li>
            <li>Thanks for this product, I really like it.</li>
            <li>Argan Oil is very healing and moisturizing to the skin.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin really soft..especially needed on my hands</li>
            <li>and it is very moisturizing!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>They sent me not only the pump, also a free bottle of argan oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Argan oil for my skin and have noticed how much my skin is improving.</li>
            <li>Chemical-free and gentle eye make-up remover?</li>
            <li>This is the real thing, harvested from the argan tree in Morocco.</li>
            <li>However, I can assure you that you DO NOT want to apply too much of this product.</li>
            <li>It was very moisturizing, to both the hair and the scalp.</li>
            <li>absolutely and whole heartedly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>This product works really well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this product if you are having problems finding something to soothe eczema!  </li>
            <li>It does absorb readily into the skin.</li>
            <li>I used it on my face as well, and my skin really was noticeably softer.</li>
            <li>So I put some in my hair and my frizz was almost gone even though it was a very humid day</li>
            <li>and I have very curly</li>
            <li>In fact I loves it so much</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and packed well.</li>
            <li>Oils packaged in plastic get yucky fast, this is much nicer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also certified Organic, which is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and recommended.</li>
            <li>away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was ready to start Accutane.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on this b/c I haven&#x27;t really paid attention to this</li>
            <li>It amazes me that an oil can soak in so fast and even be reapplied&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>only treat my skin with virgin oils and this one is fabulous.</li>
            <li>moisturizes really well</li>
            <li>but I was surprised at how the product is just absorbed by my skin and leaves a dewy look.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I shampoo and condition my hair, I still have sores and scabs on my scalp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nothing has really helped, and of course everyone has helpful advice of what to try.</li>
            <li>Really like the pump bottle.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like this one as much as the Pura D&#x27;or that I used to use.  </li>
            <li>Never thought argan oil could make a difference because i have really course hair</li>
            <li>I will absolutely be reordering this again from</li>
            <li>I will buy again - especially since the customer service is so fabulous.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much at all.</li>
            <li>It absorbs so fast - I can put on my makeup without having to wait.</li>
            <li>this oil is considered a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; oil, so it&#x27;s not greasy at all and absorbs really fast.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs very well and doesn&#x27;t leave a very oily residue.  </li>
            <li>My face is not breaking out and feels very silky after using this argan oil.  </li>
            <li>I really like this Argan oil.  </li>
            <li>but I have heard so much about Argan Oil</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this well absorbing and non greasy oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can use a lot of that and not have too much.  </li>
            <li>Very affordable</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>but I really like it</li>
            <li>Really defines my curls and keeps hair from being so frizzy.</li>
            <li>I really like how this product makes my hair and skin look and feel.  </li>
            <li>It works very well for me</li>
            <li>But even more awe-inspiring is the fact that I rub it on my eyes (closed) to get it all over the skin and lashes</li>
            <li>I really like using this for my hair as well as for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>I also use it for my cuticles and my hair, the argan oil also is very versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was introduced to it thanks to a blog review I did for them.</li>
            <li>I use this product for couple weeks.it doesn&#x27;t feel very oily.</li>
            <li>I contacted InstaNatural immediately and they promptly proceeded to send me a second bottle free of charge.</li>
            <li>It seems to help distribute the oil very well</li>
            <li>Clears blemishes, hydrates skin very well and moisturizes cuticles.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.!</li>
            <li>It works very well on my skin and hair.</li>
            <li>but that I don&#x27;t really like.  </li>
            <li>This is a fast absorbing oil.</li>
            <li>My order came on time (very prompt) .</li>
            <li>I also use a drop on my cuticles and they look so much healthier.</li>
            <li>(it has been working very well for that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks Argan oil.</li>
            <li>It really does not agree with my skin.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t very fond of the smell.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>The oil works very well.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Nope, I promise you, this smells like straight up, throwup.</li>
            <li>One pump does my whole face..</li>
            <li>its very soothing..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hair-&lt;br /&gt;Apply 1-3 drops to the scalp or hair of washed hair and massage the oil in gently.</li>
            <li>but not anymore thanks to this 100% Argan oil by InstaNatural.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very well not leaving an oily residue.</li>
            <li>and they are actually sending me one for free.</li>
            <li>Maybe I expect too much.  </li>
            <li>Its just oil, so wondered what I could really expect.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to like this product, really, I did.  </li>
            <li>Fast forward 2 months to today, I asked a friend who has used argan oil for years to smell it.  </li>
            <li>It also does really well keeping my hair close to tangle-free.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I just run my fingers through my hair after applying the oil to my face and my hair is much healthier looking as well.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Absorbs into my hands to fast before I can apply it to my hair</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The bottle with the pump is very convienent.  </li>
            <li>no matter how much oil I use.</li>
            <li>She really appreciate it and is even already recommending it to her friends.</li>
            <li>old laugh lines</li>
            <li>it penetrates very well</li>
            <li>I even used a bunch on my scalp/hair once and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>very moisturizing ...</li>
            <li>I remember reading another customer&#x27;s review about how she used too much</li>
            <li>I would imagine that this product is not ordered much from amazon.</li>
            <li>I really had my doubts if the Argan oil would do as the product claimed.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t need to make so much.  </li>
            <li>and they look much stronger , healthier and don&#x27;t chip anymore.</li>
            <li>It has a ton of uses which makes it very multi-purpose.  </li>
            <li>Very emollient.</li>
            <li>The seller of this product really stands by it 100%.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I was very allergic too.  </li>
            <li>Highly highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I usually am very picky</li>
            <li>but I really like this product and fully recommend it.</li>
            <li>When I used it on my body it also moisturized very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have been very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also really like it as a frizz remover and detangler for my hair.</li>
            <li>When I used it on my body it also moisturized very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have been very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also really like it as a frizz remover and detangler for my hair.</li>
            <li>The reviews are very Fishy!&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is some sticky and stinky oil that doesn&#x27;t look smell or feel like real argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>found the seller to be very helpful and knowledgeable of his product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Hair looks much healthier.</li>
            <li>It really saves me a lot of $$$ as it is a multi-purpose moisturiser.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>After hearing and reading so much about the benefits of Argan oil,  I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>My real problem areas are my scalp, face and elbows.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m choosing this brand over the one I used to use because a) you get more product for fewer dollars, and the contents are identical, and b) the pump action on this bottle doles out a smaller amount at a time, so I can customize how much I&#x27;m smoothing onto my skin at any given time.</li>
            <li>but I have found I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I really like that it is not greasy feeling at all.</li>
            <li>On a side note, this company is very service-oriented.  </li>
            <li>and this really helps.</li>
            <li>It blends in very well on the skin.  </li>
            <li>This one has a convenient pump which makes it so much easier to use without accidental spillage.  </li>
            <li>I really like this  product</li>
            <li>It smooths out the split ends and tames frizz very well.</li>
            <li>It really helps my hair look</li>
            <li>very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>makes it&#x27;s so much easier to dispense the the eyedropper.</li>
            <li>A very versatile product.</li>
            <li>Thanks for asking.  </li>
            <li>It also works really fast on chapped lips which is also a plus.  </li>
            <li>I use this product on the whole family.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much difference yet.</li>
            <li>and it very seemingly works</li>
            <li>I use it on my skin, especially my face after cleansing, for a smooth glowing complexion.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have as much breakage since I&#x27;ve begun using this method.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this oil for moisturizing my face--I rub about 3 drops between my fingers and gently press it into my skin instead of rubbing it around.</li>
            <li>This is the REAL stuff...</li>
            <li>That has about as much meaning as saying &#x27;women of the U.S. use it&#x27;, and telling you to buy foot cream.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t absorb as fast as I would like it to.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and very responsive company.  </li>
            <li>It is a very versatile oil because it can be used on face, skin, hair and nails.</li>
            <li>But this product is very close..</li>
            <li>This stuff really works from hair to your toes.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and product packaging was well put together.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, this oil does not leave a greasy finish behind and once absorbed, all that&#x27;s left is healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>It also works very well as a body oil.</li>
            <li>that this line is organic and the pump bottle is very convenient as well</li>
            <li>and I must say I really like it.</li>
            <li>it is everything and more than i expected.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I both use it and it really works.</li>
            <li>You just don&#x27;t want to use too much because it makes your hair look greasy and oily if you do so.</li>
            <li>Do not purchase this brand as it went rancid real</li>
            <li>I really like the oil.</li>
            <li>I bought it, and I really like it.</li>
            <li>It Left my Face, Skin &amp; Hair feeling smooth &amp; silky to the touch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing</li>
            <li>My partner uses it for his beard to soften his facial hair, and feels safe for face since it is all natural.</li>
            <li>The oil disappeared into my skin quite quickly and the \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; was not overpowering, dissipating as quickly as the oil had penetrated my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;m spending the extra money and getting it from a legit website like Mountain Rose Herbs.</li>
            <li>Just the best oil I have used lately, it glides on and sinks in,</li>
            <li>Just make sure to do test areas on clear skin to rule out allergic reactions before putting on any affected areas, especially for children!</li>
            <li>I really liked the expensive one, the famous one, HOWEVER, I ordered this based on the reviews</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any scent, so I added a few drops of rose oil.</li>
            <li>This seems like a good product, contrary to some of the negative reviews on here.</li>
            <li>It is refreshing to see products in which all the ingredients can be pronounced and it has such a natural feel and smell to it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re curious to find whether Argan Oil works for you, this bottle from InstaNatural is a good start, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It is too late for me to return the bottle and to be fair to the seller, I want you to know that I did not contact them.</li>
            <li>They use all natural, pure ingredients and they are all made right here in the USA.  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks of applying a few drops on my hair, skin and nails… you wouldn’t believe how great this stuff works!</li>
            <li>one of those things they don&#x27;t tell you about getting old, when those white hairs start growing in they are more wiry than the ones you used to have.  </li>
            <li>Sweet almond oil has a slightly higher possibility of clogged pores than Argan oil, however I&#x27;ve used that as well (for about ten bucks for eight ounces).</li>
            <li>at least it&#x27;s a good body oil that you can use up.</li>
            <li>After the 1 hour was up I rinsed it with warm water and then blow dried my hair.</li>
            <li>put my makeup right on top of it and then need a little shine reducer dusted over my face before I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li>Most other argan products are not 100% pure but this one is.  </li>
            <li>It is a large bottle, seems like it is of pure, high quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it helps to put moisture back into my hair and tame the fly aways.</li>
            <li>Much like Portuguese cork oak, it is a totally sustainable &amp; an economically important product providing much needed employment, particularly amongst Moroccan women where co-operatives plough the profits into education for the workers and their children.</li>
            <li>Costumer service contacted me almost immediately and offered to buy me a new bottle with 2-day shipping, since my first bottle was damaged.</li>
            <li>However, I would suggest that you half this amount, half the Argan itself for it is far too perfect and could also get into the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have long wavy hair that I can easily straighten when I add the oil.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to know that it is all natural and not something with a mixture of 20 other ingredients that I can&#x27;t read.  </li>
            <li>Other brands I had to use a lot more and never seemed to absorb very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Application of the product is done differently for each body region, however in general it involves using only 1-3 drops per application and it is likely to be more effective if used every 1-2 days:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Natural Argan Oil comes in a beautiful dark blue glass bottle (always buy argan oil in dark colored glass to prevent degradation) and with a dropper in the top.</li>
            <li>had low expectations, since pretty much everything I&#x27;ve tried that claims to make skin better is simply not formulated for something like VDN.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a light oil that absorbs quickly and has a slight nutty smell.</li>
            <li>This particular one comes in a bigger bottle and is scent free.</li>
            <li>and it will be absorbed before you get to work, leaving your skin soft, relaxing creases, wrinkles - I am older and appreciate this product.</li>
            <li>And something I&#x27;ve noticed with other companies as they get more and more popular they raise their prices, I bought my oil in February when there were no reviews, now with over 300 reviews and a 5 star rating InstaNatural has kept their oil at the same reasonable price, usually less than $24 with occasional flash sales.</li>
            <li>Great product from a highly attentive seller, but even in small doses, a bit too heavy for my frizzy hair in humid Florida.</li>
            <li>I know there are many other uses for argan oil</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other argan oils and this is my favorite .</li>
            <li>I am not sure if this is Argan oil or just water in a bottle, but I am sure that it is not USDA approved!</li>
            <li>Like other oil treatments make sure not to pour it onto your hair.</li>
            <li>Since you only need a few drops each day, this stuff lasts a long time, making it an excellent value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product and compared to the other name brand stuff this will save you hundreds.</li>
            <li>I also really love the pump as compared to the dropper that comes with some other brands.</li>
            <li>There are so many other oils out there</li>
            <li>I have tried other argan oils (Josie Moran) but Instanatural  is better and the price is a bargain.  </li>
            <li>This Argan oil has replaced most of my other moisturizing products as well as my styling products for hair.</li>
            <li>With some of the other brands you pay more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much bigger bottle than what I&#x27;ve gotten in stores and with all its uses, it is well worth the price!</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t attest to any of the other uses, but this argan oil has done a better job of moisturizing and softening my beard than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality pure argan oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to start off by saying that this is PURE, high quality Argan oil.</li>
            <li>The bottle of Insta natural is pure oil, very light and has a barely noticeable nutshell sort of odor which I can barely detect.  </li>
            <li>This particular product is also a great value considering how much is in the bottle and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>, I fell in love with this oil, I use it on my skin also, it is said to do wonders for the people in the Amazon who are constantly exposed to harsh climate, I most certainly would recommend this product for smoother and soft looking skin.</li>
            <li>I am slowly but surely switching my family&#x27;s products over to healthier alternatives - I&#x27;ve got a few more facial products to use up (waste not want not - and they are great - just want Simplified!)</li>
            <li>directions for different uses such as those are on the bottle in pretty large print (at lease as large as you can on a bottle) and are easy to see and use.</li>
            <li>Using this and Walgreen&#x27;s $8.99 alpha lipoic acid cream is taking my face to a whole new level of moisture and smoothness!</li>
            <li>Mine came with a dropper in a blue bottle, so it looks like Insta Natural is trying a new look, but I&#x27;m sure the pump works just as well!&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I have long, fine hair so 5 to 6 drops will cover it all.  </li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t use too much it soaks in to your skin in about a minute and leaves it supple and smooth.</li>
            <li>It seems much thinner than a previous brand of argan oil I have used...not sure why it&#x27;s so much thinner.    </li>
            <li>I love the pump and the fragrance is barely noticeable and goes away almost instantly.  </li>
            <li>It is housed in pretty amber bottle which I appreciate since the packaging limits sun exposure which may potentially degrade the oil and reduce the time the oil stays fresh.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that a small portion of it had leaked out in the box.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it is just great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I’ve been using it for a few weeks as a replacement for the hand cream I usually use and am very impressed.</li>
            <li>I put some of this in my hair after a shower and let it air dry and the argan oil keeps my hair looking naturally in control and keeps it nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference in my nails after only a few applications - they were brittle and peeling and now they&#x27;re much stronger and break much more infrequently.</li>
            <li>I have used Argan oil before (on my natural, dreadlocked hair) and enjoyed the way it not only was absorbed by my hair but how it left my hair with a natural-appearing glossy shine.</li>
            <li>Totally recommend for hair, specially in the summer.</li>
            <li>It has moisturized my hair and skin better than previous argan oils I have used, including Acure, Josie Maran, Pur D&#x27;or, and a whole foods brand.</li>
            <li>The skin on my forehead is now becoming a bit dry but the rest of my face is normal.</li>
            <li>and then I rub any extra on my nails to make them shiny, soft, and strong.</li>
            <li>but as others have noted that just means a good leave in conditioning treatment and after the next wash my hair is silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also mix about half a dropperful into my lotion.  </li>
            <li>Just a little rubbed in the palms &amp; run through the hair makes it easy to comb, &amp; shines!  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and she has not been able to use it long enough to warrant a 5 star rating just yet but does like the feel and quick absorption--makes her skin soft and helped control frizzy hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very long, fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>I will purchase this item as long as it is available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin smooth all day long.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle of InstaNatural Organic Argan Oil in early December of 2014 based on the recommendation of friends.  </li>
            <li>I paid full price for this on amazon, and will definitely be doing so again when I run out.</li>
            <li>It is more greasy and not easily absorbed like the Josie Maran argan oil.</li>
            <li>Of all the promises of improvement, the only thing I found to be true is that it didn&#x27;t break my skin out.  </li>
            <li>Insta Natural was one of the first companies I had the pleasure to review a product for.</li>
            <li>I also appreciate that the bottle is dark (to protect the integrity of the oil) and that it has a pump (which is so much more sanitary than the droppers).</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and pretty.  </li>
            <li>And after 4 months(February till now in June) of full  all over body use I still have about 20% of the bottle left.  </li>
            <li>So thought I would try this since its cheaper, nice big size for the price, only usedmonce so far.</li>
            <li>At first, I was hesitant since my face is naturally oily, WHY WOULD I PUT OIL ON MY FACE?</li>
            <li>Started using it just now, so I am not sure how effective it is with stopping hair loss.</li>
            <li>It was my first try at a natural oil for my face instead of &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I searched the internet and bought my first bottle  of Insta Natural from Amazon (I always buy Amazon) after reading the raving reviews.  </li>
            <li>It has helped my dry skin and hair tremendously!</li>
            <li>Company refunded me in full for the product, no return necessary, so A+ for customer service.  </li>
            <li>this is my favorite argan oil hands down .</li>
            <li>Any more will weigh down the hair) and leaves my skin feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li>Just because supposedly another nation may traditionally use a specific product doesn&#x27;t mean that product is the very best of the best.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I absolutely live this product!</li>
            <li>and I live in Hawaii where the humidity is never ending!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>when it comes to my psoriasis a good thing that helps keep them from flairing up so bad is keeping my skin moisterized, i used this product on my arm and it kept my arm nice and smooth and imediatly calmed down my psoriasis, didnt cause them to spread or anything.</li>
            <li>The bottle contains more information as far as uses are concerned - since this is a raw ingredient, you can use it to make your own things as well, and it&#x27;s extremely versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When asked what her favorite thing about the oil is, she responded with the way it has leave in or wash out options, that it is natural and not full of chemicals or perfumes, the pump that gives her exactly the amount she needs for that particular day, and</li>
            <li>But today, 24/hrs later, that one lonely finger (I&#x27;m not using it to type this, that&#x27;s how amazing it looks)</li>
            <li>The patches of dry are gone, and i have a smooth texture now.</li>
            <li>Gives my hair a slight sheen but more than that</li>
            <li>If you look greasy you used too much, less is more with this stuff.</li>
            <li>This product accomplishes what I wanted, but less is more.  </li>
            <li>Much like Portuguese cork oak, it is a totally sustainable &amp; an economically important product providing much needed employment, particularly amongst Moroccan women where co-operatives plough the profits into education for the workers and their children.to avoid absorbing pesticides at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While there is a slight learning curve to application, but my skin has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li>My facial skin texture is firmer &amp; more supple (being 63, that&#x27;s endorsement enough),</li>
            <li>I bought this oil mainly to use on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it and was able to use it 3 days later (standard shipping).</li>
            <li>but I bought 2 more bottles, I for my extra bathroom and one as an extra.  </li>
            <li>And by the time I wake up in the morning, the oil is completely absorbed and my face feels not dry but freshed.</li>
            <li>Much better than useless lotions containing water which evaporates and also better than greasy olive or coconut oils.</li>
            <li>My nails have become drier as I get older</li>
            <li>This is natural and light enough not to cause break outs.</li>
            <li>Its like a combination of motor oil and super glue mixed</li>
            <li>I have to say that I have gotten several products by this company, and without fail they are excellent quality and do what they say.</li>
            <li>I mixed this with the rosehip oil and the results were fantastic my legs felt so soft after i shaved them  and my face two.</li>
            <li>I have gone to a couple different health food stores and sampled many different brands of argan oil and compared to my bottle of InstaNatural</li>
            <li>particularly my hands/feet</li>
            <li>I mainly use it for</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and you&#x27;re not left feeling greasy at all!</li>
            <li>I find good oils last longer when packaged in glass and a few drops after a shower is all you need.</li>
            <li>I do use it on my hair and have not noticed any particular benefit.</li>
            <li>The bottle is decent sized, but doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly as a sealer for my hair during styling and part of my moisturizing routine and will be reordering.  </li>
            <li>After using the oil for two months, I can’t say for sure if there have been any actual physical benefits.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more of this in the future for her.</li>
            <li>Love it over 50 younger men think I am much younger.  </li>
            <li>I would most definitely purchase this specific brand again.</li>
            <li>I am older</li>
            <li>I had not tried Argan Oil until recently; now that I have, coconut oil has a worthy competitor.</li>
            <li>it has made such a tremendous difference in my face.  </li>
            <li>and I plan on purchasing several more as I have been using it daily now for over 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I purchased the InstaNatural Argan Oil a few months ago and I love it so much I wanted to write a review.</li>
            <li>It is not the brans, as I have reviewed Insta Natural products in the past and have considered them to be a very reputable company.  </li>
            <li>This is mainly used cosmetically but can be consumed.</li>
            <li>mostly review all the Insta natural Product line with 1 line ads, not real</li>
            <li>The pump is an added bonus, I don&#x27;t care for the dropper that comes on most competitors bottles, the pump keeps the product covered so the oil doesn&#x27;t get exposed to outside influences and such.</li>
            <li>me, it&#x27;s been decent...</li>
            <li>I got this mainly for my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I was told my skin would be extremely sensitive to light, especially sunlight.  </li>
            <li>I expected it to have a strong smell</li>
            <li>It works great when applied to my fine, thin, curly hair giving it shine and body without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>I have waist length curly hair, make combing it out after a wash much easier and my hair is very soft.</li>
            <li>Also, this smells very natural which I don&#x27;t really care for.</li>
            <li>So, I love this idea because this way it will last a good long time because the bottle is 4 fluid ounces, enough to last quite awhile if you watch what you are doing.</li>
            <li>Hair is shiny, controls fly aways, helps with smoothing down  hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>have tried a few different brands that are pure and organic and honestly, so far, I&#x27;ve loved them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great price for such a large size - you use a few drops at a time so it should last you for a while.</li>
            <li>The oil would leak out before I could squeeze the dropper making a bit of a mess on the bottle and dispensing more than I wanted to use.</li>
            <li>After a few minutes, the oil is absorbed and my skin is ready for make up (foundation and the full monty).</li>
            <li>Remember to exfoliate your dry scalp first!!</li>
            <li>No more dry spots, no tightness or oily spots and my skin tone has evened out a great deal.</li>
            <li>even if I am supposed to use it for half of what I do, but as long as I don&#x27;t ingest it, i think I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li>wrap the bottle make sure the cap is sealed tight and put pieces of foam so a spill won&#x27;t occur, unless it came from an amazon location.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend their Argan Oil &amp; all their products.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend  Instanatural&#x27; s organic product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I will order this product again from this company, and recommend it highly to my friends.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>High Points</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I am personally trying to use less commercial products (leave in conditioner, hand lotion, face moisturizer), so for these purposes, it works great.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this amazing, quality product over any other brand of Argan Oil I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I waited to write a review as I wanted to be as honest as possible to other consumers.  </li>
            <li>had the opportunity to sample some Insta Natural 100% Pure Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>So fun for me to go outside of the box and try new things I had never even heard of before vs. using chemical treatments!</li>
            <li>I also love the little note I received.</li>
            <li>It does take a little bit of time for it to soak in, but I think this has more to do with my using three pumps than anything else.</li>
            <li>temptation when using a product like this is always to use a little more than the label recommends.</li>
            <li>My skin felt different the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used on my hair after shampooing/conditioning to give it a little more shine.  </li>
            <li>This One Comes With A Squirt Nozzle, Which Allows Me To Use A Little More Oil At One Time</li>
            <li>I even put it on my beard now which makes it look a little better.</li>
            <li>So far, so good, although I did not completely substitute out my other prescriptions and creams.  </li>
            <li>and then my hair keeps my hair shiny and keeps the frizzies out (I have long, fine, medium-thick, naturally wavy, frizzy hair).</li>
            <li>I find this Argon oil to be very light, in texture as well as scent, and adding a few drops to your skin and hair after a shower really makes your skin soft and your hair shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li>I originally ordered this oil for my dry hair.</li>
            <li>The hard, cystic kind.</li>
            <li>Just a little goes a long way and smells good.</li>
            <li>I seem to be having less breakouts since starting to use it, and i LOVE the way my skin feels!  </li>
            <li>Offers every benefit of other brands&#x27; Argan oil (reduces appearance if wrinkles; quickly and completely absorbed; no oily or shiny feel or appearance).</li>
            <li>You get a large 4oz bottle of pure argan oil for a decent price, so I’d definitely recommend this product if you’re looking for argan oil for your skin or looking to try something new (this was new for me!), then give this a try.</li>
            <li>Soft, gentle and non greasy.</li>
            <li>This stuff I smooth on while wet, even on my face now</li>
            <li>It is also a great tonic for dried cuticles, as I have only recently learned.</li>
            <li>It absorbs readily and my skin feels soft and moist.</li>
            <li>I wish I had not wasted that much money.</li>
            <li>Really like this so far.  </li>
            <li>Really makes my skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have much of a smell, it did remove my shampoo smell when I put it on, which kinda sucks as I love the smell of my shampoo, hehe.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and without freeze even in very humid weather during rainy season in Panama.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this versatile product so far.</li>
            <li>It really rehydrates my face and makes it soft and not oily.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to say too much because I fear some pharmaceutical company will find a way to fight against this natural remedy....</li>
            <li>--smooth on rough feet, elbows, hands, face&lt;br</li>
            <li>My whole body is soft as a baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>So far, I really like this oil.  </li>
            <li>I really like this oil so far.</li>
            <li>I just bought a second bottle for my golden retriever</li>
            <li>to the reviews of many suspecting the oil is not genuine, I bought two brands together.</li>
            <li>But since using it for about 6 weeks now i can say i saw a difference in my hair looking more healthier than ever without all those harsh chemical \.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>When I get out of the shower I put a few pumps on my hand and run over mostly the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>My wife and I both have long hair, and I have a full beard.</li>
            <li>Using my normal lotion wasn&#x27;t doing the trick.  </li>
            <li>I bought this oil based on the reviews and normally i use rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t apply too much - start with small, add more as needed, eh?  </li>
            <li>love this product use these everyday for my moisturizer for my hair and my body.</li>
            <li>It is still worth getting, but you might keep in mind that you&#x27;ll want to follow it with something pleasantly-scented if you&#x27;ll be in close contact shortly thereafter.</li>
            <li>but I guess would take ore than few months of usage :)</li>
            <li>It is so useful on face-nails-hair that I have made it a daily routine.</li>
            <li>Much better than a heavy night cream.</li>
            <li>Suffice it to say that rubbing a few drops into my heels is now a favorite activity during evening TV sessions.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the extra couple of minutes in the morning.  </li>
            <li>and my elbows are well on their way to being normal again.</li>
            <li>I will likely purchase more of this product as the winter is long.  </li>
            <li>After trying a small sample from a high-end brand known for its argan oil (JM), I knew it was something I definitely wanted to put on my face but wasn&#x27;t willing (able, really) to spend that much.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not really necessary, as a few drops work just as well, but this way is a lot more fun.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday (more than once).</li>
            <li>Is it normal?</li>
            <li>so i tried this alone as a treatment before using normal shampoo</li>
            <li>It has a light, green, nutty scent at first</li>
            <li>I can not give a full review of long term use</li>
            <li>I love this oil for my long blonde locks.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s not cold pressed and a different bottle..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care the bottle is different.. but not cold pressed?</li>
            <li>Broken - was not wrap good</li>
            <li>Not sure yet if it does anything for my nails, but I have high hopes that will result in better, stronger nails too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the previous users who were so satisfied and took the time to write a review.  </li>
            <li>Also, be sure to blow-dry completely, or hair may feel a bit weighed down.</li>
            <li>The shiny black, blue and red hair you&#x27;ve seen so far are all thanks to this amazing product!</li>
            <li>I am sure this will last for a very long time</li>
            <li>This one is thinner and absorbs better, TOTALLY improved my dry skin and hair.</li>
            <li>It is less greasy than my last argan, which I also liked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Usually when I use a cream based moisturizer alone, my makeup will end up settling on top of my skin and by mid day, my forehead appears scaly and dry.</li>
            <li>The Argan oil has so many uses and just helps especially in the winter dry air.</li>
            <li>It works especially well for those dry patches I get on my elbows, but frankly it&#x27;s the most versatile beauty product I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisified with this product and would most definitely purchase other products from this company.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Argan Oil for over 2 years and this product is just as good as any of the more expensive options at other retailers.</li>
            <li>is most likely due to the oil going rancid from being exposed to  too much oxygen.</li>
            <li>The 2nd time I used the right amount.  </li>
            <li>You get just the right amount of product to cover the face and potentially the neck when using this product.    </li>
            <li>Luckily, it doesn&#x27;t smell for long</li>
            <li>The dropper lets you dispense the product a few drops at a time, which is perfect, since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Unlike other type of oil leaves greasy texture.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention the seller follows up right after, he has been very helpful and fast reply to all my questions.</li>
            <li>Used daily, and it seems to keep the fine facial lines at a minimum.  </li>
            <li>, I like Argan Oil because of its high concentration of vitamin E and essential fatty acids that works great on my dry skin and helps make my hair stay soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really get to enjoy the oil but put a little bit on my hands..</li>
            <li>However, the oil is filled with other oil and fragrance.</li>
            <li>and I have been seeing small but great results in such a short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is a little odor, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because it is natural.</li>
            <li>As for the Oil, just from the little I was able to rub on my hands wow</li>
            <li>I used it on my face and liked that it didn&#x27;t feel oily, but when it used it in my hair, even the very small amount I used made my hair feel oily.</li>
            <li>As a new comer to Argan Oil</li>
            <li>Argan oil is definetly going to be a new</li>
            <li>and  sent me a new one immediately.</li>
            <li>I am a new organic Argan oil user for my face</li>
            <li>because then I will put on my argan to soak into my newly exfoliated pores.  </li>
            <li>Argan Oil is pressed from the fruits of the Argan Tree[Argania Spinosa], a tree that is native to Morocco and can live up to 200 years.</li>
            <li>I received the new dropper 2 days later.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>I live in vegas.  </li>
            <li>so I can definitely live with it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to get some argan oil product for my parents who live overseas</li>
            <li>, they must be new to Argan oil.</li>
            <li>I also like the new pump versus the dropper they used to use.</li>
            <li>the new pump spray vs the dropper version before.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t gotten any new acne yet.</li>
            <li>I am new to using argan oil</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what garbage is in the air where i live</li>
            <li>Please send a new pump.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>(PS I live in the desert).  </li>
            <li>I love how raw and organic it is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands which were smaller bottles and far more expensive, but this was a great quantity for natural, organic argan oil with a reasonable price tag.</li>
            <li>put on wet, clean hair to control frizz and add shine.</li>
            <li>Has made a huge difference in my skin, I am 33 so starting to notice some moisture loss in my skin especially this winter.</li>
            <li>It soaked in very quickly, had a slight smell -</li>
            <li>I used a few drops daily on my feet for amazing relief.</li>
            <li>I always have skin issues when I&#x27;m pregnant (break outs, dry skin).  </li>
            <li>This deliciously light feeling and deeply nourishing oil has literally improved the look of my skin in just two weeks of daily use.  </li>
            <li>nice oil, doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy on hair, also no smell , just use few drops so it is big bottle</li>
            <li>It drys quickly and without a greasy felling (because it&#x27;s a dry oil).</li>
            <li>After washing her hair, applying the argan oil, and a quick blow dry</li>
            <li>I am 70 years old and come from a generation of men that never were particularly concerned about their appearance.  </li>
            <li>After showering and towel drying my hair, I dispensed a few drops of Insta Natural Argan Oil into my palms, rubbed the oil vigorously between my hands and applied it to the ends of my hair where it tends to be the driest and most damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(my ends are super dry</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 3 drops and it was too much, 2 drops still too much, 2 drops only on the ends</li>
            <li>I start on the ends and then smooth a bit onto my frizzy baby hairs around my face and finally run my hands through the rest of my hair with what&#x27;s left.</li>
            <li>As well, as I wrote in my review of the Rose Hip oil, Instanaturals is the real deal, a Company that stands behind their product, and is staffed by professionals.</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling soft and smooth and helps with winter rough hands.  </li>
            <li>, it has a strange smell to it, but this is consistent with what I&#x27;ve read about real argan oil.</li>
            <li>ive a super dry skin</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need a whole lot for your hair which means that it will last a lot longer.</li>
            <li>It has worked far better than any OTC lotion I&#x27;ve used and far better than numerous prescription medications which are generally topical steroids and probably not very good for you</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully at instantly and completely calming my very dry and sensitive skin, and making my nails strong and pretty.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Argan Oil is so natural that the only ingredient is : 100% pure and certified organic virgin cold-pressed argan oil (Argania Spinosa).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although it is initially a little greasy when you first spray it on, it does draw into the skin fairly quickly when you massage it in, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was re-stocking my supply of various natural moisturisers when I came across this product and between the positive reviews and the money-back guarantee (which I really hoped I would not have to test)</li>
            <li>Because I have fine hair, it seemed to weigh it down, even after shampooing.</li>
            <li>This oil makes my skin feel very soft all over.  </li>
            <li>was very soft.</li>
            <li>My feet feel very soft.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, which is getting dryer with age.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin but have had no issues with this oil.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>I am blonde and what I am talking about is that soft, fine, almost translucent facial hair that you get.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use without making a mess.</li>
            <li>I had no prior knowledge of what pure argan oil smelled or looked like, so I was surprised that I didn&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li>(but I did use it the first week since my dry skin was very severe).  </li>
            <li>I use it on my hair, face and hands and it makes everything so soft!</li>
            <li>My only draw back is, there is simply not enought to take a bath in :)</li>
            <li>left in my first bottle</li>
            <li>When I use this oil my skin feels soft and supple!</li>
            <li>(she didn&#x27;t say that last part exactly).</li>
            <li>It seems like they are pretty solid with their product quality.</li>
            <li>that it is natural and organic, too!</li>
            <li>but I am not sure if it is safe to use on the eye area..</li>
            <li>First, but not the last time I&#x27;m buying it.</li>
            <li>No waste!</li>
            <li>love to add a few drops to the homemade scrubs and creams I make!</li>
            <li>daughter usually has a ponytail aka ball of curls on top of her head.</li>
            <li>; i.e., old!  </li>
            <li>I use it every day and my eczema has completely cleared up!  </li>
            <li>It works better then the most expensive facial lotions too.</li>
            <li>My immediate reaction was to say out loud, &amp;#34;No way!</li>
            <li>WHY WOULD ANYONE SELL THIS ALONG WITH A PUMP TOP THAT DOES NOT FIT?!</li>
            <li>Seen the same oil in other places for much more.</li>
            <li>This will last me surely through the entire next year</li>
            <li>I really love the small, texture and quality of the InstaNatural argan oil.</li>
            <li>it looks much better then usual.</li>
            <li>At first I use only on my face.  </li>
            <li>I felt like a greaser if you put more than 1 small pump.</li>
            <li>I use it on my arms and tattoo - it brings out the colors in the tattoo and leaves my skin so soft and again, not oily!  </li>
            <li>soaks in to my skin faster and feels more instantly hydrating than other organic Argan oils I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s basically the same exact thing but for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>Terrific value and very prompt service!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty big bottle!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over a month and my skin feels so soft!</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and use a flat iron to straighten it, and using this product on my hair wet helps to smooth it and reduce any frizziness!</li>
            <li>It absorbed fast and contrary to what I have read in other reviews</li>
            <li>This was my first Argan oil experience and I am eager to use it for everything possible.</li>
            <li>I used it twice a day on my underarms and the back of my arms and after the first day could already tell a difference.  </li>
            <li>now i have soft hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely spreading the word about this to everyone who needs real Argan oil!</li>
            <li>I am a mixed asian woman and while my hair is wavy, it wasn&#x27;t enough to warrant more keratin treatments anymore.</li>
            <li>It does have a smell when you first open the bottle.</li>
            <li>I have only used this for 2 days now and my review is pretty premature.</li>
            <li>You can use and mix it with natural products without all the chemicals!</li>
            <li>it was so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Effects are satisfactory so far!  </li>
            <li>Another natural product from InstaNatural!</li>
            <li>I saw instant results after using this product on my hair for the first time.</li>
            <li>So I purchased a separate, nearly identical bottle to keep the argan oil in and haven&#x27;t had a problem since!</li>
            <li>Not too sure if the bottle situation only happened to me, but be careful if that happens to you!</li>
            <li>love how raw and natural this product is.</li>
            <li>love how raw and natural this product is.</li>
            <li>My skin has the dryness, wrinkles, and brown spots that come with a very long life that has been well lived, and it is also super sensitive.</li>
            <li>My skin became more dry from using it and my hair also looked dry after using this product.</li>
            <li>the natural smell is slight &amp; easy to get used to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Moroccan hair oil for 2 years now and decided to finally try the real thing, what they claim is the main ingredient - argan oil.</li>
            <li>I love how soft my face feels long after application (my skin is usually pretty dry - especially in the winter!).</li>
            <li>As someone with a combination skin type, I can go from having a very oily face to a very dry face depending on the weather and my diet, and I had been looking for something that I could use as a moisturizer that would help keep my face consistently moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and don&#x27;t forget to put in in your hair at night to give it a nice conditioning while you sleep.</li>
            <li>I had a more expensive brand in a smaller bottle but this honestly works the same.</li>
            <li>I have been a fan of Josie Maran for a long time but right now its not in the budget.</li>
            <li>I rest assured knowing it is 100% pure and organic.&lt;br /&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit &amp; Planet&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;</li>
            <li>I use just a bit of this oil--recommended by my hair stylist--to calm frizzy hair that tends to dry because of hair coloring.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge so will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I greatly prefer the slightly fruity scent of this to the other and what smell there is dissipates much quicker than the other, stinky smell.  </li>
            <li>First off, the smell is that of fresh green olives.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to dispense a few drops at a time.</li>
            <li>The argan oil sinks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t rub off.</li>
            <li>The following morning my hair still felt soft and when I straightened my hair it looked so pretty.</li>
            <li>It is pure, cold pressed, 100% organic, in a beautiful cobalt blue glass ( that is quality packaging ).&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really helps my frizzies to calm down.  </li>
            <li>oil is organic and pure, has no chemical additives like other oils advertised for much higher price.</li>
            <li>My cuticles and rough heels are finally happy after only a few days!  </li>
            <li>I think the reason I was getting such mixed results at first was because I was convinced I needed to use a whole bunch.</li>
            <li>Besides using it &amp;#34;as is&amp;#34; from the bottle, you can use it as a hot oil treatment, skin moisturizer, dry scalp and eczema treatment, treat dry hands and cuticles, treats mild acne since it has Oleic acid, use it to grill vegetables, add some lemon and use as salad dressing.</li>
            <li>bottle will last a long time, with each drop of treasured oil absorbed and appreciated.</li>
            <li>makes you feel worse &amp; more side effects!  </li>
            <li>This is a nice, big glass bottle, tinted blue (argan oil needs to be in a dark bottle to retain its properties).</li>
            <li>I could lessen the amount used to have it soak in faster, but I don&#x27;t mind going to sleep with a slightly oily face when I know I&#x27;ll be waking up to smooth, soft skin.</li>
            <li>There are Argan Oils out in the market, similar to this product, that sell for much more for much less.</li>
            <li>I use under moisturizer as an extra boost and really love the look that it provides, which is to give my face a slightly luminous look.</li>
            <li>This is my second time trying Argan oil, and I like this brand better than the previous one I&#x27;d tried.</li>
            <li>They quickly resolved the issue and went the extra mile to go beyond the simple fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This treatment leaves my hair soft and shiny and after a few applications like this, my hair is strong too.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I have to hold it upside down until I am ready to use it because basically the dropper just let&#x27;s the oil come right out, instead of in drops.</li>
            <li>This is my third bottle, first from this company, and this is the first time I&#x27;ve experienced this putrid smell. :(</li>
            <li>It really helps soften and calm my dry, coarse, frizzy, and curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I just rub a few drops between my palms and lightly rake the product through my hair and WOW!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t thank you enough, y&#x27;all process a pure miracle.  </li>
            <li>argan oil is a pure, simple, organic product.  </li>
            <li>I especially like that it&#x27;s organic and pure maintains its nutrients.</li>
            <li>My skin certainly looks younger and fuller.  </li>
            <li>This &amp; another essential oil were packed in a large box that  included a case of six 32 oz.</li>
            <li>It only contains 100% pure, certified organic argan oil.</li>
            <li>The pump as a dispenser is also great - especially compared to other oil products that have droppers that leak, particularly when you only need a few drops.</li>
            <li>It has very light nutty smell, negligible in a few drops, only observed when taking a sniff from the bottle.</li>
            <li>after 3 days my hair became really smooth and shiny and a little oily.</li>
            <li>Organic cold-pressed oils are never going to be cheap, at least not if you want them to be pure and ethically-sourced.  </li>
            <li>I recently had the opportunity to try Insta Natural’s 100% Pure Organic Moroccan Argan oil.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed a significant thickening of my hair or less acne.</li>
            <li>This oil is lovely, but a little thinner in consistency than others I have used... however, the results have been the same.  </li>
            <li>I love it, and it takes so little that this bottle will last forever.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and is comparable to other Argan Oils I have used.</li>
            <li>My favorite part about it is that the wrinkles on my forehead are hardly visible when I have the oil on.</li>
            <li>Dr. Axe made this oil the clear choice</li>
            <li>Applying just a tiny amount of this Argan Oil twice a day (morning and night) directly on my cuticles has really improved their condition.</li>
            <li>I expected to enjoy using their argan oil and InstaNatural actually surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The seller really believes in their product and offers a lifetime 100% money back guarantee.</li>
            <li>I have to be careful, but for deep moisturizing for my hair - it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not used to spending a lot on facial products but the bottle is 4oz which really is huge, especially since you only need to use a couple of drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The oil also comes out of the dropper much too fast, so be careful.</li>
            <li>After using a well known (expensive) organic toxin free moisturizer I was looking for something toxin free but cheaper.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft.  </li>
            <li>I part my hair in multiple places and apply a drop or two to each part and rub in gently and throughly.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product unhesitatingly.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>It instsntly makes your hair soft and is also a detangler.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel sooooo soft.</li>
            <li>makes hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how versatile it is.</li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals or preservatives to complicate things.</li>
            <li>My (4b) hair is soft, manageable and is retaining length.</li>
            <li>far it has help  dryness a lot I can not tell yet</li>
            <li>I also like that it&#x27;s organic and natural ingridents.</li>
            <li>I really cannot get enough of it.</li>
            <li>This product made my skin sooo much smoother and younger.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft without being greasy.</li>
            <li>Either way, my hair is always soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I decided that I would not use this oil on my face because my skin can be sensitive.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair really soft.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind the smell and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Now with Insta Natural, I feel the difference</li>
            <li>I like that it is totally natural, no temporary results like the anti-wrinkle cream that quits working when you quit using it.</li>
            <li>This organic Argan oil is a translucent yellow in color and has what I feel a very neutral scent, so it will not compete with any fragrances you are already wearing.  </li>
            <li>I had when I was young and thought I could rule the world.    </li>
            <li>So far I have used this oil for my nails and cuticles, as a leave in conditioner, and I even have used it on my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>(smaller ones much faster of course)  </li>
            <li>so silky and soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>REALLY SEE A BIG DIFFERENCE.LOVE</li>

            <li>It leaves your skin soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly,no odor and feels like silk on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Soft, manageable and shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used the professional oil products that are blended with Argan oil., but decided to try it alone.</li>
            <li>I can literally feel the difference and feel like a million bucks with this natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It goes far, believe me.</li>
            <li>When the postman dropped the package next to my door I found out that something happened to the oil inside and the whole box was soaked in oil. :</li>
            <li>But I was extremely pleasantly surprised...</li>
            <li>and it made them so soft.</li>
            <li>and you should not put anywhere near your face</li>
            <li>I can already see that my hair is much shiner, thicker, and healthier overall.</li>
            <li>Just starting using it on my whole body after a work out.</li>
            <li>it?&lt;br /&gt;I am a professional stylist.</li>
            <li>I have been using this Argan Oil on my hair for the last couple weeks and find it has really improved the feel and look of my hair.  </li>
            <li>It was a gift for my mom and so far she likes how the oil feels compared to others she&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li>The issue that I had with the the pump bottle has been fixed.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but I use it on my arms and legs and so far  no break outs.</li>
            <li>Instead my arms and legs are soft all day.</li>
            <li>No heavy fragrance at all.</li>
            <li>Every bottle of Insta Natural Argan Oil is certified organic.</li>
            <li>A handful of drops (5-7) is what I needed to make my shoulder length hair look soft and</li>
            <li>Insta Natural offers a 100% guarantee on their product.</li>
            <li>100% natural</li>
            <li>Not oily just leaves me soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I mix approx 6 drops of the argan oil into my conditioner and it leaves it soft and conditioned.  </li>
            <li>As it&#x27;s an oil, it doesn&#x27;t take much to go a pretty long way.</li>
            <li>anything stings once it&#x27;s in the eyes, natural or not.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also love that this bottle is going to go a long long way when you figure you only use 2-3 drops at a time.  </li>
            <li>so I was surprised that it can be used on the hands, nails, face, arms and legs as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>am 52 years old and everybody thinks I am in my early Thirties.  </li>
            <li>But NOTHING made it go completely</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiny, manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>A lot healthier to moisturize as it is all natural.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my skin daily and really like the effects.</li>
            <li>also use this on my face when I feel the need but only after using a hyaluronic acid gel/serum since this combo really seems to help with absorption of this.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>However, after rubbing this into my hair, the odor &amp;#34;magically&amp;#34; disappears and I am felt with no harsh smelling</li>
            <li>After reviewing the ingridients and making some research, is absolutely the same.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturised, but not greasy.</li>
            <li>The only reason I took off one star was because the smell really is ghastly.</li>
            <li>It works really well and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>This 4oz.bottle is a real value and seems to have the same results.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural is a company that I trust to offer real 100%  Argan oil and not a blend of inferior oils with Argan mixed in.</li>
            <li>However, it appears that they have fixed this problem by changing the bottle to a pump dispenser.</li>
            <li>The results were a soft and bouncy mane.</li>
            <li>I have really damaged hair because I dye my&lt;br /&gt;hair neon red, so I use this to help with the damage, split ends, and frizz.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair shine and skin soft.</li>
            <li>ABSORBS QUICKLY, SOFT SKIN, THANK YOU</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft with this product.  </li>
            <li>After about one week of use the dryness went away completely.  </li>
            <li>It is a natural product, doesn&#x27;t have any perfume added,</li>
            <li>I use it on eczema as well, and while it may not heal it completely it does relieve it.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soooo soft.</li>
            <li>I have used this for almost 2 weeks now and my face and hands have never felt this soft.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>So far, I have used it for 2 months, and it doesn&#x27;t cause any problem around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>and I wanted something natural to add moisture to my skin.</li>
            <li>I use it on body and face and it leaves skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>And also it keeps my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>WOW WHAT A SAVINGS OVER JOSSEY&#x27;S JUST NO SCENT</li>
            <li>1-2 drops rubbed into the tips of my hair and -voila- shiny, soft hair.</li>
            <li>My skin is silky thanks to this product I apply twice daily after showers.</li>
            <li>Works well so far.</li>
            <li>As for Amazon they were so gracious to refund me back for all the products that were damaged, Thanks Amazon..</li>
            <li>I did not break out from this product which I was thankful for since I break out from basically anything and everything under the sun since my skin is so freaking sensitive.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather use this natural one ingredient product than a manufactured moisturizer with garbage ingredients in it.  </li>
            <li>I left it in my scalp/hair for one whole day.</li>
            <li>When I contacted them and let them know this, they offered me this product for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Received for review the product is presented in a 120mL brown glass bottle and comes with a capped pump action spray.</li>
            <li>Despite my frequent use one bottle lasts me months.</li>
            <li>Insta Natural&#x27;s oil is a bargain at any price, and this 4 oz.</li>
            <li>Immediately, she told me that it was old.  </li>
            <li>I add a few pumps to my lotion bottle, and it leaves my skin smooth and silky without any greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>I also like that the pump action to squirt the oil out of the glass bottle is not messy at all.</li>
            <li>I rub one pump of this between my palms, run it through the ends of my hair, and everything becomes soft and springy, not at all greasy.</li>
            <li>Wow I was surprised.</li>
            <li>It has an old smell, but I&#x27;m not too picky about that</li>
            <li>I will go directly to the company and order.</li>
            <li>I have to say, I am completely won over.</li>
            <li>It soaks in immediately and leaves my skin soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ways</li>
            <li>It lets a lot come out, more than I needed so I am extra careful when I take it out of the bottle to only use about two drops.&lt;br</li>
            <li>HER HAIR IS SO SOFT AND MANAGEABLE.  </li>
            <li>THE NATURAL HAIRSTYLES</li>
            <li>and it is not heavy</li>
            <li>My skins feels soft but not greasy,oil absorbs well.</li>
            <li>I got this because it is completely organic</li>
            <li>Personally, it&#x27;s too much to use it in the morning.</li>
            <li>People are commenting on how soft my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels baby soft.  </li>
            <li>Insta Natural Argan Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think I just do not personally like the whole oily feeling.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since then, I have simply purchased the real thing.(Oil Only.)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When it came, however, I was finding that the smell simply was too much for me.  </li>
            <li>IT MAKES MY SKIN SO SOFT.</li>
            <li>I am 74 years young.  </li>
            <li>I was contacted by InstaNatural to try out some of their natural beauty products.</li>
            <li>It protects my hair from any heat damage I may do to it as well as make it shiny, soft and frizz</li>
            <li>It protects my hair from any heat damage I may do to it as well as make it shiny, soft and frizz</li>
            <li>If you are extremely sensitive you may not like it.</li>
            <li>but it is all natural</li>
            <li>I think most of the negative comments in regards of the product leaving hair too oily come from 1st-time buyers who might not know how to use  argan oil.</li>
            <li>Natural.  </li>
            <li>My face is sensitive and prone to acne and this product does not break me out.</li>
            <li>are so soft and they snap</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to buy my second bottle now</li>
            <li>After applying the argan oil, my skin feels soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really seems to help with the itching and discomfort… even throughout the following day.</li>
            <li>It leaves skin really soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair...</li>
            <li>I was done with all of that and wanted to go natural.</li>
            <li>I just needed something that would help me manage the texture of my hair and bring out my natural waves and this product is it.</li>
            <li>It is dispensed through a pump as well which I much prefer over the standard dropper method.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural way to give hair nutrition.</li>
            <li>I used this after I applied the Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>oil is completely diluted that it wont help your skin.</li>
            <li>I can use it on my face without it burning my eyes, and it makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and supple my hands</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li>also use it to get soft shiny hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft not frizzy anymore.</li>
            <li>But I do use it on her hair a lot and don&#x27;t have any complaints so far.</li>
            <li>The fragrence took some getting use to, but I am sensitive to scents.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin silky soft, moisturizes my hair and leaves it shiny.</li>
            <li>So far no adverse reactions to the product.  </li>
            <li>When it dries my hair feels lush and there is no frizz to be seen.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it in the mornings, I use it at nights after my Retinol cream (I allow the retinol cream to absorb completely before applying this oil).</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>I have been trying it for nearly five days.</li>
            <li>It absorbs within 3 to 5 minutes and my face feels soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li>A BOTTLE DIRECT.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anybody who is trying to keep their hair under control and who wants their hair to shine and come to life.</li>
            <li>And I also got to keep the old bottle.</li>
            <li>I purchased Argan oil in hopes of abating my wrinkles, if only for a few more years.</li>
            <li>I have been using this argan oil consistently since I first ordered it a few weeks ago</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, about five to ten minutes later, it had completely absorbed into my skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;They may not be a sham, but I don&#x27;t trust their products, and something is most definitely fishy about their product line.</li>
            <li>have only been using it a few days, but my skin seems to have that healthy glow</li>
            <li>Most of the time you only need a few drops.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oil wasn&#x27;t as effective as I would have hoped given the price (a bit thin and &#x27;watery&#x27;</li>
            <li>If you are going to invest in a good quality argan oil, then you will not be steered wrong with this product.</li>
            <li>thick better for body</li>
            <li>Frankly, it makes my face feel every bit as good as some of the expensive Estee Lauder moisturizers I&#x27;ve used for years.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a sturdy thick glass bottle and has a handy spray pump dispenser, that way you only use what you need.</li>
            <li>I have used expensive argan oil and this stuff is just as good but fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>It seems like a nice oil, just not for my (white girl, medium thick) hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is less frizzy, super soft, and shinier!</li>
            <li>I also apply just a tiny (TINY) bit in the morning before putting on my makeup, and that seems to soak right up.   </li>
            <li>He responded right back to me that he would send another one which I got two days later.  </li>
            <li>only down side I&#x27;ve encountered is that Insta Natural&#x27;s Argan Oil doesn&#x27;t absorb very quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick tip: just put 2 drops max in your palm, rub hands together a few seconds to warm it up, apply only to ends and sparingly mid-length (wet hair or dry)</li>
            <li>Very nice personal touch from a company that I feel truly stands behind their products!</li>
            <li>I have some dry elbows from the winter dryness and when I first opened the argan oil to smell it and check it out</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see much of a difference between this brand and other brands of Argan Oils.</li>
            <li>It reduced my dry scalp dramatically after the first usage.</li>
            <li>comes as said, this is my first Argon oil purchase as i am growing my hair out and my scalp gets dry.</li>
            <li>Then add about half a dropper full on my hands and rub them together.</li>
            <li>so little is used each time thanks to the neat pump dispenser, even after weeks of testing, the 120ml bottle is still ¾ full so it will last for ages.</li>
            <li>, pat myself dry but leave it to sit on my lower legs while they dry and voila, smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>Used it on my Moms super extra dry hair.</li>
            <li>but I also have a bottle on hand for my foster dogs with dry skin problems, in particular a papillon with allergies and an older chihuahua.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For facial use, I like to use this Argan Oil on super dry spots, which has been a godsend this winter.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t realize how much 4 ounces really is, but this bottle is going to last a long time</li>
            <li>My hair is damaged from over coloring and styling....and adding this before I flat iron is really making a difference in the text and sheen of my hair.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and the product has instructions on the label saying how many drops you should use for everything.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Fast Absorbing &amp; Long Lasting:</li>
            <li>Even though I didn&#x27;t like the smell of the other brand, the results were worth the smell.  </li>
            <li>Went from blotchy red areas and dark patches on my face to an unbelievably smooth, extremely soft, hydrated even-toned skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Due to being long, my hair splits easily and always tangled at the split ends.</li>
            <li>However the effect died down the 2nd day but it takes much longer for it to be absorbed.</li>
            <li>Most products that intend to add body actually do the opposite by weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m undecided if it was good or bad, but it was just slight, so I&#x27;ll be ok.  </li>
            <li>(not really sure since theres always a fine line between glowy and oily but lets go with glowy).</li>
            <li>I use it mainly on my face and what is left on my fingertips is rubbed into my cuticles.</li>
            <li>and now my face is back to normal and soft.</li>
            <li>:) I now use argan oil in my body wash, in my coconut oil as a moisturizer, and alone in my hair--a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>This is my first experience using it &amp; only takes a tiny bit to do the job.</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle in December 2014 and just recently bought a second bottle (even though I still had about 1/4 bottle left).When using just a 4 drops/pumps a day for my hair, face and hands</li>
            <li>My first experience with argan oil was a different brand and this was my second.  </li>
            <li>When I put a drop of Josie Maran next to a drop of this, they smelt, felt, and looked EXACTLY the same.</li>
            <li>A small bottle will easily last you more than a year.</li>
            <li>Argan oil in general has really helped to balance out my face and help my acne chill out, as well as making my face feel softer overall.  </li>
            <li>and I use it on almost my entire body, mainly my hair, legs and feet.</li>
            <li>hair is typically very dry and frizzy, but it&#x27;s also very fine and think so I have a hard time finding products that help moisturize and smooth my hair without weighing it down or making it look oily.</li>
            <li>For hair I have very thick n dry hair: it&#x27;s done some good for it</li>
            <li>It goes right on without the heavyweight of other oils.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality product that should be part of your daily routine.</li>
            <li>Did lot&#x27;s of research prior to purchasing argan oil and must say this product fills all of the requirements of a high quality oil.</li>
            <li>There is a slight odor, but it is not unpleasant to me and it is gone before I&#x27;ve finished rubbing the oil in.   </li>
            <li>My only concern is that there is a distinct smell to pure argan oil that was missing from this.</li>
            <li>Liked using on my hair but had to be careful to use only a little.  </li>
            <li>(only tried it once to mostly dry hair), so this is worth another</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and the fact that I&#x27;m using an organic oil on my body&#x27;s largest organ, makes me feel confident that I&#x27;m not putting dangerous chemicals into me.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a large bottle and it goes a long way!</li>
            <li>either straight or mixed with other products.....huge, positive difference.  </li>
            <li>And the bottle is huge compared to what you usually get.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time because you don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast on skin and the skin stay moisturized for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>oil comes in a cobalt glass bottle with a long glass dropper which makes application very convenient.  </li>
            <li>it is too small to fit on the bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using lotion on my hands, but it didn&#x27;t really work long term...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I have to say this oil is fantastic.</li>
            <li>but this wasn&#x27;t very appealing unfortunately.</li>
            <li>i really enjoy using it and added it to my everyday routine !</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and I usually forget I even put it on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using for a few days but really like the way it is quickly absorbed and leaves no greasy residue.</li>
            <li>, but not least, sometimes facial wash just does not get all of the eye make-up!</li>
            <li>After the first day of applying the oil to the rough patches, my skin was a lot softer.</li>
            <li>Exactly what expected.</li>
            <li>As a hair treatment I left it on my hair fifteen minutes before washing and washed my hair like normal.</li>
            <li>I mix this with my normal facial cleanser and shampoo/conditioner for added moisturization.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a late 50&#x27;s fair skinned guy) and he recommended various lotions that worked but never very well.  </li>
            <li>100% pure, use it for my dry legs and sometimes in my hair.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough, I can truly say that it has replaced every other moisturizer that I used to buy, and I now look for all types of beauty products that contain argan oil in a pure form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;In one of the dry regions of the USA, I really need a moisturizer like argan oil because lotions do not typically work.</li>
            <li>i USE ON MY SKIN AND ON MY HAIR TO CALM DOWN THE FRIZZ.</li>
            <li>instanatural 100% Pure Argan Oilis a multipurpose, and it works on my skin and nails - where I really need it because my cuticles are messy.</li>
            <li>oil itself has a sort of sweet, earthy scent and is pale yellow/ brown in color.</li>
            <li>Both oils were out of their packages, banging around loose in the large box &#x3D; insufficient packing material.</li>
            <li>The convenient pump makes my new Argan Oil habit one that will last a lifetime!</li>
            <li>Since my hair would be way too short if I just cut off the frizzy bits, I just live with it.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because its still fairly new to me</li>
            <li>I hope it will take a couple of months to finish this bottle, but I&#x27;ll definitely order a new one once I run out.</li>
            <li>New hairs are starting to grow in also.</li>
            <li>I regret trying a new salon recently because my hair was over processed.</li>
            <li>For my friends who have dry skin, it really helps keep it moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I use this oil as a moisturizer on damp skin and it has really helped my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>My wife uses this product, and says it works really well for dry and frizzy hair</li>
            <li>It worked very well on dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works really well to keep your heels from getting dry.  </li>
            <li>I have quite dry and damaged hair that could really benefit for argan oil, or so I&#x27;ve heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this really really helps with the dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, this stuff really shines for me when I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely clear with no characteristic aroma.</li>
            <li>Never knew how dry my face really was, until i used argan oil.</li>
            <li>and  I really like this for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I feel this has really helped my dry winter skin on my hands.</li>
            <li>In fact, it was the complete opposite; even-toned, extremely soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>The oil does have a slight odor but the benefits are so worth waiting for the smell to dissipate.</li>
            <li>Simple, organic beauty is possible thanks to InstaNatural.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use no more than 4-5 drops on long hair.</li>
            <li>The nutty scent is mild and goes away a few minutes after I apply it to my skin/face.</li>
            <li>, I now have smooth, soft hair that is not oily,  I have thick shoulder length hair, and I use about 2 pumps.  </li>
            <li>Most skincare products, even when touting natural, have included ingredients that I can&#x27;t pronounce, were made in labs, and are unnecessary.</li>
            <li>The smell is nutty but mild and you don&#x27;t smell it after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Josie Marrans is much nicer argan oil, this one is okay not impressed with the way it smells...</li>
            <li>Although a little goes a long way, I&#x27;m somewhat heavy-handed and probably used much more than necessary.  </li>
            <li>This oil spreads easily and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of problems with split ends right at the crown of my hair and have always had a problem keeping them down.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day and by the second and third day my hair gets super tangled and frizzy but with this oil after the third day my curls are still defined and soft with minor frizz.</li>
            <li>With the exception of hormonal break outs, I no longer get zits and my scars from past zits have lightened significantly.</li>
            <li>But not for face, caused major breakouts and clogged pores.</li>
            <li>If I will ever be in need of other oils I will be absolutely ordering it from here!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different kinds, but the kinds that they offer at places like CVS, Target, and other beauty suppliers often contain other ingredients.</li>
            <li>I mean, you cannot get more personal than this!</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it my hair was extremely frizzy</li>
            <li>purchased the first bottle but due to shipping and handling the content of the oil spilled out.</li>
            <li>My facial skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>One has eczema and he needs no other treatment</li>
            <li>When I first purchased their oil, the bottle opened in the package during delivery and oil leaked inside the box and all over the other products contained in my order.</li>
            <li>and that is a major</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try the other uses as recommended by the other reviewers, and will be back for more.</li>
            <li>No other compensation was received.</li>
            <li>My hair seems more shiny (not greasy), lasts in my hair longer as I usually need to reapply after day 2 or 3 as my ends look dry again.  </li>
            <li>And I do NOT have oily skin--it is sensitive, but normal (neither dry, nor oily, nor with a t-spot).</li>
            <li>color is a clear light canary yellow, and it definitely has an oily consistency, but it isn&#x27;t heavy.</li>
            <li>And, I don&#x27;t have to use near as much as I did from the  other brand.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair feel super soft and I only apply a few drops of it after I shower..</li>
            <li>not people this stuff takes my poor dry hair and makes it so nice and soft</li>
            <li>More than a few other oils.</li>
            <li>When I started to apply a few drop of argan oil onto my wet hair, my hair lost has decrease tremendously, leave a gentle feeling on my scalp every time I brush them.</li>
            <li>It is the rarest and most expensive oil on earth and is used mainly to moisturise hair, skin, nails, face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works well and absorbs quickly if your skin is slightly damp before applying or if you add the oil to your regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s also a very good moisturizer or a base before you put on your make up.</li>
            <li>The smell is very mild and is either not lasting or not strong enough to make my skin smell this way when I use it.</li>
            <li>First of all, the quality of the argan oil is not right.</li>
            <li>Then I add a little more to the very ends and finish by drying my hands on the surface of my thick hair.  </li>
            <li>In a couple of weeks it had transformed my greying, dry wild hair into manageable &amp; soft!  </li>
            <li>I use it as part of my regimen for dealing with my insanely thick, curly hair and it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>The combination gave me silky smooth legs for at least a week!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since put a couple of pumps on my long hair after showering and haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference on my curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Argan Oil is a long lasting moisturizer that is gentle and can be used anywhere.  </li>
            <li>what&#x27;s different in it, but I have clear skin, never had acne or breakouts</li>
            <li>Long lasting and very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li>Definitely the freshest argan oil I&#x27;ve used, (another brand had an &#x27;old&#x27; odor</li>
            <li>I was surprised with the quality of this argan oil given its low price point.</li>
            <li>I also use it at night after I wash my face, it helped with a tiny, old scar I had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 32 years old, and am starting to show some winkles/aging, etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes my skin soft, you do need to reapply several times during the day.</li>
            <li>I ask used it on my skin and the oil left my skin soft with a glow.</li>
            <li>After a lot of researching different companies, I decided to go with Insta Natural.</li>
            <li>Use daily and it leaves my skin soft and silky and has no odor.  </li>
            <li>The next day my hair feels so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>You only need a drop of two for your hair to make it look shiny and feel soft.</li>
            <li>Since the smell is barely there, it doesn&#x27;t leave any type of odor.</li>
            <li>It makes his hair soft and we can actually run a comb through it.  </li>
            <li>those two only as&lt;br /&gt;it works so well on my natural hair and hands.</li>
            <li>Thus far, I&#x27;ve only used this product as a moisturizer for my hands and nails, but my plan is to eventually treat my hair with it.</li>
            <li>It has left my hair moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>Apparently it&#x27;s a miracle solution to all your hair, skin, nail, and grooming problems?</li>
            <li>Surprised at how big the bottle is!</li>
            <li>I have also applied on my hair before a shower and that left my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>You are far too generous and this could last me until the day I die.  </li>
            <li>My mom (Asian) is in her early 60&#x27;s</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m honestly surprised it started making you look abit younger and gives your face the shine it needs!</li>
            <li>I use this oil as my night cream and my skin feels soft next day  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only used it on my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I am constantly being told I look like my 20 year old daughters sister............</li>
            <li>I especially like its lack of odor, which helps anyone who is sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li>Another thing that surprised me was the total lack of smell in this oil.</li>
            <li>Not much else to say really</li>
            <li>I am 70 years young and on a regular basis</li>
            <li>It also has natural anti-aging properties - the Moroccan peasant women use it as such.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the only Argan oil I have tried so far..</li>
            <li>Perhaps I used too much or it should be applied to wet hair</li>
            <li>I only need about two drops on the ends of my hair to help my hair feel soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>The only thing that surprised me is the smell.  </li>
            <li>It does not have much smell, which is as I expected.</li>
            <li>So far I have been using it for about a couple of weeks only</li>
            <li>It actually works on old, sun damaged skin.</li>
            <li>Try and find this price for 100% natural argon oil at the big beauty and cosmetic companies -- you can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>It has given my hair a big boost in moisture and made it feel so soft</li>
            <li>Two products which are currently gaining favor among natural skin care enthusiasts are rosehip oil and argan oil.</li>
            <li>This is truly My secret beauty weapon:)</li>
            <li>But, after a few minutes, the oil sheen dissipates and the oil is absorbed.</li>
            <li>The scent disappears after the oil is absorbed (within a few minutes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>ladies don&#x27;t waste your money if its not cold pressed..</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way -- purchased many for dry skin</li>
            <li>Even though it was thicker than other oils I have tried, it disappeared quickly into my dry winter skin, leaving it with renewed glow.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to those with dry skin or hair.  </li>
            <li>If you want a good makeup remover that won&#x27;t stink, sting or dry out the skin, try a few drops of this on a cotton pad before washing the face as usual.</li>
            <li>hair goes through a lot - from chemical straightening, to coloring and high temperature appliances such as blow dryers and flat irons.</li>
            <li>It is multi purpose and moisturizing just like other brands in a large bottle.</li>
            <li>Try it, it is natural and if you like it half as much as I do, you will be hooked.</li>
            <li>In any case, it&#x27;s basically spotty areas somewhere in your body that can get bumpy and dry, and when they really feel like acting up they&#x27;ll throw in some itching sensation.</li>
            <li>- Use it on either wet or dry hair, reduces frizziness, but useful for all hair types as it adds shine without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
            <li>It works well, but it doesn&#x27;t go on my thick, curly hair as easily as the product did, so I end up using several pumps of this oil as a hair serum.</li>
            <li>I simply chalked it up to an individual intolerance at the time as I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I put a few drops in (right in the problem areas)</li>
            <li>It rubbed right in and didn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I have skin that transitioning from normal to slightly dry.</li>
            <li>Many other argan oils I have used are much more expensive for less oil.</li>
            <li>The oil slightly irritated my skin when I first it on, making my face itch.</li>
            <li>Instanatural Argan oil is not as clear and is a little thicker than JM brand but absorbs into the skin the exact same way.</li>
            <li>First of all I seriously doubt if this is real argon oil or just some chemical in form of oil.</li>
            <li>a sidebar would be, that I had a very stressful day yesterday, so when this happens, I get super dry, itchy patches on my skin, usually a leg!  </li>
            <li>smell shows only how pure and unprocessed this Argan Oil is.</li>
            <li>The oil it was very stick and didn&#x27;t blend like the other argan oils</li>
            <li>I found this oil much thinner than other oil brands I had purchased and it did not soak into my skin as well.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried it much on skin and other areas yet.  </li>
            <li>My hair was much softer and smoother than when I use other products.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s true that when using Argan Oil, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>its also a nice size and only a few drops in your hair that you leave in for about 20 mins than shampoo as usual</li>
            <li>It hardly has any scent, which I personally find really important when picking skincare or beauty products.</li>
            <li>You have to be very careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li>My new miracle go-to oil for burns, dry skin and combination skin.</li>
            <li>I live in a desert climate and dry skin is a problem.</li>
            <li>and it holds all the moisture in since it is so dry where i live.  </li>
            <li>I used the other brand on the other side of my face and this insta natural on the right side of my face.</li>
            <li>While this oil is fine as a lubricant, it is not good as a moisturizer because it doesn&#x27;t absorb and stays on the surface all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, this is not a miracle oil, I&#x27;ve not seen a dramatic reduction in lines or wrinkles as I was expecting, but that is ok</li>
            <li>I use jojoba oil to massage face and neck but Argan oil is too sticky that I am afraid may result in too much pressure too skin if used as massage oil as you have to apply a lot more</li>
            <li>I have really brittle curly hair and the oil leaves it soft and manageable with out having to use harsh chemicals</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the product for long.. but can comment that the service was very responsive to rectify a minor problem.</li>
            <li>She said that the oil should smell similar to olive oil and not a cow&#x27;s ass</li>
            <li>I am currently using 5 insta natural products daily</li>
            <li>My wife has been using the Insta Natural Argan Oil Hair Treatment and Elixir for the last several weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this product for a short time but it makes my skin feel soft and supple with no greasy feeling whatsoever.</li>
            <li>My 65 year old skin, always prone to blemishes, simply soaks up the argan oil and looks terrific.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to exfoliate as often because later in the day or even the next morning my skin still feels soft.  </li>
            <li>It has a lovely hint of a fruity scent, very subtle.</li>
            <li>No dry skin for me.</li>
            <li>Smells a bit funky at first, but apparently it&#x27;s supposed to, and the smell fades after a few minutes in your hair anyway.</li>
            <li>If you use more than a few drops, then your hair will appear oily and limp.</li>
            <li>You only need a few drops and it goes on feeling greasy but then once absorbed in skin--</li>
            <li>My hair is sofe, shiny and not dry.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, frizzy hair when I first wash it and blow it dry</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I first heard about argan oil from my hair stylist who was trying to sell me a tiny bottle of Argan oil mixed in with a ton of other junk for an exorbitant price.  </li>
            <li>I used exactly 1 drop and spread it all over my hands and rubbed it into my nail beds a little.</li>
            <li>It does smell different (stronger) from the other 100% pure certified organic argan oils I&#x27;ve used before it.  </li>
            <li>They are usually weak and bend and break easily.  </li>
            <li>After a few purchases of &#x27;argan&#x27; oil, only to find they were &#x27;blends&#x27; or somethign other than argan oil, I was pleasently surprised ot not only get this with a coupon but also to get genuine argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The product itself is ok, but I have very dry skin and was hoping to get some relief by using this oil, unfortunately it didn&#x27;t really help that.</li>
            <li>I tested it on dry and freshly washed, it is not absorbed by my skin as described.</li>
            <li>I have used the oil after a fresh wash, before a blow dry and on an average day just for moisture.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying argan oil and boy was this not a let down!</li>
            <li>Argan oil is a hot product right now in the cosmetics market, and you can find it in shampoos and premium lotions nowadays, and it’s always pretty expensive due to the extensive labor used to extract it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be careful when you use this on your hair, a very little goes a long way, and make sure to just get it on your ends and comb through.</li>
            <li>From a company that I was already a bit leery of, to get something that is almost the polar opposite of the product it purports to be, makes me highly suspicious, and I won&#x27;t take chances with either my skin or hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair, slightly wavy, quite thick but very fine texture.</li>
            <li>I generally use them at night as a deep skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have only used INSTANATURAL ORGANIC ARGAN OIL FOR HAIR, FACE, SKIN, &amp; NAILS on my nails, so I can’t really say if it has any other benefits or works as advertised.</li>
            <li>Everything I have listed above is not only the products that I have tested, but that is my complete daily skin care and hair care regimen.  </li>
            <li>Not long after I received my products from Insta-Natural</li>
            <li>Not sure if it will significantly reduce wrinkles/age spots yet, as I haven&#x27;t been using it that long.</li>
            <li>But I started using this Argan oil a few months ago, and my hair looks so much healthier and fuller!</li>
            <li>It has a funny, olive oil smell, and it&#x27;s too heavy for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I started using couple of drops on my hair face first and have started applying a few drops to my skin and hair as well.</li>
            <li>The product is pure argan oil, and because it absorbs right into your skin there is no greasy feeling left behind.</li>
            <li>I bought this for split end control and it works really good as long as you don&#x27;t put it on your scalp if you have thin hair as it weighs it down and feels greasy.  </li>
            <li>It really helps with dry cuticles and it also helps moisturize dry hair.</li>
            <li>My skin looks younger than my years, has a subtle glow, is smooth and supple, and</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair weighed down at all.  </li>
            <li>It has really made a difference on my forehead, not over night but slow &amp; steady</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t really got a chance to compare it with any other brand out there!</li>
            <li>but my fine hair just turned into a big oily mess that wont style and weighs down my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Within 1-2 days, my dry and red skin returned back to normal.</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t seen any major changes in my skin have only use it for a short time</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand of Argan oil because it&#x27;s certified organic, cold pressed, has a light texture, no smell and IT WORKS!  </li>
            <li>became intrigued by instanatural because of the seller&#x27;s gracious responses to those who reviewed it negatively and also by their in-depth product description, which they obviously took the time to write themselves rather than copy and repeat the generic information available anywhere on the net.</li>
            <li>It is very fast absorbing and leaves a thin shiny layer of oil on your skin after it has been applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells a little bit stronger than what I had been using previously, but the scent evaporates quickly and the oil is lightweight and makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how quickly, with only a little amount, already relieved my dry, cracked hands.</li>
            <li>also noticed that this Argan oil brand doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like some of the other brands I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>Used it just a couple of times so far, but it has already softened my dry spots.</li>
            <li>You need less than the size of a dime in your hand and you can do your whole face...</li>
            <li>I have dry, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product because it costs half as much as the bottle I buy from my stylist.  </li>
            <li>Over the winter I developed itchy dry patches of skin on my hands, I put some argan oil on it and it went away after just three applications.</li>
            <li>The dropper&#x27;s opening is larger than what I consider normal so the oil comes out without you having to squeeze it, so be careful.</li>
            <li>There are many uses for this unbelievable product, I will name just a few of my favorites:&lt;br /&gt;•As</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and you won&#x27;t have that sticky icky feeling like some oils will leave behind.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair, which has gotten coarser over the past few years, has taken on a healthy sheen.</li>
            <li>works as a quick hairstyler as well, well for mens hair at least.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really follow up with my wife as it pertains to her health/beauty buys, but yesterday, she pinned me down (literally) and forcefully &#x27;repaired&#x27; the cuticle of my left index finger, and used the Argan oil to moisturize it.</li>
            <li>I have young single men asking me out.</li>
            <li>It has a very slight nutty odor (The same odor as the actual raw kernels when crushed), which should be an indicator that it&#x27;s the real deal, but it dissipates very quickly.</li>
            <li>so how can a small amount be enough for all my hair right?</li>
            <li>Using a little more on the ends and a little less near the scalp.</li>
            <li>A little expensive, but this oil works great on eczema &amp; any dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, my heels felt smooth on the couch, and not in danger of &amp;#34;catching&amp;#34; on the threads in that dry, icky way.</li>
            <li>My face is much softer but the wrinkles show only a slight improvement, I&#x27;m 66 and always looking for a miracle face lift in a bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair which gets frizzy when it&#x27;s dry and after applying this oil it defined my curls and left my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>This is finally a product that gives shine, encourages my natural wave and takes away the dry look from my ends.</li>
            <li>As It Should Be, With A Very Slight Olive-Like Scent Which Is Completely Normal And Natural.</li>
            <li>It is amber-colored as it should be, with a very slight olive-like scent which is completely normal and natural.</li>
            <li>My hair has even grown about half an inch where normally it just breaks off!  </li>
            <li>I do not recommend this product to those with fine hair, because it may leave your hair feeling a little heavy.</li>
            <li>I believe this is also the real stuff as the consistency, color, and slight odor are the same as the type sold in the aforementioned store.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair and it makes it look greasy.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly and definitely helps my skin in this cold weather.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is one of the few times I encountered a brand that bottles pure argan oil.</li>
            <li>As with all 100% pure argan oils, the oil just felt way too heavy upon application.  </li>
            <li>I naturally have curly, frizzy hair that is very dry and tangled.</li>
            <li>Adds shine like no other, and lasts long in my hair</li>
            <li>At first &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34;, the Argan Oil seems a bit greasy, but a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li>This winter I developed a very dry area around my mouth and tried several different products (none of which worked well) before trying this one.  </li>
            <li>My husband likes the quick absorption of the Moroccan Argan Oil without the oily feel or heavy scent of other lotions.</li>
            <li>Like argan oil, rosehip is very high in essential fatty acids.</li>
            <li>love that this replaces a host of other less green products--hair masks, cuticle oils,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how good your product is if there is bad customer service I&#x27;m notbuying again.</li>
            <li>I always read the reviews on products that I try to find out what kinds of things I should look for, both good and bad.</li>

            <li> and I also am using it on my hair with good results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still searching for a good organic argan oil - this one makes me itchy all over and irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m not allergic because I tried Josie Maran&#x27;s sample from Sephora and loved it.</li>
            <li> and I have tried everything to keep them moistened and looking good.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as Josie Maran.</li>
            <li> It feels good and moisturizing and I sometimes mix it with shea butter</li>
            <li> My skin loved it.</li>
            <li> It doesnt smell that good</li>
            <li> Ive tried it on my hair and it feels good.</li>

            <li> and it seems to be a good product</li>
            <li> Good communications from store to customer and their pricing.  </li>
            <li> This is my good to oil for hair and skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a generous amount for a fair price.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t feel good on the skin or hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read good things about benefits of Argan oil and my hairstylist recommended to try it out.</li>

            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> but it was not as good as this.</li>
            <li> It seems to do a good job of moisturizing my hands (which get cracked).</li>
            <li> Good for everything.</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good oil for my skin, but too oily for my hair.</li>

            <li> It is good for your skin.  </li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> It may be good, just not for me.</li>

            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I’d assume that’s a good thing as well.</li>
            <li> that because it is good for all hair types we can use it on our daughters as well as recommending it to anyone/everyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why peple said it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Good buy.  </li>
            <li> Nice seller and great customer service.</li>
            <li> good price and good product.</li>
            <li> The oil comes in a glass bottle, which is always a good indication of quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> Really good stuff.</li>
            <li> Really good hair and skin product</li>
            <li> Good buy for your money.</li>
            <li> Good addition in mixing body butters.</li>
            <li> This product does not contain alcohol and does a good job improving the condition of my strands.</li>
            <li> The Product is good and on Time</li>
            <li> They sent a write up of all the good things about this.</li>
            <li> Since According To The Description, It&#x27;s Good For Everything From Hair To Skin To Nails</li>
            <li> It is so good</li>
            <li> good product I recommended</li>
            <li> This is a good deal for those of you who are considering picking up the Josie Maran argan oil.</li>
            <li> Good stuff...worth trying.</li>
            <li> so I don’t know how good it would be on an oilier complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So by putting the argan oil which is GOOD oil on your skin, you are telling your skin and brain that you have oil now</li>
            <li> Good , i like it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> This can be used on your hair or skin and boy was this one good timing also.  </li>
            <li> and then some on the rest of me and I am moisturized for a good twenty four hours.</li>
            <li> and then some on the rest of me and I am moisturized for a good twenty four hours.</li>
            <li> This product is a good as another Argan oil on QVC in my opinion without the price day.  </li>
            <li> The size and price was good also.</li>
            <li> Good customer service.</li>
            <li> because again i heard it&#x27;s good for your hair</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t good for hair maybe for plants but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an argan oil by garnier fructis on my hair for a while now and loved it</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the price, and also the fact that it&#x27;s USDA certified</li>
            <li> The scent is light and best of all, you can use it by itself.</li>
            <li> I put this on and my skin feels good all day.</li>
            <li> and I would say it has good quality.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Insta-Natural Argan oil for a couple of years and it is the best price for the highest quality organic oil available.</li>
            <li> I loved this oil...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used Argon oil, you know what to expect at a good price.</li>
            <li> I was imagining that this would be a good substitute for face lotion</li>
            <li> About using it on nails/hair/etc... you get the result of a good oil; you do not get access to the fountain of life and your choice of princess crown.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also good for skin and nails</li>
            <li> GOOD PRICE.  </li>
            <li> My feet have not felt this good in years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer as it soaks in niceley.</li>
            <li> This oil works good for my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is a good quality oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soooo excited that I&#x27;ve found a place to order this marvelous product at this price.  </li>

            <li> Best Argan Oil on the market and worth every penny.  </li>

            <li> I am thrilled that I found this product which is unscented since I do not care for scented products.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving this one</li>
            <li> Nice quality and feel (doesn&#x27;t feel like i&#x27;m putting oil on my face).</li>
            <li> Nice product and a nice price.  </li>
            <li> I liked how it did contain some frizz</li>
            <li> This is the kind you want, with Argania Spinosa.</li>
            <li> I liked the effect since my hair looked shiny and a bit tamed afterwards.</li>
            <li> I use it with the Rose Hip Oil.</li>
            <li> I am buying this along with the Rose Hip Oil and giving them to my friends as Christmas presents.</li>
            <li> I bought it for nice skin.  </li>
            <li> I do not know how effective it is to sooth scars, ( he has a cat scratch scar on his cheek)</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my face and fingernails and loving the results--</li>
            <li> It smells nice to me, kind of a musky earthy nutty smell, like a walk in the woods, but if you find the odor offensive, it&#x27;s gone in about 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does a nice job of nourishing and rejuvenating the skin...evens out skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li> My face and hair are loving it.</li>
            <li> Nice product not too greasy.</li>

            <li> I love that this product is organic and therefore good for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it comes in a spray bottle.</li>

            <li> He has a kind of rash on his cheeks.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and would be nice for the skin.  </li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best!!</li>
            <li> I warm the oil on my hand and just pat it on my face.</li>
            <li> Still like a food, but with a hint of fruit or something nice in it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 bottles so I always have it handy.</li>
            <li> smells good; more fruity than nutty.</li>
            <li> and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.</li>
            <li> Gives my skin a nice glow with no toxins and no breakouts.</li>
            <li> My mother had me order it for her after trying some of mine and is loving it as well.</li>
            <li> The bottle has nice pump delivery system.  </li>

            <li> She really liked this product and started recommending it to all her friends.  </li>
            <li> Nice quality Argan oil, I like it.</li>
            <li> Then InstaNatural sent me an email asking me about how much I liked it, and I spoke my mind.</li>
            <li> This absorbs so nicely into skin and hair and balanced me out.</li>
            <li> After applying it, I rub my hands together and the oil spreads nicely</li>
            <li> it made my skin feel nice...</li>
            <li> The product smells kind of nutty, kind of like Tamanu oil if you ever used it</li>
            <li> In the morning I would wake up and my skin kind of looked glowy</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This product has a really nice smell, a bit on the nutty side.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own</li>
            <li> Good oil, use it on my hair and it feels OK</li>
            <li> No smell that I can detect, which is actually kind of nice.</li>
            <li> My skin seemed to look and feel healthier and it gave it a nice glow as well.</li>
            <li> So for me it works wonderfully for hair, not so much for my face.</li>
            <li> Now that it is warm, he climbs twice a week outdoors, and once a week indoors.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the lightweight feel of this.</li>
            <li> I Would Like To Start By Saying That I Really Liked The Bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed my nails are a lot healthier since I started using this product, which is a nice bonus!&lt;br /&gt;Feet</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> Moreover, I noticed how nice it feels on my hands</li>
            <li> Their offer of superior customer service was outstanding.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice smoothing affect on the hair.  </li>
            <li> love this Argan Oil and am delighted that I was sent a sample to try.</li>
            <li> It has a nice nutty scent that isn&#x27;t too empowering.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT WAS DISCOUNTED IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST UNBIASED REVIEW</li>
            <li> Thanks to the generosity of the supplier, we have had the opportunity to test this excellent product.</li>
            <li> but I can honestly see no difference.</li>
            <li> Fast and great service!</li>
            <li> Product arrived a couple days sooner than I anticipated which was nice.</li>
            <li> I love this argan oil and am more than happy to recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is a nice value and generous amount.</li>
            <li> I put a drop or two in my palm, rub hands briskly together to warm the oil, then run it through my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used both the Argan and the Rose hip oil .  </li>
            <li> was sent this product to review, regardless, the review is unbiased and my own opinion.</li>
            <li> However, the condition has subsided greatly since I started using argan oil, which I mix with an odorless body lotion (it claims to be the &amp;#34;ultra healing&amp;#34; type), mostly to be able to spread the oil more</li>
            <li> Yes, I always liked Argan Oil.</li>

            <li> So far I am very happy using in the recipe for moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This argan oil has enabled me to be much more &amp;#34;comfortable in my own skin&amp;#34; during the colder winter months in the northeast US.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with Insta Natural Organic Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li> , rinse off with warm water - and I make sure I don&#x27;t leave the oil on my face -</li>

            <li> Perfect even for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The customer service at Insta Natural was great too!</li>

            <li> I was thrilled and pleased.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son&#x27;s hair and so far so good!!!!</li>
            <li> An excellent value for natural, organic Argan Oil that can be used from head to toe.</li>
            <li> Okay, I am going to be embarrassingly honest here.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural is by far the best company that I have come across selling argan oil.</li>
            <li> I love this amazing product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am very happy with the product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a natural way to moisturize.</li>
            <li> I love how it feels and it absorbs so nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great quality oil and an extremely economical price.</li>
            <li> May not be suitable for wearing under makeup in the morning</li>
            <li> I then notified the company directly and their customer service is excellent!  </li>
            <li> Liked the idea of being able to use on Hair and skin.</li>
            <li> This product looks good and genuine.</li>
            <li> I bought this argon oil for my face, and so far i am really happy with it!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go with smooth, silky hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> VERY HAPPY WITH IT SO FAR.  </li>
            <li> You need a natural non-comodegenic oil, and argan oil is perfect for that.</li>
            <li> works great and has stayed fresh</li>
            <li> The product itself does not have the best smell but that is something I can deal with since it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Always loved Argan oil for my hair makes it shiny and smooth the best so far</li>
            <li> This is wonderful because it is natural, and before I was using hydrocortisone and it did not even work as well as this.</li>
            <li> OK this stuff is so effective.</li>
            <li> This is a great product; it feels so nice on my skin, it&#x27;s light and smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li> but it is still a nice gesture and no doubt of great help to those using argan oil for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pure 100% Argan Oil, and the good stuff, none of that binder and filler stuff!</li>
            <li> Quality seemed great and price was right.</li>
            <li> have very fine curly hair that gets frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this stuff!</li>
            <li> And the smell isn&#x27;t too strong at all!</li>
            <li> It has a delicately sweet scent that is quite pleasant (to me anyway)</li>
            <li> The more I use this the more I love it!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this argan oil!</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s a rare product that&#x27;s good for both, it&#x27;s the perfect solution for older people with acne-prone</li>
            <li> Argan oil is the best for skin of any I&#x27;ve tried, and this brand is silky and pure, and a fabulous deal, price-wise.</li>
            <li> Thanks for asking me to review this - I had heard good things, and you did not disappoint!</li>
            <li> I purchased this specific brand because it looked to be the best value and am super happy with this argan oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product and how quickly I received it!</li>
            <li> I received an great email from the company, prior to delivery, with great tips and suggestions for the Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> Good quality, good price, but the oil has a strong smell, which I&#x27;m not crazy about.  </li>
            <li> and it comes nicely packaged in a very attractive cobalt blue glass bottle with a dropper.</li>
            <li> Even its mildly nutty smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> this by far is my favorite, and the best value I have come across.</li>
            <li> I want the most natural products I can find for my hair and skin and this is perfect for both!</li>
            <li> Although I got this product free to review this is my honest opinion about the product based on my own experience.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It absorbs very easily into the skin and makes your skin more youthful.</li>
            <li> This is great oil and it is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Also, this company has great customer service and has very good pricing compared to some other brands out there.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased argan oil from InstaNatural, and I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant, and if you use it on your skin, it is absorbed very quickly!  </li>
            <li> It is a great moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done!</li>
            <li> since I notice it makes amazing things to my skin, I was brave enough to give it a try on my hair, the result is just as good as all the reviews.</li>
            <li> My daughter, for whom the argan oil was purchased, says it&#x27;s almost as good as Josie Moran – only the smell is not as good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and very affordable!</li>
            <li> the price!&lt;br /&gt;The price is a GREAT value.&lt;br /&gt;The company ships it out FAST!</li>
            <li> I looked online and found a pretty great deal in the product.</li>
            <li> The price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> and I swear I have fewer fine lines on my face because of it!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t leave my face looking greasy and the moisture lasts all day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes my face feel very smooth.  </li>
            <li> Very light and</li>
            <li> My skin has never been softer and it is very smooth.  </li>
            <li> This oil is very light and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> Bought this based on a couple of very thoughtful reviews I read.</li>
            <li> they feel very smooth  </li>
            <li> And, the results  - a smoother, softer skin and a very light sheen in your hair - can be seen and felt seconds after applying it.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and the rest of my body, and it&#x27;s very smooth and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I like this oil and it has a very light smell.</li>
            <li> Very smooth texture.</li>
            <li> Very light smell</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the brand, you get a lot for a good price!</li>
            <li> Great product, love it so much!</li>
            <li> I also use sum on my lips and it worked pretty good, not as  moisturising  as my lip balm but still really nice for a all in one serum.  </li>
            <li> The good thing is this oil absorbs quickly and the odor dissipates.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and it is light and leaves my hair super shiny, also great moisturizer for skin.</li>
            <li> Honestly I can&#x27;t believe how strong and healthy my nails have become in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Thank you InstaNatural for your great quality products at such a friendly price!!!</li>
            <li> It shows that the company stands by their products and that satisfying their customers is very important.  </li>
            <li> This oil is very light and has a lovely fragrance.  </li>
            <li> For me, this has the same great results with a much more pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> Fine bottle and nice flavor.</li>
            <li> like it very much!!!</li>
            <li> This  product is great because it is organic, undiluted and USDA Certified Pure Moroccan Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is great, and being 100 percent pure, you can use it on your skin, unlike Moroccanoil products.</li>
            <li> I use it every night to keep my pregnant belly smooth and stretch mark free!!!</li>
            <li> My skin and hair have seen huge improvements!</li>
            <li> Huge bottle for the price!</li>
            <li> My husband noticed the changes on my face, my skin looks softer and healthy.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I&#x27;ll see more firmness with continued use.&lt;br</li>

            <li> so I bought a Derma Roller &amp; use their Viamin C Toner (love the spray bottle), Retinol, Hyaluric Serum, the Argan Oil &amp; then follow with my moisturizer every night.  </li>
            <li> After using many products from InstaNatural, I know that I don&#x27;t have to do the in depth research anymore.</li>
            <li> ChapStick and lip balm weren&#x27;t making it better.</li>

            <li> I LOVE this product...</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> Although I just purchased this product I have to say in two weeks time my skin and hair looks so much better.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a while, but have not seen outstanding results.</li>
            <li> more hair frizz..</li>
            <li> my hair is softer and looks healthy...</li>
            <li> I am hoping this will keep more from showing up.  </li>
            <li> but I think this works better.</li>
            <li> Plus, I really love that this oil comes with a pump bottle</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything until now.</li>

            <li> I love InstaNatural products and this one is in the running for my favorite one in their line.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s OK for hair and body.</li>
            <li> I really love the quality of this Argan oil.</li>
            <li> While I love argon oil, deceptive description was in play here.</li>
            <li> I think my hair does feel better, though,</li>
            <li> I took the bottle with the pump top with me in my luggage when I went traveling</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even smell it any more - I mix it with my eye cream, I mix it with my face moisturizer when I need a bit more &#x27;oomph&#x27;, and I LOVE it at night as the outer most layer of moisture before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li> I use it for a beard tamer and facial moisturizer, both of which are excellent applications.</li>

            <li> :)</li>
            <li> The dropper is a plus since I can control the amount more than when using a pump or the pour method.</li>
            <li> :) Plus, it worked well on my elbows and knees since these are my &amp;#34;problem areas&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> also tried it on my nails and hands and was glad that my nails appeared better after rubbing the Argan Oil on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> dispenser and I like that much better than the dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I was looking for 100% Argan Oil to get more benefits out of it.  </li>
            <li> Yes quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> The turgor and texture are definitely better.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it on hair so much but face and nails have been great.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>

            <li> I have used Argan oil for many years now for my hair because I use a Keratin process to straighten it.</li>

            <li> My hair feels a lot better since I have been using it.  </li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Argan oil supposedly has many benifits</li>
            <li> mostly</li>
            <li> but I make sure there is nothing else added to the oil.</li>
            <li> I use their Vitamin C serum and the Rosehip Serum and love those too.  </li>
            <li> immediately I have enjoyed softer, more supple skin on my face, and my hands as well.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks more plumped.</li>
            <li> and I simply love the results I am already witnessing.</li>

            <li> don&#x27;t know where I read about argan oil, but I do know it was in one of the many websites about dermatological conditions that spoke about VDN.</li>

            <li> was given this product free for a honest  review</li>
            <li> is one of my favorite.</li>
            <li> is just perfect, the bottle comes with its cap, it can&#x27;t leaks during transportation, and with an extra treatment pump, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> do love it for my hair</li>
            <li> It also wears well for day use under makeup, though I prefer to use a day moisturizer that has SPF (though that realistically could be worn on top of the argan oil).</li>

            <li> Love the fact that this is organic.</li>

            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> but this is so much better because I don&#x27;t have a coating on my nails that will peal off and chip away.  </li>

            <li> for its supposed miracles... one can often read that this is practically magic</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like it on your face, and it doesn&#x27;t perform magic tricks for your nails or hair,</li>
            <li> I am actually able to apply my make up on over this oil.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> and I rub it in for it to absorb better then apply the remainder to the rest of my hair and brush it out.</li>
            <li> I love it and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Update: Still love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I never knew one product can have so many uses.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many products for dry skin and Aryan oil is the best I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast shipping, thanks!</li>
            <li> No fragrance, so I add my own essential oils---and create beautiful hair and body oil.</li>
            <li> I loved that this product was 100% argan oil (most products list argan oil as one -- and not the first - ingredient).  </li>
            <li> I decided to try and look after more than 25 types of this precious oil I decided to buy the Natural Insta for its excellent description and to my good fortune I was not wrong because I&#x27;ve had extraordinary results ....</li>
            <li> Great high quality produt.</li>

            <li> Large bottle and 100% pure for an amazing price!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the argan oil, it is a great facial night cream/ oil for me and all natural without chemicals</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my fair share of sunburns because I&#x27;m pasty, this was a real help!</li>
            <li> We will definitely be long time customers of this incredible product!!!</li>
            <li> I wake up to a beautiful hydrated soft glowy complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives my hair a beautiful shine and brings out my naturally wavy texture.</li>
            <li> I was quite interested to try this oil, since according to the description, it is good for everything from hair to skin to nails to -- increasing one&#x27;s intelligence?</li>
            <li> So this is actually pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Pretty soon I will try again and reorder, I could tell that this Argan oil is of good quality by the texture..</li>
            <li> Moreover, the product came packaged beautifully and looked professional.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful for long hair esp.</li>
            <li> have used \\&quot;olive oil\\&quot; products for years with good results;  I have recently switched to Argan oil products; Argan oil is a much lighter product to use with wonderful result.  </li>
            <li> It smells wonderful, kind of a light olive-y scent, and it sinks luxuriously into my skin.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper and great for hair, split ends and fine lines.</li>
            <li> the damaged area that I treated with Argan oil was SIGNIFICANTLY healthier!</li>
            <li> Well, once I saw that this could be used on your hair, I was so excited!</li>
            <li> I am so excited about Instanatural products!</li>
            <li> has faded significantly!</li>
            <li> It’s been hugely helpful – not only does it help soothe the dryness, it does an excellent job of helping heal the cracks at my fingertips.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge for the price and is such an awesome bargain!</li>
            <li> As a bonus, when I&#x27;ve had questions, I&#x27;ve received quick, courteous answers.</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil is excellent, I use it after washing my hair and when it is dry.</li>
            <li> It settles quickly and leaves your skin nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry skin and sun-damaged skin.</li>
            <li> Best oil for dry hair...</li>
            <li> and I swear this is the best product for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Love the easy spray bottle.</li>
            <li> (it washes out of her hair much more easily than baby oil).  </li>
            <li> I like this more for my nails than anything and the dropper makes for easy precision targeting of my cuticles when I want to moisturize them.</li>
            <li> And Makes It More Easy To Use.</li>
            <li> Let me make sure to note though, I am a bit hyper-sensitive to smells, and have an easy to trigger gag reflex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Argan oil is wonderful on my skin and cures the dry and ichy skin.</li>
            <li> I liked me, so I was not expecting this super</li>
            <li> My nails are actually strong and healthy with nothing on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked mine before, but it&#x27;s nowhere near as good as this one.</li>
            <li> I received a genuine email from the FOUNDER OF THE COMPANY to make sure everything worked out for me, if they could help in any way, if I received my package, and if I enjoyed the product.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have found Argan oil and especially the organic kind.  </li>
            <li> I Appreciated the fast shipping and am very happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I really like the dropper because it dispenses the perfect amount, so I don&#x27;t end up with too much.</li>
            <li> my skin is very soft, moisturizer, and looks great.</li>
            <li> The people at InstaNatural are delivering wonderful high quality and fresh oils with fantastic customer service.</li>
            <li> Since this has been the best for my hair (albeit among a limited number of alternatives)</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I experienced a mild discomfort.</li>
            <li> my husband said best product for dry skin!</li>
            <li> but I am delighted that I have found this organic 100% pure argan oil..</li>
            <li> This is a great oil, right color, right smell</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a good thing, but it certainly does the job of moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good quilty and large bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a really good deal as you get a large size for the price.  </li>

            <li> Insta Natural 100% Pure Argan Oil from Morocco is the perfect product for skin and hair.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not here on the planet to make someone else rich, no matter how cute they are.  </li>
            <li> Other than that this oil is really great!</li>
            <li> I got compliments from the first day I used it, on how healthy my hair looked!</li>
            <li> COOL!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Argan oil has so many great uses, it is pretty much an all-purpose oil.</li>
            <li> I was originally intrigued by the affordability of the product, how it&#x27;s organic, and fully potent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my cuticles, hair, face and other body parts with excellent results.</li>
            <li> I will continue buying their other wonderful products ...</li>
            <li> How cool!</li>
            <li> Using it right after I get out of the shower, when skin is still damp, it creates a lovely sheen on the skin and also makes my feel very smooth.  </li>
            <li> It has a funky smell, but it is very mild.</li>
            <li> Spray bottle is sooo easy to apply the oil...love it.</li>
            <li> The smell also goes away very quickly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t spread easily.</li>
            <li> but I would admit that it actually works great and leaves my skin looking healthy.</li>
            <li> The hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy and it is easy to comb.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly and does not smell.</li>
            <li> this daily to your hair for great shine and healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li> This makes it so easy to use on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I find it to be oily and doesn&#x27;t absorb easily.</li>
            <li> lightweight and easy to apply all over.  </li>
            <li> , I love that it&#x27;s great for the face, dry skin, cuticles, hair ends, and I love mixing it in with my hair conditioners, leave ins, masks</li>
            <li> The smell is very mild.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to over-do which brings on the greasy look.</li>
            <li> But the scent does fade very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Good Product, great value, useful for dry skin, hair and nails</li>
            <li> Its really easy to use</li>
            <li> The oil has a nice smooth texture when spread on the skin and is absorbed very quickly and is non-greasy but silky to the touch.  </li>
            <li> It dries very quickly and does not feel sticky.</li>
            <li> Brown pump bottle - so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice light golden color as I would expect argan oil to.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s great on my dry skin and hair, and the big bottle is perfect if you&#x27;re sharing with someone else!</li>
            <li> It has such great benefits with so many benefical uses.</li>
            <li> I could already feel the softness and it was easy for my fingers to run through my hair.</li>
            <li> Great oil&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil has always been a favorite of mine for a facial moisturizer  - it does wonders for the complexion</li>
            <li> This produt is great for so many things like acne, dry scalp, split ends, frizzy hair, stretch marks, &amp; more.</li>
            <li> in addition, it has no perfume in it and the smell is strong.</li>
            <li> Came nicely packaged, in good shape with both a solid cap And a dispenser cap.</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell that I don&#x27;t like smelling on my face all day.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural&#x27;s Organic Argan Oil does not have a strong smell and that&#x27;s why I like this one</li>
            <li> this particular oil is that it is good on softening</li>
            <li> When you apply the oil to your hair, you can smell the strong nutty scent.</li>
            <li> Nails were strong and longer than ever.</li>
            <li> It can drip, so remove excess from dropper before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance: there are no added ingredients and therefore you smell the argan which does not have a strong smell.</li>
            <li> This brand of face oil was highly recommended and fairly priced, so I thought I would try it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is also a nice size and good value for money, this oil can be pretty pricey but this particular brand is quite reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One recommendation: offer special price for two or more bottles.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase---Have been using on my face, hair and nails and find it very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> It has also lessened the appearance of my scars on my face which is pretty amazing as I have some acne</li>
            <li> This is pretty amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> The oil has a bit of a nutty scent to it, which I really like.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with all of the InstaNatural products I have had the pleasure of trying out and reviewing.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this at full price :).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty nice stuff</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for another argan oil, which contained more synthetic ingredients than true argan oil.</li>
            <li> I did some research and purchased my first bottle and am thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is nice, the oil works exactly like my 43.00 a bottle Morroccan oil.</li>
            <li> I received a prompt reply from a really sweet and efficient sales associate letting me know that another bottle was on its way free of charge!</li>
            <li> had really wanted to love this oil, as I&#x27;ve heard such wonderful things about it.  </li>
            <li> The thing I love most about it is that it&#x27;s 100% pure argan oil!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in many many products you can buy, but this is pure organic Argan Oil!</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional price for such an amazing multi-use beauty tool.  </li>
            <li> This one is hands down the best yet.</li>
            <li> This is very good for dry and itching skin.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil has so many great uses, its great to have pure oil in such a large quantity.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, best organ oil by far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also using this for my baby tortoises, their shells are also healthy, thanks to this! :)</li>
            <li> , I have fine lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks so and it seems to soften the fine lines.</li>
            <li> am using on my face for fine lines because I read Mireille Guilliano&#x27;s book &amp;#34</li>
            <li> Less is best when it comes to argan oil.  </li>
            <li> A couple drops does just fine for my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something to change fine lines...</li>
            <li> I ordered it anyway because I wanted an organic leave in conditioning oil for my waist length-baby fine</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pretty sure this is the real deal, will be purchasing again, IF I RUN OUT! :)</li>
            <li> The oil quality itself is fine though.  </li>
            <li> but the smell does seem to dissipate after a while, and for overnight use, etc., it should be fine.  </li>
            <li> Even the fine wrinkles around my eyes are softer.  </li>
            <li> and although fine for my body, it made my face break out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine all-purpose</li>
            <li> Great service fast shipping thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning the many ways that argan oil can be used, but so far I&#x27;m very glad I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> think I&#x27;ll be ideal for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> The oil is fine.</li>
            <li> But overall, I am extremely satisfied with my product and the amazing customer service received!</li>

            <li> I love the way it quickly absorbs into the skin..</li>
            <li> The oil dries fairly quickly and leaves your skin with a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m pregnant again, I plan to use it as a moisturizer and avoid all the chemicals that are in most lotions.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and soon afterward, if not immediately, the area looks and feels softer and more moisturized.</li>
            <li> Super pleased - skin feels so refreshed.  </li>

            <li> Light scent, great for cuticles, dry skin, hair, makeup removing, love it</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, but the water where I&#x27;m at is absoluetly filled with chlorine and chemicals and dries my hair to straw</li>
            <li> It feels wonderful and makes your skin so soft and absorbs quickly if you don&#x27;t apply too much.  </li>
            <li> My dry skin is always a struggle in winter, and argan oil does a wonderful job of penetrating the top layers of my skin and bringing much needed moisture and relief.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It definitely made my skin very smooth, and my hair shiny and in good repair.</li>

            <li> This Argan Oil is fantastic, and the price is even better.&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing this as &#x27;stocking stuffers&#x27; for my girlfriends this year.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Oh so smooth my hands felt as for the rest  of  All of the oil</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of Instanatural Argan oil to try.</li>
            <li> Not only is ths product great</li>
            <li> Silky, smooth, shiny, not oily...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve primarily just used this on my hands.</li>
            <li> I just discovered Argan Oil; I had purchased a much more expensive brand, and was happy with it, but my checkbook wasn&#x27;t so happy</li>
            <li> The skin does feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
            <li> The aroma is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic company.</li>
            <li> It is so light, the skin and hair absorve</li>
            <li> it is light ...</li>
            <li> Great value for the money, this bottle will last for months! A+++</li>
            <li> I am using it primarily on my face as a moisturizer, and still experimenting with the correct amount to use.  </li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and youthful.</li>
            <li> so impressed that I may well buy some more when it eventually runs out rather than buying a non-organic equivalent; given that the product is absorbed into the skin, it makes sense to avoid absorbing pesticides at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> It smells awesome and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for several weeks and now getting comments on how great my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I got this free to try.</li>
            <li> I tried lotions and everything else I could think of, then this fantastic oil showed up.  </li>
            <li> This was fantastic oil.  </li>
            <li> It definitely filled in any lines and scars that I had.</li>
            <li> Additives irritate acne so this is perfect - rub a few drops over fingertips and massage into face.</li>
            <li> but i enjoy its multipurpose appeal</li>
            <li> Great product especially for the price.</li>
            <li> received a free copy of this product courtesy of the company, for the purpose of review.</li>
            <li> and it just gives skin a velvety smooth feelking.</li>
            <li> This seller emailed me a nice letter with suggested uses for the product &amp; again later to make sure I was completely satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li> totally recommend,  great seller</li>
            <li> This oil is fragrance free and non-comedogenic for the face.</li>
            <li> but great product overall.</li>
            <li> It was packaged extremely securely.</li>
            <li> After shampooing her hair, I put this in and it made it look so shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> Smells earthy and makes my hair and face smooth.</li>
            <li> You can use this on different parts of your body so it is great.  </li>
            <li> The smell ISNT so great but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, smells kinda like olive oil.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so smooth</li>
            <li> to a light feel and light polish.  </li>
            <li> This oil is fabulous.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as smooth as it should of been</li>
            <li> I know what I am credible in reporting issues with skin and hair.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I love argan oil for my hair and I cannot say enough good things about this company.  </li>
            <li> II leaves my ski feeling soft and it gives good shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a satisfied customer, and I anticipate being able to go longer between pedicures thanks to Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> It spreads out better, but can leave you looking like Courtney Love after a 10 day bender if you use too much.</li>
            <li> It is very hydrating and my skin has been feeling more healthy.</li>
            <li> good oil. makes hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I use it daily, and with the reasonable price, I can afford this awesome product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller suggested since I am so sensitive to the smell, using a refined version of the oil might be a good alternative.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> Used on wet hair, it acts as a good conditioner and helps hair to style nicely without frizz.</li>
            <li> The benefit is fabulous looking, healthy feet that always look freshly pedicured.</li>
            <li> Again, preservatives age skin, so argan oil is a perfect all-natural solution, and the price is a lot lower than high end anti-aging products that are often less effective.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, the price is right</li>
            <li> This product is great alone, or combined with other creams for a greater effect.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted! !</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> has a pump that is very useful.</li>
            <li> The instanatural also sent a mail on tips on how to use argan oil which I found to be very useful.</li>
            <li> Very nice packaging and quality overall.</li>
            <li> Very courteous and concerned with my overall satisfaction and experience.  </li>
            <li> Very pure product :)  </li>
            <li> However, I have to admit I have from time to time enjoyed comments about my healthy head of salt and pepper hair as I&#x27;ve gotten older making me look &amp;#34;distinguished.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I recently came across a blog posting which praised argan oil as a wonderful skin moisturizer, particularly for your face.</li>
            <li> The light weight oil absorbs easily and relatively quickly...</li>
            <li> This is a huge bottle  and completely worth the investment!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Organic, cruelty free, preservative and fragrance free...and something must be said about its unique aroma.</li>
            <li> The people at InstaNatural are super nice &amp; helpful, received an email from them shortly after my purchase making sure I&#x27;m satisfied with their product.</li>
            <li> Great way to add a heat protectant before flat ironing and using the hairdryer without chemicals!</li>
            <li> this leaves my skin so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> It is also great for dry, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Luckily it cleaned out easily in the wash.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, it&#x27;s light and absorbed into skin quickly.</li>
            <li> Ordering process was easy and received order quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent size bottle in a nice packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Removes super long-lasting lipsticks easily.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and expected, great product!</li>
            <li> My skin would stay sufficiently moisturized throughout the day which is good since winter heating ravages my skin like no other.  </li>
            <li> other reviewers have noted, it does smell badly at first, kind of like mulch which is not an attractive smell.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite product!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to others as it is effective and affordable.</li>
            <li> They shipped out a new one, which I received intact, and undamaged on that same weekend on Sunday, talk about great customer service!</li>
            <li> It is perfect for my dry hands, and it really soothes my cuticles.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend Instanatural to anyone - their customer service is amazing too!</li>
            <li> I use it daily and the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> And the quantity makes it the perfect size to use for hair, whereas in smaller bottles I never felt there was enough to use on more than my face</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is one of the most gentle, light, fragrance free moisture  giving products I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive InstaNatural Organic Argan Oil for Hair, Face, Skin and Nails.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my hair, too, and originally bought it as a replacement for Moroccanoil Hair Treatment.</li>
            <li> I have been using it as carrier oil with my essential oils and am loving it!  </li>
            <li> Jose Maran may cost more but it is the real deal!</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with it at my first aplication....</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Some oils are good for internal use, some are great for external use like this one.  </li>
            <li> With this value, it isn&#x27;t worth it to try to use anything else!</li>
            <li> I have used this argan oil as a leave in conditioner on my hair, to moisturize my face, as as a full body oil, cuticle conditioner and to smooth knees, elbows and heels.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to write this review because it works so well on my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> I tried argan oil for the first time a couple years ago and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I was SO EXCITED to try out the oil.</li>
            <li> They are giving me the best price at about $23 a bottle for 4oz and there are usually sales on their oils.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product so far.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this oil.  </li>
            <li> Rich in Omega 3 and 9 which helps to prevent hair loss and repairs damaged hair follicles.</li>
            <li> This is the first argan oil I&#x27;ve ever used, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Since I first started using it about a month ago, my cuticles and nails are looking so much better.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fully absorbed!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Concentrate on the areas that are more drying first.</li>
            <li> That is certainly rare these days!</li>
            <li> But yeah if your on the fence whether to go with this brands argan oil compared to the hundreds on argan oils on Amazon, its worth a shot!</li>
            <li> I love to use this wonderful product on different parts of the body such as my face, neck, elbows, hands, nails, knees, feet, scalp, and hair.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this to apply on my stretch mark scars.</li>
            <li> I love Argan oil - this one comes in a bigger bottle than most with a pump top.</li>
            <li> first one in many moons.</li>
            <li> I have been using Insta Natural Argan Oil for two weeks and instantly noticed a change in my nails, a huge change, no splitting, cracking, breaking and the cuticles look great too !  </li>
            <li> I have never used argan oil and was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> After just 3 days, I noticed a significant difference in my skin</li>
            <li> Thanks InstaNatural! :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely enough to make me feel more comfortable in my own skin</li>
            <li> I went nuts and had so much fun!</li>
            <li> Even my kids love this, they apply this before going to bath as hot oil treatment for their hair.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this to use on my face at night</li>
            <li> I love this oil so much!</li>
            <li> I originally bought coconut oil</li>
            <li> I love argan oil, this is the first bottle I buy from this brand</li>
            <li> I love first off that it is organic</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this brand, and must say that I&#x27;m thoroughly pleased.  </li>
            <li> A bit pricey for the amount, but well worth it!</li>
            <li> It has very strong smell when first applied but the smell goes away once absorbed.</li>
            <li> Makest skin soft and there is no scene to it at all, which is a good thing, because I wouldn&#x27;t want to be smelling my own face all day long. :)</li>
            <li> After emailing Instanaturall about this incident they were very pleasant, personal, supportive and understanding of the situation and shipped a new package to me straight away!</li>
            <li> Clean smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for a dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Will probably purchase more in the future in addition to the one I have been using because the price is amazing......</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for dry</li>
            <li> Great product it works well for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is a really great argan oil I use this on my face for winter dry skin also I use some in my hair works well</li>
            <li> It is light and adsorbs quickly into my skin and my husbands scalp.  </li>
            <li> Also it worked great on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This oil absorbs quickly and goes on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li> body absorbs it quickly and leaves a smooth texture.</li>
            <li> Goes on lightly and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dry and fly away and this oil allows me to leave the house not ashamed of my hair.</li>
            <li> I used it over night and woke up with super smooth face and hair.</li>
            <li> It is great for dry heels and skin.</li>
            <li> It has a clean smell.</li>
            <li> It keeps everything clean and sanitary.</li>
            <li> I really love how it is light and yet very moisturizing</li>
            <li> ,Great product really and good customers services will definitely recommend to my friend and will come back for more</li>
            <li> Feels great to put on dry skin.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin so quickly and leaves it silky smooth, with no oily or sticky residue.</li>
            <li> I find that half a dropper of oil is all I need to cover face and neck, and it&#x27;s an ideal moisturizer alone or under makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my dry hair</li>
            <li> This is great for any dry, brittle hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is perhaps the best Argan oil I&#x27;ve tried (I&#x27;ve used 3-4 different brands so far).  </li>
            <li> I applies argan oil couple drops to my clean washed hair.</li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly and the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li> And most importantly, it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li> Made my hair very soft and gave it a nice smell.</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft, smooth and feels better than ever!</li>
            <li> so I was really excited to give it a try and to be true</li>
            <li> Not all oil smells good; this doesn&#x27;t smell horrid, just not lovely (and who doesn&#x27;t like to smell lovely before bed? :).</li>
            <li> light, not unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a couple pumps in my hair after I wash it and as a cuticle oil, but you can apply directly onto the skin or mix with your favorite lotion, too!</li>
            <li> I could go on and on about Insta natural products - LOVE them!  </li>
            <li> Insta Natural is definitely my &amp;#34;Fountain of Youth&amp;#34; I give Insta Natural 5 stars for amazing products and excellent customer service.  </li>
            <li> Thank you InstaNatural for making me so happy about finally having the one and only perfect facial moisturizer I&#x27;ll ever need!</li>
            <li> This argan oil is very light, no fragrance and absorbs fast.  </li>
            <li> but that dissipates right away as does the slickness of the oil, so I guess my skin and hair finds it  easily absorbable.  </li>
            <li> Also a great dry hair conditioner!  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t liked very much even if he is pure and may treat the hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice anything special about it.</li>
            <li> So what makes this product special?</li>
            <li> Nowadays, it seems that every product on the market claims to contain Argan Oil and more often than not probably doesn&#x27;t, so getting a bottle of InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Organic Moroccan Argan Oil was heaven sent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this 100% pure Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I love that its pure and organic with no detrimental ingredients.</li>
            <li> It is a bit potent in scent, but for 100% pure, what do you expect?</li>
            <li> My favorite use of InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Argan Oil was as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> What I love about this is how large the bottle is</li>
            <li> nothing too special.</li>
            <li> it right up!</li>
            <li> She was absolutely right!  </li>
            <li> The remainder goes right on my skin and rubbed into my nails!</li>
            <li> I used it as hand lotion at night and noticed my fingernails got stronger right away!  </li>
            <li> This product is great for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is colourless, relatively runny and has a pleasant mild nutty odour.</li>
            <li> I am SUPER excited to get my hands on it</li>
            <li> I appreciate that because most hair and body products are super strong and I can be real sensitive to some smells.</li>
            <li> My shipment arrived early and the product is amazing.</li>
            <li> It drips pretty much on its own</li>
            <li> I use oils all the time in my lip and skin care products and knew of their amazing ability to help heal and keep things soft.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still trying to get a refund on the full bottle</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the smell is not so good as the rest InstaNatural products.</li>
            <li> (I also understand from reviews as good as a $40 plus bottle in for about the same price</li>
            <li> A good product &amp; no customer service isn&#x27;t the way to go for me when I can get 2X the size for the same product &amp; customer service!  </li>
            <li> but they really didn&#x27;t seem to care which made me not feel confident in their company.  </li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and love that it gets rid of acne.</li>
            <li> See the full review on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Its light and easily absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making such a good quality and affordable product.</li>
            <li> only four  times use all his eczema gone his skin smoother thank you for making really good product</li>
            <li> This oil is such good quality that I am using it on my face as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It has the true smell, feel and color of the true argan oil, since a lot of the oils in the market are diluted..</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and sleek and my cuticles have never looked this nice.</li>
            <li> The true test would be after my shower through.</li>
            <li> Love it so much.</li>
            <li> I most highly recommend that you give them a try!</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about Argan Oil from this company.  </li>
            <li> so make sure not to get to exited and apply too much</li>
            <li> Thanks insta naturals everyone and anyone would be satisfied to have this stuff.</li>
            <li> And I noticed -- much to my surprise -- that my heels looked better.</li>
            <li> also appreciated that the seller made a sincere effort to follow up on my order.  </li>
            <li> also appreciated that the seller made a sincere effort to follow up on my order.  </li>
            <li> It is good especially for Hair, Face.</li>
            <li> I was using a different brand of the argan oil and it was working good.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite it&#x27;s many benefits (there really is a lot)</li>
            <li> the full review on: maegal .</li>
            <li> This was such a good buy-</li>
            <li> Preferably store in really cool place, but not in refrigerator.</li>
            <li> I am also much better off financially and have more free time b/c</li>
            <li> Bigger container than I anticipated, so that&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how good the product is if the outside IS CHEAP-LOOKING.</li>
            <li> It is easily absorbed without leaving my skin greasy and my skin remains  hydrated even after light washing.  </li>
            <li> The oil has the rubberband smell, which tells you it&#x27;s quality argan oil and is a nice, natural smell.  </li>
            <li> and I cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> I am orderning more for them very soon.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T use a full pump, a lot of product comes out.</li>
            <li> I get full use out of this because i also use it on my nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li> I appreciate a company that is ready to go the extra mile to make sure that their customers are happy and is so ready to stand by their products.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you InstaNatural!</li>
            <li> works really well on my hair and skin, love it.</li>
            <li> I make a lot of my own personal care products, such as shampoo and body butter, and it works great in those too.  </li>
            <li> loved it order my second bottle today , it has a nutty smell but it fades after a minute or two.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product for its price.</li>
            <li> I told them sure why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be using this, it&#x27;s going straight in the bin.</li>
            <li> That way you could see better how much oil is coming out.</li>
            <li> Good sized bottle that will last forever.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not expecting miracles, but it is doing nice things for me so far.  </li>
            <li> As good as the Argan oil I bought at a cooperative in Southern Morocco 4 years ago</li>
            <li> I THOUGHT SHE WAS JUST GOING TO BE STUCK WITH HAVING A HEAD FULL OF NAPPY UNTAMABLE HAIR.  </li>
            <li> I am really falling in love with this product.</li>
            <li> The 4 ounce bottle is very generous, and the quality is top shelf.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad i was asked if i wanted to try this thank so much</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not at all sure that this really argan oil.</li>
            <li> Second time buyer of this product and both have been good quality.</li>
            <li> i put it in my face its really nice m hair so soft</li>
            <li> And the top is very helpful</li>
            <li> The youthful gloss from the oil turns straw like dried out long hair into beautiful shiny attractive hair.  </li>
            <li> So far i am loving the results.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended laser surgery, but advised my skin would take a full 2 months before I felt &amp;#34;back to normal&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s really cool that you can use this for your skin AND your hair.  </li>
            <li> There are an overwhelming selection of products available for skin care, therefore it can be very difficult to know which products are best if you want healthy, glowing skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only does it appear that argan oil is a bit of a dermatological cure-all, it is one of the most environmentally friendly products around and is a very important export for Morocco.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only does it appear that argan oil is a bit of a dermatological cure-all, it is one of the most environmentally friendly products around and is a very important export for Morocco.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with another oil I ordered from Instanatural (the pump did not work, the oil was fine), and I was sent a brand new bottle free of charge and very quickly.  </li>
            <li> If the price seems a bit high, just know that you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find the more &#x27;exotic&#x27; oils in such a large bottle at a fair price unless purchasing in bulk and not everyone has the time, money, or storage for that.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, well packaged, and oil is light and easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> I am using this oil on my face, neck, and chest as my daily moisturizer because what I have read indicates it&#x27;s good at treating mild acne.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and is absorbed quickly</li>
            <li> Right now using it for face and really enjoy the way it feels.</li>
            <li> When I first used the oil, back in the beginning of March, it had a very light nutty scent which was nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many of Amazon&#x27;s Argan oils looking for a good substitute for the more expensive JM product that I love and this one is it.  </li>
            <li> It looks good product, I just used few times but it seems high quality and has no smell which is good for me..</li>
            <li> The name argan sounds like magic but in reality good extra virgin oil has the same of better property.</li>
            <li> and this was very gentle on my face, absorbed quickly, and worked great as a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and brittle and this completely smoothes my fly aways!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and does exactly what it promises:  soft, silky, manageable hair and smooth moisturized skin (face and feet).  </li>
            <li> Very good product for my sensitive, rosasea facial skin.</li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly,</li>
            <li> I am pregnant with my fifth baby.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth, and I love the aroma.</li>
            <li> Repairs all the damages my hair has to deal with in transforming to Super Saiyan beyond.</li>
            <li> and it seemed to heal really quickly.  </li>
            <li> Came to my home quick and in one piece.</li>
            <li> The oil absorbs quickly without leaving hair looking greasy.</li>
            <li> Love argon oil but most bottles only have a drip pour.</li>
            <li> I was lucky to get this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li> I feel better using a natural oil as opposed to a chemical filled moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my stretch marks while pregnant</li>
            <li> Sometimes I will mix a drop of my favorite essential oil in it to make it smell better.</li>
            <li> Penetrates quickly too.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a super product</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it has helped my mild acne</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay oily at all, and the mild scent goes away</li>
            <li> The product has a mild order that I don&#x27;t care for but the smell soon goes away.</li>
            <li> The bottle is super durable</li>
            <li> I also used on my son&#x27;s forehead- he is 12 and has mild acne and it cleared it up to a point he doesn&#x27;t fight me to put it on.  </li>
            <li> I use Argan Oil on my face every night,  The oil is quickly absorb into the skin and softens the winkles.  </li>
            <li> try to use it on my arms instead and although it absorbs quickly, it doesn&#x27;t nourish my skin either.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly into your hair without weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product sample.and cuticles, treats mild acne since it has Oleic acid, use it to grill vegetables, add some lemon and use as salad dressing.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> When mixed with essential oils, it makes for a wonderful potion that my skin drinks up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, so I don&#x27;t feel like a grease ball and doesn&#x27;t leave grease marks on my clothing (Almond or Olive oil don&#x27;t seem to absorb as quickly).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But I have started using it all over my body after a shower, so this second bottle will get used up more quickly :)</li>
            <li> The product absorbs quickly and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, you can use up the product fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly into hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I contacted InstaNatural immediately and they quickly sent me another bottle with 2 day shipping.</li>
            <li> I even purchased a bottle for most of my favorite people for Christmas last year.</li>
            <li> The scent is an &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; type scent, not overpowering, but smells natural - it makes me feel great that the product I&#x27;m using is all natural.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I believe the quality of the product is exceptional.</li>
            <li> I used the argan oil for my skin (face and hands) and I was impressed with the moisture that it provided (I only had to use 2 drops to cover my face and hands in the same application) .</li>
            <li> I use it for my beard and it helps tremendously in controlling the frizz (beard hair is a lot thicker and frizzier than head hair</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> it has a heavier consistency and does not absorb as quickly.  </li>
            <li> It has a mild scent that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> The oil absorbs quickly so you can use it just minutes before putting on makeup or clothes.  </li>
            <li> so I purchased InstaNatural argan oil and found it to be useful as a facial moisturizer and good for nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li> The package arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy at all, as you might think an oil would</li>
            <li> I do not like the scent of your product even though you said it would disappear quickly.</li>
            <li> i have tried different argan oil from different companies but this one is the best Argan oil i have ever used in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly into skin without any oily residue or feel.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and leaves no lingering scent to compete with perfume or body mist product.  </li>
            <li> But, the smell does go away quickly</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly which does not leave any staining.</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan oil for years and am pleased to have stumbled upon this particular brand.  </li>
            <li> It has helped my skin tremendously and now my four daughters are using it as well.  </li>
            <li> i just received the bottle today,well packaged,i took a shower and applied in my face and neck ,it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have oil in your face,the skin absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> Are you pregnant,  your glowing etc.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and is not too greasy.</li>
            <li> This has become my argan oil of choice , definitely the best around and terrific value .</li>
            <li> I think many individuals with needs similar to mine would also love this product.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s effect on my super oily acne prone</li>
            <li> Use it everywhere, absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> Absorbs quick.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this product has caused no irritation and has been a light, gentle and effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am one of those highly allergic people and am able to use this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ok with that just because since it is an oil, I didn&#x27;t have high expectations.</li>
            <li> I love this product and highly recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li> Argan oil is highly regarded in the beauty community as one of the most luxurious hair and skin products.</li>
            <li> I use to buy a high end, well known name, Argan Oil from Sephora, that cost 3 times more then this one.</li>
            <li> First, the bottle is huge.</li>
            <li> The best part is that you do not need a lot, and that is coming from a person with a head full of thick hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even great on dark spots and</li>
            <li> The company seems great too, they emailed just to touch base and be sure I received my order and was happy.</li>
            <li> It comes with an eye dropper which is a nice touch since most other brands you have to pour it out and you tend to pour out too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a few drops of this wonderful oil makes my skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I normally use organic coconut oil as lotion but this absorbs and feels better.  </li>
            <li> This is my second purchase from instanatural and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased and would definitely recommend this product to friends and family!</li>
            <li> Great for fading dark marks and healing or &amp;#34;coating&amp;#34; split ends of hairs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lite and fragrance free oil that does exactly what you expect....moisturize....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also good for my nails and hands, as well as my grey color treated hair, concentrating on the ends.</li>
            <li> I contacted Instanatural because I might have received a defective bottle and they were quick to send me a new bottle free of charge!</li>
            <li> Seriously, why pay more!!!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think this argan oil is real or pure.</li>
            <li> My hair is strong, shiny, and vibrant, and that&#x27;s why!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t smell great, but I&#x27;m happy that it has no artificial scent either.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended though and far superior over synthetic emollients.</li>
            <li> The new one arrived with no leak and was absolutely free!</li>
            <li> New favorite n cheaper too.</li>
            <li> Love the new dispenser pump.</li>
            <li> It goes right in, and it has a fresh, clean scent.  </li>
            <li> When you first open the bottle it smells like a plant but the smell goes away for good.</li>
            <li> It transformed my dry toenails and feels so good on my hair and fingernails too.</li>
            <li> I was going to use this for a face moisturizer before applying my make-up, but I&#x27;d likely have to wait a good 10-15 minutes before applying said make-up to let the oil soak in the skin first.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I thought to put oil to skin first after cleansing wasn&#x27;t good idea especially in the morning.</li>
            <li> It gets absorbed quickly to your skin and hair because it doesnt make your hands oily after applying it to your hair.</li>
            <li> I really like and use it a lot more often than when I first tried it.  </li>
            <li> I really like that it has a pump which makes it easy to dispense.  </li>
            <li> Not crazy about the fragrance, but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> The oil has really soften up my nails and they are not tearing as easy as they were.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and beautiful and it finally MOVES!</li>
            <li> The scent quickly disappears once it is absorbed into the skin or hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just received my first bottle of Argan Oil about two weeks ago and so far and am loving it.  </li>
            <li> Argan oil is absorbed quickly and does not have any oily leftovers.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs easily into the skin &amp; controls my straight hair flyaways.</li>
            <li> Overall a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I bought at Tjmax, both pure &amp; organic &amp; they work fine &amp; NO</li>
            <li> Saying that I have very sensitive skin and many allergies, and yet I had no reaction to this at all.</li>
            <li> I use it on my frizzy hair to calm it down, it works great for that.  </li>
            <li> It looks like the packaging changed - I liked the blue bottle a lot and read that it was one of the best for keeping the oil fresh, but as long as it&#x27;s dark, I think it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> There is also no scent, which is a huge positive for me.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural is my favorite brand so far!</li>
            <li> Of all the essential oils and carrier oils I use, this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I use it as a moisturizer after shower and it feels great!Who needs chemical products if it is a better natural alternative!</li>
            <li> Really makes your hair shiney!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m feeling pretty optimistic about the results to come!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Get a better argan oil for a little more!</li>
            <li> I bought this recently and love it!</li>
            <li> I love the all natural argon oil!</li>
            <li> (read some time where some fragrance(s) actually come from and you&#x27;ll be glad they keep it all organic)!</li>
            <li> Overall pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> First of all, packaging on this &amp;#34;liquid gold&amp;#34; is perfection!</li>
            <li> From the first day of using this oil, I noticed that my cuticles were healthier and my nails were stronger!</li>
            <li> This is really saving my hair &amp; skin from the Winter!!</li>
            <li> Multiple uses include hair, skin, nails, body and more!</li>
            <li> and I like it so much!!</li>
            <li> My curly hair is also responding nicely - it&#x27;s curling better with less frizz.</li>
            <li> It is probably one of the best I&#x27;ve use thus far and that includes Jojoba, shea butter, black Jamaican, etc.</li>
            <li> Best results for me so far are by using a pea-sized amount on the bottom half of damp hair.</li>
            <li> and I like to put it on my face, decollete and shoulders at night at wake up in the a.m. with super soft, hydrated and smooth feeling skin!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super nutrient-dense while feeling really light and absorbing immediately.</li>
            <li> but it absorbs very quickly, and leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Interesting complex smell, like a mix of chocolate and olives...hard to describe but pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face, neck and hair, my skin is softer and more radiant, my hair which tends to be dry and frizzy looks and feels a lot better.  </li>
            <li> It is absorbed so easily and fast</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves my nails healthy looking and skin soft.  </li>
            <li> From my own experience, it has not caused any breakouts (I&#x27;ve had quite a while of use--by a different brand at first, bought at Whole Foods for quite a bit more money).</li>
            <li> I received it quickly (in two days), and started using it right away.</li>
            <li> It is the first Argon oil I have used, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands, but I can say that InstaNatural has been just as great as the product they offer.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is so pure and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great for clearing up and moisturizing those little break outs once a month too.</li>
            <li> The result was great, hair looks a little shinny, moisturized and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells a little bit nutty which is great.</li>
            <li> My latest go to favorite for my hair (very dry ends).</li>
            <li> I seriously love these kind of products where you just need one little bottle to spoil your body, face and hair.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure that the pure stuff will be even better for him - especially without any added fragrance!</li>
            <li> Fantastic large size for an Organic Argan Oil --- no one else sells it in such a cost effective fashion</li>
            <li> This argan oil is very sticky,  not as smooth  as you can use it liberally as a massage oil.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> My skin soaked the oil really fast and it literally goes on silky smooth on my skin and feels like &amp;#34;liquid gold.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s also not too oily / greasy like others</li>
            <li> I have used this as a facial moisturizer twice a day and my skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li> I thought it was just hype, but I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and a scar on my leg has been greatly faded.</li>
            <li> Not oily, but smooth and translucent which makes my makeup much easier to apply.  </li>
            <li> It really helps make my hair smooth and helps brighten your complexion.</li>
            <li> but it has a really, really light woody smell that is really neutral.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another great comment I must mention is that the odor disappears after a few minutes of application.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work so great on my winter dried legs.  </li>
            <li> Everyone wants smooth skin, even your feet</li>
            <li> Never have I seen such amazing customer service.</li>
            <li> I can literally walk out with no make up and still feel amazing and going back two years</li>
            <li> Amazing face moisturizer especially for winter!</li>
            <li> It really is an amazing thing these days when something actually works ...</li>
            <li> and I really like the light smell the oil does have.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle makes the price VERY affordable.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wondering what fresh Argan oil should smell like, this is it.</li>
            <li> love using this natural, organic, fresh oil on my skin.</li>
            <li> But it smells so fresh and natural that I love slathering it</li>
            <li> I have healthy hair but the natural curls make them not that manageable...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased argan oil from natural food stores as well, but some seem thicker and have more of an odor.  </li>
            <li> My skin and hair are looking soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s economical too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on application and how it makes my skin so soft and touchable.  </li>
            <li> so far its ok</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not need much!&lt;br /&gt;Has a nutty aroma, golden color.</li>
            <li> Compared to the stuff being sold, for the prices it is totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> but I honestly did NOT like it near as much as my argan.  </li>
            <li> I am used to paying far more.  </li>
            <li> and i have enjoyed it thus far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a product that actually does what it says.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a naturalista in many ways, so of course I pounced on this exciting 100% natural product &amp; couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out for myself.</li>
            <li> hair is natural and my wavy locks have enjoyed the nourishment of this product for a month now.</li>
            <li> I have tried many and this is the beast so far.</li>
            <li> Use the Argan oil daily and have no complaints; my skin is soft and happy.  </li>
            <li> I do feel like I have to wash my hair more frequently</li>
            <li> This Argan Oil not only makes my hair smooth which I love, it also makes my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> It neither gets absorbed in skin nor goes away after washing.</li>
            <li> I find my hair to be more silky and soft.</li>
            <li> It took me by surprise, but it did wear off as soon as it was absorbed.</li>
            <li> WORTH IT</li>
            <li> Blame it on those long-ago teenage days when my hair had plenty of oil on its own.</li>
            <li> (well, really Morocco), being an avid cook, I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> The next day, her hands were exceedingly soft, though, so you win some you lose some?&lt;br</li>
            <li> I enjoy smoothing just a few drops on daily after showering to nourish our skin and this is an excellent moisturizer to use when styling my hair with heated appliances.</li>
            <li> It was a fresh scar from a skin biopsy</li>
            <li> This oil is completely diluted with something cheaper for sure.</li>
            <li> Its gives me soft skin.. Would love to recommend to evryone</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> We both use it directly after getting out of the shower and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> when I have used some oils that pour directly from the bottle, I had a tendency to over pour and ended up with more oil on my hands than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> The smell does dissipate as the oil is absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> The results are instant and more importantly</li>
            <li> I combine this Argan oil with rosehip oil along with a few drops of lavender essential oil to create my own night time moisturizer, which works great on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic Argan OIl,  I actually looked at so many and researched before I bought this one.  </li>
            <li> did receive a complimentary bottle for the purpose of a review, however, I was under no obligation to post an Amazon review of it.</li>
            <li> In all seriousness, this is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It gives my nails a natural healthy shine and it&#x27;s improving the health of those ragged cuticles I mentioned.</li>
            <li> This is odorless, absorbs into my skin immediately leaving it with a natural glow, and it makes my hands look so much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few organic Argan oils, and so far I&#x27;m really impressed with this one.  </li>
            <li> I have had some success with a Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s acne product, too.</li>
            <li> and it seems like I want to get it done more frequently now.</li>
            <li> It is well absorbed not living any trace of greasy sensation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has so many benefits in it&#x27;s natural form for the body to even using it in foods.</li>
            <li> I love how soft and radiant my skin looks using this product for just two weeks.  </li>
            <li> However, I am pleased with this product so far</li>
            <li> I add a few drops of my own natural oil based perfume to make it have a more appealing smell.  </li>
            <li> It fixed my cracked heal like a magic.</li>
            <li> So, I really think that diluting this wonderful oil and put it into a smaller bottle and keep the price the same.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected, pricing is also good.</li>
            <li> Nice big bottle.</li>
            <li> If you use Argan oil on a regular basis the bottle size is nice</li>
            <li> If you want a hair and body oil that is trully natural, health and on top of that smalls</li>
            <li> So far I love this</li>
            <li> After doing some research on Argan oil, I’ve come across many sources stating the miraculous benefits of this liquid, with some going as far as to call this product “liquid gold”.</li>
            <li> Again, I have extremely sensitive skin and most products don&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the golden color and nutty scent&lt;br /&gt;Rancid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;InstaNatural stands behind all of their products and provides some of the best customer service out there.</li>
            <li> I use the oil on my body and love the soft texture it gives.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not enough on it own to fix my hair problem.</li>
            <li> This combination completely reduces/eliminates frizz and leaves my hair soooooo smooth, brings out the curls, isn&#x27;t greasy or oily feeling and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bummer because it is a nice big bottle</li>
            <li> : I received this complimentary product for review.</li>
            <li> The oil is so useful for skin, hair, nails.  </li>
            <li> I am not an oil expert, but for what it&#x27;s worth I do believe this is 100% argan oil.</li>
            <li> At night, I&#x27;ve been mixing it in with my hand cream too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample.</li>
            <li> BEST QUALITY, SO useful for various parts, such as hair, face, foot etc, ans also reasonable price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the pump and would prefer a dropper bottle.</li>
            <li> It is true that its not as &#x27;greasy&#x27; as you would expect and that it soaks in pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Just received this a week back and loving it.</li>
            <li> For my face it is quickly absorbed and leaves my skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I love its lush texture.</li>
            <li> It is soft and silky and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and break out when using most face products, or from hormonal changes.  </li>
            <li> So far I am pleased with it in each use.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price</li>
            <li> Again, so worth</li>
            <li> this product is powerful...</li>
            <li> So far my favorite have been Watts, Slice of Nature and AAA.</li>
            <li> I ordered this, as well as their Organic Rose Hip oil, and both are terrific.</li>
            <li> my skin looks more radiant with a soft and supple appearance.</li>
            <li> Face become more radiant, skin is hydrated and protected and no longer sensitive.</li>
            <li> Have only been using it for about 2 weeks now, but it works great so far.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li> I looked up potential products and saw that argan oil is a great natural product to use.</li>
            <li> But the bottle was sitting in the shower and, reading the label, it seemed worth trying on my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is very quickly absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> my hair much more manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say that just the Argan oil is enough.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t appear to be too oily, in fact, once on, it is so well absorbed</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely worth</li>
            <li> - this is a high quality argan oil, goes on easily and is quickly absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li> this oil is great and lived up to previous reviews!</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of using this, I’m not sure if I’ve experienced every single benefit it was supposed to provide, but I’ve seen some of my scars fade–and that’s already more than what most skin care products have done for me.</li>
            <li> My buying experience was very positive from InstaNatural.  </li>
            <li> It absorbed quickly and was shiny at first, but that also dissipated.</li>
            <li> I just love this old-school no mess way to protect and dispense restorative oils.</li>
            <li> After blow drying I used a couple more drops and it smoothed down my hair, left it with a nice little sheen and very pleasant smelling!  </li>
            <li> I have an oily skin, but the argan oil get&#x27;s absorbed very quickly, and makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> started using it on my hair and love how it moisturizers and make my hair more manageable and shiny without looking oily or greasy like some other oils do.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just due to too many pumps.</li>
            <li> Great tproduct and so much cheaper than the other SHOPPING CHANNEL brand.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased to have been told about Argan oil for my dry hair by a coworker.  </li>
            <li> It feels oily when you first put it on but quickly soaks into skin</li>
            <li> but the smell disappears pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> receiving the new bottle I noticed the plastic seal on the new bottle was much better secured and was very fresh and earthly smelling, the way it&#x27;s suppose smell.</li>
            <li> Seems pure and clean.</li>
            <li> dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also very nice on hands and hair, whether you just use a few drops in damp hair or mix it into your conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d glad Amazon can source the same high quality for a better value.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for dry skin, dry hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal for a huge bottle that will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> As good as other reviews said it was.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s alright not as good as other Argan oils that I have used.</li>
            <li> I have heard about this oil many times in the past and have really wanted to try this product to see if it was as good as it sounded.</li>
            <li> This awesome bottle of Argan Oil is 100% pure Argan Oil and can be used in your hair, body, nails and on your face, especially if you have dry skin or hair</li>
            <li> Amazon made it right</li>
            <li> Since Argon oil soaks right into my skin, I use this under my makeup providing protection and softness.</li>
            <li> I felt and noticed the difference right away.  </li>
            <li> I must add that they sent me an email right away saying that they would refund it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s right up there with the Argan Oil Hair Mask.</li>
            <li> Ordered it after I tried my daughter&#x27;s and right away</li>
            <li> I am still trying to figure out the right amount for my hair, so it won&#x27;t look greasy.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the product from amazon, instanatural shipped it right away and the package was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I rub 5 drops in my hand and then spread it on right after washing.</li>
            <li> The price was right for this organic argan oil.  </li>
            <li> On my skin as a night time moisturizer and a leave in conditioner take the frizz right out</li>
            <li> and I would not put it on right before I go out</li>
            <li> No breakouts and 1 pump dispenses just the right amount of quantity needed.</li>
            <li> When I saw that InstaNatural had an Argan Oil, I jumped right on it.  </li>
            <li> I use it right out of the bottle on my face and neck, but also as an added ingredient in homemade body butters.</li>
            <li> I apply it right after a bath or shower.  </li>
            <li> This oil soaks right into your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel at all.  </li>
            <li> The price is right and it ships right away.</li>
            <li> I have started putting it in my shampoo bottles, applying it on my skin right out of the shower</li>
            <li> The bottle has a pump dispenser that expels just the right amount.</li>
            <li> So the day I got it I wanted to put it on right away.</li>
            <li> I literally had an area between my thumb and fingers on my right hand that had no responded to even dermatology intervention..</li>
            <li> I use it mainly as a face moisturizer and it works fabulously.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to stop using all of these very expensive products and just use this awesome oil.  </li>
            <li> I love it, it&#x27;s MUCH lighter than the olive and carrot oils that I normally used on my hair.  </li>
            <li> One of the first things you learn with modeling is that most cosmetic products are hyped far beyond their stated results.</li>
            <li> So far my skin feels hydrated and great all day long</li>
            <li> Being that it&#x27;s 100% pure argan oil, I was please to see that it&#x27;s true and nothing has been added to this product.</li>
            <li> Being a concentrated, full strength oil, the silky feeling it gives both hair and body leaves a rich sheen that is light yet lasting.</li>
            <li> I have been putting it on my nails after I peeled off my latest gel mani (I know, major no-no) and basically destroyed my nail beds.</li>
            <li> and best of all it last an entire week and completely eliminates my dirty/oily look!</li>
            <li> I love that it is organic and has no other additives in it.</li>
            <li> I love the 100% pure Organic Argan Oil by Insta Natural!</li>
            <li> And my dry, horrid cuticles and nails that got some by chance, looked and felt so much better!  </li>
            <li> This company has fantastic products AND great customer service, a combination that is hard to find these days!</li>
            <li> Let me just tell you that I have high expectations with this product since I already tried two other products from InstaNatural and they work great.</li>
            <li> but this one is more better than previous.</li>
            <li> 1/2 a drop for under my eyes), although it obviously goes more quickly when also used on arms &amp; legs.</li>
            <li> I used this after my shower last night, my hair is so soft and seems to have more volume and looks healthy.</li>
            <li> However, I try now to place the smell in an olive category instead of a farm animal category and that helps my nose bare it a bit more.</li>
            <li> As a general moisturizer, I think it is a better option</li>
            <li> wife has been using it as a substitute for her usual post-shower body moisturiser and is perfectly happy with the results</li>
            <li> It comes in large bottle, has no smell, and absorbs quickly into my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Argon oil because I&#x27;m sensitive to most hair products,  I found that it is great on my hair, made it less flyaway, very soft and manageable</li>
            <li> Pure Argan oil is one amazing oil that is essential in my&lt;br /&gt;hair care regime.</li>
            <li> This 100% Pure Certified Organic Argan Oil is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I was provided a sample to review of insta natural 100% pure Argan oil and was extremely pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> The only downside of the oil being completely pure with no additives is that it doesn&#x27;t smell nice.  </li>
            <li> Initially it has a very strong odor when first opened.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is a minor one: I am now used to being impressed by how good the vendor&#x27;s products smell, and this is the exception in that regard alone.</li>
            <li> This oil is really awesome if you have eczema or any other dry skin issues.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the amount of money I have spent with the other brand when this product is just as good, I kind of feel like I&#x27;ve been being ripped off.</li>
            <li> The bottle is MASSIVE (most of the other oils I have come in 1oz bottles) and it seems to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> and I hope that InstaNatural Argan Oil will still be available when I need a new bottle.  </li>
            <li> Purely Organic!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s certainly helpful for the Winter months!</li>
            <li> but when you first put it on it smacks you right in the face.</li>
            <li> No junk, just pure oil!</li>
            <li> The 4-oz bottle is really large!  </li>
            <li> Mom gives InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Argan Oil 5 Stars!</li>
            <li> I works amazingly well on my dry elbows and heels.  </li>
            <li> Argan is a very \\&quot;dry\\&quot; oil which soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Thus far I&#x27;ve only used this product on my face and it feels really good.</li>
            <li> It works really well and arrived quickly .</li>
            <li> Has a very toasted nutty scent that goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> I am going to see if I can find some good recipes for facial washes that include this natural, healthful oil.</li>
            <li> Never had my hair so soft and now it is so easy to brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought a much cheaper of this oil in my local store, it was amazing.</li>
            <li> It is great for a many things and since I am a person with semi oily skin I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> This one is clear with a strong sulfur smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I get nice moist and shiny curls after my hair is all dry.</li>
            <li> Received this &amp; just as good but less pricey.</li>
            <li> but it absorbs easily into the skin and does not immediately wash off your hands leaving them soft but not oily.</li>
            <li> It doesn’t really have a scent to it, but it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used a few different argan oil products for my hair this one is the best by far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I Love this oil and use it more than once everyday ...</li>
            <li> I also put some warm oil in my hair about 2 hours before washing it (my hair tends to be dry these days)</li>
            <li> This oil is light and relatively fragrance free, allowing me to also use  the oil on my hair and my body.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> many people will know, rosehips are small fruits produced by a certain type of rose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic addition to my DIY Natural medicine cabinet!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 70 and older hair and skin need this special treatment.  </li>
            <li> However, it is a nice light oil, moisturizers ok, just not for my very rough dry patches.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you for making such an amazing pure product as such a reasonable price!!!!</li>
            <li> and it got here very fast.</li>
            <li> The post-purchase customer service emails from the seller is very appreciated, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Like it very much.</li>
            <li> I would definitely not repurchase as it looks very cheap and the expiration date is no where to be found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Argan Oil for a couple of weeks and like it very much for skin, hair &amp; nails.</li>
            <li> very reasonable price</li>
            <li> I would very highly recommend!</li>
            <li> thank you very much</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try this kind by InstaNatural, and WOW, I&#x27;m never using anything else.</li>
            <li> The oil is fresh with a very faint sweet natural aroma, a light golden color and the perfect consistency.</li>
            <li> You need so little to feel so good....</li>
            <li> Whereas before my skin had large areas of uneven coloring and bumpy textures, the most I have now aresome spots that resemble freckles more than anything.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Argan oil has a mild olive kind of a smell which is its pure form of scent so its not really bad but its not very nice fragrant either.</li>
            <li> The over the counter versions have worked better than this product, I use it mainly for my hair and as I recently cut it I wanted something more natural to nourish it.  </li>
            <li> My hair always ends up super greasy and the oil acts as some kind of holding product (like spray) leaving my hair just like a mess.</li>
            <li> I WILL be ordering more from THIS company when my bottle nears the bottom - but as much as I use, I&#x27;ve still got a good 3 or 4 months AT LEAST - to go - maybe longer since high summer will be here soon.    </li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more of this brand.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, AJ!</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I would most definitely order InstaNatural again.</li>
            <li> I received more than I follow up email from InstaNaturals which customer service is a big selling point with me.  </li>
            <li> This has pretty much healed them!  </li>
            <li> I love this Argan Oil &amp; can&#x27;t rave enough about it &amp; their customer service.  </li>
            <li> The sellers are also very helpful, providing a list of ways to take advantage of all argan oil has to offer!</li>
            <li> I love argan oil and use it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> This oil is organic and that is definitely something I love in a product.</li>
            <li> Does exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> At first its oily when applied, but it absorbs fast and within an hour dries completely and then skin feels amazingly soft and nice.</li>
            <li> My hair is now soft and smooth without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with argan oil.  </li>
            <li> I use it under my regular moisturizer and love the way it makes my skin glow.</li>
            <li> I still use it to this day, and I really like how it keeps my skin moisturized!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually my second bottle, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First time using it</li>
            <li> Its makes both my body and my face so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Must use it consistently.</li>
            <li> First time I have used this Argan oil</li>
            <li> Love this oil; use it in multiple ways: on skin and hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was damaged from using the hot iron.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more when this supply begins to wane.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Aragon oil</li>
            <li> When I first received the oil, the seal was damaged causing some leakage; I contacted the company through email.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about buying it, then definitely buy it, you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> It smelled like much better than any essential oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for months now after every shower with vitamin c serum first</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it on my face because my face is already pretty oily and prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> I rubbed some onto the back of my hands to see how it would feel/soak in, and it was lovely.  </li>
            <li> I want to get my wish list ready!    </li>
            <li> i think this one is the real thing!</li>
            <li> This one with the dropper is so much handier!</li>
            <li> Thanks a million!</li>
            <li> I love the dropper--it&#x27;s essential for portioning out the oil.  </li>
            <li> (I tried another brand of argan oil without any dosing mechanism and I always used way too much and looked like I had a Jheri Curl!).  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using Argan oil.</li>
            <li> that will only reflect even more on their products.  </li>
            <li> However, this product IS exactly what it says: 100% argan oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes put extra on and leave it on for days then wash it out; feels fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this product and look forward to trying it in different applications soon.</li>
            <li> It is competitively priced and it came exactly as stated on the web site.  </li>
            <li> First off, I absolutely love the cobalt blue bottle, it caught my eye and drew me in..</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this product from head to toe, and have added it to my daily beauty regimen.s</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this product from head to toe, and have added it to my daily beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> a lot of the reviewers said, real argan oil is golden in color with a nutty scent.</li>
            <li> My hair looks healthy even though I cut my hair only twice a year.  </li>
            <li> We have tried about 6 different brands of organic Argan oil, and this is our favorite.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> This is the first Argan Oil that I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> The bottle was larger than I thought so more product for the money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When you order this product you receive an e-mail of some ways you can use the product, I found that very helpful!</li>
            <li> the minute I first opened the bottle.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more.  </li>
            <li> Have you ever tried a product and instantly fell in love with it?</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;my hair is so much softer!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it my hair didn&#x27;t look like a broom anymore.</li>
            <li> product is knowing that even if you fall into the bracket of people this may not work out for, the manufacturer is willing to make things right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of the many uses argan oil has, I was only really interested in one...</li>
            <li> I love this multi purpose oil,I first tried it in my hair left in on for about 20 min</li>
            <li> I have to use three times more jojoba oil to get the same effect in my curly hair.</li>
            <li> The founder was genuinely interested in my opinion of the oil and how I used it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> The next morning in my shower I wash it out, and it leaves my hair looking shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I worried at first that my pillowcase would get oily, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel smooth and natural.</li>
            <li> but I find this argan oil is more affordable and gives the exact same results.</li>
            <li> Still, this is an inconvenience I am willing to deal with given the price.</li>
            <li> I love using the product on my skin, especially after spending time in the sun.</li>
            <li> i am adding my favorite essential oils for my skincare.</li>
            <li> and the dropper delivers exact amounts every time.</li>
            <li> These people really understand the concept of customer service!</li>
            <li> I had bought another brand the first time</li>
            <li> first tried Argan oil on my nails and cuticles because I have always had brittle nails.</li>
            <li> Well, let me tell you, from the first time I put it on my hands, it was a 1000% difference.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more when I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for a product that could better their hair, especially curly gals like me!</li>
            <li> I will be buying more and I would suggest that you check out their web site and find out what else they have and just see how this smaller company will soon be among the favourite ones on Amazon!!!  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re really getting a 3-in-1 product when you think about it - for skin, nails, and hair!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> oils I&#x27;ve tried are way smaller than this. :)</li>
            <li> and I think it works moderately better than the Bain De Terre hair serum I have been using for several years.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure if they were related, though.</li>
            <li> Performs exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The curls last longer and are bouncier and just overall looks more healthy.  </li>
            <li> Hair and scalp health improved noticeably the first week.</li>
            <li> For those of you unfamiliar with what that entails, let me tell you: monthly Dermatologist visits, monthly blood work, proof of 2 forms of birth control (despite being over forty, married, and husband having vasectomy), and THOUSANDS of dollars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly as I hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> but when i tried this for the first time i was in shock.</li>
            <li> The only reason I brought this was because it is advertised with a pump top</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Really wish I&#x27;d discovered this kind of oil sooner, but better late than never.</li>
            <li> but the price and reviews helped us make the decision to order so we will most likely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I love that this argan oil has a dispenser for easier use than the traditional medicinal bottle.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> , so it looks and smells exactly as it should.</li>
            <li> It has so many different uses!</li>
            <li> everytime I shower to help keep my hair soft and smooth</li>
            <li> You would also have more Argan for others who have to wait for the next batch.  </li>
            <li> with any oil product, it feels oily when it is first applied.</li>
            <li> There are no &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; ingredients in the oil---it contains Vitamin E, but is absorbed readily by the skin and not sticky.</li>
            <li> The price is right and the large bottle is a plus.  </li>
            <li> But the Argan oil has really helped alot!</li>
            <li> I used this as a hot oil treatment for my hair,  just place some oil in a container and put in hot tap water to heat and applied to my hair and after 20 minutes I washed it out.</li>
            <li> I didn’t think I would see any improvement, but I was willing to give the INSTANATURAL ORGANIC ARGAN OIL FOR HAIR, FACE, SKIN, &amp; NAILS</li>
            <li> They were conscientious enough to ask if I was pleased with their product and did it in a polite and non intrusive manner.</li>
            <li> I love the oil and have added it to my daily regime.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve written a product review.  </li>
            <li> I really like this stuff and will buy again!</li>
            <li> I love Argan oil and have tried different brands.  </li>
            <li> I am always looking for healthier alternatives to the items I use to make my skin better, younger, softer.  </li>
            <li> I have tried multiple brands of Argan Oil as a face moisturizer and my face breaks out more with this brand than others.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely helping!</li>
            <li> It works pretty well, although you have to put it on before you shower.</li>
            <li> There’s no offensive odors or anything–it just smells like oil, and it gets absorbed fast.</li>
            <li> It goes on greasy at first, (How can you not expect that..</li>
            <li> so I do love the larger size for the money savings.</li>
            <li> Have been married 35 years.  </li>
            <li> Gives a healthy controlled sheen and I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Actually I first heard about Argan oil from my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> Definitely try this out, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> it is so much easier to use than a dropper!  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> She has raved about it so much that I purchased one for my self today!</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I got an email from InstaNatural which is first from any maker for me.</li>
            <li> The Argon oil was exactly what my daughter in law wanted for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> It definitely compares to the more pricey brands that you find in the stores.  </li>
            <li> I Was Quite Interested To Try This Oil,</li>
            <li> It gave my hair this soft lustrous appearance and smooth feeling that I was not expecting.</li>
            <li> … it&#x27;s the real deal you can&#x27;t beat!</li>
            <li> FAST!</li>
            <li> Why spend 2-3 times more on Josie Maran when you could get the same (better in my opinion) quality for a third of the price?!</li>
            <li> I have mixed some with my mousse and that was much better.</li>
            <li> and she also seems satisfied with it as a pre-wash hair conditioner, where just a couple of drops massaged into her hair and left for 15 mins.</li>
            <li> I will be back for more from this seller</li>
            <li> First time purchasing this brand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used josie maran for years but not only do I like InstaNatural better</li>
            <li> but it does exactly the same thing leaves my skin soft and it minimizes the lines better than any cream I used before, and I find that the Argon oil works great for the dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> It is the first time I am using the argan oil</li>
            <li> I LOVE argan oil and have been using the JM version daily for 2 years...</li>
            <li> Glad I made the switch and will definitely be buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face: 3 drops beneath my regular moisturizer - and on my body: about 3/4 dropper for each leg and 1/2 dropper for each arm beneath my body lotion.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying this product your hair will thank you for it!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using argan oil</li>
            <li> I added perfume to it to eradicate the funny smell.</li>
            <li> Overall, it seemed okay</li>
            <li> With the hot weather coming I am not going to have ashy legs this summer.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First Time I&#x27;ve used a product like this.  </li>
            <li> If you use this in your hair it will make it very shiny!</li>
            <li> My face has never felt so soft and smooth and my co-workers are even asking me what I&#x27;ve done, because my skin seems to be glowing.</li>
            <li> Not sure how they have such wonderful reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased argan oil.  </li>
            <li> The price is remarkable at around $20.00 for 4 oz - a much better value than the expensive face creams out there.  </li>
            <li> scents.&lt;br /&gt;The product does contain traces of tree nuts, so be aware in case of allergies or hypersensitivity.</li>
            <li> I love not having to use multiple products on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have used many different brands of Argan oil on my hair over the years.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer said this oil is \\&quot;clear\\&quot;, when real argan oil has a yellowish or golden cast to it.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and it has really helped!</li>
            <li> i just use one pump and run it through my hair, especially the drier dyed sections and it makes my hair much more manageable.  </li>
            <li> Will most likely purchase again!  </li>
            <li> Works like coconut oil but not as hot (as in hair application).</li>
            <li> The quality is evident.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> After using it our skin is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Really works to soften skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be purchasing in the future when I need more.</li>
            <li> Works really well!  </li>
            <li> The first time I applied it</li>
            <li> When added to my regular hair conditioner, it adds additional moisture and shine; love it....</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product !!</li>
            <li> well...good quality product..most likely to repeat purchase :-)</li>
            <li> The first time I did it</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I always soak my face cloth in hot water &amp; place over my argon application.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It does moisturize my face, but leaves it looking OILY, so I put it on at night after a face wash, and in the morning first thing out of the shower (quite a bit before putting on make-up).</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> then I apply a generous amount from the ends to the middle top</li>
            <li> Will more than likely purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rather nutty smell which is not necessarily offensive, but it is definitely potent.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist wasn&#x27;t even aware of argan oil.  </li>
            <li> It is much better after only a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> As a hair treatment I use it overnight and wash my hair first thing in the morning, it adds shine and my hair looks and feel healthier.</li>
            <li> ;))</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> The dispenser is really good at controlling output and reducing waste.</li>
            <li> After using is for a few weeks now I like it, feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday under make up, and I have good result.</li>
            <li> I am always trying to find a product that is super light because we have fine textured hair, and also very moisturizing because our hair tends to get dry and hers is also very curly.</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to absorb but thereafter feels nice for ages and leaves a pleasant, slightly nutty aroma.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so great for my skin, especially now that my skin is getting dry.  </li>
            <li> but This oil is so light and make my dry skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> Well, I was surprised AGAIN because it was absorbed quickly</li>
            <li> I appreciate how fast absorbing it is and how quickly I can get into my clothes or touch surfaces without feeling too oily.  </li>
            <li> Having no previous experience with this oil, I wasn&#x27;t sure if that was normal and discontinued using it.  </li>
            <li> sure if this is just my bottle, or others, but I do have to be super careful with the dropper.</li>
            <li> This oil is great and about a quarter of the price I usually pay!  </li>
            <li> On another note, Instanatural sent me an email with other beauty tips and after a few weeks, they sent me another email to make sure I am happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> I have used Argan oil from other vendors and this is definitely the best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> This is my very first time trying Argan Oil, actually I hadn&#x27;t even heard of it until I was offered a chance to get a bottle for free.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very mild and barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have an almost 2 month old daughter, so I am constantly washing my hands to make sure they are clean.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the size and packaging, but even more surprised by the fact that I couldn&#x27;t stand the stench!</li>
            <li> Packaging is good, smell is not strong at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only super good for my dry hair, I also use this stuff for my nail beds as well.</li>
            <li> Real pure argan oil is a clear golden colour, with the texture you&#x27;re expecting from an oil.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a scent but this is very natural and true to what it says it does and doesn&#x27;t have a scent at all</li>
            <li> Great Quality and last a very long time!</li>
            <li> The oil is very good for moisturizing my face, hands, and other dry spots.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i originally got it for my face has a natural moisturizer and to help minimize a rash i have on my cheeks</li>
            <li> I am planning on mixing this with other oils this winter and making my own lotion.</li>
            <li> I fact, today, after shampooing (which is always an iffy time due to frizziness and dryness) I was paid two compliments on how nice my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> It nourishes the skin nicely, however it doesn&#x27;t have any antioxidant effects or other botanic effects to improve clarity of the skin.</li>
            <li> other quick thing that I LOVE about Moroccan Argan Oil...</li>
            <li> Add the pump dispenser compared to a dropper lid and this is hands down much better!  </li>
            <li> Its a great product my skin feels nice after it it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> After using Insta natural&#x27;s oil for a a few weeks, I&#x27;ve already seen great improvement.  </li>
            <li> Just a tiny amount of the oil is amazing at softening cuticles and making color-treated hair feel soft and &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> for nails my cuticles do not dry so easily now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I just can&#x27;t tell if it works better than using jojoba oil which I can get much cheaper from local trader store.</li>
            <li> Insta Natural is by far my favorite company.  </li>
            <li> Works as well as the more expensive varieties out there, and at a really fair price.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this argon oil was as good as a more expensive brand I bought</li>
            <li> There is no way for me to know for sure, but that smell let me know that the bottle definitely contained the real oil.</li>
            <li> I feel that it is as good as the more expensive Argon from the beauty supplies.</li>
            <li> so I can go back to the old kind.  </li>
            <li> This oil does just as good a job as any of the more expensive options that are on the market.</li>
            <li> - Rub into tired and achy feet, or just to make your feet soft and touchable, the perfect after pedicure</li>
            <li> they actually send emails to ask if your satisfied--yes, very :)</li>
            <li> got a free sample to try and it left my skin feeling fresh, radiant and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Left my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> pumps of this bottle is more than enough to lavish on your face and probably too much for bedtime kisses.  </li>
            <li> I was nervous after reading reviews about the smell it would have and honestly I have to stick my nose right in it to get the little funk that it does have.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural Argan oil is the first 100% pure Argan oil I have used.</li>
            <li> But I still gave it 5 stars as it&#x27;s an organic product that is pure, without additional ingredients, sustainably produced and does exactly what it says for my hair.</li>
            <li> so I was interested to try the pure product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first one I have tried out is the InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She has very sensitive skin and has mild rosacea</li>
            <li> I love that this oil is 100% pure and absorbs quickly, unlike other oils that just leave my hands feeling greasy for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives my hair more volume and makes it shiny and beautiful, it helps my dry hands and my nails (e.g. after using nail polish remover when they are all dry), I like it on my skin after taking a bath, when my skin is all dry</li>
            <li> My feet are super soft!</li>
            <li> I like to use it on my hair and body as it leaves everything super moisturized and soft!</li>
            <li> It is quickly absorbed by skin, which is a positive indicator for its high quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s easily absorbed and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin oily, I used some on my hair and my kids hair, it&#x27;s organic and safe and the bottle is big and looks like it will last for a while you just need a few drops:), I would like to update my review to talk about the results when I use it for a while</li>
            <li> It soaked right in and left my elbows feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This product is simply amazing, I was a little exceptical about having so many uses, but it actually does.</li>
            <li> She was right, the new bottle has no smell at all!</li>
            <li> I smelled the slight nutty scent that I expect of true, authentic Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> Nice oil for the skin, but it smells pretty odd.</li>
            <li> It gets absorbed very quickly, and keeps my skin moisturized and supple all day long.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy, I don&#x27;t break out and I see a positive difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I positively have noticed a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell too strong - there is a much more expensive one that smells incredible, but I&#x27;d rather pay half the price and use this product!</li>
            <li> I love the rich, nutty smell, which disappears a few moments after you apply the oil.</li>
            <li> so I use it there too &amp; it has pretty much solved that problem.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my hair for several months, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference, but I&#x27;ll use the whole bottle to make sure.</li>
            <li> It can be used for so much, that I wasn&#x27;t aware of.</li>
            <li> It came pretty fast.</li>
            <li> At first I used too much on my face which caused a rash.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was worried, as it seems much thinner than another brand I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used to much, its trial and error like any product.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a great product that replaces other serums, oils, etc.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use more than 10 drops each time, so this 4 fl oz bottle lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I am also very please with this seller who replaced my first bottle which leaked (I did not ask for a replacement).  </li>
            <li> My face has pretty much cleared up with the use of my doctor prescribed medication combined with the Argan oil.</li>
            <li> This company got it to me within a few days; I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> First, I received my shipment early which was great because I was anxious to try it.  </li>
            <li> trust me when I say that for true natural argan oil</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a superior product to others I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I have been using Josie Maran for over a year, and this product is just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li> This Argan oil has helped with my excessive oil,  wrinkles, even my finger nails, they have never look so good.  </li>
            <li> Got rid of the tickly frizz but its not oily or greasy and works great on itchy dry skin &amp; dry hair/scalp.</li>
            <li> I use it once every other day right out of the shower and my skin hasn&#x27;t been itchy and my hair looks healthy.</li>
            <li> The oil is high quality and a much better price than similar products I&#x27;ve seen in the store.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it, actually I already purchased two more.</li>
            <li> I did notice that the oil absorbed quickly, with no strange odors or lingering oiliness on my fingers.</li>
            <li> Very pure, high quality oil.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product on my nails as they are very strong due to the fish-oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read lots of things about how the really good Argan Oil isn&#x27;t going to be cheap, yaddah yaddah, so I must admit, I was a little skeptical about Insta Natural&#x27;s great price.</li>
            <li> I get very frizzy hair (due to highlights) and mixed a couple drops in with my styling smoother and worked great.</li>
            <li> I will most likely be ordering more of this plus checking out other products sold by InstaNatural.</li>
            <li> What can I possibly say about this lovely oil other than I love it?  </li>
            <li> I use it as a hair and skin moisturizer,  a heat protectant, to balance my oily skin,  for stretch marks,  dry chapped lips,  and much more.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly for my face and my hands as a moisturizer and it has kept my skin sane during the dry winter season.</li>
            <li> I also use this as a make up remover prior to the cleanser for easy breezy feeling.</li>
            <li> I use this on my skin and hair and makes it super soft.</li>
            <li> , I have smooth and soft skin this winter, not an easy feat in dry Colorado.</li>
            <li> The oil absorbs quickly into the skin leaving my skin feeling moist and soft.</li>
            <li> I am currently pregnant and I have been using it all over my body as a stretch mark prevention so far my skin is hydrate and</li>
            <li> I love to use it on my daughters hair because she has really dry hair</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after coming home from my stylist one day with super soft silky hair.</li>
            <li> I have started using it on my skin and nails and my skin has a glow/shine and is super soft.  </li>
            <li> I love this dry feeling oil.</li>
            <li> The number of sores have lessened, and my scalp itself is not as dry, not so itchy and is really more moisturized than it has been for quite sometime.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> The pump top, however, IS TOO SMALL TO FIT THE BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> My toenails and heals have always been a problem because I have dry skin, but even more so since we moved to Arizona.  </li>
            <li> It has tremendously improved my 7 year old&#x27;s skin problem on his face.</li>
            <li> The oil penetrates quickly and it leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a dry oil.  </li>
            <li> I mostly use it for my hair and dry spots on my face.</li>
            <li> My hair looks so shiny and healthy after I blow dry.</li>
            <li> Im super sensitive to the smell</li>
            <li> (The option is no longer available in my past order list, presumably since it&#x27;s been more than 30 days.)  </li>
            <li> I was driving in snow two weeks before Thanksgiving- my skin has been getting extremely dry and ,y hands are doing that lovely cracking thing.  </li>
            <li> I mostly use it on my hair (when it&#x27;s damp before I dry it ) &amp; face (after I wash it before bed).</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product; you get a lot for the price and the dispenser is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this when i got it yesterday my hands weren&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li> the results after such a short period of time are very satisfying.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is a good size and lasts a long time when used only under eyes and on neck (i.e. requires approx.</li>
            <li> It has a nice slight nutty scent as all pure Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I find it to be naturally healing and fine even for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This oil leaves my skin very soft and is quickly absorbed so my skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily.  </li>
            <li> but I have never used the pure version</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brand purely for the customer service.</li>
            <li> Just pure Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I will purchase this again when needed, Thank you for this pure product.</li>
            <li> This oil is pure argan oil, nothing added.  </li>
            <li> I started using the Josie Maran 100% Pure Argan Oil</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is Organic and pure.</li>
            <li> Again, I like that it is totally pure from nature and</li>
            <li> the therapist said I should try Argan Oil (100% pure) as a moisturizer and to help my skin look  </li>
            <li> InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil of course.</li>
            <li> When buying Argan Oil, I realized I had to look for 100% pure organic Argan Oil that came in an amber glass bottle (as not to lose it&#x27;s properties by exposure to sunlight).</li>
            <li> You can come to me for all your problems and pay me a large sum of cash, or you can use this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This makes me believe it is not 100% pure argon oil.</li>
            <li> I have tried eating certain foods to help my nails, but nothing would work.</li>
            <li> 100% pure.</li>
            <li> but it will certainly benefit his skin from it, regardless.</li>
            <li> This multipurpose moisturizer oil 100% pure and certified organic virgin cold-pressed argan oil can be use for softening hair/repairing/conditioning, glowing skin, and stronger nails.  </li>
            <li> So now going to end up throwing away a large portion.</li>
            <li> but I wanted one that was pure</li>
            <li> so I bought this product that is pure and was organic</li>
            <li> Large size for the price.</li>
            <li> 100% Pure &amp; EcoCert</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s 100 % pure and organic.  </li>
            <li> This is 100% pure, organic argan oil; with no synthetic fragrances or fillers.</li>
            <li> Pure oil.</li>
            <li> Being weary of all the added ingredients, I looked around and realized you can buy the pure stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wanted to get the Josie Maran %100 pure argan oil, and Got a sample of it and used It, but two things.</li>
            <li> 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil also known as liquid gold is a lightweight pure argania spinosa.</li>
            <li> It is used to moisturize and hydrate skin, face, Photo - Pure Organic Moroccan Argan Oilhair and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pure, absorbs well.  </li>
            <li> The InstaNatural 100% Pure Argan Oil is a multipurpose oil.  </li>
            <li> Mom gives InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Argan Oil 5 Stars!ty four hours and protects against UV rays.</li>
            <li> Would certainly buy this again.</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy this product again.</li>
            <li> The much lower price of this 100% organic product along with the positive reviews drew me in.  </li>
            <li> AND I can see some new baby hair on the sides !!</li>
            <li> It did NOT make it heavy and oily like so many products do!  </li>
            <li> I unscrewed the top to find a dropper.. like an eyedropper, only bigger, and full of the nectar of the gods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The packaging is very attractive and the 4oz bottle is much larger than expected, and should go a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product on my face for a few days and I will order more!</li>
            <li> I think this might be my new favorite oil, I will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> Although argan oil is a relatively new and unfamiliar beauty product in the United States, it has actually been a skin care staple for many generations of Mediterranean women.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This works great for moisturizing the cuticles or for softening dry, rough patches of skin.</li>
            <li> When it is dry, it looks full and full of shine.</li>
            <li> The only compliant I have is it gets absorbed into your hand quickly before you can rub it onto your hair or skin.  </li>
            <li> And it is great just like all the other oils I mainly have been using this oil for my nails because they are so fragile.</li>
            <li> Natural Argan oil has a raw, green and nutty aroma, but what is so great about this type of oil is that the scent disappears minutes after being on your skin as true Argan oil absorbs very quickly and without that greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The oil comes in a nice heavy dark blue bottle, and you get 4 ounces which is more than twice the amount that most companies are selling.</li>
            <li> It works fine enough to finish the bottle</li>
            <li> it really helps my dry hair look nice and soft .&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;First bottle was fine but second bottle went rancid in matters of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to be very high quality</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it has a pleasant nutty smell that quickly fades.</li>
            <li> It really had no discernible smell, certainly nothing objectionable.  </li>
            <li> This is the pure, organic, all-natural, real deal.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and most oils or serums feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> So this product was a nice surprise of how little you need.</li>
            <li> My nails tend to get really dry and rough this time of year especially, and I love how noticeably smooth and soft my cuticles have been while using this amazing product.</li>
            <li> and I loved that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of people have complained about the smell, and it does have an earthy smell, but to me that just means that this is a pure, untreated oil.</li>
            <li> Not only is the value and size an amazing steal but the quality is nothing short than pure, and undiluted luxury.</li>
            <li> High quality argon oil ,just as good if not better than that well known brand ,would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> it feels amazing from my scalp down after I wash it out!</li>
            <li> It is not as think as the other products I have used and great for dry hair and skin.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about Insta Natural&#x27;s Argan oil is that it is very fast absorbing.</li>
            <li> Fragrance free, a few drops work to refresh, add shine, smooth tangles and facilitate combing.</li>
            <li> The dropper is great since you only need a few drops of this.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Argan oil and this one is no different.</li>
            <li> It is fine, with the dry and hot weather here in the desert, it keeps me well oiled</li>
            <li> I found it discounted at a very low price for a huge 32oz jug.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference in the look and feel of my hair, especially after I lightened my hair.</li>
            <li> but if nothing else it is an amazing product just to use as a hair product, especially for the amazingly low price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading the label, which suggests using 1-3 drops on the face, I realize I&#x27;ve been using way too much product.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really have wrinkles</li>
            <li> it really works....</li>
            <li> but I really dislike the smell.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much or hair</li>
            <li> As mentioned, this one looks absolutely identical to Josie Maran for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> But with the Argan oil It makes thing so much easier.</li>
            <li> ; was too much.  </li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> i think you will really like it.</li>
            <li> , each day I place a few drops in my hands &amp; run my fingers through my hair prior to styling whether or not I&#x27;ve shampooed that day with the upshot being hair that doesn&#x27;t just &#x27;APPEAR healthy&#x27;, it IS healthy.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t help moisturize my hair as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I really think this is bogus argan oil .</li>
            <li> , I also put some on my face and it leaves my skin supple, It really restore moisture to whatever it touches.</li>
            <li> just dont put too much toward the roots or it can look oily.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I bought some for my friend too, she loves It so much that she asked me to buy again.</li>
            <li> and it really helps moisturize.  </li>
            <li> so she&#x27;s very picky with anything she puts on her face, otherwise, it will get triggered.</li>
            <li> Then I rub my palms gently on my face and &amp;#34;smoothe in&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous product, have been using on my face and hair for several weeks, will definately be part of my beauty regimen from now on!</li>
            <li> I put it directly on my face after washing and it is absorbed within minutes...</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this oil.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin very moisturized.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience using oils instead of lotions, but this product convinced me to make the switch.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really did any of the things it said it would.  </li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle and all I can say is &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Thanks..</li>
            <li> I have been using argan oil on my hands and nails before bedtime and can really notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> I really appreciate that the bottle came with a screw on cap and the pump was packaged separately.  </li>
            <li> nothing really make a difference</li>
            <li> But argan oil really shines when it comes to skincare.</li>
            <li> the smell it straight from the bottle, but the smell goes away after 15 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> Since it is much cheaper than Josie&#x27;s, I will still use it for hair and body, but will stick with Josie&#x27;s for my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had heard so much on QVC about Josie Maran&#x27;s Oil, but I did not want to spend a ton of money.</li>
            <li> This helped with the dryness and also greatly improved the clarity of my skin and decreased acne, even on my chest.</li>
            <li> and my face has been much happier.</li>
            <li> but it really does keep my face moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It looks, feels, and smells like real argan oil.</li>
            <li> thank you so much for the fast shipping, will be putting a review on my blog tomarrow</li>
            <li> fast service  </li>
            <li> This winter has made my hair very brittle and frizzy, despite using 2 conditioners (Redken BodyFull and Aveda&#x27;s leave- in Damage Remedy).  </li>
            <li> I thought the email the company sent with uses for argan oil was a very helpful gesture.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> Havn&#x27;t seen much difference</li>
            <li> This stuff really work, where has this been?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use it on my hair to see if it really does make my hair shinier.  </li>
            <li> The brand at whole foods never stings my eyes.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It is not irritating or anything like that.</li>
            <li> I drop about 4 or 5 drops into my palms, rub my hands together gently and attack my tresses.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> The  dropper tends to drip too fast so be careful.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Really upsetting.</li>
            <li> and this helps keep my skin very hydrated and minimizes the look of aging.  </li>
            <li> Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Suitable</li>
            <li> How do I even begin to describe just how much</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was tighter and felt very supple.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It really ddnt do anything to my skin or hair.</li>
            <li> it really helped with keeping my hair moist..</li>
            <li> Works very well...even helps bruises.</li>
            <li> emailed me with a whole lot of ways I can use it for -hair, skin).</li>
            <li> I bought the oil for my hair, but I actually really like to use it on my face.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and the price</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to put too much on,</li>
            <li> (&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got very upset and thought I would have to go through bunch of hassle to replace it...</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it some time before reviewing it and my skin has reacted really well to it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have had flaky scalp my whole life and even have used medicated shampoo (which did not work).  </li>
            <li> I am really liking the product</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s organic and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brand and product!</li>
            <li> Thanks for this product, I really like it.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is very healing and moisturizing to the skin.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin really soft..especially needed on my hands</li>
            <li> and it is very moisturizing!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> They sent me not only the pump, also a free bottle of argan oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Argan oil for my skin and have noticed how much my skin is improving.</li>
            <li> Chemical-free and gentle eye make-up remover?</li>
            <li> This is the real thing, harvested from the argan tree in Morocco.</li>
            <li> However, I can assure you that you DO NOT want to apply too much of this product.</li>
            <li> It was very moisturizing, to both the hair and the scalp.</li>
            <li> absolutely and whole heartedly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> This product works really well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this product if you are having problems finding something to soothe eczema!  </li>
            <li> It does absorb readily into the skin.</li>
            <li> I used it on my face as well, and my skin really was noticeably softer.</li>
            <li> So I put some in my hair and my frizz was almost gone even though it was a very humid day</li>
            <li> and I have very curly</li>
            <li> In fact I loves it so much</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and packed well.</li>
            <li> Oils packaged in plastic get yucky fast, this is much nicer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also certified Organic, which is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and recommended.</li>
            <li> away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was ready to start Accutane.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on this b/c I haven&#x27;t really paid attention to this</li>
            <li> It amazes me that an oil can soak in so fast and even be reapplied&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> only treat my skin with virgin oils and this one is fabulous.</li>
            <li> moisturizes really well</li>
            <li> but I was surprised at how the product is just absorbed by my skin and leaves a dewy look.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I shampoo and condition my hair, I still have sores and scabs on my scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nothing has really helped, and of course everyone has helpful advice of what to try.</li>
            <li> Really like the pump bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this one as much as the Pura D&#x27;or that I used to use.  </li>
            <li> Never thought argan oil could make a difference because i have really course hair</li>
            <li> I will absolutely be reordering this again from</li>
            <li> I will buy again - especially since the customer service is so fabulous.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much at all.</li>
            <li> It absorbs so fast - I can put on my makeup without having to wait.</li>
            <li> this oil is considered a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; oil, so it&#x27;s not greasy at all and absorbs really fast.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs very well and doesn&#x27;t leave a very oily residue.  </li>
            <li> My face is not breaking out and feels very silky after using this argan oil.  </li>
            <li> I really like this Argan oil.  </li>
            <li> but I have heard so much about Argan Oil</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this well absorbing and non greasy oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can use a lot of that and not have too much.  </li>
            <li> Very affordable</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> but I really like it</li>
            <li> Really defines my curls and keeps hair from being so frizzy.</li>
            <li> I really like how this product makes my hair and skin look and feel.  </li>
            <li> It works very well for me</li>
            <li> But even more awe-inspiring is the fact that I rub it on my eyes (closed) to get it all over the skin and lashes</li>
            <li> I really like using this for my hair as well as for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> I also use it for my cuticles and my hair, the argan oil also is very versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was introduced to it thanks to a blog review I did for them.</li>
            <li> I use this product for couple weeks.it doesn&#x27;t feel very oily.</li>
            <li> I contacted InstaNatural immediately and they promptly proceeded to send me a second bottle free of charge.</li>
            <li> It seems to help distribute the oil very well</li>
            <li> Clears blemishes, hydrates skin very well and moisturizes cuticles.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.!</li>
            <li> It works very well on my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> but that I don&#x27;t really like.  </li>
            <li> This is a fast absorbing oil.</li>
            <li> My order came on time (very prompt) .</li>
            <li> I also use a drop on my cuticles and they look so much healthier.</li>
            <li> (it has been working very well for that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks Argan oil.</li>
            <li> It really does not agree with my skin.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very fond of the smell.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much</li>
            <li> The oil works very well.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Nope, I promise you, this smells like straight up, throwup.</li>
            <li> One pump does my whole face..</li>
            <li> its very soothing..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hair-&lt;br /&gt;Apply 1-3 drops to the scalp or hair of washed hair and massage the oil in gently.</li>
            <li> but not anymore thanks to this 100% Argan oil by InstaNatural.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very well not leaving an oily residue.</li>
            <li> and they are actually sending me one for free.</li>
            <li> Maybe I expect too much.  </li>
            <li> Its just oil, so wondered what I could really expect.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product, really, I did.  </li>
            <li> Fast forward 2 months to today, I asked a friend who has used argan oil for years to smell it.  </li>
            <li> It also does really well keeping my hair close to tangle-free.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I just run my fingers through my hair after applying the oil to my face and my hair is much healthier looking as well.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Absorbs into my hands to fast before I can apply it to my hair</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> The bottle with the pump is very convienent.  </li>
            <li> no matter how much oil I use.</li>
            <li> She really appreciate it and is even already recommending it to her friends.</li>
            <li> old laugh lines</li>
            <li> it penetrates very well</li>
            <li> I even used a bunch on my scalp/hair once and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> very moisturizing ...</li>
            <li> I remember reading another customer&#x27;s review about how she used too much</li>
            <li> I would imagine that this product is not ordered much from amazon.</li>
            <li> I really had my doubts if the Argan oil would do as the product claimed.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t need to make so much.  </li>
            <li> and they look much stronger , healthier and don&#x27;t chip anymore.</li>
            <li> It has a ton of uses which makes it very multi-purpose.  </li>
            <li> Very emollient.</li>
            <li> The seller of this product really stands by it 100%.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I was very allergic too.  </li>
            <li> Highly highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I usually am very picky</li>
            <li> but I really like this product and fully recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I used it on my body it also moisturized very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have been very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also really like it as a frizz remover and detangler for my hair.</li>
            <li> When I used it on my body it also moisturized very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have been very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also really like it as a frizz remover and detangler for my hair.</li>
            <li> The reviews are very Fishy!&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is some sticky and stinky oil that doesn&#x27;t look smell or feel like real argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> found the seller to be very helpful and knowledgeable of his product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Hair looks much healthier.</li>
            <li> It really saves me a lot of $$$ as it is a multi-purpose moisturiser.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> After hearing and reading so much about the benefits of Argan oil,  I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> My real problem areas are my scalp, face and elbows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m choosing this brand over the one I used to use because a) you get more product for fewer dollars, and the contents are identical, and b) the pump action on this bottle doles out a smaller amount at a time, so I can customize how much I&#x27;m smoothing onto my skin at any given time.</li>
            <li> but I have found I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I really like that it is not greasy feeling at all.</li>
            <li> On a side note, this company is very service-oriented.  </li>
            <li> and this really helps.</li>
            <li> It blends in very well on the skin.  </li>
            <li> This one has a convenient pump which makes it so much easier to use without accidental spillage.  </li>
            <li> I really like this  product</li>
            <li> It smooths out the split ends and tames frizz very well.</li>
            <li> It really helps my hair look</li>
            <li> very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> makes it&#x27;s so much easier to dispense the the eyedropper.</li>
            <li> A very versatile product.</li>
            <li> Thanks for asking.  </li>
            <li> It also works really fast on chapped lips which is also a plus.  </li>
            <li> I use this product on the whole family.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much difference yet.</li>
            <li> and it very seemingly works</li>
            <li> I use it on my skin, especially my face after cleansing, for a smooth glowing complexion.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have as much breakage since I&#x27;ve begun using this method.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for moisturizing my face--I rub about 3 drops between my fingers and gently press it into my skin instead of rubbing it around.</li>
            <li> This is the REAL stuff...</li>
            <li> That has about as much meaning as saying &#x27;women of the U.S. use it&#x27;, and telling you to buy foot cream.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t absorb as fast as I would like it to.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and very responsive company.  </li>
            <li> It is a very versatile oil because it can be used on face, skin, hair and nails.</li>
            <li> But this product is very close..</li>
            <li> This stuff really works from hair to your toes.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and product packaging was well put together.</li>
            <li> Amazingly, this oil does not leave a greasy finish behind and once absorbed, all that&#x27;s left is healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> It also works very well as a body oil.</li>
            <li> that this line is organic and the pump bottle is very convenient as well</li>
            <li> and I must say I really like it.</li>
            <li> it is everything and more than i expected.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I both use it and it really works.</li>
            <li> You just don&#x27;t want to use too much because it makes your hair look greasy and oily if you do so.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this brand as it went rancid real</li>
            <li> I really like the oil.</li>
            <li> I bought it, and I really like it.</li>
            <li> It Left my Face, Skin &amp; Hair feeling smooth &amp; silky to the touch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing</li>
            <li> My partner uses it for his beard to soften his facial hair, and feels safe for face since it is all natural.</li>
            <li> The oil disappeared into my skin quite quickly and the \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; was not overpowering, dissipating as quickly as the oil had penetrated my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;m spending the extra money and getting it from a legit website like Mountain Rose Herbs.</li>
            <li> Just the best oil I have used lately, it glides on and sinks in,</li>
            <li> Just make sure to do test areas on clear skin to rule out allergic reactions before putting on any affected areas, especially for children!</li>
            <li> I really liked the expensive one, the famous one, HOWEVER, I ordered this based on the reviews</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any scent, so I added a few drops of rose oil.</li>
            <li> This seems like a good product, contrary to some of the negative reviews on here.</li>
            <li> It is refreshing to see products in which all the ingredients can be pronounced and it has such a natural feel and smell to it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re curious to find whether Argan Oil works for you, this bottle from InstaNatural is a good start, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It is too late for me to return the bottle and to be fair to the seller, I want you to know that I did not contact them.</li>
            <li> They use all natural, pure ingredients and they are all made right here in the USA.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks of applying a few drops on my hair, skin and nails… you wouldn’t believe how great this stuff works!</li>
            <li> one of those things they don&#x27;t tell you about getting old, when those white hairs start growing in they are more wiry than the ones you used to have.  </li>
            <li> Sweet almond oil has a slightly higher possibility of clogged pores than Argan oil, however I&#x27;ve used that as well (for about ten bucks for eight ounces).</li>
            <li> at least it&#x27;s a good body oil that you can use up.</li>
            <li> After the 1 hour was up I rinsed it with warm water and then blow dried my hair.</li>
            <li> put my makeup right on top of it and then need a little shine reducer dusted over my face before I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li> Most other argan products are not 100% pure but this one is.  </li>
            <li> It is a large bottle, seems like it is of pure, high quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it helps to put moisture back into my hair and tame the fly aways.</li>
            <li> Much like Portuguese cork oak, it is a totally sustainable &amp; an economically important product providing much needed employment, particularly amongst Moroccan women where co-operatives plough the profits into education for the workers and their children.</li>
            <li> Costumer service contacted me almost immediately and offered to buy me a new bottle with 2-day shipping, since my first bottle was damaged.</li>
            <li> However, I would suggest that you half this amount, half the Argan itself for it is far too perfect and could also get into the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have long wavy hair that I can easily straighten when I add the oil.  </li>
            <li> It is nice to know that it is all natural and not something with a mixture of 20 other ingredients that I can&#x27;t read.  </li>
            <li> Other brands I had to use a lot more and never seemed to absorb very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application of the product is done differently for each body region, however in general it involves using only 1-3 drops per application and it is likely to be more effective if used every 1-2 days:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Natural Argan Oil comes in a beautiful dark blue glass bottle (always buy argan oil in dark colored glass to prevent degradation) and with a dropper in the top.</li>
            <li> had low expectations, since pretty much everything I&#x27;ve tried that claims to make skin better is simply not formulated for something like VDN.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a light oil that absorbs quickly and has a slight nutty smell.</li>
            <li> This particular one comes in a bigger bottle and is scent free.</li>
            <li> and it will be absorbed before you get to work, leaving your skin soft, relaxing creases, wrinkles - I am older and appreciate this product.</li>
            <li> And something I&#x27;ve noticed with other companies as they get more and more popular they raise their prices, I bought my oil in February when there were no reviews, now with over 300 reviews and a 5 star rating InstaNatural has kept their oil at the same reasonable price, usually less than $24 with occasional flash sales.</li>
            <li> Great product from a highly attentive seller, but even in small doses, a bit too heavy for my frizzy hair in humid Florida.</li>
            <li> I know there are many other uses for argan oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other argan oils and this is my favorite .</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is Argan oil or just water in a bottle, but I am sure that it is not USDA approved!</li>
            <li> Like other oil treatments make sure not to pour it onto your hair.</li>
            <li> Since you only need a few drops each day, this stuff lasts a long time, making it an excellent value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product and compared to the other name brand stuff this will save you hundreds.</li>
            <li> I also really love the pump as compared to the dropper that comes with some other brands.</li>
            <li> There are so many other oils out there</li>
            <li> I have tried other argan oils (Josie Moran) but Instanatural  is better and the price is a bargain.  </li>
            <li> This Argan oil has replaced most of my other moisturizing products as well as my styling products for hair.</li>
            <li> With some of the other brands you pay more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much bigger bottle than what I&#x27;ve gotten in stores and with all its uses, it is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t attest to any of the other uses, but this argan oil has done a better job of moisturizing and softening my beard than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality pure argan oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to start off by saying that this is PURE, high quality Argan oil.</li>
            <li> The bottle of Insta natural is pure oil, very light and has a barely noticeable nutshell sort of odor which I can barely detect.  </li>
            <li> This particular product is also a great value considering how much is in the bottle and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> , I fell in love with this oil, I use it on my skin also, it is said to do wonders for the people in the Amazon who are constantly exposed to harsh climate, I most certainly would recommend this product for smoother and soft looking skin.</li>
            <li> I am slowly but surely switching my family&#x27;s products over to healthier alternatives - I&#x27;ve got a few more facial products to use up (waste not want not - and they are great - just want Simplified!)</li>
            <li> directions for different uses such as those are on the bottle in pretty large print (at lease as large as you can on a bottle) and are easy to see and use.</li>
            <li> Using this and Walgreen&#x27;s $8.99 alpha lipoic acid cream is taking my face to a whole new level of moisture and smoothness!</li>
            <li> Mine came with a dropper in a blue bottle, so it looks like Insta Natural is trying a new look, but I&#x27;m sure the pump works just as well!&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I have long, fine hair so 5 to 6 drops will cover it all.  </li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t use too much it soaks in to your skin in about a minute and leaves it supple and smooth.</li>
            <li> It seems much thinner than a previous brand of argan oil I have used...not sure why it&#x27;s so much thinner.    </li>
            <li> I love the pump and the fragrance is barely noticeable and goes away almost instantly.  </li>
            <li> It is housed in pretty amber bottle which I appreciate since the packaging limits sun exposure which may potentially degrade the oil and reduce the time the oil stays fresh.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that a small portion of it had leaked out in the box.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it is just great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I’ve been using it for a few weeks as a replacement for the hand cream I usually use and am very impressed.</li>
            <li> I put some of this in my hair after a shower and let it air dry and the argan oil keeps my hair looking naturally in control and keeps it nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference in my nails after only a few applications - they were brittle and peeling and now they&#x27;re much stronger and break much more infrequently.</li>
            <li> I have used Argan oil before (on my natural, dreadlocked hair) and enjoyed the way it not only was absorbed by my hair but how it left my hair with a natural-appearing glossy shine.</li>
            <li> Totally recommend for hair, specially in the summer.</li>
            <li> It has moisturized my hair and skin better than previous argan oils I have used, including Acure, Josie Maran, Pur D&#x27;or, and a whole foods brand.</li>
            <li> The skin on my forehead is now becoming a bit dry but the rest of my face is normal.</li>
            <li> and then I rub any extra on my nails to make them shiny, soft, and strong.</li>
            <li> but as others have noted that just means a good leave in conditioning treatment and after the next wash my hair is silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also mix about half a dropperful into my lotion.  </li>
            <li> Just a little rubbed in the palms &amp; run through the hair makes it easy to comb, &amp; shines!  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she has not been able to use it long enough to warrant a 5 star rating just yet but does like the feel and quick absorption--makes her skin soft and helped control frizzy hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very long, fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> I will purchase this item as long as it is available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin smooth all day long.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle of InstaNatural Organic Argan Oil in early December of 2014 based on the recommendation of friends.  </li>
            <li> I paid full price for this on amazon, and will definitely be doing so again when I run out.</li>
            <li> It is more greasy and not easily absorbed like the Josie Maran argan oil.</li>
            <li> Of all the promises of improvement, the only thing I found to be true is that it didn&#x27;t break my skin out.  </li>
            <li> Insta Natural was one of the first companies I had the pleasure to review a product for.</li>
            <li> I also appreciate that the bottle is dark (to protect the integrity of the oil) and that it has a pump (which is so much more sanitary than the droppers).</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and pretty.  </li>
            <li> And after 4 months(February till now in June) of full  all over body use I still have about 20% of the bottle left.  </li>
            <li> So thought I would try this since its cheaper, nice big size for the price, only usedmonce so far.</li>
            <li> At first, I was hesitant since my face is naturally oily, WHY WOULD I PUT OIL ON MY FACE?</li>
            <li> Started using it just now, so I am not sure how effective it is with stopping hair loss.</li>
            <li> It was my first try at a natural oil for my face instead of &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I searched the internet and bought my first bottle  of Insta Natural from Amazon (I always buy Amazon) after reading the raving reviews.  </li>
            <li> It has helped my dry skin and hair tremendously!</li>
            <li> Company refunded me in full for the product, no return necessary, so A+ for customer service.  </li>
            <li> this is my favorite argan oil hands down .</li>
            <li> Any more will weigh down the hair) and leaves my skin feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> Just because supposedly another nation may traditionally use a specific product doesn&#x27;t mean that product is the very best of the best.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I absolutely live this product!</li>
            <li> and I live in Hawaii where the humidity is never ending!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> when it comes to my psoriasis a good thing that helps keep them from flairing up so bad is keeping my skin moisterized, i used this product on my arm and it kept my arm nice and smooth and imediatly calmed down my psoriasis, didnt cause them to spread or anything.</li>
            <li> The bottle contains more information as far as uses are concerned - since this is a raw ingredient, you can use it to make your own things as well, and it&#x27;s extremely versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When asked what her favorite thing about the oil is, she responded with the way it has leave in or wash out options, that it is natural and not full of chemicals or perfumes, the pump that gives her exactly the amount she needs for that particular day, and</li>
            <li> But today, 24/hrs later, that one lonely finger (I&#x27;m not using it to type this, that&#x27;s how amazing it looks)</li>
            <li> The patches of dry are gone, and i have a smooth texture now.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair a slight sheen but more than that</li>
            <li> If you look greasy you used too much, less is more with this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product accomplishes what I wanted, but less is more.  </li>
            <li> Much like Portuguese cork oak, it is a totally sustainable &amp; an economically important product providing much needed employment, particularly amongst Moroccan women where co-operatives plough the profits into education for the workers and their children.to avoid absorbing pesticides at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While there is a slight learning curve to application, but my skin has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li> My facial skin texture is firmer &amp; more supple (being 63, that&#x27;s endorsement enough),</li>
            <li> I bought this oil mainly to use on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it and was able to use it 3 days later (standard shipping).</li>
            <li> but I bought 2 more bottles, I for my extra bathroom and one as an extra.  </li>
            <li> And by the time I wake up in the morning, the oil is completely absorbed and my face feels not dry but freshed.</li>
            <li> Much better than useless lotions containing water which evaporates and also better than greasy olive or coconut oils.</li>
            <li> My nails have become drier as I get older</li>
            <li> This is natural and light enough not to cause break outs.</li>
            <li> Its like a combination of motor oil and super glue mixed</li>
            <li> I have to say that I have gotten several products by this company, and without fail they are excellent quality and do what they say.</li>
            <li> I mixed this with the rosehip oil and the results were fantastic my legs felt so soft after i shaved them  and my face two.</li>
            <li> I have gone to a couple different health food stores and sampled many different brands of argan oil and compared to my bottle of InstaNatural</li>
            <li> particularly my hands/feet</li>
            <li> I mainly use it for</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and you&#x27;re not left feeling greasy at all!</li>
            <li> I find good oils last longer when packaged in glass and a few drops after a shower is all you need.</li>
            <li> I do use it on my hair and have not noticed any particular benefit.</li>
            <li> The bottle is decent sized, but doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly as a sealer for my hair during styling and part of my moisturizing routine and will be reordering.  </li>
            <li> After using the oil for two months, I can’t say for sure if there have been any actual physical benefits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more of this in the future for her.</li>
            <li> Love it over 50 younger men think I am much younger.  </li>
            <li> I would most definitely purchase this specific brand again.</li>
            <li> I am older</li>
            <li> I had not tried Argan Oil until recently; now that I have, coconut oil has a worthy competitor.</li>
            <li> it has made such a tremendous difference in my face.  </li>
            <li> and I plan on purchasing several more as I have been using it daily now for over 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I purchased the InstaNatural Argan Oil a few months ago and I love it so much I wanted to write a review.</li>
            <li> It is not the brans, as I have reviewed Insta Natural products in the past and have considered them to be a very reputable company.  </li>
            <li> This is mainly used cosmetically but can be consumed.</li>
            <li> mostly review all the Insta natural Product line with 1 line ads, not real</li>
            <li> The pump is an added bonus, I don&#x27;t care for the dropper that comes on most competitors bottles, the pump keeps the product covered so the oil doesn&#x27;t get exposed to outside influences and such.</li>
            <li> me, it&#x27;s been decent...</li>
            <li> I got this mainly for my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I was told my skin would be extremely sensitive to light, especially sunlight.  </li>
            <li> I expected it to have a strong smell</li>
            <li> It works great when applied to my fine, thin, curly hair giving it shine and body without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have waist length curly hair, make combing it out after a wash much easier and my hair is very soft.</li>
            <li> Also, this smells very natural which I don&#x27;t really care for.</li>
            <li> So, I love this idea because this way it will last a good long time because the bottle is 4 fluid ounces, enough to last quite awhile if you watch what you are doing.</li>
            <li> Hair is shiny, controls fly aways, helps with smoothing down  hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> have tried a few different brands that are pure and organic and honestly, so far, I&#x27;ve loved them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great price for such a large size - you use a few drops at a time so it should last you for a while.</li>
            <li> The oil would leak out before I could squeeze the dropper making a bit of a mess on the bottle and dispensing more than I wanted to use.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes, the oil is absorbed and my skin is ready for make up (foundation and the full monty).</li>
            <li> Remember to exfoliate your dry scalp first!!</li>
            <li> No more dry spots, no tightness or oily spots and my skin tone has evened out a great deal.</li>
            <li> even if I am supposed to use it for half of what I do, but as long as I don&#x27;t ingest it, i think I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li> wrap the bottle make sure the cap is sealed tight and put pieces of foam so a spill won&#x27;t occur, unless it came from an amazon location.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend their Argan Oil &amp; all their products.  </li>

            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am personally trying to use less commercial products (leave in conditioner, hand lotion, face moisturizer), so for these purposes, it works great.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this amazing, quality product over any other brand of Argan Oil I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I waited to write a review as I wanted to be as honest as possible to other consumers.  </li>
            <li> had the opportunity to sample some Insta Natural 100% Pure Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> So fun for me to go outside of the box and try new things I had never even heard of before vs. using chemical treatments!</li>
            <li> I also love the little note I received.</li>
            <li> It does take a little bit of time for it to soak in, but I think this has more to do with my using three pumps than anything else.</li>
            <li> temptation when using a product like this is always to use a little more than the label recommends.</li>
            <li> My skin felt different the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used on my hair after shampooing/conditioning to give it a little more shine.  </li>
            <li> This One Comes With A Squirt Nozzle, Which Allows Me To Use A Little More Oil At One Time</li>
            <li> I even put it on my beard now which makes it look a little better.</li>
            <li> So far, so good, although I did not completely substitute out my other prescriptions and creams.  </li>
            <li> and then my hair keeps my hair shiny and keeps the frizzies out (I have long, fine, medium-thick, naturally wavy, frizzy hair).</li>
            <li> I find this Argon oil to be very light, in texture as well as scent, and adding a few drops to your skin and hair after a shower really makes your skin soft and your hair shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this oil for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> The hard, cystic kind.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way and smells good.</li>
            <li> I seem to be having less breakouts since starting to use it, and i LOVE the way my skin feels!  </li>
            <li> Offers every benefit of other brands&#x27; Argan oil (reduces appearance if wrinkles; quickly and completely absorbed; no oily or shiny feel or appearance).</li>
            <li> You get a large 4oz bottle of pure argan oil for a decent price, so I’d definitely recommend this product if you’re looking for argan oil for your skin or looking to try something new (this was new for me!), then give this a try.</li>
            <li> Soft, gentle and non greasy.</li>
            <li> This stuff I smooth on while wet, even on my face now</li>
            <li> It is also a great tonic for dried cuticles, as I have only recently learned.</li>
            <li> It absorbs readily and my skin feels soft and moist.</li>
            <li> I wish I had not wasted that much money.</li>
            <li> Really like this so far.  </li>
            <li> Really makes my skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have much of a smell, it did remove my shampoo smell when I put it on, which kinda sucks as I love the smell of my shampoo, hehe.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and without freeze even in very humid weather during rainy season in Panama.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this versatile product so far.</li>
            <li> It really rehydrates my face and makes it soft and not oily.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to say too much because I fear some pharmaceutical company will find a way to fight against this natural remedy....</li>
            <li> --smooth on rough feet, elbows, hands, face&lt;br</li>
            <li> My whole body is soft as a baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like this oil.  </li>
            <li> I really like this oil so far.</li>
            <li> I just bought a second bottle for my golden retriever</li>
            <li> to the reviews of many suspecting the oil is not genuine, I bought two brands together.</li>
            <li> But since using it for about 6 weeks now i can say i saw a difference in my hair looking more healthier than ever without all those harsh chemical \.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> When I get out of the shower I put a few pumps on my hand and run over mostly the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both have long hair, and I have a full beard.</li>
            <li> Using my normal lotion wasn&#x27;t doing the trick.  </li>
            <li> I bought this oil based on the reviews and normally i use rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t apply too much - start with small, add more as needed, eh?  </li>
            <li> love this product use these everyday for my moisturizer for my hair and my body.</li>
            <li> It is still worth getting, but you might keep in mind that you&#x27;ll want to follow it with something pleasantly-scented if you&#x27;ll be in close contact shortly thereafter.</li>
            <li> but I guess would take ore than few months of usage :)</li>
            <li> It is so useful on face-nails-hair that I have made it a daily routine.</li>
            <li> Much better than a heavy night cream.</li>
            <li> Suffice it to say that rubbing a few drops into my heels is now a favorite activity during evening TV sessions.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the extra couple of minutes in the morning.  </li>
            <li> and my elbows are well on their way to being normal again.</li>
            <li> I will likely purchase more of this product as the winter is long.  </li>
            <li> After trying a small sample from a high-end brand known for its argan oil (JM), I knew it was something I definitely wanted to put on my face but wasn&#x27;t willing (able, really) to spend that much.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not really necessary, as a few drops work just as well, but this way is a lot more fun.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday (more than once).</li>
            <li> Is it normal?</li>
            <li> so i tried this alone as a treatment before using normal shampoo</li>
            <li> It has a light, green, nutty scent at first</li>
            <li> I can not give a full review of long term use</li>
            <li> I love this oil for my long blonde locks.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s not cold pressed and a different bottle..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care the bottle is different.. but not cold pressed?</li>
            <li> Broken - was not wrap good</li>
            <li> Not sure yet if it does anything for my nails, but I have high hopes that will result in better, stronger nails too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the previous users who were so satisfied and took the time to write a review.  </li>
            <li> Also, be sure to blow-dry completely, or hair may feel a bit weighed down.</li>
            <li> The shiny black, blue and red hair you&#x27;ve seen so far are all thanks to this amazing product!</li>
            <li> I am sure this will last for a very long time</li>
            <li> This one is thinner and absorbs better, TOTALLY improved my dry skin and hair.</li>
            <li> It is less greasy than my last argan, which I also liked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually when I use a cream based moisturizer alone, my makeup will end up settling on top of my skin and by mid day, my forehead appears scaly and dry.</li>
            <li> The Argan oil has so many uses and just helps especially in the winter dry air.</li>
            <li> It works especially well for those dry patches I get on my elbows, but frankly it&#x27;s the most versatile beauty product I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisified with this product and would most definitely purchase other products from this company.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Argan Oil for over 2 years and this product is just as good as any of the more expensive options at other retailers.</li>
            <li> is most likely due to the oil going rancid from being exposed to  too much oxygen.</li>
            <li> The 2nd time I used the right amount.  </li>
            <li> You get just the right amount of product to cover the face and potentially the neck when using this product.    </li>
            <li> Luckily, it doesn&#x27;t smell for long</li>
            <li> The dropper lets you dispense the product a few drops at a time, which is perfect, since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Unlike other type of oil leaves greasy texture.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention the seller follows up right after, he has been very helpful and fast reply to all my questions.</li>
            <li> Used daily, and it seems to keep the fine facial lines at a minimum.  </li>
            <li> , I like Argan Oil because of its high concentration of vitamin E and essential fatty acids that works great on my dry skin and helps make my hair stay soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really get to enjoy the oil but put a little bit on my hands..</li>
            <li> However, the oil is filled with other oil and fragrance.</li>
            <li> and I have been seeing small but great results in such a short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a little odor, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because it is natural.</li>
            <li> As for the Oil, just from the little I was able to rub on my hands wow</li>
            <li> I used it on my face and liked that it didn&#x27;t feel oily, but when it used it in my hair, even the very small amount I used made my hair feel oily.</li>
            <li> As a new comer to Argan Oil</li>
            <li> Argan oil is definetly going to be a new</li>
            <li> and  sent me a new one immediately.</li>
            <li> I am a new organic Argan oil user for my face</li>
            <li> because then I will put on my argan to soak into my newly exfoliated pores.  </li>
            <li> Argan Oil is pressed from the fruits of the Argan Tree[Argania Spinosa], a tree that is native to Morocco and can live up to 200 years.</li>
            <li> I received the new dropper 2 days later.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> I live in vegas.  </li>
            <li> so I can definitely live with it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get some argan oil product for my parents who live overseas</li>
            <li> , they must be new to Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I also like the new pump versus the dropper they used to use.</li>
            <li> the new pump spray vs the dropper version before.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t gotten any new acne yet.</li>
            <li> I am new to using argan oil</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what garbage is in the air where i live</li>
            <li> Please send a new pump.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> (PS I live in the desert).  </li>
            <li> I love how raw and organic it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands which were smaller bottles and far more expensive, but this was a great quantity for natural, organic argan oil with a reasonable price tag.</li>
            <li> put on wet, clean hair to control frizz and add shine.</li>
            <li> Has made a huge difference in my skin, I am 33 so starting to notice some moisture loss in my skin especially this winter.</li>
            <li> It soaked in very quickly, had a slight smell -</li>
            <li> I used a few drops daily on my feet for amazing relief.</li>
            <li> I always have skin issues when I&#x27;m pregnant (break outs, dry skin).  </li>
            <li> This deliciously light feeling and deeply nourishing oil has literally improved the look of my skin in just two weeks of daily use.  </li>
            <li> nice oil, doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy on hair, also no smell , just use few drops so it is big bottle</li>
            <li> It drys quickly and without a greasy felling (because it&#x27;s a dry oil).</li>
            <li> After washing her hair, applying the argan oil, and a quick blow dry</li>
            <li> I am 70 years old and come from a generation of men that never were particularly concerned about their appearance.  </li>
            <li> After showering and towel drying my hair, I dispensed a few drops of Insta Natural Argan Oil into my palms, rubbed the oil vigorously between my hands and applied it to the ends of my hair where it tends to be the driest and most damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (my ends are super dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 drops and it was too much, 2 drops still too much, 2 drops only on the ends</li>
            <li> I start on the ends and then smooth a bit onto my frizzy baby hairs around my face and finally run my hands through the rest of my hair with what&#x27;s left.</li>
            <li> As well, as I wrote in my review of the Rose Hip oil, Instanaturals is the real deal, a Company that stands behind their product, and is staffed by professionals.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling soft and smooth and helps with winter rough hands.  </li>
            <li> , it has a strange smell to it, but this is consistent with what I&#x27;ve read about real argan oil.</li>
            <li> ive a super dry skin</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need a whole lot for your hair which means that it will last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> It has worked far better than any OTC lotion I&#x27;ve used and far better than numerous prescription medications which are generally topical steroids and probably not very good for you</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully at instantly and completely calming my very dry and sensitive skin, and making my nails strong and pretty.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Argan Oil is so natural that the only ingredient is : 100% pure and certified organic virgin cold-pressed argan oil (Argania Spinosa).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although it is initially a little greasy when you first spray it on, it does draw into the skin fairly quickly when you massage it in, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was re-stocking my supply of various natural moisturisers when I came across this product and between the positive reviews and the money-back guarantee (which I really hoped I would not have to test)</li>
            <li> Because I have fine hair, it seemed to weigh it down, even after shampooing.</li>
            <li> This oil makes my skin feel very soft all over.  </li>
            <li> was very soft.</li>
            <li> My feet feel very soft.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, which is getting dryer with age.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin but have had no issues with this oil.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> I am blonde and what I am talking about is that soft, fine, almost translucent facial hair that you get.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use without making a mess.</li>
            <li> I had no prior knowledge of what pure argan oil smelled or looked like, so I was surprised that I didn&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li> (but I did use it the first week since my dry skin was very severe).  </li>
            <li> I use it on my hair, face and hands and it makes everything so soft!</li>
            <li> My only draw back is, there is simply not enought to take a bath in :)</li>
            <li> left in my first bottle</li>
            <li> When I use this oil my skin feels soft and supple!</li>
            <li> (she didn&#x27;t say that last part exactly).</li>
            <li> It seems like they are pretty solid with their product quality.</li>
            <li> that it is natural and organic, too!</li>
            <li> but I am not sure if it is safe to use on the eye area..</li>
            <li> First, but not the last time I&#x27;m buying it.</li>
            <li> No waste!</li>
            <li> love to add a few drops to the homemade scrubs and creams I make!</li>
            <li> daughter usually has a ponytail aka ball of curls on top of her head.</li>
            <li> ; i.e., old!  </li>
            <li> I use it every day and my eczema has completely cleared up!  </li>
            <li> It works better then the most expensive facial lotions too.</li>
            <li> My immediate reaction was to say out loud, &amp;#34;No way!</li>
            <li> WHY WOULD ANYONE SELL THIS ALONG WITH A PUMP TOP THAT DOES NOT FIT?!</li>
            <li> Seen the same oil in other places for much more.</li>
            <li> This will last me surely through the entire next year</li>
            <li> I really love the small, texture and quality of the InstaNatural argan oil.</li>
            <li> it looks much better then usual.</li>
            <li> At first I use only on my face.  </li>
            <li> I felt like a greaser if you put more than 1 small pump.</li>
            <li> I use it on my arms and tattoo - it brings out the colors in the tattoo and leaves my skin so soft and again, not oily!  </li>
            <li> soaks in to my skin faster and feels more instantly hydrating than other organic Argan oils I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s basically the same exact thing but for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> Terrific value and very prompt service!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty big bottle!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month and my skin feels so soft!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and use a flat iron to straighten it, and using this product on my hair wet helps to smooth it and reduce any frizziness!</li>
            <li> It absorbed fast and contrary to what I have read in other reviews</li>
            <li> This was my first Argan oil experience and I am eager to use it for everything possible.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day on my underarms and the back of my arms and after the first day could already tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> now i have soft hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely spreading the word about this to everyone who needs real Argan oil!</li>
            <li> I am a mixed asian woman and while my hair is wavy, it wasn&#x27;t enough to warrant more keratin treatments anymore.</li>
            <li> It does have a smell when you first open the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for 2 days now and my review is pretty premature.</li>
            <li> You can use and mix it with natural products without all the chemicals!</li>
            <li> it was so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Effects are satisfactory so far!  </li>
            <li> Another natural product from InstaNatural!</li>
            <li> I saw instant results after using this product on my hair for the first time.</li>
            <li> So I purchased a separate, nearly identical bottle to keep the argan oil in and haven&#x27;t had a problem since!</li>
            <li> Not too sure if the bottle situation only happened to me, but be careful if that happens to you!</li>
            <li> love how raw and natural this product is.</li>
            <li> love how raw and natural this product is.</li>
            <li> My skin has the dryness, wrinkles, and brown spots that come with a very long life that has been well lived, and it is also super sensitive.</li>
            <li> My skin became more dry from using it and my hair also looked dry after using this product.</li>
            <li> the natural smell is slight &amp; easy to get used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Moroccan hair oil for 2 years now and decided to finally try the real thing, what they claim is the main ingredient - argan oil.</li>
            <li> I love how soft my face feels long after application (my skin is usually pretty dry - especially in the winter!).</li>
            <li> As someone with a combination skin type, I can go from having a very oily face to a very dry face depending on the weather and my diet, and I had been looking for something that I could use as a moisturizer that would help keep my face consistently moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and don&#x27;t forget to put in in your hair at night to give it a nice conditioning while you sleep.</li>
            <li> I had a more expensive brand in a smaller bottle but this honestly works the same.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Josie Maran for a long time but right now its not in the budget.</li>
            <li> I rest assured knowing it is 100% pure and organic.&lt;br /&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit &amp; Planet&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;</li>
            <li> I use just a bit of this oil--recommended by my hair stylist--to calm frizzy hair that tends to dry because of hair coloring.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge so will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I greatly prefer the slightly fruity scent of this to the other and what smell there is dissipates much quicker than the other, stinky smell.  </li>
            <li> First off, the smell is that of fresh green olives.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to dispense a few drops at a time.</li>
            <li> The argan oil sinks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t rub off.</li>
            <li> The following morning my hair still felt soft and when I straightened my hair it looked so pretty.</li>
            <li> It is pure, cold pressed, 100% organic, in a beautiful cobalt blue glass ( that is quality packaging ).&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really helps my frizzies to calm down.  </li>
            <li> oil is organic and pure, has no chemical additives like other oils advertised for much higher price.</li>
            <li> My cuticles and rough heels are finally happy after only a few days!  </li>
            <li> I think the reason I was getting such mixed results at first was because I was convinced I needed to use a whole bunch.</li>
            <li> Besides using it &amp;#34;as is&amp;#34; from the bottle, you can use it as a hot oil treatment, skin moisturizer, dry scalp and eczema treatment, treat dry hands and cuticles, treats mild acne since it has Oleic acid, use it to grill vegetables, add some lemon and use as salad dressing.</li>
            <li> bottle will last a long time, with each drop of treasured oil absorbed and appreciated.</li>
            <li> makes you feel worse &amp; more side effects!  </li>
            <li> This is a nice, big glass bottle, tinted blue (argan oil needs to be in a dark bottle to retain its properties).</li>
            <li> I could lessen the amount used to have it soak in faster, but I don&#x27;t mind going to sleep with a slightly oily face when I know I&#x27;ll be waking up to smooth, soft skin.</li>
            <li> There are Argan Oils out in the market, similar to this product, that sell for much more for much less.</li>
            <li> I use under moisturizer as an extra boost and really love the look that it provides, which is to give my face a slightly luminous look.</li>
            <li> This is my second time trying Argan oil, and I like this brand better than the previous one I&#x27;d tried.</li>
            <li> They quickly resolved the issue and went the extra mile to go beyond the simple fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This treatment leaves my hair soft and shiny and after a few applications like this, my hair is strong too.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I have to hold it upside down until I am ready to use it because basically the dropper just let&#x27;s the oil come right out, instead of in drops.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle, first from this company, and this is the first time I&#x27;ve experienced this putrid smell. :(</li>
            <li> It really helps soften and calm my dry, coarse, frizzy, and curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I just rub a few drops between my palms and lightly rake the product through my hair and WOW!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t thank you enough, y&#x27;all process a pure miracle.  </li>
            <li> argan oil is a pure, simple, organic product.  </li>
            <li> I especially like that it&#x27;s organic and pure maintains its nutrients.</li>
            <li> My skin certainly looks younger and fuller.  </li>
            <li> This &amp; another essential oil were packed in a large box that  included a case of six 32 oz.</li>
            <li> It only contains 100% pure, certified organic argan oil.</li>
            <li> The pump as a dispenser is also great - especially compared to other oil products that have droppers that leak, particularly when you only need a few drops.</li>
            <li> It has very light nutty smell, negligible in a few drops, only observed when taking a sniff from the bottle.</li>
            <li> after 3 days my hair became really smooth and shiny and a little oily.</li>
            <li> Organic cold-pressed oils are never going to be cheap, at least not if you want them to be pure and ethically-sourced.  </li>
            <li> I recently had the opportunity to try Insta Natural’s 100% Pure Organic Moroccan Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a significant thickening of my hair or less acne.</li>
            <li> This oil is lovely, but a little thinner in consistency than others I have used... however, the results have been the same.  </li>
            <li> I love it, and it takes so little that this bottle will last forever.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and is comparable to other Argan Oils I have used.</li>
            <li> My favorite part about it is that the wrinkles on my forehead are hardly visible when I have the oil on.</li>
            <li> Dr. Axe made this oil the clear choice</li>
            <li> Applying just a tiny amount of this Argan Oil twice a day (morning and night) directly on my cuticles has really improved their condition.</li>
            <li> I expected to enjoy using their argan oil and InstaNatural actually surpassed my expectations.</li>

            <li> I have to be careful, but for deep moisturizing for my hair - it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not used to spending a lot on facial products but the bottle is 4oz which really is huge, especially since you only need to use a couple of drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The oil also comes out of the dropper much too fast, so be careful.</li>

            <li> Leaves hair really soft.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind the smell and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Now with Insta Natural, I feel the difference</li>
            <li> I like that it is totally natural, no temporary results like the anti-wrinkle cream that quits working when you quit using it.</li>

            <li> So far I have used this oil for my nails and cuticles, as a leave in conditioner, and I even have used it on my stretch marks.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve always used the professional oil products that are blended with Argan oil., but decided to try it alone.</li>
            <li> I can literally feel the difference and feel like a million bucks with this natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It goes far, believe me.</li>
            <li> When the postman dropped the package next to my door I found out that something happened to the oil inside and the whole box was soaked in oil. :</li>
            <li> But I was extremely pleasantly surprised...</li>
            <li> and it made them so soft.</li>
            <li> and you should not put anywhere near your face</li>
            <li> I can already see that my hair is much shiner, thicker, and healthier overall.</li>
            <li> Just starting using it on my whole body after a work out.</li>
            <li> it?&lt;br /&gt;I am a professional stylist.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Argan Oil on my hair for the last couple weeks and find it has really improved the feel and look of my hair.  </li>
            <li> It was a gift for my mom and so far she likes how the oil feels compared to others she&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> The issue that I had with the the pump bottle has been fixed.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but I use it on my arms and legs and so far  no break outs.</li>
            <li> Instead my arms and legs are soft all day.</li>
            <li> No heavy fragrance at all.</li>
            <li> Every bottle of Insta Natural Argan Oil is certified organic.</li>
            <li> A handful of drops (5-7) is what I needed to make my shoulder length hair look soft and</li>
            <li> Insta Natural offers a 100% guarantee on their product.</li>
            <li> 100% natural</li>
            <li> Not oily just leaves me soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I mix approx 6 drops of the argan oil into my conditioner and it leaves it soft and conditioned.  </li>
            <li> As it&#x27;s an oil, it doesn&#x27;t take much to go a pretty long way.</li>
            <li> anything stings once it&#x27;s in the eyes, natural or not.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also love that this bottle is going to go a long long way when you figure you only use 2-3 drops at a time.  </li>
            <li> so I was surprised that it can be used on the hands, nails, face, arms and legs as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> am 52 years old and everybody thinks I am in my early Thirties.  </li>
            <li> But NOTHING made it go completely</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny, manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> A lot healthier to moisturize as it is all natural.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my skin daily and really like the effects.</li>
            <li> also use this on my face when I feel the need but only after using a hyaluronic acid gel/serum since this combo really seems to help with absorption of this.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> However, after rubbing this into my hair, the odor &amp;#34;magically&amp;#34; disappears and I am felt with no harsh smelling</li>
            <li> After reviewing the ingridients and making some research, is absolutely the same.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturised, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> The only reason I took off one star was because the smell really is ghastly.</li>
            <li> It works really well and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This 4oz.bottle is a real value and seems to have the same results.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural is a company that I trust to offer real 100%  Argan oil and not a blend of inferior oils with Argan mixed in.</li>
            <li> However, it appears that they have fixed this problem by changing the bottle to a pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> The results were a soft and bouncy mane.</li>
            <li> I have really damaged hair because I dye my&lt;br /&gt;hair neon red, so I use this to help with the damage, split ends, and frizz.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shine and skin soft.</li>
            <li> ABSORBS QUICKLY, SOFT SKIN, THANK YOU</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft with this product.  </li>
            <li> After about one week of use the dryness went away completely.  </li>
            <li> It is a natural product, doesn&#x27;t have any perfume added,</li>
            <li> I use it on eczema as well, and while it may not heal it completely it does relieve it.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soooo soft.</li>
            <li> I have used this for almost 2 weeks now and my face and hands have never felt this soft.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> So far, I have used it for 2 months, and it doesn&#x27;t cause any problem around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> and I wanted something natural to add moisture to my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it on body and face and it leaves skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> And also it keeps my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> WOW WHAT A SAVINGS OVER JOSSEY&#x27;S JUST NO SCENT</li>
            <li> 1-2 drops rubbed into the tips of my hair and -voila- shiny, soft hair.</li>
            <li> My skin is silky thanks to this product I apply twice daily after showers.</li>
            <li> Works well so far.</li>
            <li> As for Amazon they were so gracious to refund me back for all the products that were damaged, Thanks Amazon..</li>
            <li> I did not break out from this product which I was thankful for since I break out from basically anything and everything under the sun since my skin is so freaking sensitive.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use this natural one ingredient product than a manufactured moisturizer with garbage ingredients in it.  </li>
            <li> I left it in my scalp/hair for one whole day.</li>
            <li> When I contacted them and let them know this, they offered me this product for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Received for review the product is presented in a 120mL brown glass bottle and comes with a capped pump action spray.</li>
            <li> Despite my frequent use one bottle lasts me months.</li>
            <li> Insta Natural&#x27;s oil is a bargain at any price, and this 4 oz.</li>
            <li> Immediately, she told me that it was old.  </li>
            <li> I add a few pumps to my lotion bottle, and it leaves my skin smooth and silky without any greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> I also like that the pump action to squirt the oil out of the glass bottle is not messy at all.</li>
            <li> I rub one pump of this between my palms, run it through the ends of my hair, and everything becomes soft and springy, not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> Wow I was surprised.</li>
            <li> It has an old smell, but I&#x27;m not too picky about that</li>
            <li> I will go directly to the company and order.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I am completely won over.</li>
            <li> It soaks in immediately and leaves my skin soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ways</li>
            <li> It lets a lot come out, more than I needed so I am extra careful when I take it out of the bottle to only use about two drops.&lt;br</li>
            <li> HER HAIR IS SO SOFT AND MANAGEABLE.  </li>
            <li> THE NATURAL HAIRSTYLES</li>
            <li> and it is not heavy</li>
            <li> My skins feels soft but not greasy,oil absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I got this because it is completely organic</li>
            <li> Personally, it&#x27;s too much to use it in the morning.</li>
            <li> People are commenting on how soft my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels baby soft.  </li>
            <li> Insta Natural Argan Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I just do not personally like the whole oily feeling.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since then, I have simply purchased the real thing.(Oil Only.)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When it came, however, I was finding that the smell simply was too much for me.  </li>
            <li> IT MAKES MY SKIN SO SOFT.</li>
            <li> I am 74 years young.  </li>
            <li> I was contacted by InstaNatural to try out some of their natural beauty products.</li>
            <li> It protects my hair from any heat damage I may do to it as well as make it shiny, soft and frizz</li>
            <li> It protects my hair from any heat damage I may do to it as well as make it shiny, soft and frizz</li>
            <li> If you are extremely sensitive you may not like it.</li>
            <li> but it is all natural</li>
            <li> I think most of the negative comments in regards of the product leaving hair too oily come from 1st-time buyers who might not know how to use  argan oil.</li>
            <li> Natural.  </li>
            <li> My face is sensitive and prone to acne and this product does not break me out.</li>
            <li> are so soft and they snap</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to buy my second bottle now</li>
            <li> After applying the argan oil, my skin feels soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really seems to help with the itching and discomfort… even throughout the following day.</li>
            <li> It leaves skin really soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair...</li>
            <li> I was done with all of that and wanted to go natural.</li>
            <li> I just needed something that would help me manage the texture of my hair and bring out my natural waves and this product is it.</li>
            <li> It is dispensed through a pump as well which I much prefer over the standard dropper method.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural way to give hair nutrition.</li>
            <li> I used this after I applied the Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> oil is completely diluted that it wont help your skin.</li>
            <li> I can use it on my face without it burning my eyes, and it makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and supple my hands</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li> also use it to get soft shiny hair.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft not frizzy anymore.</li>
            <li> But I do use it on her hair a lot and don&#x27;t have any complaints so far.</li>
            <li> The fragrence took some getting use to, but I am sensitive to scents.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin silky soft, moisturizes my hair and leaves it shiny.</li>
            <li> So far no adverse reactions to the product.  </li>
            <li> When it dries my hair feels lush and there is no frizz to be seen.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it in the mornings, I use it at nights after my Retinol cream (I allow the retinol cream to absorb completely before applying this oil).</li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> I have been trying it for nearly five days.</li>
            <li> It absorbs within 3 to 5 minutes and my face feels soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li> A BOTTLE DIRECT.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anybody who is trying to keep their hair under control and who wants their hair to shine and come to life.</li>
            <li> And I also got to keep the old bottle.</li>
            <li> I purchased Argan oil in hopes of abating my wrinkles, if only for a few more years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this argan oil consistently since I first ordered it a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, about five to ten minutes later, it had completely absorbed into my skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;They may not be a sham, but I don&#x27;t trust their products, and something is most definitely fishy about their product line.</li>
            <li> have only been using it a few days, but my skin seems to have that healthy glow</li>
            <li> Most of the time you only need a few drops.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oil wasn&#x27;t as effective as I would have hoped given the price (a bit thin and &#x27;watery&#x27;</li>
            <li> If you are going to invest in a good quality argan oil, then you will not be steered wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> thick better for body</li>
            <li> Frankly, it makes my face feel every bit as good as some of the expensive Estee Lauder moisturizers I&#x27;ve used for years.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a sturdy thick glass bottle and has a handy spray pump dispenser, that way you only use what you need.</li>
            <li> I have used expensive argan oil and this stuff is just as good but fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> It seems like a nice oil, just not for my (white girl, medium thick) hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is less frizzy, super soft, and shinier!</li>
            <li> I also apply just a tiny (TINY) bit in the morning before putting on my makeup, and that seems to soak right up.   </li>
            <li> He responded right back to me that he would send another one which I got two days later.  </li>
            <li> only down side I&#x27;ve encountered is that Insta Natural&#x27;s Argan Oil doesn&#x27;t absorb very quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick tip: just put 2 drops max in your palm, rub hands together a few seconds to warm it up, apply only to ends and sparingly mid-length (wet hair or dry)</li>
            <li> Very nice personal touch from a company that I feel truly stands behind their products!</li>
            <li> I have some dry elbows from the winter dryness and when I first opened the argan oil to smell it and check it out</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see much of a difference between this brand and other brands of Argan Oils.</li>
            <li> It reduced my dry scalp dramatically after the first usage.</li>
            <li> comes as said, this is my first Argon oil purchase as i am growing my hair out and my scalp gets dry.</li>
            <li> Then add about half a dropper full on my hands and rub them together.</li>
            <li> so little is used each time thanks to the neat pump dispenser, even after weeks of testing, the 120ml bottle is still ¾ full so it will last for ages.</li>
            <li> , pat myself dry but leave it to sit on my lower legs while they dry and voila, smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> Used it on my Moms super extra dry hair.</li>
            <li> but I also have a bottle on hand for my foster dogs with dry skin problems, in particular a papillon with allergies and an older chihuahua.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For facial use, I like to use this Argan Oil on super dry spots, which has been a godsend this winter.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t realize how much 4 ounces really is, but this bottle is going to last a long time</li>
            <li> My hair is damaged from over coloring and styling....and adding this before I flat iron is really making a difference in the text and sheen of my hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and the product has instructions on the label saying how many drops you should use for everything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Fast Absorbing &amp; Long Lasting:</li>
            <li> Even though I didn&#x27;t like the smell of the other brand, the results were worth the smell.  </li>
            <li> Went from blotchy red areas and dark patches on my face to an unbelievably smooth, extremely soft, hydrated even-toned skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Due to being long, my hair splits easily and always tangled at the split ends.</li>
            <li> However the effect died down the 2nd day but it takes much longer for it to be absorbed.</li>
            <li> Most products that intend to add body actually do the opposite by weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m undecided if it was good or bad, but it was just slight, so I&#x27;ll be ok.  </li>
            <li> (not really sure since theres always a fine line between glowy and oily but lets go with glowy).</li>
            <li> I use it mainly on my face and what is left on my fingertips is rubbed into my cuticles.</li>
            <li> and now my face is back to normal and soft.</li>
            <li> :) I now use argan oil in my body wash, in my coconut oil as a moisturizer, and alone in my hair--a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This is my first experience using it &amp; only takes a tiny bit to do the job.</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle in December 2014 and just recently bought a second bottle (even though I still had about 1/4 bottle left).When using just a 4 drops/pumps a day for my hair, face and hands</li>
            <li> My first experience with argan oil was a different brand and this was my second.  </li>
            <li> When I put a drop of Josie Maran next to a drop of this, they smelt, felt, and looked EXACTLY the same.</li>
            <li> A small bottle will easily last you more than a year.</li>
            <li> Argan oil in general has really helped to balance out my face and help my acne chill out, as well as making my face feel softer overall.  </li>
            <li> and I use it on almost my entire body, mainly my hair, legs and feet.</li>
            <li> hair is typically very dry and frizzy, but it&#x27;s also very fine and think so I have a hard time finding products that help moisturize and smooth my hair without weighing it down or making it look oily.</li>
            <li> For hair I have very thick n dry hair: it&#x27;s done some good for it</li>
            <li> It goes right on without the heavyweight of other oils.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product that should be part of your daily routine.</li>
            <li> Did lot&#x27;s of research prior to purchasing argan oil and must say this product fills all of the requirements of a high quality oil.</li>
            <li> There is a slight odor, but it is not unpleasant to me and it is gone before I&#x27;ve finished rubbing the oil in.   </li>
            <li> My only concern is that there is a distinct smell to pure argan oil that was missing from this.</li>
            <li> Liked using on my hair but had to be careful to use only a little.  </li>
            <li> (only tried it once to mostly dry hair), so this is worth another</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and the fact that I&#x27;m using an organic oil on my body&#x27;s largest organ, makes me feel confident that I&#x27;m not putting dangerous chemicals into me.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a large bottle and it goes a long way!</li>
            <li> either straight or mixed with other products.....huge, positive difference.  </li>
            <li> And the bottle is huge compared to what you usually get.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time because you don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast on skin and the skin stay moisturized for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> oil comes in a cobalt glass bottle with a long glass dropper which makes application very convenient.  </li>
            <li> it is too small to fit on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using lotion on my hands, but it didn&#x27;t really work long term...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I have to say this oil is fantastic.</li>
            <li> but this wasn&#x27;t very appealing unfortunately.</li>
            <li> i really enjoy using it and added it to my everyday routine !</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and I usually forget I even put it on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for a few days but really like the way it is quickly absorbed and leaves no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> , but not least, sometimes facial wash just does not get all of the eye make-up!</li>
            <li> After the first day of applying the oil to the rough patches, my skin was a lot softer.</li>
            <li> Exactly what expected.</li>
            <li> As a hair treatment I left it on my hair fifteen minutes before washing and washed my hair like normal.</li>
            <li> I mix this with my normal facial cleanser and shampoo/conditioner for added moisturization.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a late 50&#x27;s fair skinned guy) and he recommended various lotions that worked but never very well.  </li>
            <li> 100% pure, use it for my dry legs and sometimes in my hair.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough, I can truly say that it has replaced every other moisturizer that I used to buy, and I now look for all types of beauty products that contain argan oil in a pure form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;In one of the dry regions of the USA, I really need a moisturizer like argan oil because lotions do not typically work.</li>
            <li> i USE ON MY SKIN AND ON MY HAIR TO CALM DOWN THE FRIZZ.</li>
            <li> instanatural 100% Pure Argan Oilis a multipurpose, and it works on my skin and nails - where I really need it because my cuticles are messy.</li>
            <li> oil itself has a sort of sweet, earthy scent and is pale yellow/ brown in color.</li>
            <li> Both oils were out of their packages, banging around loose in the large box &#x3D; insufficient packing material.</li>
            <li> The convenient pump makes my new Argan Oil habit one that will last a lifetime!</li>
            <li> Since my hair would be way too short if I just cut off the frizzy bits, I just live with it.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because its still fairly new to me</li>
            <li> I hope it will take a couple of months to finish this bottle, but I&#x27;ll definitely order a new one once I run out.</li>
            <li> New hairs are starting to grow in also.</li>
            <li> I regret trying a new salon recently because my hair was over processed.</li>
            <li> For my friends who have dry skin, it really helps keep it moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I use this oil as a moisturizer on damp skin and it has really helped my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses this product, and says it works really well for dry and frizzy hair</li>
            <li> It worked very well on dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works really well to keep your heels from getting dry.  </li>
            <li> I have quite dry and damaged hair that could really benefit for argan oil, or so I&#x27;ve heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this really really helps with the dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, this stuff really shines for me when I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely clear with no characteristic aroma.</li>
            <li> Never knew how dry my face really was, until i used argan oil.</li>
            <li> and  I really like this for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I feel this has really helped my dry winter skin on my hands.</li>
            <li> In fact, it was the complete opposite; even-toned, extremely soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> The oil does have a slight odor but the benefits are so worth waiting for the smell to dissipate.</li>
            <li> Simple, organic beauty is possible thanks to InstaNatural.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use no more than 4-5 drops on long hair.</li>
            <li> The nutty scent is mild and goes away a few minutes after I apply it to my skin/face.</li>
            <li> , I now have smooth, soft hair that is not oily,  I have thick shoulder length hair, and I use about 2 pumps.  </li>
            <li> Most skincare products, even when touting natural, have included ingredients that I can&#x27;t pronounce, were made in labs, and are unnecessary.</li>
            <li> The smell is nutty but mild and you don&#x27;t smell it after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Josie Marrans is much nicer argan oil, this one is okay not impressed with the way it smells...</li>
            <li> Although a little goes a long way, I&#x27;m somewhat heavy-handed and probably used much more than necessary.  </li>
            <li> This oil spreads easily and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of problems with split ends right at the crown of my hair and have always had a problem keeping them down.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day and by the second and third day my hair gets super tangled and frizzy but with this oil after the third day my curls are still defined and soft with minor frizz.</li>
            <li> With the exception of hormonal break outs, I no longer get zits and my scars from past zits have lightened significantly.</li>
            <li> But not for face, caused major breakouts and clogged pores.</li>
            <li> If I will ever be in need of other oils I will be absolutely ordering it from here!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different kinds, but the kinds that they offer at places like CVS, Target, and other beauty suppliers often contain other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I mean, you cannot get more personal than this!</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it my hair was extremely frizzy</li>
            <li> purchased the first bottle but due to shipping and handling the content of the oil spilled out.</li>
            <li> My facial skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> One has eczema and he needs no other treatment</li>
            <li> When I first purchased their oil, the bottle opened in the package during delivery and oil leaked inside the box and all over the other products contained in my order.</li>
            <li> and that is a major</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try the other uses as recommended by the other reviewers, and will be back for more.</li>
            <li> No other compensation was received.</li>
            <li> My hair seems more shiny (not greasy), lasts in my hair longer as I usually need to reapply after day 2 or 3 as my ends look dry again.  </li>
            <li> And I do NOT have oily skin--it is sensitive, but normal (neither dry, nor oily, nor with a t-spot).</li>
            <li> color is a clear light canary yellow, and it definitely has an oily consistency, but it isn&#x27;t heavy.</li>
            <li> And, I don&#x27;t have to use near as much as I did from the  other brand.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair feel super soft and I only apply a few drops of it after I shower..</li>
            <li> not people this stuff takes my poor dry hair and makes it so nice and soft</li>
            <li> More than a few other oils.</li>
            <li> When I started to apply a few drop of argan oil onto my wet hair, my hair lost has decrease tremendously, leave a gentle feeling on my scalp every time I brush them.</li>
            <li> It is the rarest and most expensive oil on earth and is used mainly to moisturise hair, skin, nails, face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works well and absorbs quickly if your skin is slightly damp before applying or if you add the oil to your regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s also a very good moisturizer or a base before you put on your make up.</li>
            <li> The smell is very mild and is either not lasting or not strong enough to make my skin smell this way when I use it.</li>
            <li> First of all, the quality of the argan oil is not right.</li>
            <li> Then I add a little more to the very ends and finish by drying my hands on the surface of my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> In a couple of weeks it had transformed my greying, dry wild hair into manageable &amp; soft!  </li>
            <li> I use it as part of my regimen for dealing with my insanely thick, curly hair and it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> The combination gave me silky smooth legs for at least a week!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since put a couple of pumps on my long hair after showering and haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference on my curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Argan Oil is a long lasting moisturizer that is gentle and can be used anywhere.  </li>
            <li> what&#x27;s different in it, but I have clear skin, never had acne or breakouts</li>
            <li> Long lasting and very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li> Definitely the freshest argan oil I&#x27;ve used, (another brand had an &#x27;old&#x27; odor</li>
            <li> I was surprised with the quality of this argan oil given its low price point.</li>
            <li> I also use it at night after I wash my face, it helped with a tiny, old scar I had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 years old, and am starting to show some winkles/aging, etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes my skin soft, you do need to reapply several times during the day.</li>
            <li> I ask used it on my skin and the oil left my skin soft with a glow.</li>
            <li> After a lot of researching different companies, I decided to go with Insta Natural.</li>
            <li> Use daily and it leaves my skin soft and silky and has no odor.  </li>
            <li> The next day my hair feels so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> You only need a drop of two for your hair to make it look shiny and feel soft.</li>
            <li> Since the smell is barely there, it doesn&#x27;t leave any type of odor.</li>
            <li> It makes his hair soft and we can actually run a comb through it.  </li>
            <li> those two only as&lt;br /&gt;it works so well on my natural hair and hands.</li>
            <li> Thus far, I&#x27;ve only used this product as a moisturizer for my hands and nails, but my plan is to eventually treat my hair with it.</li>
            <li> It has left my hair moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> Apparently it&#x27;s a miracle solution to all your hair, skin, nail, and grooming problems?</li>
            <li> Surprised at how big the bottle is!</li>
            <li> I have also applied on my hair before a shower and that left my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> You are far too generous and this could last me until the day I die.  </li>
            <li> My mom (Asian) is in her early 60&#x27;s</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m honestly surprised it started making you look abit younger and gives your face the shine it needs!</li>
            <li> I use this oil as my night cream and my skin feels soft next day  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used it on my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I am constantly being told I look like my 20 year old daughters sister............</li>
            <li> I especially like its lack of odor, which helps anyone who is sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> Another thing that surprised me was the total lack of smell in this oil.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say really</li>
            <li> I am 70 years young and on a regular basis</li>
            <li> It also has natural anti-aging properties - the Moroccan peasant women use it as such.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the only Argan oil I have tried so far..</li>
            <li> Perhaps I used too much or it should be applied to wet hair</li>
            <li> I only need about two drops on the ends of my hair to help my hair feel soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> The only thing that surprised me is the smell.  </li>
            <li> It does not have much smell, which is as I expected.</li>
            <li> So far I have been using it for about a couple of weeks only</li>
            <li> It actually works on old, sun damaged skin.</li>
            <li> Try and find this price for 100% natural argon oil at the big beauty and cosmetic companies -- you can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It has given my hair a big boost in moisture and made it feel so soft</li>
            <li> Two products which are currently gaining favor among natural skin care enthusiasts are rosehip oil and argan oil.</li>
            <li> This is truly My secret beauty weapon:)</li>
            <li> But, after a few minutes, the oil sheen dissipates and the oil is absorbed.</li>
            <li> The scent disappears after the oil is absorbed (within a few minutes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ladies don&#x27;t waste your money if its not cold pressed..</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way -- purchased many for dry skin</li>
            <li> Even though it was thicker than other oils I have tried, it disappeared quickly into my dry winter skin, leaving it with renewed glow.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to those with dry skin or hair.  </li>
            <li> If you want a good makeup remover that won&#x27;t stink, sting or dry out the skin, try a few drops of this on a cotton pad before washing the face as usual.</li>
            <li> hair goes through a lot - from chemical straightening, to coloring and high temperature appliances such as blow dryers and flat irons.</li>
            <li> It is multi purpose and moisturizing just like other brands in a large bottle.</li>
            <li> Try it, it is natural and if you like it half as much as I do, you will be hooked.</li>
            <li> In any case, it&#x27;s basically spotty areas somewhere in your body that can get bumpy and dry, and when they really feel like acting up they&#x27;ll throw in some itching sensation.</li>
            <li> - Use it on either wet or dry hair, reduces frizziness, but useful for all hair types as it adds shine without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
            <li> It works well, but it doesn&#x27;t go on my thick, curly hair as easily as the product did, so I end up using several pumps of this oil as a hair serum.</li>
            <li> I simply chalked it up to an individual intolerance at the time as I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I put a few drops in (right in the problem areas)</li>
            <li> It rubbed right in and didn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I have skin that transitioning from normal to slightly dry.</li>
            <li> Many other argan oils I have used are much more expensive for less oil.</li>
            <li> The oil slightly irritated my skin when I first it on, making my face itch.</li>
            <li> Instanatural Argan oil is not as clear and is a little thicker than JM brand but absorbs into the skin the exact same way.</li>
            <li> First of all I seriously doubt if this is real argon oil or just some chemical in form of oil.</li>
            <li> a sidebar would be, that I had a very stressful day yesterday, so when this happens, I get super dry, itchy patches on my skin, usually a leg!  </li>
            <li> smell shows only how pure and unprocessed this Argan Oil is.</li>
            <li> The oil it was very stick and didn&#x27;t blend like the other argan oils</li>
            <li> I found this oil much thinner than other oil brands I had purchased and it did not soak into my skin as well.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it much on skin and other areas yet.  </li>
            <li> My hair was much softer and smoother than when I use other products.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s true that when using Argan Oil, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> its also a nice size and only a few drops in your hair that you leave in for about 20 mins than shampoo as usual</li>
            <li> It hardly has any scent, which I personally find really important when picking skincare or beauty products.</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li> My new miracle go-to oil for burns, dry skin and combination skin.</li>
            <li> I live in a desert climate and dry skin is a problem.</li>
            <li> and it holds all the moisture in since it is so dry where i live.  </li>
            <li> I used the other brand on the other side of my face and this insta natural on the right side of my face.</li>
            <li> While this oil is fine as a lubricant, it is not good as a moisturizer because it doesn&#x27;t absorb and stays on the surface all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, this is not a miracle oil, I&#x27;ve not seen a dramatic reduction in lines or wrinkles as I was expecting, but that is ok</li>
            <li> I use jojoba oil to massage face and neck but Argan oil is too sticky that I am afraid may result in too much pressure too skin if used as massage oil as you have to apply a lot more</li>
            <li> I have really brittle curly hair and the oil leaves it soft and manageable with out having to use harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the product for long.. but can comment that the service was very responsive to rectify a minor problem.</li>
            <li> She said that the oil should smell similar to olive oil and not a cow&#x27;s ass</li>
            <li> I am currently using 5 insta natural products daily</li>
            <li> My wife has been using the Insta Natural Argan Oil Hair Treatment and Elixir for the last several weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a short time but it makes my skin feel soft and supple with no greasy feeling whatsoever.</li>
            <li> My 65 year old skin, always prone to blemishes, simply soaks up the argan oil and looks terrific.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to exfoliate as often because later in the day or even the next morning my skin still feels soft.  </li>
            <li> It has a lovely hint of a fruity scent, very subtle.</li>
            <li> No dry skin for me.</li>
            <li> Smells a bit funky at first, but apparently it&#x27;s supposed to, and the smell fades after a few minutes in your hair anyway.</li>
            <li> If you use more than a few drops, then your hair will appear oily and limp.</li>
            <li> You only need a few drops and it goes on feeling greasy but then once absorbed in skin--</li>
            <li> My hair is sofe, shiny and not dry.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, frizzy hair when I first wash it and blow it dry</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> I first heard about argan oil from my hair stylist who was trying to sell me a tiny bottle of Argan oil mixed in with a ton of other junk for an exorbitant price.  </li>
            <li> I used exactly 1 drop and spread it all over my hands and rubbed it into my nail beds a little.</li>
            <li> It does smell different (stronger) from the other 100% pure certified organic argan oils I&#x27;ve used before it.  </li>
            <li> They are usually weak and bend and break easily.  </li>
            <li> After a few purchases of &#x27;argan&#x27; oil, only to find they were &#x27;blends&#x27; or somethign other than argan oil, I was pleasently surprised ot not only get this with a coupon but also to get genuine argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The product itself is ok, but I have very dry skin and was hoping to get some relief by using this oil, unfortunately it didn&#x27;t really help that.</li>
            <li> I tested it on dry and freshly washed, it is not absorbed by my skin as described.</li>
            <li> I have used the oil after a fresh wash, before a blow dry and on an average day just for moisture.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying argan oil and boy was this not a let down!</li>
            <li> Argan oil is a hot product right now in the cosmetics market, and you can find it in shampoos and premium lotions nowadays, and it’s always pretty expensive due to the extensive labor used to extract it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful when you use this on your hair, a very little goes a long way, and make sure to just get it on your ends and comb through.</li>
            <li> From a company that I was already a bit leery of, to get something that is almost the polar opposite of the product it purports to be, makes me highly suspicious, and I won&#x27;t take chances with either my skin or hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair, slightly wavy, quite thick but very fine texture.</li>
            <li> I generally use them at night as a deep skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have only used INSTANATURAL ORGANIC ARGAN OIL FOR HAIR, FACE, SKIN, &amp; NAILS on my nails, so I can’t really say if it has any other benefits or works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Everything I have listed above is not only the products that I have tested, but that is my complete daily skin care and hair care regimen.  </li>
            <li> Not long after I received my products from Insta-Natural</li>
            <li> Not sure if it will significantly reduce wrinkles/age spots yet, as I haven&#x27;t been using it that long.</li>
            <li> But I started using this Argan oil a few months ago, and my hair looks so much healthier and fuller!</li>
            <li> It has a funny, olive oil smell, and it&#x27;s too heavy for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I started using couple of drops on my hair face first and have started applying a few drops to my skin and hair as well.</li>
            <li> The product is pure argan oil, and because it absorbs right into your skin there is no greasy feeling left behind.</li>
            <li> I bought this for split end control and it works really good as long as you don&#x27;t put it on your scalp if you have thin hair as it weighs it down and feels greasy.  </li>
            <li> It really helps with dry cuticles and it also helps moisturize dry hair.</li>
            <li> My skin looks younger than my years, has a subtle glow, is smooth and supple, and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair weighed down at all.  </li>
            <li> It has really made a difference on my forehead, not over night but slow &amp; steady</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t really got a chance to compare it with any other brand out there!</li>
            <li> but my fine hair just turned into a big oily mess that wont style and weighs down my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within 1-2 days, my dry and red skin returned back to normal.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t seen any major changes in my skin have only use it for a short time</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brand of Argan oil because it&#x27;s certified organic, cold pressed, has a light texture, no smell and IT WORKS!  </li>
            <li> became intrigued by instanatural because of the seller&#x27;s gracious responses to those who reviewed it negatively and also by their in-depth product description, which they obviously took the time to write themselves rather than copy and repeat the generic information available anywhere on the net.</li>
            <li> It is very fast absorbing and leaves a thin shiny layer of oil on your skin after it has been applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells a little bit stronger than what I had been using previously, but the scent evaporates quickly and the oil is lightweight and makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how quickly, with only a little amount, already relieved my dry, cracked hands.</li>
            <li> also noticed that this Argan oil brand doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like some of the other brands I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Used it just a couple of times so far, but it has already softened my dry spots.</li>
            <li> You need less than the size of a dime in your hand and you can do your whole face...</li>
            <li> I have dry, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it costs half as much as the bottle I buy from my stylist.  </li>
            <li> Over the winter I developed itchy dry patches of skin on my hands, I put some argan oil on it and it went away after just three applications.</li>
            <li> The dropper&#x27;s opening is larger than what I consider normal so the oil comes out without you having to squeeze it, so be careful.</li>
            <li> There are many uses for this unbelievable product, I will name just a few of my favorites:&lt;br /&gt;•As</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and you won&#x27;t have that sticky icky feeling like some oils will leave behind.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair, which has gotten coarser over the past few years, has taken on a healthy sheen.</li>
            <li> works as a quick hairstyler as well, well for mens hair at least.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really follow up with my wife as it pertains to her health/beauty buys, but yesterday, she pinned me down (literally) and forcefully &#x27;repaired&#x27; the cuticle of my left index finger, and used the Argan oil to moisturize it.</li>
            <li> I have young single men asking me out.</li>
            <li> It has a very slight nutty odor (The same odor as the actual raw kernels when crushed), which should be an indicator that it&#x27;s the real deal, but it dissipates very quickly.</li>
            <li> so how can a small amount be enough for all my hair right?</li>
            <li> Using a little more on the ends and a little less near the scalp.</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but this oil works great on eczema &amp; any dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, my heels felt smooth on the couch, and not in danger of &amp;#34;catching&amp;#34; on the threads in that dry, icky way.</li>
            <li> My face is much softer but the wrinkles show only a slight improvement, I&#x27;m 66 and always looking for a miracle face lift in a bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair which gets frizzy when it&#x27;s dry and after applying this oil it defined my curls and left my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> This is finally a product that gives shine, encourages my natural wave and takes away the dry look from my ends.</li>
            <li> As It Should Be, With A Very Slight Olive-Like Scent Which Is Completely Normal And Natural.</li>
            <li> It is amber-colored as it should be, with a very slight olive-like scent which is completely normal and natural.</li>
            <li> My hair has even grown about half an inch where normally it just breaks off!  </li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product to those with fine hair, because it may leave your hair feeling a little heavy.</li>
            <li> I believe this is also the real stuff as the consistency, color, and slight odor are the same as the type sold in the aforementioned store.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and it makes it look greasy.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed quickly and definitely helps my skin in this cold weather.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one of the few times I encountered a brand that bottles pure argan oil.</li>
            <li> As with all 100% pure argan oils, the oil just felt way too heavy upon application.  </li>
            <li> I naturally have curly, frizzy hair that is very dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> Adds shine like no other, and lasts long in my hair</li>
            <li> At first &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34;, the Argan Oil seems a bit greasy, but a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> This winter I developed a very dry area around my mouth and tried several different products (none of which worked well) before trying this one.  </li>
            <li> My husband likes the quick absorption of the Moroccan Argan Oil without the oily feel or heavy scent of other lotions.</li>
            <li> Like argan oil, rosehip is very high in essential fatty acids.</li>
            <li> love that this replaces a host of other less green products--hair masks, cuticle oils,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how good your product is if there is bad customer service I&#x27;m notbuying again.</li>
            <li> I always read the reviews on products that I try to find out what kinds of things I should look for, both good and bad.</li>
            <li> Usually I use a little bit of olive oil to treat its dryness but now, I am done with dry and damaged hair :)</li>
            <li> I like to use a little on my hair when it&#x27;s dry to smooth my split ends and keep frizz down.</li>
            <li> I have been using just a few drops daily for my hands and already my nails are healthier and my cuticles are back to normal!  </li>
            <li> I have mid length hair (down to mid back) and live in southern ca.</li>
            <li> I am so very pleased that I purchased this product in time for the cold, dry winter season.</li>
            <li> It is not much of a scent, however it does slightly smell like an unused cloth bandaid when first applying.</li>
            <li> I have used this product on my hair and face as well as dry areas on my body (I live in a very dry climate).</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it on my feet or hands as I&#x27;m busy using up other products there, but I am encouraged enough that I will try those areas next.</li>
            <li> : Little goes a long way Bottle is large and price is</li>
            <li> A little pure organic oil goes a long way.</li>
            <li> But, I mainly used it all over my body because I was itching everywhere due to extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> product also has the benefits of being organic and extremely concentrated which means that it&#x27;s much healthier for your body and is likely to last a lot longer than other products which may need to be used in much larger amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has slight nutty smell to it..which is normal for Argan oil..</li>
            <li> it came broken and ruined other items with it , on star is more than a lot..</li>
            <li> The spoiled or rotten smell that a lot of people refers to, is a natural thing of argan oil, is not a fantastic aroma, but it doesnt mean its fresh!</li>
            <li> I have very soft, peeling nails, and have tried products specifically for those issues, but no success.  </li>
            <li> Normally would have to wash my hair everyday in order to make it manageable, but this product allows me to simply comb and recurl a bit a second or even third day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it a bit on my face as well, nothing dramatic, but nicely absorbed and soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 67 yrs old and have tried all manner of moisturizers (I wish I had the money I&#x27;ve spent over the years on stuff that didn&#x27;t work too!).  </li>
            <li> I am 30 years old and have had moderate to severe adult acne for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> I keep it in the fridge as I do with other natural oils.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of argan oil products and it works very well, if not better than the more expensive ones sold by QVC.</li>
            <li> I do not know what some of the other reviewers are complaining about as far as the smell.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much for this, a little goes a long way for both skin &amp; hair.</li>
            <li> I received a product that claims to be argan oil from insta natural but the there are other stuff inside it.</li>
            <li> left hair really oily even when using a small amount, only use it over night and wash it out in the morning.</li>
            <li> I flat iron it daily.</li>
            <li> I simply apply a very small amount on my palm and massage it sparingly right onto my scalp and extend it throughout the hair to the ends.  </li>
            <li> Also, I find that if I use a little on my face, it leaves it soft and glowing!!</li>
            <li> but I am used to the subtle fresh scent of argon oil that I have been using.....</li>
            <li> At first I received a very rancid and stale bottle.</li>
            <li> Buy the stuff if the Amazon price is within your price point and you want to try it; at this price, the 4oz makes as much sense as a small portion (especially since you can also use it as a body oil, etc).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it enough or long enough to know if this merits 5 starts, but I like it.</li>
            <li> A 4 oz bottle such as this will last a LONG time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Long story short, I am in my twenties, male</li>
            <li> This big bottle will last quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> You only need two or three drops of this at a time for anything so this should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for about 14 days, and even though i do have a couple minor breakouts, i can instantly see results with the texture of my skin, it seems alot smoother.</li>
            <li> I got my second bottle today with no packaging issues :) unfortunately it still smells pretty awful but after reading some of the other reviews, I&#x27;ve found out that that&#x27;s pretty normal and actually means that it&#x27;s fresh (?).</li>
            <li> I did also try it on my dry scratchy elbows which I get with the hot dry summers, just a few drops in my palm and rub in</li>
            <li> I usually put on oil right after shower when body still wet in the shower instead of putting on lotion.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is just as nice and so much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I used get a facial threading about every 3-4 months (maybe less frequent...)</li>
            <li> but so far they look less obvious now.</li>
            <li> I use it regularly under my eyes and on neck, and less frequently on the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> The only products I  use on my hair is the normal shampoo and conditioner but have not found one to tame my hair.</li>
            <li> Since i have used it for my nails they have not broken off like they usually do.</li>
            <li> The bottle will last a long time....</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it was starting to fall out,</li>
            <li> My hair was so oily and flat and looked damp that I had to take a shower again.</li>
            <li> (I have 22 inch long hair and use on face daily).</li>
            <li> You only need one pump for long hair.</li>
            <li> and it will last a LONG time.  </li>
            <li> Long story short</li>
            <li> This oil is also fast-absorbing and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I have not been using it for long enough to see what it can do with continued use</li>
            <li> My nails never grow this long without applying multiple coats of a nail hardening product.</li>
            <li> After I shower, I&#x27;ll put a few squirts of this in my hair (concentrating on the ends), then follow up with my normal routine of gel.  </li>
            <li> This argan oil is just as good as the very expensive ones out there on QVC and other shopping channels.  </li>
            <li> Please save yourself the trouble and don&#x27;t buy the cheap crap, buy Josie or something more legit.</li>
            <li> first glance / feel, I was apprehensive to apply it my face as it is somewhat thick and oily.</li>
            <li> My hair ends up soft and manageable without feeling weighed down or greasy.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shine and soft without weighting it down.</li>
            <li> I use this oil directly on my skin, in my home made body butters, and anytime I need a little extra boost for my hair.  </li>
            <li> This oil is really nice and lightweight, but I think that I&#x27;m a little wary of its organic certifications.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hair and it definitely adds some shine, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it makes my face break out bad!</li>
            <li> , this bottle should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> so it will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> As a super added bonus, I had some very fresh and painful blisters on my fingers - the oil moisturized them and took the swelling down.  </li>
            <li> My hands were so dry and ashy-looking today that washing them after restroom visits was surely a necessary  but dreaded task.</li>
            <li> If you have dry ones and needing something extra so they don&#x27;&#x27;t crack and bleed</li>
            <li> Finally solved my itchy dry winter skin problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my hands and some various dry spot.</li>
            <li> To keep my hair moisturized throughout the day, I mixed the argan oil with my dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is suffering from dry hair/skin.</li>
            <li> skin has always been dry, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> Too soon to say if its making any different, but my skin seems fresher/not dry.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with dry patches of skin on the back of my neck for years.  </li>
            <li> I have various dry spots on my skin - ankles, knees, elbows -</li>
            <li> It does work well, and it has definitely helped with my dry skin, but it hasn&#x27;t been a miracle product for me (yet).  </li>
            <li> I have been using it on my dry skin, and it seems to be improving daily.  </li>
            <li> I have always had a problem finding a moisturizer that takes care of my dry skin, and I&#x27;ve finally found it.  </li>
            <li> My hair tends to dry out a bit in the summer, and the dreaded frizzies that come with extra humidity around here.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a daily leave in conditioner because I have extremely dry hair.</li>
            <li> Especially to those who suffer with psoriasis or any severe dry skin problems.</li>
            <li> I use a drop or two at bedtime for my face and wake up with soft, supple skin that has noticeably less lines on my forehead and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have dry cuticles and hair because I work outside a lot.  </li>
            <li> It actually leaves my hands feeling dry after I use the product.</li>
            <li> It has definitely helped with my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this for a short time (several days) for a skin rash of unknown origin.  </li>
            <li> with the InstaNatural 100% Argan Oil, I followed the directions carefully and since I have short hair now, I only used 2 drops of the Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> And trust me, this bottle will last me a long long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in bathtub--a few drops in my bath water makes my entire body skin soft</li>
            <li> Obviously I still have split ends but it seems this oil stops my dry ends from getting worse which gives me more time to grow out my hair and not get it trimmed every few months.</li>
            <li> The next morning I couldn&#x27;t see a single skin peel.</li>
            <li> As I get older I&#x27;ve had increasing issues with eczema and just plain dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> I used to loose 70-80 hairs on daily basis but now it reduced to 20.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t like heavy, greasy  anything on my face, but after turning 30 something, my skin got extremely dry, and I had to give this bottle a try.</li>
            <li> I am going to have to use the more expensive Josie Maran, which somehow, they have managed to eradicate any repugnant smells from (Josie Maran only smells slightly nutty.)</li>
            <li> Works just as well as other, more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> My underarms and the back of my arms broke out in a very dry and cracking rash.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and gets ichy especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate, and I need something heavy duty to keep my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> This is going to be something i will use ever other day, im going to make this last as long as possible.</li>
            <li> As a moisturizer &amp;#34;Organ Oil&amp;#34; made my hair soft and controlled frizz, although it seems a little bit greasy.</li>
            <li> I am dark skinned, with brown hair that is fine and thin.  </li>
            <li> This is golden, but very thick, almost viscose and cloudy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does have a slight odor that I don&#x27;t really like, but it&#x27;s certainly not strong enough to prevent me from using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair looks dry and flat.</li>
            <li> I can’t really comment on the condition of my nails as they’re so hard anyway</li>
            <li> I ran out and was forced to pick up a small bottle at a large health food store which was five times more expensive for the same product with the same organic certifications.</li>
            <li> In the winter it gets very dry where I live and lotions do not cut it for my skin and my hair is a frizzed out dry mess.  </li>
            <li> When they say 100% pure, they really mean it.</li>
            <li> but it honestly stunk so bad that I didn&#x27;t want to put it on</li>
            <li> Well, as much as I love this product, I&#x27;m afraid my allegiance isn&#x27;t in goose step with my wallet.  </li>
            <li> Well, as much as I love this product, I&#x27;m afraid my allegiance isn&#x27;t in goose step with my wallet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oils are not thick like some others I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I use.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle did not state that it was cold pressed by the Berber community, like the more high-end, &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This oil looks clear when it&#x27;s one drop on your skin, but if you put some into another small bottle as I did for travel purposes, it is definitely yellowish-gold in color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have paid much more per ounce for cold pressed argon oil.</li>
            <li> I have noticed it does clear my zits within a few days</li>
            <li> So even one drop over my long dense hair</li>
            <li> have a long and curly hair and the Argan Oil</li>
            <li> Well, I wish I had learned about this a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> My daughter uses it on her long, long hair.</li>
            <li> Goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I either add a few drops of the oil when washing my hair (after last rinse) and my hair is soft and without frizz after or add the oil after I washed my hair (while still wet).</li>
            <li> Plus I have all grey hair now</li>
            <li> It just takes a few drops for my nearly waist length hair.</li>
            <li> Why did it take so long for me to find a product like this?</li>
            <li> A drop goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was surprised by a few things.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking to InstaNatural argan oil for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times in my hair sparingly since I bought it and like it so far.</li>
            <li> The scent is natural, nutty and green, so it is not perfumed.  </li>
            <li> Just one or two pumps goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> When I blow dried my hair it was so manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li> How have I lived this long without having used this before?  </li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I am trying to grow out my hair long so that I can donate it.</li>
            <li> and I also use this on minor scrapes for my daughters.  </li>
            <li> Try it and see for yourself, remember that 1 drop goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;bb</li>
            <li> We’ve used argan oil indirectly as a minor constituent of massage oil</li>
            <li> used the lotion for a few weeks and was surprised to notice the radical improvement in my skin and hands.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> It helps brushing through long tresses.</li>
            <li> glass bottle with a long dropper.</li>
            <li> , hands uselessly slipping over the door handle until my wife finally let me out.</li>
            <li> the long dropper cap and inert fragrance..</li>
            <li> I look forward to seeing what the long term results will be</li>
            <li> They have grown out long and none of them have cracked or chipped.</li>
            <li> (You don&#x27;t have to use a lot because it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting lots of compliments on my long hair now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I apply it to my hands and drag my fingers through the last 6-8 inches while my hair is still damp.</li>
            <li> after long research on argan oil</li>
            <li> No real need for extra creams, although I do still use them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Apply to wet hair just before blow drying to eliminate friction and prevent hair breakage, or apply to curly hair to give it a polished look that will last all day long.</li>
            <li> The price of this organic oil is not really an issue after you see how long this bottle will last.  </li>
            <li> I have very frizzy thick wavy</li>
            <li> My brown hair is straight and thick.</li>
            <li> the next morning my eye lids look like prunes, had no issue with bio oil doing that, tried it a couple of times, with same results) doesn&#x27;t seem to hydrate my skin as well as the previous product I used.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair and put a little bit in my palms and rub it together then into my hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered two bottles and one of them was broken, I called and they send another bottle out right way.  </li>
            <li> The cap was barely screwed on and over half the bottle of liquis was leaked out</li>
            <li> For a long time after bleaching my hair, it looked  frizzy, dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> After doing long research over several other products I came across this</li>
            <li> all the FRIZZY baby hairs all around my crown are soft and tame.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so this size should last awhile even though I use it for everything for the entire family.</li>
            <li> seems large cosmetic companies are adding argan oil to everything and charging ridiculous prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That brand was so much more expensive than InstaNatural!  </li>
            <li> I actually used it on one leg and not the other</li>
            <li> if only I could get a lifelong discount!</li>
            <li> I was using a different brand, but switched to this based on the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and wavy and it makes the waves just pop!</li>
            <li> Out of other oils I have purchased last month ( Jojoba oil, Rosehip oil and Grapeseed oil)</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this a long time ago!</li>
            <li> I just recently started using Argan oil for treating my dry/cracked hands due to winter.</li>
            <li> While it does not have the “gift box” packaging other Argan oils have, it also does not have the same price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not personally tried any other brands, but I do like the bottle and the pump that the InstaNatural comes with.</li>
            <li> I was always under the impression if you had an oily face you did not need to put more oil on it;  I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> A long time that is!</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s a small price to pay for a natural product!  </li>
            <li> It also kept my skin feeling moisturized all day long!</li>
            <li> I did was went back to my other brand when using argan oil on my face, but continued to use this on my body and hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bigger than any other one, I&#x27;ve ever seen before.</li>
            <li> the effects last between showers, which are every other day.</li>
            <li> ,When I used it, I just needed to use one application of it, with other creams I had to use two different creams to cover my dry areas.</li>
            <li> I thought if there were some way to make a difference, with very little trouble or effort, I would be willing to do it.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it very long, but it does seem to be working well on my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I would be very careful putting it into your hair unless you are planning a deep oil treatment and then washing it out.</li>
            <li> I read that argan oil has a very long shelf life anyway.  </li>
            <li> I finally called Instanatural directly and told them about the terrible smells of the 2 bottles that I ordered from Amazon, and without any reservation, the representative kindly said that it should not smell so bad (and that they&#x27;ve been in talks with Amazon about how they store the product) and sent me an entirely new bottle FREE OF CHARGE.</li>
            <li> so I am going to use it on the dry areas on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Also I have dry skin on my hands ( washing my hands with antibacterial soap before I touch my patients)</li>
            <li> hair was oily after I blow dry.</li>
            <li> have also used the oil on my dry spots that appear every so often.  </li>
            <li> to my mother, who has dealt with a lifetime of frizzy hair and dry skin.</li>
            <li> helped me a lot to reduce the frizz and with nourishment of my dry hair.</li>
            <li> recommendation is everyone with severe dry skin must try this out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> truly 100% Argan oil!!!!&lt;br /&gt;i have oily scalp and dry ends</li>

            <li> I should point out that my skin is naturally dry</li>
            <li> I was hoping that it would help with dry skin</li>
            <li> After about 3-4 days the dry spots were basically gone.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>

            <li> I use for my face, eye area, course hair, and dry hands.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately i couldn&#x27;t use it for more than a few days because my mom decided to keep it</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using the product for several days I found that it made my hair, skin and nails shinier and covered up my scars and skin imperfections very well with a thin layer of oil.</li>
            <li> A few drops is enough to cover the entire face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an active person and wash my hair almost daily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a myth that you can only use oils on very dry skin; as long as you&#x27;re only using a few drops, this oil will work well even on combo skin like mine and won&#x27;t turn you greasy or make you break</li>
            <li> It is Organic, which is very very important for me when I&#x27;m looking for Argan oil and other oils, and cold pressed too.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging</li>
            <li> and there wasn&#x27;t a single spill.</li>
            <li> I use it every single day.</li>
            <li> I used too much and my hair turned out very limp because it was weighted down.)  </li>
            <li> No more dry flaky skin on my face, my lips no longer peel and my hands are soft again.</li>
            <li> Will not repurchase, I have dry skin on my face, usually use bio oil, wanted something natural.</li>
            <li> At 47, I have very dry skin, dry feet and EXTREMELY dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li> I have hair that flows past my bottom, which I dye, blowdry, and straighten frequently.</li>
            <li> I had excessive oil on my t zone, with break outs all over my face and being over 40 years old, uhhggg.  </li>
            <li> The one suggestion I would have is that the dispenser bottle have a small nozzle on it - sort of like a soft soap bottle.</li>
            <li> knew it works for me, faint smell is sweet</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way, so I expect it to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and during Chicago winters I used to apply 2-3 moisturizers at a time and my face still got very dry.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller and in few hours or less she responded and sent me a new dropper.</li>
            <li> I use it on the ends of my hair (it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it greasy), on my skin - especially under my eyes (doesn&#x27;t break me out), and my boyfriend also sometimes uses it to soothe his eczema.</li>
            <li> I rub my hands together then apply to the middle of my hair down to the ends.  </li>
            <li> It not only made my legs extremely hydrated, it gave me the closest shave in the history of ever!</li>
            <li> Big difference from other brands-my hair loves it!</li>
            <li> I can actually put it in my hair, which the other ones were too greasy to do!  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way - just one squirt pump onto your fingertips will moisturize your entire face &amp; hands.  </li>
            <li> A little bit will go a long way and it&#x27;ll last forever.  </li>
            <li> Only a little is needed and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Highly not recommended..</li>
            <li> you were ever afraid to try Argan Oil, InstaNatural offers a LIFETIME 100% Satisfaction Money Back Guarantee, so it you&#x27;re not completely satisfied, you can return the bottle and get a full refund, but I know you won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> my hands were DRY!</li>
            <li> (I have combination skin, so I put the product on my cheeks and dry patches and then I move onto the rest of my face and neck!</li>
            <li> it took the dry spots away within a day!</li>
            <li> and i used this on my ankles and any dry patches!</li>
            <li> but you can only use it for hair if you used half the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Before I dry my hair, I some to my wet hair.</li>
            <li> The lines didn&#x27;t appear white anymore, and they were less visible.</li>
            <li> I have tried Argan Oil in the past from different manufactures with mixed results</li>
            <li> This oil/company knows what they are doing, where else are you getting a 4oz GLASS bottle that is actually USDA certified for less than $24, look around amazon and go to the stores</li>
            <li> I have tried it with wet hair before styling, with dry hair after styling</li>
            <li> My hair, face, and body just drinks in the Argan Oil and makes my wrinkles less obvious and my skin feeling moist without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> As I have aged, and also returned to a northern climate, dry skin has been an issue....</li>
            <li> and there has definitely been less cracking and splitting.</li>
            <li> I’ve used it both on wet hair and dry hair.</li>
            <li> The way I use this  oil is I towel dry my wet hair after I wash it</li>
            <li> I like to mix a little with my leave-in treatment after showering, and with regular use, repairs dry, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> It is helping to clear up a dry patch that I&#x27;ve had for months as a result of the hard water in UK taps.</li>
            <li> Tried the oil on my hair which  had become very dry and almost brittle, after I stopped using chemical products on my hair when I had my son.</li>
            <li> husband loves it for his very dry hands and nails</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> which can be very dry.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and Argan oil helps me.that oil makes my skin healthier .I</li>
            <li> Now that Dec is almost here and the air is very dry, I have been using the product on my skin and hair.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have dandruff, just over 50 and very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Then I used it on my feet because the skin on my feet became very dry and cracky.  </li>
            <li> I also use it in my VERY dry hair in between shampoos to add shine.........</li>
            <li> The oil also has softened and moisturized my feet, which get very dry in winter.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry hair, so after washing my hair, I put this in it while it&#x27;s still damp.</li>
            <li> tend to make my skin very dry</li>
            <li> Im using this for scalp, and helping me out for my very dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I have very dry skin, nails, and hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair gets very dry</li>
            <li> the only drawback is the bottle leaks (i just keep it in another container to prevent a mess and collect the leakage)</li>
            <li> Only a few drops go a long way!</li>
            <li> Argan oil has a faintly nutty, though not unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li> It has a mild natural smell that isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> All pros to this product - can&#x27;t think of a single reason not to recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I tried using this for hair after seeing argan oil commercial on TV but this brand is so greasy even just a little bit makes my hair a big oily sticky mess that seems lifeless and wont style.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the pungent, sour smell...unsure if that&#x27;s what other reviewers are calling &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit and it soaks in..  </li>
            <li> The little bumps I used to have on the back of my arms - gone!</li>
            <li> ( I only lost little oil</li>
            <li> The bottle of Instanatural Argan Oil is a little different from what I have used before because it has a dropper.</li>
            <li> I put on after morning shower, on face, and then run hands through my hair to leave a little extra oil there - keeps away the frizzies.  </li>
            <li> I actually even believe that it absorbs a little quicker than JM.</li>
            <li> I simply use one little pump, which coats the tips of my fingers, to moisturize my face before putting my makeup on in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Only a little is needed.</li>
            <li> I personally use it as a base beneath my daily moisturizer, but other with less dry skin may be able to get away with just this.</li>
            <li> I put some in my conditioner and when i get dry skin due to the weather i put some lotion in my hand and then squirt some of this Argon oil in the lotion, mix it in hand and apply, it works wounders.</li>
            <li> It is also noteworthy that he is a busser at a busy restaurant for work (really hard on hands also).  </li>
            <li> Very little amount is needed and the amount in the bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> it helps to look better when you feel badly.</li>
            <li> Okay, I must have gotten a bad batch of this or something.</li>
            <li> Found this Insta natural and it was much cheaper and still cold pressed and 100 % organic.</li>
            <li> I now have a road map on my forehead from 1st an overdose of thyroid meds &amp; it has only gotten worse with treatment of the Lyme because I can&#x27;t think clearly</li>
            <li> It also has a strange smell not sure if it is the oil mixed with the oily cardboard...</li>
            <li> and only after using it for a few weeks I can notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not tongues it too often.</li>
            <li> I had been using Avon but wanted to try something different, and this was just too heavy.  </li>
            <li> You really only need a few drops.</li>
            <li> not much else to say...</li>
            <li> The packaging says you only need a few drops</li>
            <li> I use it after a shower when my skin is still wet, then blot off the remaining water with a towel.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is a lifelong skin care treatment.</li>
            <li> no chemicals added from unknown sources.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I rely heavily on reviews, so I want to be as helpful as possible.      </li>
            <li> I only use a few drops a day--less than the size of a dime.</li>
            <li> Not really.</li>
            <li> Look at the 1 star and beleive me, this is not real argan oil.</li>
            <li> Just be careful, argan oil can clog pores despite the claim to the contrary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days, but if my opinion changes, I&#x27;ll add to my review.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased poor quality Argan oil before (even some from Morocco), but this is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few nights later, I pulled out the bottle again to repeat the process.</li>
            <li> After a lifetime spent out of doors, my skin is once again moist;  my hair glistens.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> Seriously, only a few drops.</li>
            <li> However, the last few years I&#x27;ve noticed my hair getting thinner, brittle and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I only use a few drops to help my nails and skin every day</li>
            <li> sometimes i&#x27;ll put maybe 3 drops on the ends of my wet hair when i get out of the shower for a leave in treatment.  </li>
            <li> (Be careful around the eyes--</li>
            <li> Just be careful where you put it.</li>
            <li> ;  It felt way too heavy and oily to be used a facial moisturizer</li>
            <li> I tried it on my hair but the effect is not really noticeable.</li>
            <li> and I will repurchase when the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> I never really thought oil would work for me since my skin is so oily</li>
            <li> I add in a couple of drops on essential oil (for scent) with a few drops of the oil and use on damp skin after a shower</li>
            <li> I used this on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> and i only used a few drops&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I have suffered from a wide variety of issues with my nails over the years e.g. cracking, flaking, spots, fungus, etc.</li>
            <li> She left it on for a few hours and then washed it off.  </li>
            <li> I received it in the mail sooner than expected and the quality of the oil is as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I also like to use this as a heavy duty moisturizer after using my facial brush or any exfoliant.  </li>
            <li> The product works as expected.</li>
            <li> so I am curious to see if it will help this winter.  </li>
            <li> I like it that the bottle comes with a dropper because you really only need a few drops.</li>
            <li> I used it on my hair a bunch as well as my cuticles while reviewing it over the last few weeks.</li>
            <li> The item was as I expected.</li>
            <li> Possible because of the same reason the rosehip oil was stale and old that it sat on a shelf in amazon&#x27;s warehouse</li>
            <li> Be careful of this dropper.</li>
            <li> that it only takes a few seconds to disappear into the skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my hair while its wet</li>
            <li> Makes me break out if I use it every night, so only use a few nights a week.</li>
            <li> IT IS NOT REAL ARGAN OIL.</li>
            <li> It got rid of any rough patches on my feet, hands, knees and elbows in about two to three days of once a day application</li>
            <li> It got rid of any rough patches on my feet, hands, knees and elbows in about two to three days of once a day application</li>
            <li> I expected my face to be oily after hours</li>
            <li> This product was not what I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> it was the same product I have been using for a few years now</li>
            <li> and this is helping a lot after only a few applications .I</li>
            <li> Not really the cure-</li>
            <li> acne/heals scars/raises your grandmother back from the dead.</li>
            <li> Only need a few drops.</li>
            <li> , that is a big plus in my book as I don&#x27;t like to use a lot of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Came as expected, timely.  </li>
            <li> though, so be careful.</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> The bottle came with a pump which squeezed out a tiny amount of product which I love because I HATE dropper type of packaging since I  never fully control the amount of product coming out.</li>
            <li> I have red, thick, course hair and can spend tons of money buying all the different moisturizing products out there that offer no results!  </li>
            <li> I live in an area that has hard water and use shampoo bars, SI my ends are sometimes a little dry.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve been sick and unable to smell anything, I&#x27;ve used the oil more extensively, and it really is a cosmetic wonder.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I actually prefer it and, in the interest of experimentation, have also been rubbing a drop into my scalp after showering (I have very short hair) and have noticed none of my usual itchiness or slight dandruff.</li>
            <li> I recently completed chemotherapy, and my skin was looking pale and blotchy.</li>
            <li> quality argan oil that is diluted and not pure.</li>
            <li> in a bit of inattention i had the pump facing the wrong way and shot it right on my blouse.</li>
            <li> Oh well, less than $18 down the drain, no big deal</li>
            <li> It has a slight odor--not &#x27;fishy&#x27;, not unless you&#x27;ve had some strange experiences with cod liver oil, though.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I have long black hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so only use a few drops at a time.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the Argan, but they are growing like crazy and are very strong and hard.</li>
            <li> I currently wear my hair natural and usually have a hard time keeping it hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Literally half of the amount is required of my previous Argan Oil brand, so definitely a cost saver!  </li>
            <li> and I appreciate how quickly this product absorbs into the skin without making it feel super sticky and nasty.</li>
            <li> I have used other products on her hair and I have found them to be sticky, greasy, way too heavy, and in a number of other ways inadequate and definitely not giving the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It offers the same benefits, there is no odor to the oil (other than the usual small “earthy” scent that is typical of Argan oil)</li>
            <li> Other brands were not pure or burned my life eyes when used as a all over face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> no more rough cuticles and growth &amp; appearance are overall improved)</li>
            <li> and my cuticles are a lot less dry.  </li>
            <li> I do also use it on my cuticle and notice it is less dry</li>
            <li> Previously, I was using coconut oil but found it was clogging my pores while still leaving some dry spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> It softened my hair and makes it look less dry.</li>
            <li> Very dry skin with dark spots  works well with softening them</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy, and I have oily skin.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a really long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Trust me while experimenting with this a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> find a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t do much other than making my cheeks feel less dry</li>
            <li> It is extremely moisturizing and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I only use a small amount at a time because a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> This bottle will last forever because you need very little.</li>
            <li> The other company I bought from I sent an email because I ordered 4 different bottles &amp; 1 was missing half the bottom</li>
            <li> I no longer have to endure dry skin, weak fingernails, or the disappointed looks of loved ones.</li>
            <li> I wash my face as usual in the evening using Cetaphil and occasionally adding in some microdermbrasion &#x27;sand&#x27; to give my face some exfoliation.</li>
            <li> inexpensive compared to the other brands...</li>
            <li> My damage is due to prolonged chronic diseases &amp; the medication&#x27;s side effects on my skin &amp; hair plus scars from surgeries.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I can write the name of the other company</li>
            <li> but just the other turned around.  </li>
            <li> I was not compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t wear make up over the argan oil like other people have written.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy this product and other Instanatural Products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the smell is standard, but I can&#x27;t argue the results.</li>
            <li> I got this after reading other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Extremely please with the quality, cost and size of the product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other uses besides for my hair.</li>
            <li> It also seemed to make my skin break out where the other oil I had purchased did not.</li>
            <li> and you only have to use a small amount</li>
            <li> They had to resend it because the shipment was lost, but they were quite gracious and extremely helpful.</li>
            <li> One of the tests I do is to put the JM oil on one side of my face and body and the oil I&#x27;m trying on the other.  </li>
            <li> Other oils won&#x27;t absorb or they smell or there is some glaring difference, like viscosity.  </li>
            <li> I have used other Argan oils, but some leave your hair looking greasy.</li>
            <li> It seems to work as well as the other though.</li>
            <li> After that I rub the coated cuticles on the other hands&#x27; cuticles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly like a hand cream...</li>
            <li> I usually have to use a prescription steroid cream daily by my nose,</li>
            <li> The other reviews are spot on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other types of oils on my face and nothing works like this.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> This stuff is all the adjectives together that you would apply to any other  product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought some other products from instanaturals, and they continue to impress.</li>
            <li> Like all facial oils this does have that slick oil feel afterwards but</li>
            <li> However, I do like the fact that it is organic and does not contain any other ingredients.</li>
            <li> The odor is a bit stronger than other argan oils I have used before.  </li>
            <li> just a small amount is enough.</li>
            <li> Every other night, I do a scalp massage using it.</li>
            <li> I have tried others and they are perfumed and contain other junk.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable 100-Day 100% Money Back Guarantee.</li>
            <li> I know we are supposed to use it on hair, but I wanted to try some other ways to use the oil as well.</li>
            <li> Then I repeated this on my other heel.</li>
            <li> Upon reading other reviews, I thought this product would help with my acne</li>
            <li> and I plan to explore their other high-quality ORGANIC (ooh la la) products.</li>
            <li> regards to usage, a few drops really do go a long way</li>
            <li> I decided to try it based upon the other reviews for use on my beard.  </li>
            <li> After a couple weeks use (about every other day at night) I saw an improvement in my beard.  </li>
            <li> Little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> If you are not satisfied, then you will receive your money back, no questions asked.</li>
            <li> for using it on my hands and nails, I like it as I would any other.</li>
            <li> argan oil has a light amber color and a very faint nutty scent.</li>
            <li> Use as a moisturizer on my face, mix with other oils as a carrier oil and on and on.</li>
            <li> I never had a problem with any argan oils before, but this one is extremely drying.</li>
            <li> She back of her hair is a little tangled as that&#x27;s how she sleeps, and I put just a little bit on her hair and her curls come out.</li>
            <li> When I first tried it, I had a sample from an expensive designer brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this oil at first because 4 fl oz of argan oil at $25 (sale, $50 retail) is suspicious, I haven&#x27;t used argan oil before</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> The bottle says other uses for acne treatment.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It acts just like any other oils.  </li>
            <li> and I no longer add any other oil or perfume to it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s due to developing sweat glands.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products, but to no avail.  </li>
            <li> This makes my hair shiny and bouncy, I use it as a daytime moisturizer but the uses are endless.</li>
            <li> Had it for two months and it smells rancid now, hadn&#x27;t used it for a couple weeks and when went to use it the other day it wreaks.</li>
            <li> It soaks in and nourishes, unlike other products which only coat hair and make it look slick and sticky.  </li>
            <li> This product, on the other hand, does not give me a &amp;#34;helmet hair&amp;#34; if you know what I am talking about.  </li>
            <li> I only use one small pump.</li>
            <li> I have used other argan oils, wanted to try this one out.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need any other moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I put 8 drops on my hair every other day.  </li>
            <li> I hope this manufacturer adds other products to their organic argan oil line-up.  </li>
            <li> have compared ingredients with other brands that are 5x the price</li>
            <li> As for the effects, my skin felt plump and moisturized after using the oil and not overly greasy like other carrier oils.</li>
            <li> other brands Instanatural is my brand.</li>
            <li> I would order again from InstaNatural and plan to check out their other products.</li>
            <li> , why did I finally take the plunge and purchase this when I was so reluctant in the past?</li>
            <li> A few drops goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair extremely greasy</li>
            <li> After using this for only a few weeks I already have healthier hair and skin!  </li>
            <li> possible years past</li>
            <li> but it can  be used to cure other ailments...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to other products on the market, the price on the InstaNatural is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Argan oil by other brands &amp; never had any issues.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the usage ideas sent to me via email and the extreme speed of delivery.</li>
            <li> There is no funny smell to this product either..  </li>
            <li> I had an unbelievable experience back and forth via email after purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li> There are no chemicals or preservatives added, they do not test on animals and they even offer a 100% money back guarantee if you are not satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are other products I prefer to all argan oil.  </li>
            <li> no more hand lotion and save my daily moisturiser.</li>
            <li> I asked two of my friends over lunch the other day how my skin looked</li>
            <li> , continue providing this product and all your other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews that it does not leave your skin oily, it leaves my&lt;br /&gt;skin</li>
            <li> I have other argan products that I use on the rest of my body</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel oily like baby oil or any other oils I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have used miracle nail in the past and achieved a similar result</li>
            <li> allergies.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about this product at first because the description read like a panacea which is just not existent.  </li>
            <li> So, due to the 791 five star reviews, I chose this one</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> And a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> This is a lightweight oil that has done wonders for my cuticles that typically get cracked and very dry during the winter months.</li>
            <li> The only ingredient is: 100 % pure and certified organic virgin cold pressed argan oil.</li>
            <li> I pour a small amount on tower dried hair and let it air dry, two hours later my hair is so freaking sleek and shiny!</li>
            <li> I found it a little gross, but if your going to wash it off anyway its not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> I have very rough skin on the tips of two finger on both hands</li>
            <li> It is certified organic which is also an important variable for me and impossible to find in other skin/body/hair products.</li>
            <li> A few pumps is all you&#x27;ll need for your hair (and I have long hair!).</li>
            <li> and I tend to feel and look dry after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Smells like cow poop</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m growing out a perm, so the bottom few inches of  my hair is dry, damaged, and frizzy.</li>
            <li> This is definitely replacing the expensive hair conditioners I&#x27;ve been using as it makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> Less rough and softer to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells like cow manure.  </li>
            <li> It gives your hair a slight wet look.</li>
            <li> I was having some trouble with dry skin on the face.</li>
            <li> I let it dry for a few minutes and put my make-up on with no problem.</li>
            <li> It has cleared up a few dry crusty patches that were on my skin around my hairline</li>
            <li> When i heard about this product i was scared to use it on my face, i mean its oil for crying out loud.</li>
            <li> Approximately 2 months later, I open the bottle and it has a sour odor.  </li>
            <li> Depending on what you are using it for, it usually takes only a small amount, thus it lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> so you have to be careful not to make a mess.</li>
            <li> and yes we have tried other brands, seems to be less sticky compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> I purchased my bottle in the winter, specifically to use on my face, as I was putting my skin through the ringer that season - hot and dry indoors to cold and windy outdoors.  </li>
            <li> I have never subjected my hair to harsh treatments such as dying, bleaching or a perm, I do not use a curling iron or straightener and I hardly blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this argan oil for a little over a week, I use it on my hair before I blow dry, hair feels shinning and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> So basically, my skin is mostly dry but a little oily on my cheeks, and some black heads on my chin.  </li>
            <li> It is one of the most expensive oils (COMPARED to coconut, apricot, grapeseed, etc!!).</li>
            <li> Maybe a rare few flakes during the heart of a cold, dry winter.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry, brittle and so frizzy and this helps tame it away.</li>
            <li> A little (really little) bit goes a long way, and that’s the truth.</li>
            <li> but seriously it smells like a tint of soy sauce O.O).</li>
            <li> My face was &#x27;cleanish&#x27; - but very dry, and I hadn&#x27;t exfoliated for a few days.  </li>
            <li> so it has gotten a little rough over the years.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few weeks now I have noticed that my hair feels healthier and less dry.</li>
            <li> That said, it was still cheaper than the other argan products I had previously</li>
            <li> I take fish oil 2X per day and that smell can be hard to initially get use</li>
            <li> I usually apply little bit at the bottom of your hair then with whatever left in my palm</li>
            <li> The oil is thin, not thick, but it does pack a lot of oil in a couple little drops.  </li>
            <li> Especially when our water gets hard and dries your skin/hair out a bit.</li>
            <li> Also, it is hard to use only  a drop or two with the way the bottle dispenses the oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s often hard to tell if a product has actually worked but there is no doubt that using Argan Oil on my nails has made a difference.</li>
            <li> I can actually style my hair and don&#x27;t have to worry about it looking dull and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that my skin tone has improved, that dark spots are lightening.  </li>
            <li> This 4oz bottle will probably last me at least 8 months if not longer.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the smell, it reminds me of oil in a pan</li>
            <li> Even my husband noticed how it worked on the bags and dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> in this bottle to last for a year, at least.</li>
            <li> The oil comes in a four ounce dark glass bottle with a dropper attached inside the screw-on cap.</li>
            <li> But on any given day, I had at least one &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; blemish coming in and one &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; one finally shrinking away.</li>
            <li> only complaint I have is the smell.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the scent of the argan oil.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed it restores elasticity to the skin, especially around the eyes and really delicate areas.</li>
            <li> Even lightened dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I normally hate my hair, but I am now beginning to love it.</li>
            <li> Smells sour and like vomit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a few drops on my hair when it&#x27;s still wet.</li>
            <li> The first three they sent me for blog review purposes gave me the worst reactions to skincare that I&#x27;ve had in a long time, and ever really from a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> i wouldn&#x27;t even step out of the door of my own house because i hated my skin.    </li>
            <li> I was looking for a large, less expensive bottle of organic argan oil to use on my face and hair, and also on my children&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> No more cracking, peeling or bleeding due to the dry weather!  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and used to have bad acne, but after a few bouts of accutane I developed dry skin.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I just got a bad bottle, but for those of you who may be new users like me, if yours smells old, it probably is.</li>
            <li> When my scalp feels too dry from sun or swimming, I massage a few drops of argan oil onto my scalp or add a few drops to my shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my hair after a shower and it keeps the frizz down in addition to making my har silky, shiny, and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair weigh down and felt greasy.</li>
            <li> However, no problems at all when I cut down to using a couple of drops twice a day.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels like silk and not all weighed down.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down but instead controls flyways and makes my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> I have not used it in my hair, as it would probably weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> and it controls frizz without weighting it down.</li>
            <li> I get down to the basics.</li>
            <li> I put a little on my&lt;br /&gt;unruly hair every time I wash it which is every other day.  </li>
            <li> Extremely moisturizing and not too greasy!</li>
            <li> It does feel a little oily when put on your face as opposed to some other comments</li>
            <li> It absorbs fully eventually, but takes a little longer than some other products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I finally know what people mean by glowing skin WITHOUT being greasy.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds crazy right???</li>
            <li> I have hair just past my shoulders, curly/wavy and often dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> but that doesn&#x27;t mean its no good its just mean that my skin is a more serious condition i need to bee looking at with a Derm.</li>
            <li> It was a painful condition since it would hurt to even smile!  </li>
            <li> Even when I use it on face or other skin, the smells goes away just in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few other brands and</li>
            <li> I use this almost everyday due to frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Other than a slight green tint</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like anything heavy on my face and wear very minimal makeup because of that.  </li>
            <li> I live in the interior of Alaska with bitterly cold temperatures and harsh wind, this product is now part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that my pores were enlarged, But now they are markedly less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I have suffered from various skin conditions, such as eczema and acne, and this product does not case any ill side effects or flair ups.</li>
            <li> I was using Moroccan Oil and this is half the price.  </li>
            <li> Use this for over a month and my hair is softer and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> It has a slight butter smell...</li>
            <li> so I started using less on it</li>
            <li> less gunky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it has helped my acne and over all glow of my previously lack-luster skin.</li>
            <li> but it gets once less star for stinging my eyes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that there are four organic oily argan ounces sitting in my bathroom for less than $24.</li>
            <li> I typically have oily skin and hair</li>
            <li> Fact of the matter is, none of the previous argan oils I had tried smelled this good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Fact of the matter is, none of the previous argan oils I had tried smelled this good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My pores have minimized and my face is 70% less oily.</li>
            <li> AND I have a lot less fly-aways.</li>
            <li> less waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives the hair a slight shine and&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a slight scent to it, but the smell fades after three seconds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slightly &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; oil, so it doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling super-slick.</li>
            <li> I have slept in it and it hasn&#x27;t been greasy like some oils nor has it smelled odd.</li>
            <li> Not to mention my scalp is MUCH less flaky than it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li> That being said, I am used to argan oil having a slightly nutty smell which this did not have</li>
            <li> brand of Argan oil is priced less than the oil I&#x27;ve been using, but there’s zero difference.</li>
            <li> And the lines on my face seem less with my skin looking nourished.  </li>
            <li> My hair seems to have less split ends and is shiny.  </li>
            <li> I had a slight issue with the packaging and notified Amazon, to no result.  </li>
            <li> and you get less.</li>
            <li> My nails are growing longer with less splitting and peeling than</li>
            <li> However, after using it for a day or so, I noticed an odd smell...</li>
            <li> something on the order of slightly rancid almonds.  </li>
            <li> Slight smell.  </li>
            <li> I also use this oil on my face and noticed my acne has been less inflamed.</li>
            <li> The oil has a slightly nutty smell that disappears on application.</li>
            <li> My case is an odd one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Argan Oil has a slightly nutty smell (reminds me of Neem Oil).</li>
            <li> The bottle doesn&#x27;t have a typical dropper, but a convenient pump.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for the past 4 days on my hands and neck, which were looking very dry and crepey.</li>
            <li> I usually have skin peeling along my nail beds with very dry nails that arewalways peeling.</li>
            <li> Although I wish I would have gotten the pump bottle, the dropper version still makes it a lot simpler for use with less mess and</li>
            <li> Be careful to use very little and increase if you need to -</li>
            <li> It is truly multipurpose oil; you use it for hair, skin and even nails.&lt;br /&gt;During winter my skin becomes very dry and it is very hard to keep it moisture for a long time.</li>
            <li> In Connecticut, we had a very harsh winter, and my hands became very dry.  </li>
            <li> Because seriously, you only need a little bit of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I used the oil today, expecting a greasy, smelly mess.</li>
            <li> so I don’t have to worry about a mess.</li>
            <li> Based on the two drops in the palm of my hand, I thought to myself that there was no way I was going to put that on my face as I would look like an oily mess.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I was pretty desperate to get off of the steroid creams and antibiotics that my dermatologist prescribed.  </li>
            <li> I do find the scent a bit weird, but that’s due to InstaNatural leaving the oil in its natural state.</li>
            <li> so if you have thin hair you will barely need any otherwise your hair will look oily.</li>
            <li> so if you have thin hair you will barely need any otherwise your hair will look oily.</li>
            <li> I got long thick hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  had the Argan oil for a little over 2 months and have used less than 20% of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little less pricey</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure if this stuff is not pure or expired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Is your hair dull, dry, breaking?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hands - Works wonders on those dry chapped hands, or returning softness to those hard working hands.</li>
            <li> But the winter weather had made my skin flaky, dry and dull.</li>
            <li> I have thick long Latina hair and I avoid using products that weigh my hair down making it look greasy, stiff or dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and if I don&#x27;t use a few drops of Argan Oil to tame my hair, well, it&#x27;s not a pretty</li>
            <li> use a little bit of the oil and put it around my eye area after washing (when my skin feels tight).</li>
            <li> but unfortunately the moisture doesn&#x27;t last long for my arms and legs which seem to be going through withdrawal since I finished off my cellulite cream, stretch mark and scar cream and youth express age-defying Moisturizer...</li>
            <li> , I find it to be less messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sometimes doubtful of the purity of&lt;br /&gt;Argan oils because it is too easy to buy &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; and have it turn out to be a blend.</li>
            <li> bc half is going to waste.</li>
            <li> I have also had trouble with their customer service in the past which hardly speak English!</li>
            <li> The glass bottle, dark container, cold-pressed oil, and 100% Argan are what you should look for in an Argan oil and this stuff has it all!</li>
            <li> but I feel that if I put too little, it&#x27;s not doing its job.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face, neck and a little on my hair.  </li>
            <li> The bottle came wrapped in bubble wrap but was a little greasy.    </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptic about buying this oil in the beginning...</li>
            <li> No significant smell.</li>
            <li> I have tried it in my hair, but it makes it oily looking no matter how little I put on it, so I have discontinued doing that unless I plan to shampoo before going somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I would suggest using a little to put on the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little off putting</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are diminishing a little at a time.</li>
            <li> I plan on using this little treatment every week.</li>
            <li> When I have time I also put a little oil on my fingernails to make them stronger and look healthier!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a little dab of the oil on my hair line solves the problem.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes along way</li>
            <li> If your balking at getting this let me tell you their are alot of drops in this bottle, and a little does so</li>
            <li> I look at that little drop and think, &amp;#34;Oh,</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little greasy as you might guess.</li>
            <li> So he has little bumps like oil seeds.  </li>
            <li> My skin meaning face has cleared up as well with argan oil all you need is a little and pat it onto your face.</li>
            <li> or too little with one pump.</li>
            <li> I use a little in my hair also.  </li>
            <li> Just wish they had reduced the price a little.</li>
            <li> A little goes</li>
            <li> This is a little heavier</li>
            <li> I use it on my face at night and a little in my hair after washing it..</li>
            <li> There are times when I don&#x27;t have time for a wash, yet my hair needs to have some taming - a little bit of this</li>
            <li> And here&#x27;s my little proof for saying that: I have used olive oil, coconut oil and a couple of hair serums before, and none of them have worked as well as this.</li>
            <li> I use it liberally as a face moisturizer and a little in my hair after showering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a little over 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I was NOT able to do that with other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> A bonus side of this oil is that I massage a little on my nails after massaging it on my face.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a loooooong way</li>
            <li> I was using small amounts, and even mixing with some of my other &amp;#34;fragrant&amp;#34; products, and to me the smell still lingered.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nothing that a little bit of cologne or perfume won&#x27;t take care of anyway.</li>
            <li> A little goes a looong way.</li>
            <li> I like the oil, just turned out to be a little too oily for my skin type (I have combination skin).</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure of this product</li>
            <li> I add a little tea tree oil as an anticeptiant</li>
            <li> put a little on damp hair to defrizz</li>
            <li> and I also apply a little bit on my ends when I straighten my hair to prevent frizz.</li>
            <li> The smell takes a little getting used to</li>
            <li> has a slight nutty scent, for those saying it &#x27;stinks&#x27;, if you are comparing it to the over processed and odorless (or altered aroma) products, you aren&#x27;t using real argan oil anyway - this is what it should smell like, and the color, absorption is spot on.</li>
            <li> I usually drop a few drops on the palm of one hand then with dip the cuticles of each finger on the other hand into the palm.</li>
            <li> 100% Pure &amp; Certified Organic Cold Pressed Moroccan Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little bit heavy.</li>
            <li> In comparison between this and Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan oil...hands down this is the one too beat!</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair, which is very thick and coarse, my face, and my hands.  </li>
            <li> It can get a little messy if you are just trying to get a few drops out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought products that others raved about and they did nothing for me, but it&#x27;s hard for me to imagine that someone with tired, old skin won&#x27;t derive some benefit from this oil.  </li>
            <li> (I suppose a lot of people would find it unpleasant, but I really like it!)</li>
            <li> The company sent me something prior to receiving my oil saying that natural Argan oil has a smell to it, but this is so bad I can no longer stomach using it.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend suffers with occasional flare ups of psoriasis / and just a bit of the argan oil on the affected area helps increase healing and reduce any red flaky irritation!</li>
            <li> I put this oil on a towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> When purchasing various health and beauty products, the research I performed could be tiring, and in the end, frustrating.</li>
            <li> and it gets dried out and damaged.  </li>
            <li> This completely DRIED out my hair and stripped color.</li>
            <li> \little heavy</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on one of my palms, and rub them together.</li>
            <li> The Aragon oil didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy or heavy.    </li>
            <li> i use it everyday on my face and hands.</li>
            <li> so I needed a product that I could use everyday to stop splits ends and flaky/itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> but I broke out with a few pimples (which i have never had)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for a month</li>
            <li> I was worried the argan would be too heavy once the snow stopped falling, so I did try some marula oil -</li>
            <li> Also it makes it easier to style ( I have curly heavy hair) ..</li>
            <li> just add a few drops of this argan oil in your palms and add your moisturizer, mix well and apply to your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> moisturizer-After cleansing, massage a few drops on face/neck</li>
            <li> -While hair is still damp, add a few drops to your hair and scalp, to hydrate and moisturize</li>
            <li> I also put few drops on my hair.</li>
            <li> i use it everyday</li>
            <li> I do not care for the scent of this product, but it does fade after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> use this on everything, from adding a few drops to my bath, my lotion, rubbing it on my cuticles, or just rubbing a few drops into my hair.</li>
            <li> use it on my hair, just few drops and then rubble into the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this argan oil for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> In the meantime, my mother uses the product and likes the way it absorbs into her skin without a heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> One evening while watching TV, I put a few drops of the oil onto my heel and massaged them in for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> but it definitely hasn&#x27;t made it worse.</li>
            <li> I had tried a few organic fair-trade argan oils before and they always made me break out.  </li>
            <li> so I put a few drops on my scalp at night and massage it in.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few weeks to see the effects, but it does wonders.  </li>
            <li> mix a few drops in my shampoo and wash my hair then condition.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday (summer/ winter) for my face and my skin stays hydrated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can use the dropper and just a few drops do the trick.</li>
            <li> This wasted a lot of oil that would have otherwise been used on my face or hair.</li>
            <li> After a few days of application, the skin was noticeably smoother, softer &amp; redness reduced.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Argan oil for a few years.</li>
            <li> If I could afford it I would put it all over my body everyday</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks since I have received my order</li>
            <li> and it can get messy.  </li>
            <li> I rub a few drops on my hair after a shower and it helps with the frizz.</li>
            <li> We have been using the oil for a few weeks now for twice a day.</li>
            <li> She dyes her greys every few months and blow dries.  </li>
            <li> It takes just a few drops.  </li>
            <li> and I use it on my cuticles a few times a day</li>
            <li> then a few drops of this oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use to try to remove the oil only to make it worse.  </li>
            <li> I add a couple pumps of it to my homemade vitamin C serum, and I also rub a few drops of the oil on my face in the morning before putting my makeup on.</li>
            <li> I am using quite a few products for my face to combat aging effect (sigh).  </li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face and hair everyday for about 3 months now.</li>
            <li> The second use was much worse.</li>
            <li> I think I was stuck between getting this or the Pura d&#x27;or argan oil but went with this since it was a few dollars cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan Oil for a few months now</li>
            <li> I add a few drops to my hair to prevent split ends</li>
            <li> And Also With What I Have Read, That The Vitamin E And Fatty Acids</li>
            <li> Goes away after a few minutes after application.</li>
            <li> I add a few drops to my hair a couple of times a week, feels healthier and shiny.  </li>
            <li> (recently they have broken all the time).</li>
            <li> But after shampooing I used a couple drops of the Argan Oil and rubbed it into my towel dried hair and then combed through before blow drying.  </li>
            <li> it was clearly stale and old.</li>
            <li> I started using it a few days ago</li>
            <li> few drops does wonders on your hands</li>
            <li> A few drops of organic argan oil all over</li>
            <li> I used it on my hair ends not to waste it.</li>
            <li> Now, i have been getting a few breaks outs here in there</li>
            <li> I apply it on my face and hair everyday.</li>
            <li> USE IT ON MY MY FACE EVERYDAY &amp; BODY EVERYDAY.  </li>
            <li> , so I add a few drops to lotions, moisturizers or just use it alone all over.  </li>
            <li> I also use a few drops to moisturize my hair after washing, as well as on my hands.</li>
            <li> No, it won&#x27;t make my condition go away, and it&#x27;s unrealistic to assume a natural oil will make a genetic condition go away.</li>
            <li> but my cuticles looked like they were dried up prunes and my nails</li>
            <li> although the smell fades off after a few mins.</li>
            <li> I bought this last year but don&#x27;t remember the smell being so unappealing.</li>
            <li> The pump for this product did not fit the jar and cannot be used.</li>
            <li> I have trouble growing my fingernails out because they often chip, break or split.  </li>
            <li> I like the pump that&#x27;s included and the heavy duty glass bottle.</li>
            <li> After surgery, then sent me home with samples of heavy duty creams to begin the healing process.  </li>
            <li> Plus they sent me some helpful ways to use to product and followed up after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes I take the towel off and brush my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have thick, Mexican hair that can be hard to tame.</li>
            <li> They are usually loaded with silicones that weigh hair down and mask damage.</li>
            <li> My skin absorbs it fairly quickly, no matter where I put it, and because if this, it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily sheen, just a silky softness!</li>
            <li> try applying on slightly damp face and body to seal in moisture!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking about SERIOUS cracking, bleeding, they feel like they are on fire DRY (my palms too!</li>
            <li> I apply liberally, as there&#x27;s none of that ten dollars per drop issue that I hate worrying about when pampering myself, all over my face, down my frequently itchy neck</li>
            <li> But I guess that&#x27;s what organic plain argan oil smells like</li>
            <li> Also, since it&#x27;s a plain ingredient, you can use it for just about anything</li>
            <li> After only a couple of weeks, I can see a dramatic difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always use it for my hair to tame the frizz because I feel it&#x27;s a</li>
            <li> I also like using it on the ends of my hair, before applying a leave-in conditioner, to help tame any split ends or roughness.</li>
            <li> and I have gone through using a variety of products and treatments that would help tame my hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this with the intention of a hair oil, to use after blowdrying my hair in order to tame flyaways and frizz.  </li>
            <li> There is no fragrance added to the oil, so the scent is purely of the oil itself, which isn&#x27;t unpleasant and doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li> , growing out my hair a little past my shoulders - I wash it once a week.</li>
            <li> I mean, I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> They are seriously so rough and dry, it&#x27;s scary.</li>
            <li> matter if your hair is thick, dry, frizzy, thick, curly, or just out of control - Argan oil</li>
            <li> Turns out the first one had gone bad during shipping in the scorching heat of the season.</li>
            <li> It also softens my hands as I usually rub a few drops on my hands and then run my hands through my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used camellia oil for at least 20 years and even though it gives the shine to the hair, it will get weighted down if I wore a hat or a bicycle helmet.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had a horribly cold and dry winter, yet my skin is much less dry than usual since I&#x27;ve been using argan oil.</li>
            <li> but I am using it on my very dry, thick and unruly hair and it is taming it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 72, live in Pennsylvania&#x27;s cold winters, and Argon oil is keeping my skin well moisterized without leaving a layer of film.</li>
            <li> This proved expensive and painful, since I was basically burning off the top layer of skin off my body every couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have chemically treated hair which looks like the coconut husk - totally dry and unhealthy .</li>
            <li> My poor, cracked and dry skin has been revitalized with InstaNatural 100% Organic Arganic Oil.</li>
            <li> There is also little to no aroma!</li>
            <li> It is cold where I live and I usually have to reapply moisturizer throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised that Argan oil seems very thin when dropped but thick when smoothed onto skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You need very little to get results.</li>
            <li> Use very little otherwise it will feel too greasy.  </li>
            <li> It did not absorb well even though I used very little.</li>
            <li> Disappointed very much.</li>
            <li> The smell is not pleasant and the oil doesn&#x27;tt seem to moisturize ad we ad other brands.</li>
            <li> I spray 3 pumps in my hand and massage it into the ends of my damp hair after shower, then style as usual.  </li>
            <li> I massage a liberal amount of the oil on my scalp and let it rest for 30 mins to 1 hr., even sometimes overnight and shampoo as usual.  </li>
            <li> Just a small drop of oil rubbed between my fingers does the trick.  </li>
            <li> so I can get the desired amount and not have excess (and waste!).</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, curly, and gets dried out...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started putting a small amount on my nails/cuticles and am also seeing a healing difference.  </li>
            <li> It softened my curls on those lazy hair days.</li>
            <li> Just rubbed a few drops of this oil on the ends and it now looks nourished !</li>
            <li> If you put it near your scalp your hair will look dirty.</li>
            <li> I am usually got  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used a small amount of this on my hair...</li>
            <li> But if you can get past that the product does work well.</li>
            <li> With all the hoopla about this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; oil I was anxious to try it.  </li>
            <li> but it is not overwhelming</li>
            <li> or you will end up with excessively oily skin  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure about hair but the reviews seem to say excessively shiny.  </li>
            <li> No more make up,all I need is argan oil</li>
            <li> Use a small amount at a time.</li>
            <li> I use this oil overnight in my hair, as well as a small amount after I shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Argan Oil, Rosehip Seed Oil &amp; their Moroccan Rosewater for the past month</li>
            <li> The pump dispenser helps me to get even amounts for application without going overboard with the product.  </li>
            <li> Not nearly as many tangles and</li>
            <li> My nails grew stronger than usual.</li>
            <li> I know in the past</li>
            <li> I usually use a pump for my face and then use the leftover residue for my hair.</li>
            <li> Unlike so-called &amp;#34;Argan&amp;#34; oil that I&#x27;ve used in the past, this oil is odorless.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t I&#x27;m not sure what to call it</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve used it for the past 3 weeks).  </li>
            <li> and it seemed so unfair to be fighting wrinkles and pimples at the same time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure what to say about its effect on wrinkles</li>
            <li> Exfoliate your skin thoroughly and use argan oil once a day after bathing/showering, and you can have crazy soft skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after using an expensive brand that came in a tiny bottle.  </li>
            <li> product also comes with a guarantee if, for some reason, you are not satisfied.</li>
            <li> choose this product over E&amp;S because E&amp;S is more expensive and the worst part of that product is that I have received leaky bottles from them several times.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed first.</li>
            <li> A small amount does indeed add shine and softness to my hair.</li>
            <li> It will last a&lt;br /&gt;while and won&#x27;t be expensive to replace when you run out.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my hair and face...really combats the harsh effects of winter on my body!  </li>
            <li> After towel trying it, I just put a small amount in my palm and worked the oil through my hair.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to treck to an Ayurvedic store to find Argan without and preservatives or cosmetic chemicals that are added to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past month.</li>
            <li> I also use a small amount on my damp hair after washing.</li>
            <li> I had a small brown patch on my face that I had picked at and after using my Argan Oil</li>
            <li> This oil arrived with a small leak in the box on delivery.</li>
            <li> It is the only product I use in my hair after years of trial and error using expensive products, creams, and gels.</li>
            <li> Just a small drop is needed.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Josie Moran Argan oil but thought I would try this one.  </li>
            <li> I use this at least a few times a week.</li>
            <li> Not many people...</li>
            <li> (my hands are the softest they&#x27;ve been in years), on your face (I usually break out with the smallest amount of any type of oil on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Argan Oil for my skin for the past two weeks.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I am a fan of Argon Oil.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even a fragrance I can name, but a faint scent that I actually like.</li>
            <li> No more body lotion, no more hair serum,</li>
            <li> Just a few drops and presto!</li>
            <li> No more store bought chemical stuff to my hair.</li>
            <li> I use 4 drops on my face, usually at night-time.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount in my hair and let it set for a while before shampooing out.</li>
            <li> I used an additional small amount in my damp hair before drying and styling.</li>
            <li> Over the past three weeks the smell has become &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I add a few drops of this to my conditioner and hand cream and it works like a dream!</li>
            <li> We usually use coconut oil</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product and doing some research of the benefits of this oil I was anxious to receive it.</li>
            <li> That night I took a bath with my usual shampoo and conditioner routine.</li>
            <li> I also mix Mary Kay lotion with a few drop of argan oil to apply to my face for shine and it also works!</li>
            <li> Just a small dab of those Over the Argan is sufficient.  </li>
            <li> Not able to go to the store to purchase the creams after the samples ran out, I started using the argan oil, morning, noon and night.  </li>
            <li> So not sure if it was a faulty package.</li>
            <li> Also, the frigid temperatures [currently 13 degrees] had both oils nearly frozen, one had crystalized!</li>
            <li> I tried it today and perhaps I used too much (really hard to know which thick hair) because it seems a little greasy/stringy</li>
            <li> Very few frizzies...</li>
            <li> Lastly, I have very dry, flaking &amp; itchy skin, sometimes painful spot on each my cheeks &amp; not the ones on my face either.  </li>
            <li> They stand behind their product, are extremely knowledgeable about it and reply to your questions immediately.</li>
            <li> It is less expensive than the other leading oil out there</li>
            <li> so I expected it to go bad at some point in the future but</li>
            <li> I feel my skin is clearer and subtle after using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> It has a faint argan oil smell, which reminds me of Morocco (I spent a holiday in Casablanca a few years ago).</li>
            <li> Smells - reminds me a bit of olives, very slightly!,</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is Pure Argan Oil Smells Weird!!</li>
            <li> and this is at least bearable) and little bit like soy sauce (I seriously dont know if its cause</li>
            <li> Wasted my other expensive oil trying to blend to remove, neutralize, or reduce the stink.  </li>
            <li> I think this b/c of a little unpleasant (but acceptable) side effect from daily use.</li>
            <li> One  odd thing to note is that is mixes with water, which I did to thin it out.  </li>
            <li> I have eczema on my scalp, and it is dry, itchy and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It is a little less expensive than others i have purchased, which i appreciate since i use it for hair and skin every day.  </li>
            <li> Hair type is fine flyaway and wavy, the worst to deal with...!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes my skin super soft during the awful cold of midwest winters.</li>
            <li> and I was noticing a lot of split ends in some of my hard to flatten areas.</li>
            <li> The hard thing was deciding what to use it for.</li>
            <li> While I am hardly an expert on all the organic argan oils of the world</li>
            <li> There is hardly any fragrance at all</li>
            <li> I never had a lot of wrinkles, I am 71,just some lines around my mouth and on my forehead  I hardly notice them now.</li>
            <li> Being a roofer’s labourer and out in all weathers, my hands have a hard life</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you give it a try,you will not be disappointed..</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call the smell bad, just natural for that oil</li>
            <li> at least this specifique brand cause they are a lot of Argan Oil out there</li>
            <li> Some people have complained about the odor.  </li>
            <li> I do not agree with a lot of negative reviews.</li>
            <li> So, I think the common denominator is the argan oil.</li>
            <li> Just common sense.    </li>
            <li> But at least it won&#x27;t LOOK like it.</li>
            <li> though all these negative reviews....sounds almost like a smear campaign to me....</li>
            <li> Moroccan Argan Oil has been all the rage lately</li>
            <li> The oil stinks and doesn&#x27;t work well on my facial complexion.</li>
            <li> at least 3 times a day....</li>
            <li> /&gt;It caused my entire face to break out like crazy like hives.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I comb it through my hair and leave it there for at least a couple of hours before I shampoo and condition it.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to at least some of those.</li>
            <li> I am mistaken for being in my late 50\\&quot;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are no extra ingredients, nothing artificial, no fragrances, preservatives...</li>
            <li> at least before I review</li>
            <li> I then gather it and put a plastic processing cap over my hair for at least an hour or two, shampoo and condition.  </li>
            <li> apply it at least an hour before shower.</li>
            <li> when i bought this it was cold pressed and a different bottle.</li>
            <li> had thick patches of it but now has reduced and my hair looks shinier.</li>
            <li> Mine was thick and lumpy, almost looked separated</li>
            <li> I applied 5 drops on my thick hair and it did not absorb well at all.</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t moisturize quite like a thick gooey hand cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to using Chi&#x27;s keratin silk oil and its thick</li>
            <li> it my thick waves hair.  </li>
            <li> My hairstylist keeps recommending a keratin treatment for my thick, course and bushy hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick as others I have tried</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> The oil smells like vomit, does not absorb, thick like Olive oil and Broke me out like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The oil is a lil thick and have to get used to the aroma</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use it on my body or over my tattoos to moisturize, but usually use coconut oil for my body since it is less expensive.</li>
            <li> Just read their replies to negative reviews here, and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.</li>
            <li> Thin and poor quality compared to other Argan oils we have used</li>
            <li> This stuff smells pretty bad!</li>
            <li> It’s not totally overwhelming, so I can deal with it!</li>
            <li> Well, I look no more!  </li>
            <li> The oil keeps my skin moisturized and no more breakouts!</li>
            <li> I mean come</li>
            <li> However, the smell, while bad, is pretty faint and disapears after application</li>
            <li> This has replaced my very expensive facial moisture cream and eye cream.</li>
            <li> nails are not bad at all, but my mothers hands and feet are AWFUL.</li>
            <li> I will be looking for less expensive replacements.  </li>
            <li> I will be looking for less expensive replacements.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> [hence why I braid it], and it works wonders for keeping ridiculous curls under control.</li>
            <li> seriously, it seemed that this oil was a miracle or something.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s significantly less expensive so to me</li>
            <li> I know what olive oil smells like (and on that fragrance note, olive oil itself is often a counterfeit mixture of canola and chlorophyll; seriously, Google it).  </li>
            <li> I know what olive oil smells like (and on that fragrance note, olive oil itself is often a counterfeit mixture of canola and chlorophyll; seriously, Google it).  </li>
            <li> I have been searching for a less expensive alternative</li>
            <li> I seriously didn&#x27;t know where to start.</li>
            <li> and I was sad when I couldn&#x27;t afford to order it for a little while,</li>
            <li> but I have noticed that the irritating hard skin that accumulates at the edges of the nails is softer and not snaggly</li>
            <li> Shortly after I started using this product it caused a lot of pore blockage and made my face break out badly.</li>
            <li> it goes on same as jm brand not greasy however it does have a lite order/not bad.</li>
            <li> I received an email from the manufacturer, which prompted me to try it sooner than later--I bought it to use when the weather turned bitter cold.</li>
            <li> There is a faint smell which goes away after a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t describe the smell, but it is not good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thin or too thick.  </li>
            <li> It sits on my skin without absorbing and smells very bad.</li>
            <li> He keeps his hair cut very short to the skin, because of his tufted hair foliculitus and we bought this product for him to try on the horribly itchy, dry and scaly tissue build up around those hair follicles.  </li>
            <li> I believe it is due to the cold press procedure, which isn&#x27;t actually bad since it removes impurities from the oil that can hinder the overall shelf</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Maybe there was a bad batch in the warehouse, but mine did NOT smell bad and it was golden in color as it should be.</li>
            <li> And the smell was not pleasant.</li>
            <li> If you know your Argan oil you know they are not pleasant smelling unless the have perfumes added.</li>
            <li> Ever since I went to Morocco a few years ago, I have been obsessed and addicted to Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I will forewarn you that it smells bad, there are clearly no added fragrances.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m applying it wrong</li>
            <li> , that was so faint that a few seconds in the air &amp; it was gone!  </li>
            <li> I have used Josie Maran&#x27;s in the past but find it to be too expensive (although I do still use her body butters).  </li>
            <li> So if you have a weak stomach, you may want to reconsider.</li>
            <li> Feels weak</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it on my nails, but I have dry, ugly cuticles</li>
            <li> I have very thick course&lt;br /&gt;hair</li>
            <li> and I mean NEVER be purchasing this stuff again!</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast, works well, except the terrible smell.</li>
            <li> Addicted.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this argan oil and will continue to use forever.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into skin after a few minutes &amp; protected my skin from the cold &amp; indoor heart.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, not a great idea.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to it.</li>
            <li> It looks worse, (example, I put it all over my face including eye area,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with thing nails, but it was noticeably worse.</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t search for images, it&#x27;s not great).</li>
            <li> /&gt;So if you happen to be in the 1/1,000 of people that have this specific and annoying condition, all I can say is it helped me, and it might help you too.</li>
            <li> One thing I don&#x27;t like is that it makes it looks thin too</li>
            <li> Then I follow up with a thin layer of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> After cutting my hair a few months ago I&#x27;ve noticed that I have been getting split ends again</li>
            <li> , I hate that &amp;#34;tap lightly with your pinky finger&amp;#34; annoying method recommended by the high-end beauty industry.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have stated, it smells BAD.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seriously been getting compliments!</li>
            <li> I was nervous to test out this Argan Oil because in the past a similar product broke out my skin terribly.</li>
            <li> What I appreciate about this brand is that it it organic, cold pressed, and is 4 ounces instead of the usual 2ounces.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to use this at work to keep my neck and hands moisturized but its awful-I&#x27;m afraid someone may walk past me and think I haven&#x27;t showered.  </li>
            <li> not seeing any dramatic results</li>
            <li> Lots of people said to only use a little, but I was convinced they didn&#x27;t know my life, so I slathered my face with the oil (to heal it from the nasty cold wind, of course).</li>
            <li> I am still prone to random breakouts, I felt my skin was looking tired and splotchy</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the very expensive brands so not sure what the difference is.</li>
            <li> It has a different smell and sticks to my skin very badly.</li>
            <li> This may not work for everybody but at least try it!!</li>
            <li> Awful stuff, stinks to high heaven.</li>
            <li> I hardly style it down because it just looks so awful to me.</li>
            <li> Using just a drop makes my hair look and feel oily - and I have very thick hair!</li>
            <li> I wonder if I got a bottle of rancid oil because my son complained of bad smell every time I used it.</li>
            <li> They have those visible lines, which I suppose are commonly referred to as ... cracks (that sounds so bad).</li>
            <li> If you are in the market for Argan Oil, you won&#x27;t be sorry trusting this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m increasingly uncomfortable the colder it gets.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals or weird stuff in it.  </li>
            <li> Obsessed</li>
            <li> Literally speaking I could apply the 3.6 oz size bottle of oil, it would have been drunk by my skin.</li>
            <li> Have replaced my rather expensive serum and moisturizer with this oil.  </li>
            <li> It has a horrible smell if you open the cap</li>
            <li> but sadly I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Sorry gang.  </li>
            <li> Sorry gang.  </li>
            <li> Dispenser pump included way too small for the bottle. :-(</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry with your purchase</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this product, at this price.</li>
            <li> why use all these expensive cosmetics ?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get hunged up on the fake reviews.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is not this stinky or irritating to your skin.!</li>
            <li> It is sometimes difficult to find hair products to suit our needs.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about Argan Oil—but I had read a lot about it on the internet.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but this product was not satisfactoy.</li>
            <li> Another plus, is that it isn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> I still prefer the expensive brand but will use this too.</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> I used argan oil before but it&#x27;s too expensive to keep buying it from sephora</li>
            <li> It does the work...but has a weird smell...</li>
            <li> Sadly , I can not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Jenni</li>
            <li> I have always used Moroccan Oil, but it&#x27;s SO EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with this oil.</li>
            <li> There is a faint nut like odor to the oil, but it vanishes as you rub it into your skin.</li>
            <li> Too expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this blindly for use in my hair.</li>
            <li> In a marketplace saturated with lousy sellers, I have been overjoyed with Insta Naturals, and will continue to order exclusively through them,</li>
            <li> i am addicted to it and have to have it all the time!</li>
            <li> Maybe there&#x27;s something wrong with it?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical on the claims of a lot of products.  </li>
            <li> Argan oil is supposed to be non-comedogenic (not supposed to clog your pores), so supposedly is unlikely to cause a breakout or clog pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted!  </li>
            <li> AMAZON SENT MY A WRONG ITEM IN PLACE OF THIS</li>
            <li> Anyway... not really impressed with this &#x27;liquid gold&#x27;.</li>
            <li> argan oil is very poor grade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer the scent of Josie Maran too, this one is hard to apply because I have to plug my nose :(</li>
            <li> but in less than I month I noticed that it began to smell terrible like it had become rancid.</li>
            <li> all over my drawer in bathroom, in zipper bag in my purse,.. awful mess.</li>
            <li> I just wasn&#x27;t crazy about putting oil on my hair.</li>
            <li> and I am afraid I will break out</li>
            <li> Crazy...</li>
            <li> I bought this brand because it&#x27;s cold pressed and organic.</li>
            <li> After being indoors this cold, cold season this product was a welcomed relief for dryness.</li>
            <li> It was a bit disappointing to me when I found out that it was not the product that I thought I ordered.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s cold pressed, and there is nothing else in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crazy about Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> It is frizzy and curly and knots up like crazy.</li>
            <li> It also works well for winter cold rashes.</li>
            <li> I decided to try some of this oil on the patch to see what happened and the burning, heat and itching went away within a few minutes!!!!!</li>
            <li> You can go wrong with this product!</li>
            <li> This product is trash and the worst waste of my money!</li>
            <li> And how could you go wrong?!?</li>
            <li> About 1/3 way through I started noticing an unpleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> The smell is unpleasant.</li>
            <li> For the price, however, I can deal with a slightly unpleasant scent as the scent does not linger.</li>
            <li> Works well, but has an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Argan oil has a very faint smell so you don&#x27;t have to worry about your nose being overwhelmed.</li>
            <li> I have some of Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil products, but they are very expensive (they work, too).  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I dropped my bottle the base broke.</li>
            <li> Like manure-on-a-farm bad.</li>
            <li> Bad odor</li>
            <li> I feel bad for leaving a bad rating while everyone else is raving, but it was SO oily that I couldn&#x27;t stand.</li>
            <li> and if you put this on your face or hair, it makes it like you have bad breath walking around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming it is not doing anything bad to my hair</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> bad boxing and shipping</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch</li>
            <li> It can be quite embarrassing at times, and it can look like I just have really bad dandruff, or give the impression that I don&#x27;t take care of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It broke me out too bad that I have to stop using after couple days.</li>
            <li> The smell was not at all as bad as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Some reviews talk about it smelling bad, or being vegetable oil</li>
            <li> Look above&lt;br /&gt;Can cause bad reaction.</li>
            <li> Hence the rosehip oil went bad and is unusable.  </li>
            <li> Oil does go bad.</li>
            <li> It smells really bad.  </li>
            <li> It is sticky like glue with a bad odor.&lt;br /&gt;Eww</li>
            <li> , the smell also isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> and I was so SHOCKED.</li>
            <li> I was assured that it wouldn&#x27;t make my hair and skin oily by friends, however I am disappointed because I  can&#x27;t even use it on my hands because it doesn&#x27;t soak in as stated and</li>
            <li> Call me disappointed.</li>
            <li> My skin was chaffed from cold, I used two days and Gone!</li>
            <li> Stinks like poop!  </li>
            <li> It stinks!</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The product does seem to be as described, I&#x27;m disappointed in the packing.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before buying this but have been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

            <li> I just knew I would not be disappointed by this oil.</li>
            <li> (I have used jojoba oil before, but I hate the smell of it).</li>
            <li> You can use it as a moisture base for whatever skin or body care or cosmetic you wish and it won&#x27;t interfere.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I looked up signs of &#x27;bad argan oil&#x27; and a really terrible smell</li>
            <li> It did to my friend who tried it on her face and caused bad rash&lt;br /&gt;Everything!</li>
            <li> Bad packaging!</li>
            <li> I tried using this just once and hated it.</li>
            <li> I do not think you will be disappointed..!!</li>
            <li> Nasty .</li>
            <li> I tried it a couple times but it was just too insulting to my nostrils.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 stars though because I hate the smell of it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The worst product ever</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> Yes, it has an odor but nothing horrible at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells horrible.</li>
            <li> I always broke out within a month from finishing Accutane, and i still had those annoying scars!    </li>
            <li> turned out horrible.</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a try, since the worst thing that could happen is I lose</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this poduct! I&#x27;m actually using a different brand before and when I saw this, thought it&#x27;s not gonna hurt to try. I used the other brand on the other side of my face and this insta natural on the right side of my face. I am impressed that this one absorbed a lot faster and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all. My husband noticed the changes on my face, my skin looks softer and healthy. I  am also using this now too for my body, daily with my fav lotion. It does have a nutty scent. I&#x27;m also using this for my baby tortoises, their shells are also healthy, thanks to this! :)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wondering what fresh Argan oil should smell like, this is it. I love the rich, nutty smell, which disappears a few moments after you apply the oil. Definitely the freshest argan oil I&#x27;ve used, (another brand had an &#x27;old&#x27; odor and I&#x27;m still trying to get a refund on the full bottle I recently bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to another plus of purchasing this oil - Instanatural&#x27;s amazing customer service. Just read their replies to negative reviews here, and you&#x27;ll see what I mean. This company will issue a hassle free refund, in case it doesn&#x27;t work out for you. This is also the largest size of Argan oil I&#x27;ve seen, at the best price I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using this natural, organic, fresh oil on my skin. It keeps my skin soft and moisturized. I add a big squirt to my body lotion, rubbing my lotion and the oil together in my hands, before applying to my body. Wonderful. Hopefully I&#x27;ll see more firmness with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the label, which suggests using 1-3 drops on the face, I realize I&#x27;ve been using way too much product. I&#x27;m probably using about 12 drops just on my face and neck. But it smells so fresh and natural that I love slathering it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles, I have fine lines. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks so and it seems to soften the fine lines. I&#x27;m using this together with the Instanatural Vitamin C serum, which I bought at the same time. I&#x27;ll try to post a review on the Vitamin C serum after I&#x27;ve used it a bit longer.</li>
            <li> I have skin that transitioning from normal to slightly dry. I am still prone to random breakouts, I felt my skin was looking tired and splotchy and so I decided to mix up my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil has been  Wonderful! It is the only moisturizer I use now. I wash my face as usual in the evening using Cetaphil and occasionally adding in some microdermbrasion &#x27;sand&#x27; to give my face some exfoliation. I spread a medium weight coat over my skin. It soaks in quickly, When I wash in the morning, I apply with a lighter hand, waiting about 10 minutes before applying makeup. I will also use this to remove eye makeup when I use the waterproof mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin tone has evened out. The patches of dry are gone, and i have a smooth texture now. I didn&#x27;t realize that my pores were enlarged, But now they are markedly less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hair seems like it needs some extra moisturizing I will work 4 drops or so through it in the evening, and wash in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit I am not fond of the pump, and would prefer the option of selecting a dropper. One hurried morning  in a bit of inattention i had the pump facing the wrong way and shot it right on my blouse. Oops. Luckily it cleaned out easily in the wash.</li>
            <li> I love that it came with a pump! So far so good.</li>
            <li> it really works.... my skin is smoother than before :)</li>
            <li> Again, InstaNatural insists the quality and honesty on their product! It works as they said. Perfect for moisture my skin and hair. I have healthy hair but the natural curls make them not that manageable... The oil makes it softer and &amp;#34;trainable&amp;#34;!! I am soooooo happy with the product. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the smell is not so good as the rest InstaNatural products. It has a funky smell, but it is very mild. However, the smell goes away after the oil being rubbed in and it would be overrun by shampoo smells. Even when I use it on face or other skin, the smells goes away just in a few minutes. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is just as good as the very expensive ones out there on QVC and other shopping channels.  You only need a little bit and it soaks in..  I use this on my face as well as my arms and legs.  I will definitely be ordering more of this brand.  I do not think you will be disappointed..!!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased argan oil from InstaNatural, and I&#x27;m really happy with it. The scent is very mild and barely noticeable. Argan is a very \\&quot;dry\\&quot; oil which soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy. As a bonus, when I&#x27;ve had questions, I&#x27;ve received quick, courteous answers. I&#x27;ve purchased a number of their products now, and I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of InstaNatural&#x27;s products as well as their customer service. Thanks, AJ!</li>
            <li> Excellent price for such a large bottle but I really dislike the smell. It has a very strong nutty (and what smells like meat smell to me.) I am going to have to use the more expensive Josie Maran, which somehow, they have managed to eradicate any repugnant smells from (Josie Maran only smells slightly nutty.)</li>
            <li> This quantity for the price is a great bargain.  I use it morning and night on my face &amp; hands - it absorbs quickly yet leaves a subtle glow, and it can be applied under another moisturizer if you choose.  My husband also uses it as his aftershave and loves it.  A little goes a long way - just one squirt pump onto your fingertips will moisturize your entire face &amp; hands.  Works great as a hair treatment to be shampooed out in the shower, but I personally don&#x27;t like using it as a styling treatment ie. before or after blow drying.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for hair, hands, and neck and face.  This helps me to repair my hair and provides a nice bit of moisture to keep my neck nice and youthful.</li>
            <li> I just keep coming back to this product. I use this as a face moisturizer before bed. It lasts a long time because you don&#x27;t have to use much. Clean smell.</li>
            <li> inexpensive compared to the other brands...</li>
            <li> I have been listening about Argan Oil for while . Bought a body lotion with Argan Oil from a popular company but it had mineral oil and that isn&#x27;t good for your skin. I just tried once today and I was so SHOCKED. I have deep lines around my mouth and on my neck  and after used it, my lines were gone 50% , on one application. GONE . I couldn&#x27;t believe it. My skin is combination so I am going to use it on the dry areas on my face and neck. Also I have dry skin on my hands ( washing my hands with antibacterial soap before I touch my patients) ( I am  home care nurse for the elderly) so I will use it for that too, but this is one of the best products I had purchased from Amazon. I am reordering it on my next order. THIS IS A WINNER!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I put this oil on a towel dried hair. The oil it was very stick and didn&#x27;t blend like the other argan oils I had.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was oily after I blow dry. Didn&#x27;t liked very much even if he is pure and may treat the hair.</li>
            <li> Great for the skin and hair.  Leaves hair soft.  Don&#x27;t use too much or hair looks greasy.</li>
            <li> I had issues with cracked fingers until I purchased this oil at the recommendation of my nail tech.  It cleared up the problem in days!</li>
            <li> It actually has a smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this as it has no artificial chemicals and its totally safe&lt;br /&gt;but!&lt;br /&gt;I used it for freeze of my hair and it only makes my hair greasy. in addition, it has no perfume in it and the smell is strong. So even one drop over my long dense hair and I totally feel the smell throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I will use it for my nails.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at full price :). This argan oil looks identical to my Josie Maran argan oil.  I see no difference between the two side by side.  If you are an argan oil user, I&#x27;d recommend this brand to replace your more expensive brands.  I&#x27;ve purchased argan oil from natural food stores as well, but some seem thicker and have more of an odor.  As mentioned, this one looks absolutely identical to Josie Maran for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Amazing moisturizer and does not leave skin oily!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer for sure!</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant, and if you use it on your skin, it is absorbed very quickly!  I&#x27;m currently using it as a leave-in conditioner for my hair.  It is better than any conditioner I have ever tried!  It works wonders!  In a couple of weeks it had transformed my greying, dry wild hair into manageable &amp; soft!  I just bought a second bottle for my golden retriever - one of his best conditioners had argan oil in it so I&#x27;m sure that the pure stuff will be even better for him - especially without any added fragrance!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for making hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant with my fifth baby.  I always have skin issues when I&#x27;m pregnant (break outs, dry skin).  I heard that Argan Oil works wonders for skin, so I purchased this to give it a try.  I have been amazed.  My skin is soft and smooth.  I haven&#x27;t had any break outs since I started using it (just a drop in the morning and evening after cleansing my face). I have also noticed that my skin tone has improved, that dark spots are lightening.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great value for Argan oil.  Works just as well as other, more expensive brands.  Will buy this again!</li>
            <li> This product is not as advertise. I want my money back. Stated to be argan oil but is actually something else.&lt;br /&gt;Prob cheap cooking oil. Don&#x27;t put this on your body, please...</li>
            <li> InstaNatural is my favorite brand so far! I&#x27;ve tried more than 4 InstaNatural products and loved them. I recommended this brand to my mother in law and my son&#x27;s teachers.. they love it</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  I currently wear my hair natural and usually have a hard time keeping it hydrated.  But with the Argan oil It makes thing so much easier. It isn&#x27;t too oily and my hair feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used the oil on my dry spots that appear every so often.  My spots have cleared up since using the oil.</li>
            <li> Use it for dry skin Works great :)</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for a dry scalp. I apply it as they recommend and let it sit in my hair the night before I wash my hair.  and only after using it for a few weeks I can notice a difference.  Been using this product for a while now and my scalp is virtually flake free. Maybe a rare few flakes during the heart of a cold, dry winter. All around a great product to use for your hair. Be careful not tongues it too often. I changed the way I use it though. I part my hair in multiple places and apply a drop or two to each part and rub in gently and throughly. After letting it sit for about 20 min to and hour I take a shower and wash my hair. I wash my hair once every 3 days and that&#x27;s the only time I apply it. Don&#x27;t over use this product. Like anything else use it in moderation.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hair and it definitely adds some shine, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it makes my face break out bad!</li>
            <li> This oil is really awesome if you have eczema or any other dry skin issues. It also is a strengthener for finger nails. I know there are many more uses....read up on it and buy it!!!! One awesome item to have on file.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite carrier oils. My skin soaks the Argan oil in and feels nourished. Of all the essential oils and carrier oils I use, this is my favorite! Soft, gentle and non greasy. I highly recommend you give it a try,you will not be disappointed..</li>
            <li> Love this oil! Great to calm hair frizz, as a face and skin moisturizer and for nails and cuticles. Not greasy or oily.</li>
            <li> Excellent product will order again. Met ALL my expectations. Spray bottle is sooo easy to apply the oil...love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE it!! Best Argan oil I have ever tried! Bought it to use on my hair and skin and its amazing! I spray 3 pumps in my hand and massage it into the ends of my damp hair after shower, then style as usual.  You have instant shine and no frizz! Best on skin after shower! When you first open the bottle it smells like a plant but the smell goes away for good. Purely Organic! Buying more as gifts.</li>
            <li> Great value for the quantity</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of using this product the lines around my mouth have practically disappeared.  I would most definitely order InstaNatural again.</li>
            <li> I love the Argaon Oil &amp; it is just as good as another brand I bought from Amazon (I also understand from reviews as good as a $40 plus bottle in for about the same price but InstaNatural is twice the size!!!  I received more than I follow up email from InstaNaturals which customer service is a big selling point with me.  A good product &amp; no customer service isn&#x27;t the way to go for me when I can get 2X the size for the same product &amp; customer service!  My damage is due to prolonged chronic diseases &amp; the medication&#x27;s side effects on my skin &amp; hair plus scars from surgeries.  I found out I have Lyme Disease about 7 months ago which was probably the catalyst for the chronic diseases &amp; the Lyme treatment makes you feel worse &amp; more side effects!  Ugh!  My lips turned to stone so I use the Argan Oil on them whenever I wash my face &amp; them an organic Shea Butter lip balm &amp; that is the only thing that has worked for me.  I tried so many things before that.  I now have a road map on my forehead from 1st an overdose of thyroid meds &amp; it has only gotten worse with treatment of the Lyme because I can&#x27;t think clearly so I bought a Derma Roller &amp; use their Viamin C Toner (love the spray bottle), Retinol, Hyaluric Serum, the Argan Oil &amp; then follow with my moisturizer every night.  During the day just the Argain Oil on my face &amp; lips but not eyes followed by my moisturizer or my eye makeup slides off.  The other company I bought from I sent an email because I ordered 4 different bottles &amp; 1 was missing half the bottom so I had cuts &amp; glass embedded in my fingers.  Amazon made it right but they really didn&#x27;t seem to care which made me not feel confident in their company.  I also told them when reading the reviews trying to find one that wasn&#x27;t, &amp;#34;I received this bottle to review but this is my honest opinion....&amp;#34; was too much.  No response!  I don&#x27;t know if I can write the name of the other company but I&#x27;m taking a picture of the 2 bottles side by side but just the other turned around.  I was sent 4 emails, one for each product I bought from InstaNatural more than once again to follow up!  It has really made a difference on my forehead, not over night but slow &amp; steady so I am a customer for life.  I wrote them an email telling them all I have written here &amp; they went above &amp; beyond with their customer service.  I highly recommend their Argan Oil &amp; all their products.  I also use it on on my hair &amp; leave it on over night which is excellent.  I have very rough skin on the tips of two finger on both hands so I use it there too &amp; it has pretty much solved that problem.  Lastly, I have very dry, flaking &amp; itchy skin, sometimes painful spot on each my cheeks &amp; not the ones on my face either.  This has pretty much healed them!  I need to see a Dermatologist but I have enough on my plate so this is working so I can&#x27;t complain.  I love this Argan Oil &amp; can&#x27;t rave enough about it &amp; their customer service.  To me that is part of what makes a good company!!!  Peace &amp; health to all! 💫</li>
            <li> Came nicely packaged, in good shape with both a solid cap And a dispenser cap. Recieved an email detail usages and a contact for questios, concern, etc. Great high quality produt. Feels great on skin and hair and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural has a great product line made from quality ingredients. When purchasing various health and beauty products, the research I performed could be tiring, and in the end, frustrating. After using many products from InstaNatural, I know that I don&#x27;t have to do the in depth research anymore. Their Argan Oil is no exception. It&#x27;s organic, and is a great multipurpose moisturizer that everyone in the house can use for all sorts of reasons, from hair to skin, with great benefits. Both my husband and I have suffered from various skin conditions, such as eczema and acne, and this product does not case any ill side effects or flair ups. I&#x27;ve passed on some of my bottle (which is going to last for awhile!) to my mother, who has dealt with a lifetime of frizzy hair and dry skin. I know she will benefits from the Argan oil as well!</li>
            <li> Use at night.  Very good product for my sensitive, rosasea facial skin.</li>
            <li> Wish I could say that I loved this product, however I have combination skin. I was assured that it wouldn&#x27;t make my hair and skin oily by friends, however I am disappointed because I  can&#x27;t even use it on my hands because it doesn&#x27;t soak in as stated and seams to end up in my hair. Thank you</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of argan oil as a moisturizer and this product is a great value. Many other argan oils I have used are much more expensive for less oil. This product is organic and works just as well as the others. The dispenser is really good at controlling output and reducing waste. And the quantity makes it the perfect size to use for hair, whereas in smaller bottles I never felt there was enough to use on more than my face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received the products for review free of charge. I was not compensated in any other way. All opinions are my own..</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff!!!! I use it on my hair, face and hands and it makes everything so soft!</li>
            <li> It has very strong smell when first applied but the smell goes away once absorbed. It does help my skins stay moisturized but I just can&#x27;t tell if it works better than using jojoba oil which I can get much cheaper from local trader store. This argan oil is very sticky,  not as smooth  as you can use it liberally as a massage oil. I use jojoba oil to massage face and neck but Argan oil is too sticky that I am afraid may result in too much pressure too skin if used as massage oil as you have to apply a lot more strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the reviews of many suspecting the oil is not genuine, I bought two brands together. They smell the same, same stickiness and same effect when applied. I do believe these are genuine.</li>
            <li> Really good quality!! Helped my lips out since they were messed up. ChapStick and lip balm weren&#x27;t making it better. Also has helped with dandruff  had thick patches of it but now has reduced and my hair looks shinier.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by Dr. Axe. Best Argan Oil I found so far. Good stuff</li>
            <li> I have used many products with Argan Oil but I have never used the pure version so I was really excited to give it a try and to be true I am very very happy that I tried the Pure Argan oil. The Argan oil is awesome. It is truly multipurpose oil; you use it for hair, skin and even nails.&lt;br /&gt;During winter my skin becomes very dry and it is very hard to keep it moisture for a long time. I have to keep on moisturizing every 4-5 hrs. But with the Argan oil this is not the case, it keeps my skin moisturized for 10-12 hrs. It absorbs fast on skin and the skin stay moisturized for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I have a long and curly hair and the Argan Oil helped me a lot to reduce the frizz and with nourishment of my dry hair. When I need deep nourishment for hair I apply it prior to shampooing my hair. I massage a liberal amount of the oil on my scalp and let it rest for 30 mins to 1 hr., even sometimes overnight and shampoo as usual.  This treatment leaves my hair soft and shiny and after a few applications like this, my hair is strong too.&lt;br /&gt;And when I need to reduce the frizz then I apply 2-3 drops of the oil on my hair it gives a nice shine too.&lt;br /&gt;And for nails my cuticles do not dry so easily now.&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is everyone with severe dry skin must try this out.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product free for testing and reviewing but the opinion is 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Im so pleased that I gave this Organic Argan Oil a try! I dont want to be without it now. It transformed my dry toenails and feels so good on my hair and fingernails too.And my lips love it! Thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li> i am from morocco and this stuff is truly 100% Argan oil!!!!&lt;br /&gt;i have oily scalp and dry ends so i only use it on my split ends after bow drying my hair and wow can believe how shiny and healthy it look, its not greassy and doesn&#x27;t make your hair look dirty like styling product do.&lt;br /&gt;my Hair type is fine flyaway and wavy, the worst to deal with...!&lt;br /&gt;i originally got it for my face has a natural moisturizer and to help minimize a rash i have on my cheeks but it didn&#x27;t do much other than making my cheeks feel less dry which is goo but the rash still present, but that doesn&#x27;t mean its no good its just mean that my skin is a more serious condition i need to bee looking at with a Derm. But since using it for about 6 weeks now i can say i saw a difference in my hair looking more healthier than ever without all those harsh chemical \.&lt;br /&gt;my conclusion DEFINITELY WORTH the try..!!! and i will recommended to my friends at least this specifique brand cause they are a lot of Argan Oil out there i am only speaking for this one!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product...I am using it everywhere! My face, hair, hands, nails and feet, too! It has a lovely hint of a fruity scent, very subtle. I highly recommend the brand, you get a lot for a good price!</li>
            <li> Thus far I&#x27;ve only used this product on my face and it feels really good. Doesn&#x27;t feel too oily, but does give my skin the extra moisturizing that it needs during these winter months.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product and a reasonable price for Argan oil.  I bought two bottles from Amazon already.  The nutty scent is mild and goes away a few minutes after I apply it to my skin/face.</li>
            <li> I LOVE that this product is so versatile!!! You can use it on skin, face, acne, nails, hair, etc. I&#x27;ve started using it on my face at night since it is oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 72, live in Pennsylvania&#x27;s cold winters, and Argon oil is keeping my skin well moisterized without leaving a layer of film. Since Argon oil soaks right into my skin, I use this under my makeup providing protection and softness. It&#x27;s also good for my nails and hands, as well as my grey color treated hair, concentrating on the ends. Highly recommend  Instanatural&#x27; s organic product.</li>
            <li> I really like this. It is very moisturizing and love that it gets rid of acne. I haven&#x27;t notice a difference in acne but im sure it takes time.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my sister and myself, and we both love it. We will be ordering it again!</li>
            <li> I used this after my shower last night, my hair is so soft and seems to have more volume and looks healthy. This is going to be something i will use ever other day, im going to make this last as long as possible. I will recomend this product i think you will really like it.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!!! Makes my skin so soft and I feel soooo good! I will definitely buy again and again</li>
            <li> Fantastic large size for an Organic Argan Oil --- no one else sells it in such a cost effective fashion&lt;br /&gt;of this top quality!</li>
            <li> Love this!  I&#x27;ve tried many, many products for dry skin and Aryan oil is the best I&#x27;ve found.  My skin and hair are looking soft and healthy.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I had no prior knowledge of what pure argan oil smelled or looked like, so I was surprised that I didn&#x27;t really like the smell. But, I mainly used it all over my body because I was itching everywhere due to extremely dry skin. I used it for about three weeks and now my itchiness is mostly gone.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again makes your face to oily</li>
            <li> Great for moisturizing hair and skin. I love using this on my face with combination skin. Doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out but softens the dry spots. My partner uses it for his beard to soften his facial hair, and feels safe for face since it is all natural.</li>
            <li> This item is so amazing,  I will be buying more from this seller.</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle of InstaNatural Organic Argan Oil in early December of 2014 based on the recommendation of friends.  I do happen to believe in miracles just not &#x27;miracle&#x27; beauty products.  However, InstaNatural Organic Argan Oil has made me a believer.  My facial skin texture is firmer &amp; more supple (being 63, that&#x27;s endorsement enough), BUT I&#x27;m also getting great results on my nails (no more rough cuticles and growth &amp; appearance are overall improved), each day I place a few drops in my hands &amp; run my fingers through my hair prior to styling whether or not I&#x27;ve shampooed that day with the upshot being hair that doesn&#x27;t just &#x27;APPEAR healthy&#x27;, it IS healthy.  I am so impressed that I&#x27;ve ordered another bottle as a back- up since running out is simply not an option I care to face!  I recommend this product unhesitatingly.</li>
            <li> I am just starting to use this oil so the jury is still out on effectiveness.  The price an fast shipping were excellent as are product warranties.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used argan oil, but was tempted by what I saw on QVC.  That brand was so much more expensive than InstaNatural!  I was glad to find the InstaNatural on Amazon.  The oil is very good for moisturizing my face, hands, and other dry spots.  A little goes a long way and I hope that InstaNatural Argan Oil will still be available when I need a new bottle.  Some people have complained about the odor.  There is a slight odor, but it is not unpleasant to me and it is gone before I&#x27;ve finished rubbing the oil in.   (UPDATE:  May 2016,  This is the third bottle I&#x27;ve bought and I am very happy with it.  Thank you.)</li>
            <li> Very happy w Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I love this oil it leaves my face nice and smooth and I love it for my hair perfect</li>
            <li> While this oil is fine as a lubricant, it is not good as a moisturizer because it doesn&#x27;t absorb and stays on the surface all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not good for skin or hair</li>
            <li> This is wonderful - especially for travel - it does hair, nails, face and body!!!</li>
            <li> I love argan oil for my hair and I cannot say enough good things about this company.  I had an issue with another oil I ordered from Instanatural (the pump did not work, the oil was fine), and I was sent a brand new bottle free of charge and very quickly.  I would recommend this brand purely for the customer service.</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan oil for over a month and love it.  My skin feels soft and smooth, and I love the aroma.</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast, works well, except the terrible smell.</li>
            <li> Just used it for the second time today.  It is a good quality product and very effective.  I like the price and hope it stays there so I don&#x27;t have to shop around anymore.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product. I have used Argan oil before (on my natural, dreadlocked hair) and enjoyed the way it not only was absorbed by my hair but how it left my hair with a natural-appearing glossy shine. InstaNatural Argan oil is the first 100% pure Argan oil I have used. I received an email from the manufacturer, which prompted me to try it sooner than later--I bought it to use when the weather turned bitter cold. Well, the weather has turned! My hands were so dry and ashy-looking today that washing them after restroom visits was surely a necessary  but dreaded task. I used the oil today, expecting a greasy, smelly mess. To my surprise, the extra paper towels I took for use after application were not needed! The oil disappeared into my skin quite quickly and the \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; was not overpowering, dissipating as quickly as the oil had penetrated my dry skin. The comfort lasted even after the next hand-washing. I am so very pleased that I purchased this product in time for the cold, dry winter season.</li>
            <li> i love  this oil and its price! So glad I found this company on amazon.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast shipping, thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my hair, and it is working great! The sellers are also very helpful, providing a list of ways to take advantage of all argan oil has to offer!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t help moisturize my hair as much as I thought it would. It&#x27;s great for your skin. I have a t-zone prone oily type of skin and this doesn&#x27;t make it over oily.</li>
            <li> Timely shipping! This is a nice oil. I use it on my face as a moisturizer...it&#x27;s certainly helpful for the Winter months!</li>
            <li> I use it as a moisturizer after shower and it feels great!Who needs chemical products if it is a better natural alternative!</li>
            <li> This argan oil works great! It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t leave my face looking greasy and the moisture lasts all day. The smell also goes away very quickly.</li>
            <li> this oil is great and lived up to previous reviews! It instsntly makes your hair soft and is also a detangler. The best part is that you do not need a lot, and that is coming from a person with a head full of thick hair!</li>
            <li> I have no complaints at all with this company&#x27;s argan oil.  It does smell different (stronger) from the other 100% pure certified organic argan oils I&#x27;ve used before it.  I use it on my face, hair, and body.  It really helps soften and calm my dry, coarse, frizzy, and curly hair.  I have oily skin, but it helps control my skin&#x27;s oil production so my face never looks oily.  For my friends who have dry skin, it really helps keep it moisturized.  Now my skeptic friends can&#x27;t stop using Argan oil either.  Argan oil balances one&#x27;s skin, no matter what skin type you have.  It truly is a magic beauty potion!</li>
            <li> This is a great quality argan oil. I love argan oil and use it on a daily basis. I use it in my hair and on my face. My hair is dry, brittle and so frizzy and this helps tame it away. When I get out of the shower I put a few pumps on my hand and run over mostly the ends of my hair. I would avoid putting a bunch on the roots.  It feels great on my face. Leaves my skin soft and hydrated. Instanatural  is a great brand and I love their products. This oil is organic and that is definitely something I love in a product. I will definitely continue using! *sample provided to review</li>
            <li> Great item, fast shipping, thank you.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel sooooo soft. Not greasy.</li>
            <li> Wonder Argan Oil at an affordable price.  Does exactly as advertised.  Also, they sent me an email explaining the many uses, which was nice and unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way.  Hair is shiny, controls fly aways, helps with smoothing down  hair without weighing it down. Great on my sensitive skin, face included.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.  If you are in the market for Argan Oil, you won&#x27;t be sorry trusting this.</li>
            <li> Exvellant product, i use it in my skin care lotions</li>
            <li> Wonderful pure argan oil!  This article http://draxe.com/argan-oil-benefits-skin-hair/&lt;br /&gt;by Dr. Axe made this oil the clear choice and it is meeting all expectations! Thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li> has a pump that is very useful. makes hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS. I use this every night after I cleanse my face. this leaves my skin so smooth and clean. Also works great on my hair. highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil mainly to use on my hair.  I have processed, colored hair and it gets dried out and damaged.  I use one pump in my hand and rub them together and work into my hair and then use one pump again after I dry my hair and it helps to put moisture back into my hair and tame the fly aways.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair, my face and my body. I love the healthy sheen it gives my hair and the glow it gives my skin but unfortunately the moisture doesn&#x27;t last long for my arms and legs which seem to be going through withdrawal since I finished off my cellulite cream, stretch mark and scar cream and youth express age-defying Moisturizer...those were some awesome moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to using it on my face because I don&#x27;t feel like it lasts on my body and I tend to feel and look dry after a few hours. It&#x27;s amazing on the hair or doubled with a moisturizer though. I love the smell of it too. It also works great with acne prone skin and sometimes I use a drop of it in my foundation for that dewy healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was sent this product to try out and review. See the full review on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> This is such a versatile product and has drastically changed my skin and hair.  the bottle has lasted forever and i will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Love it! I use it on my hair and then what ever is left I rub into my hands. My skin is soft and my hair looks great! You only need a tiny bit otherwise it will make your hair look greasy. Using a little more on the ends and a little less near the scalp.</li>
            <li> I purchased this specific brand because it looked to be the best value and am super happy with this argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine curly hair that gets frizzy.  Just a small drop of oil rubbed between my fingers does the trick.  I&#x27;ve also used on my hands and it softens without feeling oily.  I know there are many other uses for argan oil and I will be getting educated.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. Within a day of applying it as a face moisturizer I knew I had stumbled on something good. Love it! The instanatural also sent a mail on tips on how to use argan oil which I found to be very useful. Great company, great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is Amazing! As a new comer to Argan Oil I was surprised at how versatile it is. You can apply it to any part or your body, from hair to heels. My skin absorbs it fairly quickly, no matter where I put it, and because if this, it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily sheen, just a silky softness! The glass bottle, dark container, cold-pressed oil, and 100% Argan are what you should look for in an Argan oil and this stuff has it all! I myself like that it uses a pump to dispense the oil, I find it to be less messy. I love how raw and organic it is. No harsh chemicals or preservatives to complicate things. Definitely added to my daily beauty regimen! Thank you InstaNatural for my bottle. I love, love, love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Never used Argan oil before and never knew what it does. Bought if for $17.97, so I like the price. It is one of the most expensive oils (COMPARED to coconut, apricot, grapeseed, etc!!). Use it mostly for my face and nails. Face feels great after I apply (about 4-5 pumps for the whole face and neck). Love the smell of this oil. Smells - reminds me a bit of olives, very slightly!, though it has it own smell. At first its oily when applied, but it absorbs fast and within an hour dries completely and then skin feels amazingly soft and nice.</li>
            <li> This I team is for someone else. I don&#x27;t know how it works.</li>
            <li> Works well. Takes a bit of time to absorb on me, but no breakouts. Skin feels good.</li>
            <li> This is what I call multipurpose of everything in a bottle. I can use this on my skin by adding a couple pumps to my moisturizer. Then apply to my face and feel relaxed. I know I am putting a good product with additional moisturizers in it. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! Next way I am using this is by using it on my hands and cuticles. If you have dry ones and needing something extra so they don&#x27;&#x27;t crack and bleed think about this.</li>
            <li> The oil is wonderful. My hair is now soft and smooth without being greasy.  I works amazingly well on my dry elbows and heels.  A little goes a long way so it&#x27;s economical too.&lt;br /&gt;My order arrived in a timely manner, well packed, and in perfect condition. Before my order arrived I received a note telling me about the product and giving me contact information in case anything wasn&#x27;t to my liking.  I will order this product again from this company, and recommend it highly to my friends.</li>
            <li> Great product dies it&#x27;s job. This review was given in exchange as a gift for the product</li>
            <li> Best argan oil I&#x27;ve ever used! I use it as a hair and skin moisturizer,  a heat protectant, to balance my oily skin,  for stretch marks,  dry chapped lips,  and much more. My hair is getting thicker and it is repairing my split ends. You can go wrong with this product!</li>
            <li> Nice. Shiny but soaks in face. Great on hair too. Addicted.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased and satisfied with this product. It works wonders on dry skin. I love it!</li>
            <li> I really think this is bogus argan oil . Mine was thick and lumpy, almost looked separated and it smelled like a sheep farm! Nasty . I&#x27;m returning it. You get what you pay for. Next time I&#x27;m spending the extra money and getting it from a legit website like Mountain Rose Herbs. Don&#x27;t buy this , I&#x27;m warning you</li>
            <li> LOVE this oil!  This is my first experience with argan oil.  First, I received my shipment early which was great because I was anxious to try it.  I&#x27;m 67 yrs old and have tried all manner of moisturizers (I wish I had the money I&#x27;ve spent over the years on stuff that didn&#x27;t work too!).  This oil makes my skin feel very soft all over.  The little bumps I used to have on the back of my arms - gone! It absorbs quickly and the fact that I&#x27;m using an organic oil on my body&#x27;s largest organ, makes me feel confident that I&#x27;m not putting dangerous chemicals into me.  Using this and Walgreen&#x27;s $8.99 alpha lipoic acid cream is taking my face to a whole new level of moisture and smoothness!</li>
            <li> I Received This Product in Exchange for an Honest Review. I Have to say I already Love it. Have used on my Nails, Hair , &amp; Face. I will continue using this Fabulous Product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my hair for several months, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference, but I&#x27;ll use the whole bottle to make sure.</li>
            <li> We are very happy with this oil, we use it on face and body it absorbs quickly and leaves skin feeling great. InstaNatural Organic Argon oil is the best product I have found for my face.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite argan oil hands down . I&#x27;ve tried other argan oils and this is my favorite . quality is there !! put it on any blemish, scar, irritated skin and this works wonders .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using argan oil in conjunction with coconut oil for my skin for the last month, and it has done wonders for my acne. With the exception of hormonal break outs, I no longer get zits and my scars from past zits have lightened significantly. Not sure if I&#x27;m applying it wrong but I can&#x27;t wear make up over the argan oil like other people have written. It doesn&#x27;t soak into my skin. I generally use them at night as a deep skin moisturizer. The shipping was fast and I love the way it smells. I would order this again!</li>
            <li> Goku approves. Repairs all the damages my hair has to deal with in transforming to Super Saiyan beyond. The shiny black, blue and red hair you&#x27;ve seen so far are all thanks to this amazing product!</li>
            <li> This argan oil feels so nice. Used it just a couple of times so far, but it has already softened my dry spots. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love the oil.&lt;br /&gt;It is a light oil that absorbs quickly and has a slight nutty smell.</li>
            <li> Great Product and Great customer service by Instanatural.  Best Argan Oil on the market and worth every penny.  Will continue to buy this product and other Instanatural Products</li>
            <li> My new miracle go-to oil for burns, dry skin and combination skin. Packed with vitamin E and antioxidants! Had a sunburn after my vacation that started to crack, burn, itch and peel. This stuff soothed the itching and burning almost instantly!  Thank God! I&#x27;ve had my fair share of sunburns because I&#x27;m pasty, this was a real help!</li>
            <li> I love this product, the oil absorbs into my hair and does not have it sticky at all, I also put some on my face and it leaves my skin supple, It really restore moisture to whatever it touches. I WOULD BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.</li>
            <li> This completely DRIED out my hair and stripped color. And the smell was not pleasant.</li>
            <li> Product as described; would buy from again.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product . It works really well and arrived quickly . I like that it&#x27;s in a glass bottle and it smells really good.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!!!! Product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my teenage daughter and she likes it. it makes her hair shine....just dont put too much toward the roots or it can look oily.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful argan oil.  I use it mainly as a face moisturizer and it works fabulously.  The company has excellent customer service as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and was able to use it 3 days later (standard shipping). My (4b) hair is soft, manageable and is retaining length. I&#x27;m not sure if the smell is standard, but I can&#x27;t argue the results.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied.  I bought the product to use in my hair but you can only use it for hair if you used half the bottle.  It doesn&#x27;t spread easily.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever! It just melts into my dry skin.... My only draw back is, there is simply not enought to take a bath in :)</li>
            <li> This oil is a great sealant when used alone. I use it mostly in addition to my &#x27;already made&#x27; oil mixture. Adds shine like no other, and lasts long in my hair</li>
            <li> I love the feel of argan oil for my face and neck.  I also use on my fingernails but havent noticed any improvement there. I have dry skin so I like using this also on my arms and feet.</li>
            <li> Four times left essage I am satisfied it helps dryness of my skin and a scar from pre-cancer treatments.&lt;br /&gt;So far it has help  dryness a lot I can not tell yet if help scars but I am going to keep using it to see in time&lt;br /&gt;If it will help scar but dryness of skin a lot. I will recommend it for dryness and making FACE softer.</li>
            <li> So far I am very happy using in the recipe for moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The smell is not pleasant and the oil doesn&#x27;tt seem to moisturize ad we ad other brands.</li>
            <li> I got this after reading other reviews.  I was using Moroccan Oil and this is half the price.  I am very pleased by it&#x27;s being thinner than the Moroccan Oil, because it&#x27;s easier to use.  Also, I received an e mail from the company telling me the different ways I could use this.  One of them was on my nails.  I never thought of doing that.  i&#x27;ve wanted to strengthen my nails forever, so I thought why not I&#x27;ve tried everything else.  Well, I wish I had learned about this a long time ago.  My nails are growing faster and lasting longer.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Very good product! Fast delivery. Will buy again.🙏</li>
            <li> Its light and easily absorbed into my skin. I feel my skin is clearer and subtle after using it for a few days. GOOD Product for the price, I like it!</li>
            <li> As I get older I&#x27;ve had increasing issues with eczema and just plain dry itchy skin.  As the temperature drops below 50 degrees F I&#x27;m increasingly uncomfortable the colder it gets.  I do have a dermatologist (I&#x27;m a late 50&#x27;s fair skinned guy) and he recommended various lotions that worked but never very well.  My wife had some Josie Maran argan oil, I tried it and liked it but I&#x27;m not here on the planet to make someone else rich, no matter how cute they are.  I decided to see what Amazon had to offer and discovered this product.  I could not be more pleased.  This argan oil has enabled me to be much more &amp;#34;comfortable in my own skin&amp;#34; during the colder winter months in the northeast US.  While I&#x27;m never 100% comfortable the use of this product has dramatically relieved my symptoms.  It has worked far better than any OTC lotion I&#x27;ve used and far better than numerous prescription medications which are generally topical steroids and probably not very good for you anyway.  I don&#x27;t hand out 5 stars to every product I review but wanted to give this product an enthusiastic recommendation.  It works.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased it. It works great on my body, face, and hair, as a moisturizer and frizz remover.</li>
            <li> All natural and works great on my skin. I bought some for my friend too, she loves It so much that she asked me to buy again. Her daughter use it for her hair, and she is so satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this stuff!!  Really makes your hair shiney!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this Argon Oil. A little goes a long way -- purchased many for dry skin and it really helps moisturize.  I use it under my regular moisturizer and love the way it makes my skin glow. I also appreciate the attentiveness of the company regarding the product. Great customer care!</li>
            <li> Great product in a great package! the oil it self is amazing and is NOT greasy. It&#x27;s especially helpful to have the pump so I can get the desired amount and not have excess (and waste!). I would recommended this for hair, nails, and skin. :)</li>
            <li> This 100% Pure Certified Organic Argan Oil is by far my favorite. I use it mostly for my face and my hands as a moisturizer and it has kept my skin sane during the dry winter season. You can also use it for your hair and nails. I don&#x27;t always use it for my hair to tame the frizz because I feel it&#x27;s a \little heavy but I feel that if I put too little, it&#x27;s not doing its job. However, I would put it in my scalp overnight, as some sort of &amp;#34;hot oil&amp;#34;. It makes my hair softer and shinier after rinsing it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom also uses this for her face. She has very sensitive skin and has mild rosacea so she&#x27;s very picky with anything she puts on her face, otherwise, it will get triggered. She loves this Argan Oil and uses it regularly without complaints of her rosacea acting up.</li>
            <li> I love argon oil!.....the price of this brand is marvelous.... but I am used to the subtle fresh scent of argon oil that I have been using.....Will probably purchase more in the future in addition to the one I have been using because the price is amazing......</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for my naturally curly hair!  Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy when straightening it either.</li>
            <li> Yes I am very happy with my argan oil.  I use it on my face, neck and a little on my hair.  It seems&lt;br /&gt;to make the wrinkles look lighter.  I believe  if I continue to use it they will eventually go away.  My&lt;br /&gt;daughter said she could see a difference in my face and I have only been using it 30 days.  I still have&lt;br /&gt;some left in my first bottle but I bought 2 more bottles, I for my extra bathroom and one as an extra.  I use&lt;br /&gt;it twice a day.  I wash my face and neck, dry then apply argan oil.  I use a compact powder over that to take&lt;br /&gt;take the shine away.  My face looks much better and I&#x27;m not spending a lot of money on it.  I put a little on my&lt;br /&gt;unruly hair every time I wash it which is every other day.  Now I don&#x27;t have the fly aways.  It&#x27;s great for dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my face feel very smooth.  My daughter is beginning to get wrinkles around the mouth and when I told&lt;br /&gt;her about it she is going to start using it also.</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt....just in time to make beard oil for a Christmas present. Quality seemed great and price was right.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product and how quickly I received it!</li>
            <li> I used the one on my arms and legs and hands to moisturize my skin! I did put it on my feet and then applied socks to them over night!&lt;br /&gt; I still use it to this day, and I really like how it keeps my skin moisturized! I put a few drops on one of my palms, and rub them together. Then I rub my palms gently on my face and &amp;#34;smoothe in&amp;#34; the oil! It&#x27;s  helped my face stay moisturized!</li>
            <li> Used this in my hair and loved it! My hair is thick, curly, and gets dried out...this was just what I needed. Can&#x27;t wait to try it on my skin!</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product that should be part of your daily routine.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it enough or long enough to know if this merits 5 starts, but I like it. I use it on my face and neck and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. My daughter uses it on her long, long hair.</li>
            <li> Cannot wait for use this for better, hair and face.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> Extremely please with the quality, cost and size of the product. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Great beauty product; immediately brightens my skin, with a beautiful glow.  It is not &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;; the oil dissolves into the skin leaving it hydrated and glowing.  I&#x27;ve just started putting a small amount on my nails/cuticles and am also seeing a healing difference.  Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> I naturally have curly, frizzy hair that is very dry and tangled. But I started using this Argan oil a few months ago, and my hair looks so much healthier and fuller! I would definitely recommend Instanatural to anyone - their customer service is amazing too! I want to try their vitamin C facial toner next.</li>
            <li> I like the spray bottle, it helps to make the application easier. The bottle came wrapped in bubble wrap but was a little greasy.    I sprayed just a tad bit to give my hair a shiny look. The Aragon oil didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy or heavy.    I also like that it&#x27;s organic and natural ingridents. I haven&#x27;t tried any other uses besides for my hair. But I love Aragon oil products and this is one of my favorites now.    A bonus is the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is wonderful.  I use it mainly on my face and what is left on my fingertips is rubbed into my cuticles.</li>
            <li> I use it daily instead of lotions, it works great for me. I noticed huge difference in how my skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptic about buying this oil in the beginning... but I would admit that it actually works great and leaves my skin looking healthy. I was told how the wonders of Argan oil can help in every way, and i must say that it&#x27;s actually done its job!  (Thanx for the 50% off coupon towards my next bottle of argan oil)..</li>
            <li> I love it for my face,</li>
            <li> Love this oil!  I use it on my hair and my fingernails too! It is awesome!</li>
            <li> I use this oil as a moisturizer on damp skin and it has really helped my dry skin.  When I use this oil my skin feels soft and supple! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I use it for my face and hair. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I found this oil much thinner than other oil brands I had purchased and it did not soak into my skin as well.  It also seemed to make my skin break out where the other oil I had purchased did not.</li>
            <li> My mother in law love it, great for skin and hair. Is enough for the price. Good quality</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually my second bottle, and I love it. I bought this one for my mom. I normally don&#x27;t like heavy, greasy  anything on my face, but after turning 30 something, my skin got extremely dry, and I had to give this bottle a try. I use it only at night. And by the time I wake up in the morning, the oil is completely absorbed and my face feels not dry but freshed. It&#x27;s my rutine now and I use it every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the good job!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in mint condition.  Use this for over a month and my hair is softer and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> Good quality product, I very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Love this product...use it every day on my face...I finally look and feel moisturized and you only have to use a small amount</li>
            <li> Wonderful for hair, skin, and everything.</li>
            <li> A m a z i n g!  My hair and face look and feel so healthy after using for just 1 week.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;My wife uses this product and absolutley loves it. She says that this oil made her hair look thicker and reduced hair fall.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The product is excellent! ☺</li>
            <li> Love this Argan Oil....</li>
            <li> I received the Argan Oil as promised packaged securely. I love the way it feels on application and how it makes my skin so soft and touchable.  Everyone with dryskin issues should be using this..I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Finally solved my itchy dry winter skin problem. Much better than useless lotions containing water which evaporates and also better than greasy olive or coconut oils. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product is great for my very dry skin. My skin feels hydrated yet not greasy. I also use this as a make up remover prior to the cleanser for easy breezy feeling. Other than that this oil is really great!</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have stated, it smells BAD. Like manure-on-a-farm bad. I tried it a couple times but it was just too insulting to my nostrils. On the plus side, it did hydrate my face...though it was oily for a while. I was going to use this for a face moisturizer before applying my make-up, but I&#x27;d likely have to wait a good 10-15 minutes before applying said make-up to let the oil soak in the skin first. I REALLY wanted to like this stuff, for the price point, it&#x27;s a great deal. I&#x27;m debating between ordering another bottle in hopes I got one from a bad/smelly batch or bagging it altogether. Hmmm...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6/8/2015:&lt;br /&gt;I ended up ordering a second bottle only to have it smell the same. Both bottles had an expiration date of 12/17 on the bottom. I finally called Instanatural directly and told them about the terrible smells of the 2 bottles that I ordered from Amazon, and without any reservation, the representative kindly said that it should not smell so bad (and that they&#x27;ve been in talks with Amazon about how they store the product) and sent me an entirely new bottle FREE OF CHARGE. FANTASTIC customer service! She said that the oil should smell similar to olive oil and not a cow&#x27;s ass (she didn&#x27;t say that last part exactly). I did receive that 3rd bottle a couple days ago, and in does in fact smell the same. Wah wah. However, I try now to place the smell in an olive category instead of a farm animal category and that helps my nose bare it a bit more. It still smells yucky, but I can take it now knowing that it&#x27;s just the smell of the regular product and not from a bad/old bottle. 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This stuff took a bit to get used to.  It has a funny, olive oil smell, and it&#x27;s too heavy for my hair.  My hair is fine, but the water where I&#x27;m at is absoluetly filled with chlorine and chemicals and dries my hair to straw so I had taken to putting some oil in it.  I had been using Avon but wanted to try something different, and this was just too heavy.  I do however, like using it on my legs and arms after a shower.  Like I said, the water here just turns you into a raisin and I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of lotions.  This stuff I smooth on while wet, even on my face now, pat myself dry but leave it to sit on my lower legs while they dry and voila, smooth skin.  So it works....depending on what you need it for.  Oh, and there doesn&#x27;t appear to be any odor on my towel or my skin after it dries, which is nice so it doesn&#x27;t compete with lotion or perfume smells.</li>
            <li> So I must write a review here on this oil!  I used it on my hair in place of my Bio Silk.  AMAZING!  It made my colored hair look so healthy as I heat styled it.  It did NOT make it heavy and oily like so many products do!  I got compliments from the first day I used it, on how healthy my hair looked! I had used the Argan hair mask, then styled it with this...the combination was amazing.... a sidebar would be, that I had a very stressful day yesterday, so when this happens, I get super dry, itchy patches on my skin, usually a leg!  I decided to try some of this oil on the patch to see what happened and the burning, heat and itching went away within a few minutes!!!!! COOL!</li>
            <li> First time using it and i like it especially for my hair</li>
            <li> My shipment arrived early and the product is amazing. Very light and my hair feels amazing. I will be ordering from this awesome company again. I also love the little note I received. It was a very nice touch.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> I tried this oil as a hair mask, as a hand cream, as a nail oil, on my face, on my feet ... its so awesome that you can use it for so many different purposes. I seriously love these kind of products where you just need one little bottle to spoil your body, face and hair. Argan oil is definetly going to be a new must have of mine and I will have to buy another bottle as soon as this one is empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives my hair more volume and makes it shiny and beautiful, it helps my dry hands and my nails (e.g. after using nail polish remover when they are all dry), I like it on my skin after taking a bath, when my skin is all dry and I even love it on my face as a overnight treatment. Its makes both my body and my face so soft and smooth. I really cannot get enough of it. Especially now in Winter its just perfect to have.</li>
            <li> Feels great! Skin texture has improved! Absorbs better on damp face! Must use it consistently.</li>
            <li> I love Argan oil for it&#x27;s many uses. This product is great alone, or combined with other creams for a greater effect. I use it on my face, skin and hair. This particular one comes in a bigger bottle and is scent free. Great product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is very rich and moisturizing, and I love it for skin. I live in a dry climate, and I need something heavy duty to keep my skin moisturized. Love this!</li>
            <li> First time I have used this Argan oil and I really like it.  I applied to a knee and elbow floor burn while playing pickleball and it seemed to heal really quickly.  I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. This is my second bottle. I use it twice a day on my face only and it lasts over a year. A little goes a long way. Gives my face a beautiful dewy fresh look. People compliment my skin all the time now. It give this amazing glow and just makes my skin look radiant. Great for clearing up and moisturizing those little break outs once a month too. I am addicted to this argan oil and will continue to use forever. Its just makes my skin feel and look amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Keep it in the shower.</li>
            <li> The InstaNatural Argan Organic Oil is excellent for the hair. My hair was a disaster after the Argan Oil, the hair look shinny and manageable. The hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy and it is easy to comb. The Argan Oil is excellent, I use it after washing my hair and when it is dry.</li>
            <li> This helps my nails and cuticle a lot.</li>
            <li> so far its ok i haven&#x27;t seen any major changes in my skin have only use it for a short time will let you know after 30 days of use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my hands and some various dry spot. I don&#x27;t notice anything special about it.</li>
            <li> Came to my home quick and in one piece. Has a very toasted nutty scent that goes away quickly. Only draw back is the pump. The one I got doesn&#x27;t fit my bottle!</li>
            <li> great Argon oil product</li>
            <li> Love this oil; use it in multiple ways: on skin and hair. Not too oily; nice and light.</li>
            <li> Everything arrived perfectly and on time.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the oil daily since it arrived and I already notice my hair getting shinier and it might just be my imagination but it also seems like my hair started growing faster. Ive also been using it on my face but i haven&#x27;t notice any changes there but it is a great moisturizer. If you have oily skin i don&#x27;t recommend using it on your face. I am 100% satisfied &amp; will be reordering. ♡</li>
            <li> NO LIE. This product made my skin sooo much smoother and younger. The best thing ever for my skin.</li>
            <li> To keep my hair moisturized throughout the day, I mixed the argan oil with my dry shampoo. It softened my curls on those lazy hair days. It&#x27;s also a great body moisturizer.

            <li> My daughter recommended I buy this product for my hair.  I love it and ise it every day!  My hair was damaged from using the hot iron.  I am using it for the tips of my hair and also to prevent frizziness.  After reading more about it, I now use it on my face in the evenings.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is suffering from dry hair/skin.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural is one of my favorite company. I’ve used several product including argan oil hair mask, argan hair treatment blend oil, Emu Oil, and Lavender oil. It seems like they are pretty solid with their product quality. I just love argan oil for my skin! I like InstaNatural argan oil and didn’t have any problem with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased Argan oil in hopes of abating my wrinkles, if only for a few more years. I like the way it feels on my skin and I also am using it on my hair with good results. I am going to see if I can find some good recipes for facial washes that include this natural, healthful oil. I will definitely purchase more when this supply begins to wane.</li>
            <li> i love the oil.  i use it everyday on my face and hands.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good comunication, good product, thanks</li>
            <li> Excellent product, my skin is radiant</li>
            <li> Just been using it over a couple of weeks, and i love it! I like how it moisturize my skin but doesn&#x27;t feel so greasy after applying it. Totally will buy again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great Argan oil product.  Leaves skin soft without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Never had my hair so soft and now it is so easy to brush.&lt;br /&gt;It is 1000000 times better than any chemical hair treatment.</li>
            <li> Amazing. I pump twice in my hand, rub together and then onto my face. I use it to moisturize in the morning and before bedtime.  I have oily skin and don&#x27;t have breakouts. I also use it instead of a makeup primer.</li>
            <li> Very oily feel and really not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s a great product, Leaves your skin silky soft .Wish I had knowed about it sooner.Your skin just drinks it up without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this Argan Oil.  It&#x27;s so great for my skin, especially now that my skin is getting dry.  I&#x27;ve been able to stop using all of these very expensive products and just use this awesome oil.  I know it is nourishing my skin and it doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals or weird stuff in it.  Just pure Argan oil.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product, have been using on my face and hair for several weeks, will definately be part of my beauty regimen from now on!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still searching for a good organic argan oil - this one makes me itchy all over and irritates my skin. I know I&#x27;m not allergic because I tried Josie Maran&#x27;s sample from Sephora and loved it. I prefer the scent of Josie Maran too, this one is hard to apply because I have to plug my nose :( Does not smell nutty, smells industrial.</li>
            <li> I was not a fan of the smell and the consistency of this oil. I wanted to send it back, but I was over the allowed time period. It has a strong smell that I don&#x27;t like smelling on my face all day.</li>
            <li> I paid full price for this on amazon, and will definitely be doing so again when I run out. I had another brand before, I don&#x27;t remember what it was called, but it was over 3 times the price of this one. This one is WAY better. I liked mine before, but it&#x27;s nowhere near as good as this one. This one is thinner and absorbs better, TOTALLY improved my dry skin and hair. No funky smell to it whatsoever. It has a slight butter smell... It&#x27;s actually a nice smell, but extremely light. I love this stuff, and the pump is super convenient. I use it all over and in my hair. ❤️❤️ Obsessed</li>
            <li> So stinky I mixed Rosemary oil with it, so will see how that works. The squirt bottle works well.</li>
            <li> Everything works as we hoped for. Pricing, delivery time, packaging, and quality of product.</li>
            <li> I use this every night after I wash my face. No dry skin for me.</li>
            <li> Love it. Look younger already.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil.  They had to resend it because the shipment was lost, but they were quite gracious and extremely helpful.</li>
            <li> Works as hair mask but nothing else</li>
            <li> Great product, works as described.  No significant smell.</li>
            <li> This is awesome! I have never tried Argan Oil. It can be used for so much, that I wasn&#x27;t aware of. Before I dry my hair, I some to my wet hair. When it is dry, it looks full and full of shine. I also have used it for a moisturizer for my face and feet. My feet I rub on after shower and slip on comfy socks to sleep. My feet are super soft!</li>
            <li> I use this on my skin and hair and makes it super soft. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You really only need a few drops. Goes a long way. Used it on my husbands kinky hair. Made him some nice curls and shines.  Feels good on face makes your skin glow and healthy looking</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously awesome! It&#x27;s doing wonders on both my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> This deliciously light feeling and deeply nourishing oil has literally improved the look of my skin in just two weeks of daily use.  I put it directly on my face after washing and it is absorbed within minutes... It&#x27;s perfect for wearing under make-up!  The convenient pump makes my new Argan Oil habit one that will last a lifetime!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Argan oil as a daily moisturizer for my face morning and night and on my nail cuticles as well.  Loving it!  I have tried it in my hair, but it makes it oily looking no matter how little I put on it, so I have discontinued doing that unless I plan to shampoo before going somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;Love that it is natural and organic, too!</li>
            <li> ,When I used it, I just needed to use one application of it, with other creams I had to use two different creams to cover my dry areas. Every time I used it, I had peeling on the sides of my nose. I had to quit using it. My sister loves it and I have given her two bottles for her birthday.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I use it daily and not only for the face.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product... Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. It&#x27;s great on skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin very moisturized. Allow 5-10 minutes for the oil to absorb into the skin. Afterwards, skin feels moisturized and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience using oils instead of lotions, but this product convinced me to make the switch. I love how my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Aragon oil and I am now a convert. After only one week my face, skin and hair are smoother. I love the way my skin feels. It seems like that this bottle will last awhile too. Great value in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is Pure Argan Oil Smells Weird!!</li>
            <li> This has done wonders for my nails.  My nails have become drier as I get older and I have tried everything to keep them moistened and looking good.  This is the only thing I have found to help.  I noticed a difference immediately! It&#x27;s great on skin, too.  Haven&#x27;t tried in my hair yet.  Love it for my face.</li>
            <li> it does what it says.</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service, delivered in a timely manner, a lot of product at a great price. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is one of the most gentle, light, fragrance free moisture  giving products I have ever used. I am one of those highly allergic people and am able to use this product.  The oil is so light you can apply it in the morning and it will be absorbed before you get to work, leaving your skin soft, relaxing creases, wrinkles - I am older and appreciate this product.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Josie Maran. It is more greasy and not easily absorbed like the Josie Maran argan oil. The oil slightly irritated my skin when I first it on, making my face itch. However the effect died down the 2nd day but it takes much longer for it to be absorbed. It has very light nutty smell, negligible in a few drops, only observed when taking a sniff from the bottle. Great value though, but I went ahead and purchased name brands (Tarte and Josie Maran) as gifts for others. I will stick with name brands one if you can afford it.</li>
            <li> Great product! I mix my own face oil using this organic Argan oil and I love it!!</li>
            <li> I was surprised with the quality of this argan oil given its low price point. The spray bottle is perfect too.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely re purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! You can use it on everything! I use it on my hair after a shower and it keeps the frizz down in addition to making my har silky, shiny, and manageable. I have thick, Mexican hair that can be hard to tame. But this oil woks wonders! I recommend washing your hair and then combing it out and then combing some of this through it. I also use it at night after I wash my face, it helped with a tiny, old scar I had. It helped make it stop itching and has reduced its appearance, mind you, the scar was tiny and on the side of my nose. Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my Argon Oil purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really did any of the things it said it would.  I used the whole bottle and all I can say is &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have not been following instructions as written, so I am going to forgo writing a rev. at this time.</li>
            <li> When I first received the oil, the seal was damaged causing some leakage; I contacted the company through email. and they responded the same day on a Friday afternoon. They shipped out a new one, which I received intact, and undamaged on that same weekend on Sunday, talk about great customer service! Tried the oil on my hair which  had become very dry and almost brittle, after I stopped using chemical products on my hair when I had my son. It worked great, I now have smooth, soft hair that is not oily,  I have thick shoulder length hair, and I use about 2 pumps.  Great way to add a heat protectant before flat ironing and using the hairdryer without chemicals!</li>
            <li> Love it! No fragrance, so I add my own essential oils---and create beautiful hair and body oil. Argan oil is the best for skin of any I&#x27;ve tried, and this brand is silky and pure, and a fabulous deal, price-wise.</li>
            <li> I love this Argon Oil.  I like the pump bottle and I use it after shower.  It feels good and moisturizing and I sometimes mix it with shea butter and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> Great for skin, hair, and nails.</li>
            <li> After reading many rave reviews about this product, I decided to give it a try. Was really impressed by how quickly it arrived. I&#x27;ve only been using for a few days but really like the way it is quickly absorbed and leaves no greasy residue. I&#x27;m feeling pretty optimistic about the results to come!</li>
            <li> This oil has improved my skin all over. I have put it in my bath too. I really Love it!</li>
            <li> Works wonders ! I have chemically treated hair which looks like the coconut husk - totally dry and unhealthy . Just rubbed a few drops of this oil on the ends and it now looks nourished ! Thanks..</li>
            <li> Love this product II leaves my ski feeling soft and it gives good shine to my hair. Love that my items get here quickly.</li>
            <li> Nice.  Arrived on time</li>
            <li> Very pure product :)  Superior hydration for hair… love it :)</li>
            <li> I love it ...love it ...love it. I&#x27;ll be ordering more I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> Although I just purchased this product I have to say in two weeks time my skin and hair looks so much better. My goal is to stay away from makeup except for occations and Argan Oil is now on my daily list of beauty regiment to achieve this goal. It is within reach. I recommend this to all women and to men as well for dry hands face etc. I will purchase this again when needed, Thank you for this pure product.</li>
            <li> I have been using argan oil on my hands and nails before bedtime and can really notice a difference.  My hands feel so smooth when I wake up and my cuticles are a lot less dry.  I also use this product on my hair.  I like to use it after styling to smooth my hair and give it a shiny look. Great product!</li>
            <li> This oil is supposed to be goldish in color according to my research, but this one is not. Despite the color I have used it to see if it was going to work for me, it doesn&#x27;t. I tested it on dry and freshly washed, it is not absorbed by my skin as described. I will not by it again from this seller. I bought a much cheaper of this oil in my local store, it was amazing. My skin loved it. Literally speaking I could apply the 3.6 oz size bottle of oil, it would have been drunk by my skin. However, the oil is filled with other oil and fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a while, but have not seen outstanding results. Very good for moisturizing in the evening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 days now..Nk more hair frizz..my hair is softer and looks healthy...It&#x27;s also a very good face moisturizer..but I am not sure if it is safe to use on the eye area..It doesnt smell that good but I dont mind..I can see excellent results !!</li>
            <li> This makes my face so smooth without feeling greasy.  Have replaced my rather expensive serum and moisturizer with this oil.  It will be my &#x27;go to&#x27; beauty product from now on.</li>
            <li> It is a bottle of oil~great price &amp; I use it on my hair &amp; skin...not much else to say...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many of Amazon&#x27;s Argan oils looking for a good substitute for the more expensive JM product that I love and this one is it.  One of the tests I do is to put the JM oil on one side of my face and body and the oil I&#x27;m trying on the other.  With this oil there was no visible difference in proformance.  Other oils won&#x27;t absorb or they smell or there is some glaring difference, like viscosity.  Other than a slight green tint this great product seems identical to the high priced oil on my skin.</li>
            <li> My daughter introduced me to your Argan Oil. I tried it on my face, lips, and hands. I felt and noticed the difference right away.  No more dry flaky skin on my face, my lips no longer peel and my hands are soft again. I am going to try it on my hair next.  I live in the interior of Alaska with bitterly cold temperatures and harsh wind, this product is now part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a convenient way to dispense the oil. This brand, and yes we have tried other brands, seems to be less sticky compared to other brands. My wife and I both have long hair, and I have a full beard. We apply it to our skin with our finger tips, there is no need to apply it to the ends of the hair, or my beard.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I use the hair dryer often to straighten my colored hair and smooth frizz so I needed a product that I could use everyday to stop splits ends and flaky/itchy scalp. I either add a few drops of the oil when washing my hair (after last rinse) and my hair is soft and without frizz after or add the oil after I washed my hair (while still wet). Either way, my hair is always soft and shiny. The oil absorbs quickly without leaving hair looking greasy. I tried using it on my face but I broke out with a few pimples (which i have never had) so I started using less on it and now my face is back to normal and soft. I would definitely buy this again. One recommendation: offer special price for two or more bottles. I would buy this as a gift for my mother/sister.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I use it on everything for everything. It settles quickly and leaves your skin nice and moisturized. Would highly recommend it to anyone. I received an great email from the company, prior to delivery, with great tips and suggestions for the Argan Oil. If you&#x27;re thinking about buying it, then definitely buy it, you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Josie Maran for a long time but right now its not in the budget. I gave this a try because of the great reviews, quantity, and the price. I was pleasantly surprised. Every morning and night I add a pump to my moisturizer and my skin soaks it up. You would think that putting it on in the morning would cause your face to be oily. But my skin looks amazing and it gave me a glow which shows under my make up. Ive tried it on my hair and it feels good. I would suggest using a little to put on the ends of my hair. If you put it near your scalp your hair will look dirty. Thank you for making such a good quality and affordable product. Im hooked!</li>
            <li> Makes hair too greasy...</li>
            <li> this oil is really good. I use it for my hair. I have really brittle curly hair and the oil leaves it soft and manageable with out having to use harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> You need less than the size of a dime in your hand and you can do your whole face...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty nice stuff</li>
            <li> Good quality and value!</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive InstaNatural Organic Argan Oil for Hair, Face, Skin and Nails.  I really appreciate that the bottle came with a screw on cap and the pump was packaged separately.  The thing that kept me from rating it as being 5 stars is the smell. To me it is a cross between burnt coffee and medicinal like a hospital.  Just not something I was looking forward to putting on my skin or hair and having to smell all day.  The nice thing is the smell fades rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for several days and does a great job of moisturizing my skin.  I am in the process of losing weight and have started getting numerous stretch marks.  I am hoping this will keep more from showing up.  Using my normal lotion wasn&#x27;t doing the trick.  The packaging says you only need a few drops but I have had to use 5 pumps to cover my hands, arms, chest and stomach.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  Nice scent!</li>
            <li> The title sums it all up.&lt;br /&gt;If you are still adventurous to try this cheap stuff, go for it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not for me</li>
            <li> I love it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Have used it from head to toe. Used it on my Moms super extra dry hair. Wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li> I absolutely live this product!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing I will be ordering this again.  I ordered two bottles and one of them was broken, I called and they send another bottle out right way.  My face, hair and skin are loving this oil.</li>
            <li> I do not agree with a lot of negative reviews. It smelled like much better than any essential oil. Also, it did not look diluted with anything else. It had a earthy texture and color. Given that however, this product did not work for me. I applied 5 drops on my thick hair and it did not absorb well at all. It left my hair oily and greasy. I must add that they sent me an email right away saying that they would refund it. Thank You!</li>
            <li> High Points: Little goes a long way Bottle is large and price is cheap Skins feels great after a month of AM and PM use  Cons: Bad odor</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a short time (several days) for a skin rash of unknown origin.  It hydrates the skin well and seems to help with lessening the itching.  My dermatologist told me to use Vaseline (ugh) but I think this works better.</li>
            <li> Light, not greasy. I use it on my face and hair. No problem with odor.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying argan oil and boy was this not a let down! I&#x27;ve been using it everywhere! From my face to my hair and even after I shower on my legs! It does it all! And the smell isn&#x27;t too strong at all! I love it! The only thing I wish is I wish I would have got some sooner! Can&#x27;t wait to buy more! *i received this with a promotional discount*</li>
            <li> I was nervous to test out this Argan Oil because in the past a similar product broke out my skin terribly. I decided that I would not use this oil on my face because my skin can be sensitive. Instead, I use it primarily on my hands. It is perfect for my dry hands, and it really soothes my cuticles. I do find the scent a bit weird, but that’s due to InstaNatural leaving the oil in its natural state. It’s not totally overwhelming, so I can deal with it! Plus, I really love that this oil comes with a pump bottle so I don’t have to worry about a mess. Just one pump is enough to moisturize my hands.</li>
            <li> Helped my dry scalp. I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything until now.</li>
            <li> This is the best products  I am usually got  Josie  maran From qvc I try for my son eczema is nothing really make a difference but I get this Organ Oil mixed with lotion and put for my son skin it&#x27;s amazing only four  times use all his eczema gone his skin smoother thank you for making really good product</li>
            <li> Very pure, high quality oil. I use it on my face at night as a moisturizer. The smell is a little off putting but it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> I like this for my face after I get out of the shower. Great product and skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> Broken - was not wrap good</li>
            <li> Very interesting oil but a great price</li>
            <li> It absorbs into skin after a few minutes &amp; protected my skin from the cold &amp; indoor heart.  I used it on the ends of my hair also before I curled them with a curling iron &amp; my hair didn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I have used other Argan oils, but some leave your hair looking greasy. But not this one!!&lt;br /&gt;Works great!! put on wet, clean hair to control frizz and add shine. This oil is such good quality that I am using it on my face as a moisturizer. It feels soft and looks great. It even help with acne. A Must Buy!!</li>
            <li> Great quality product! Best facial moisturizer for my acne prone skin</li>
            <li> Great product.  Leaves hair really soft.  Will recommend to friends.  Have purchased several time and will continue to order.  Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> argan oil is awesome and this one from instanaturals does not fail to please!</li>
            <li> I use this almost exclusively as a skin treatment. I use it after a shower when my skin is still wet, then blot off the remaining water with a towel. I also use it for removing makeup, and occasionally as a frizz treatment for my hair. But argan oil really shines when it comes to skincare.</li>
            <li> I love InstaNatural products and this one is in the running for my favorite one in their line. It&#x27;s right up there with the Argan Oil Hair Mask. So, I think the common denominator is the argan oil. I love the way this oil absorbs quickly in my skin and I have had red blotchy bumps on my legs this winter (TMI??) and after using the argan oil for a couple of days it&#x27;s clearing up. I actually used it on one leg and not the other so I could compare and it&#x27;s an amazing difference. I am a believer!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s OK for hair and body. Not absorb well enough to use on face. It has a horrible smell if you open the cap the smell it straight from the bottle, but the smell goes away after 15 minutes or so. Since it is much cheaper than Josie&#x27;s, I will still use it for hair and body, but will stick with Josie&#x27;s for my face.</li>
            <li> I really love the quality of this Argan oil. Other brands were not pure or burned my life eyes when used as a all over face moisturizer. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly on my hair and skin. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This oil is pure argan oil, nothing added.  It is a little less expensive than others i have purchased, which i appreciate since i use it for hair and skin every day.  Something this company does that others don&#x27;t is send an email w/suggested uses for the oil that u may not have thot of.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> Definitely moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;Do not need much!&lt;br /&gt;Has a nutty aroma, golden color.</li>
            <li> I bought the product because my hair kept breaking off. The daily use of this product has helped in stopping these breakage.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell of this oil.  It has kind of a burnt nut smell.  I tried another brand of argan oil before this one that was odorless.  I prefer odorless argan oil to the smell of this brand.  It seems to work as well as the other though.</li>
            <li> While I love argon oil, deceptive description was in play here. I ordered a 4 oz bottle with pump yet what I received was a 2 oz bottle with dropper. It was a last minute gift - otherwise I&#x27;d have sent it back. Call me disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with Insta Natural Organic Argan Oil.  I am using it on my skin and hair as it is an excellent moisturizer for both. A little goes a long way so only use a few drops at a time.  I would recommend this product for anyone looking for high quality Argan oil.</li>
            <li> nice oil, doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy on hair, also no smell , just use few drops so it is big bottle</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had heard so much on QVC about Josie Maran&#x27;s Oil, but I did not want to spend a ton of money. Found this Insta natural and it was much cheaper and still cold pressed and 100 % organic. Has made a huge difference in my skin, I am 33 so starting to notice some moisture loss in my skin especially this winter. This helped with the dryness and also greatly improved the clarity of my skin and decreased acne, even on my chest. Wonderful and affordable!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells pretty bad! Luckily, it doesn&#x27;t smell for long but when you first put it on it smacks you right in the face. I started using the Josie Maran 100% Pure Argan Oil a while ago but wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the price so I thought this would be a good substitute but sadly I was wrong. Shortly after I started using this product it caused a lot of pore blockage and made my face break out badly. If you don&#x27;t mind the smell and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin then I&#x27;d say go for it!</li>
            <li> I use just a bit of this oil--recommended by my hair stylist--to calm frizzy hair that tends to dry because of hair coloring. It works. I&#x27;ve recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for months now after every shower with vitamin c serum first and my face has been much happier. My forehead lines almost disappeared and I don&#x27;t break out in the problem places I used to get ingrown hairs. It really is nice for happy skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil based on the reviews and normally i use rosehip oil. I am really impressed that i use it instead of moisturizer now. It absorbs very quickly and does not smell. I also put it on my hair and it makes it feel amazing. I think this might be my new favorite oil, I will definitely order it again. Also, their customer service is excellent, I had an issue with the pump and they were so quick to respond and  sent me a new one immediately.</li>
            <li> I love the 100% pure Organic Argan Oil by Insta Natural! I am a new organic Argan oil user for my face but it really does keep my face moisturized all day. I used it for my hair for years but I used to buy another brand, not the organic Argan Oil. Now with Insta Natural, I feel the difference, I have smooth and soft skin this winter, not an easy feat in dry Colorado. I use it for my face, neck, and hands. This bottle has 4 fluid ounces, so the price is unbeatable! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It looks, feels, and smells like real argan oil. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer for lips and hands. I haven&#x27;t used it on my face because my face is already pretty oily and prone to breakouts. I use it on my hair, too, and originally bought it as a replacement for Moroccanoil Hair Treatment. It works well, but it doesn&#x27;t go on my thick, curly hair as easily as the product did, so I end up using several pumps of this oil as a hair serum. I think my hair does feel better, though, less gunky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to say that the packaging is awesome. I took the bottle with the pump top with me in my luggage when I went traveling and there wasn&#x27;t a single spill.</li>
            <li> This is a lightweight oil that has done wonders for my cuticles that typically get cracked and very dry during the winter months. Applying just a tiny amount of this Argan Oil twice a day (morning and night) directly on my cuticles has really improved their condition. Not only that but the skin on my hands is smoother. I usually drop a few drops on the palm of one hand then with dip the cuticles of each finger on the other hand into the palm. After that I rub the coated cuticles on the other hands&#x27; cuticles. Rub the oil into the cuticles with my fingers then just rub my hands all over to distribute the leftover oil on my hands. It&#x27;s not exactly like a hand cream... it won&#x27;t moisturize quite like a thick gooey hand cream but it does soften the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used a small amount of this on my hair... just 4-6 drops rubbed on my palms than run through my hair. Gives my hair a slight sheen but more than that it reduces the frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got an earthy, nutty smell... no surprise there because it&#x27;s made from nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Organic and pure. This 4oz bottle will probably last me at least 8 months if not longer. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for a month and it still got a lot of Argan Oil in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review.</li>
            <li> It is a large bottle, seems like it is of pure, high quality.&lt;br /&gt;I am using on my face for fine lines because I read Mireille Guilliano&#x27;s book &amp;#34; French Woman Don&#x27;t Get Facelifts&amp;#34; and she noted that of her friends the one who has been using argan oil (for a while!)  had the best skin amongst them as they were aging....so I am giving it a go! I like that it is totally natural, no temporary results like the anti-wrinkle cream that quits working when you quit using it. Argan oil is a lifelong skin care treatment. Compared to the stuff being sold, for the prices it is totally worth it.  I tried it for my daughter&#x27;s under the eye eczema and did not see spectacular results, but it helped. Again, I like that it is totally pure from nature and no chemicals added from unknown sources.&lt;br /&gt;Now if only I could get a lifelong discount!</li>
            <li> FINALLY! I found my moisturizer! My skin is combination and majority of moisturizers in market either make me break out because they are too oily, or they are not oily enough. This is natural and light enough not to cause break outs. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Extremely moisturizing and not too greasy!</li>
            <li> I wish I had heard about and used Argan Oil earlier!  I have been using just a few drops daily for my hands and already my nails are healthier and my cuticles are back to normal!  No more cracking, peeling or bleeding due to the dry weather!  This organic Argan oil is a translucent yellow in color and has what I feel a very neutral scent, so it will not compete with any fragrances you are already wearing.  I have been using it as carrier oil with my essential oils and am loving it!  I feel that with that combination, I am getting a lot of benefit.  I should caution you though – anyone with tree nut allergies should not use Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I put this on as soon as I got it.  My face was &#x27;cleanish&#x27; - but very dry, and I hadn&#x27;t exfoliated for a few days.  It soaked in very quickly, had a slight smell - I&#x27;m undecided if it was good or bad, but it was just slight, so I&#x27;ll be ok.  Well, it actually worked some gunk out of my pores from my massaging it in!  I didn&#x27;t expect that - guess it worked a bit like the &#x27;oil cleanse method&#x27;.  Felt very good on my face.  As a super added bonus, I had some very fresh and painful blisters on my fingers - the oil moisturized them and took the swelling down.  The pain relief was awesome!  I rubbed some onto the back of my hands to see how it would feel/soak in, and it was lovely.  And my dry, horrid cuticles and nails that got some by chance, looked and felt so much better!  I&#x27;m now a big fan.  If something should change during my usage, I will come back and update - I rely heavily on reviews, so I want to be as helpful as possible.      *** sept 2014  So I see the price is going up, Up, UP!  Well, as much as I love this product, I&#x27;m afraid my allegiance isn&#x27;t in goose step with my wallet.  I will be looking for less expensive replacements.  Sorry gang.  I&#x27;m not made of $$ !    ***feb 2015  Owned by OzNaturals.  I will no longer purchase., rinse off with warm water - and I make sure I don&#x27;t leave the oil on my face - because then I will put on my argan to soak into my newly exfoliated pores.  It&#x27;s HEAVEN.  I also use the argan for my lips - exfoliate then work on the argan.  Fabulous.    I was worried the argan would be too heavy once the snow stopped falling, so I did try some marula oil - but I honestly did NOT like it near as much as my argan.  I can&#x27;t even smell it any more - I mix it with my eye cream, I mix it with my face moisturizer when I need a bit more &#x27;oomph&#x27;, and I LOVE it at night as the outer most layer of moisture before I go to bed.  I have not once woken oily or greasy.  I also don&#x27;t apply too much - start with small, add more as needed, eh?  Just common sense.    I have very short hair - I use styling products.  When I clarify, I use a couple drops of argan as my conditioner - I don&#x27;t rinse it out.  Feels like the hair I had when I was young and thought I could rule the world.    I WILL be ordering more from THIS company when my bottle nears the bottom - but as much as I use, I&#x27;ve still got a good 3 or 4 months AT LEAST - to go - maybe longer since high summer will be here soon.    I am slowly but surely switching my family&#x27;s products over to healthier alternatives - I&#x27;ve got a few more facial products to use up (waste not want not - and they are great - just want Simplified!) - at that time I will order the &#x27;rosehip seed oil&#x27; from these guys too.  I am SUPER excited to get my hands on it (google!)!  Going to see what else they have - I want to get my wish list ready!    *** sept 2014  So I see the price is going up, Up, UP!  Well, as much as I love this product, I&#x27;m afraid my allegiance isn&#x27;t in goose step with my wallet.  I will be looking for less expensive replacements.  Sorry gang.

            <li> A great hair oil. Fragrance free, a few drops work to refresh, add shine, smooth tangles and facilitate combing. As well, has dramatically reduced the need to shampoo! A win for me.... and the planet.</li>
            <li> I feel bad for leaving a bad rating while everyone else is raving, but it was SO oily that I couldn&#x27;t stand. When I use this my hair looks like I have not showered in a week. I wonder if it&#x27;s intended for night time use as a hair pack.</li>
            <li> Smells like cow poop and if you put this on your face or hair, it makes it like you have bad breath walking around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very embarrasing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a better argan oil for a little more!</li>
            <li> This is not the best organic argan oil that I have tried. Jose Maran may cost more but it is the real deal!</li>
            <li> Great price, excellent quality, and excellent shipping!! I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase, and this seller!</li>
            <li> Great value, shipped quickly. I use it for a beard tamer and facial moisturizer, both of which are excellent applications.</li>
            <li> It has the true smell, feel and color of the true argan oil, since a lot of the oils in the market are diluted.. i think this one is the real thing! love the packaging! The spoiled or rotten smell that a lot of people refers to, is a natural thing of argan oil, is not a fantastic aroma, but it doesnt mean its fresh! is the oil benefits that you should concentrate on. Grat price! I HAVE noticed the improvements on my skin.</li>
            <li> Very lovely, versatile oil!  I&#x27;ve found many uses for it.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. It is great for a many things and since I am a person with semi oily skin I was skeptical. It has balanced me out cleaned out my pores and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Love the oil and it got here very fast. Thank yoi</li>
            <li> Great product it works well for my dry skin. The only complaint I have is the smell, it reminds me of oil in a pan that&#x27;s cooking. But if you can get past that the product does work well.</li>
            <li> Not so great of a product as I thought it would be. Would not buy again period....</li>
            <li> This is a really great argan oil I use this on my face for winter dry skin also I use some in my hair works well</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Great Service/Delivery!</li>
            <li> I heard great reviews about this from friends, but when the package came oil was leaking everywhere!!! The cap was barely screwed on and over half the bottle of liquis was leaked out but the time i opened the package.</li>
            <li> Wonderful value, as you only need a tiny bit to do the job, great as a moisturizer and to remove eye makeup, doesn&#x27;t irritate delicate skin, very light fragrance akin to olive oil, I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I could not believe the price of this 100% argon oil.  I am used to paying far more.  The product does miracles for my condition. I usually have to use a prescription steroid cream daily by my nose, my eyebrows - but not anymore! This product does the trick. The oil absorbs quickly into the skin leaving my skin feeling moist and soft. Good quality.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this oil...I use it on my face...it feels like silk and not greasy.  I will be ordering again.  I wish I could afford to use it on my entire body!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil.  Makes your hair and skin feel great.</li>
            <li> Oil is great. Dispenser pump included way too small for the bottle. :-(</li>
            <li> when it comes to my psoriasis a good thing that helps keep them from flairing up so bad is keeping my skin moisterized, i used this product on my arm and it kept my arm nice and smooth and imediatly calmed down my psoriasis, didnt cause them to spread or anything. i am very pleased with the product. thank you so much for the fast shipping, will be putting a review on my blog tomarrow</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my face, body and even my hair. It is a great moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done!</li>
            <li> I love this oil, it&#x27;s light and absorbed into skin quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been able to try this product through a promotion from tomoson. And it is great just like all the other oils I mainly have been using this oil for my nails because they are so fragile. Since i have used it for my nails they have not broken off like they usually do. I love this for my nails.</li>
            <li> Great product! This was the second purchase. It&#x27;s good for hair, skin, and nails!</li>
            <li> So far I have used this oil for my nails and cuticles, as a leave in conditioner, and I even have used it on my stretch marks. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results! My hair is soft and sleek and my cuticles have never looked this nice. My stretch marks are diminishing a little at a time. (smaller ones much faster of course)  It is a good quality oil and I love that it&#x27;s Organic! It drys quickly and without a greasy felling (because it&#x27;s a dry oil). i absolutely love it!  I can&#x27;t wait to try it for my face, and possibly as an all over moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li> Very good purchase! I received it quick! I use it at night around my eyes and on the back ofy hands. I have been using it about three weeks and l have noticed a difference. My eyes are looking firmer and hands too. The bottle is huge so will last a long time. Good purchase for the price. I would order this again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I dye my hair (shhh) so it has gotten a little rough over the years. Plus I have all grey hair now (also shhh) my goal to stay a blonde for the next 10 years will prove to put some damage on my hair. But at least it won&#x27;t LOOK like it. Because this stuff is awesome, It makes my hair feel and look amazing.</li>
            <li> Love argon oil but most bottles only have a drip pour. This one with the dropper is so much handier!</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly, color-treated hair. I flat iron it daily. My highlights were starting to look fried..and I was noticing a lot of split ends in some of my hard to flatten areas. (Especially at my magnifying mirror.) Last night, I took a section of my hair and worked 3 drops of this Argan oil through it THOROUGHLY. The hair looked oily, super shiny and in no way suitable for leaving the house. I put my hair up in a bun and went to sleep. The next morning, I noticed the damaged hair did in fact look healthier! The true test would be after my shower through. when the Argan oil was shampooed...and when I had re-flat-ironed my hair...the damaged area that I treated with Argan oil was SIGNIFICANTLY healthier! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I plan on using this little treatment every week.</li>
            <li> I bought this recently and love it! Its a great moisturizer all around and i have enjoyed it thus far.</li>
            <li> I love the all natural argon oil! I use it on all of my body including my face as a moisturizer before I go to bed and it has helped my acne and over all glow of my previously lack-luster skin. It truly feels like silk. I will definitely be purchasing this stuff again and again. Thanks a million!</li>
            <li> love this product use these everyday for my moisturizer for my hair and my body. work for me,thank u amazon.</li>
            <li> i had a facial only once in my life. the therapist said I should try Argan Oil (100% pure) as a moisturizer and to help my skin look  healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 62...and i think i have begun to look 60 again!</li>
            <li> great cost  fast service  works fantastic i would recommend this to anyone looking to buy argan oil  a must buy</li>
            <li> With all the hoopla about this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; oil I was anxious to try it.  Of all the promises of improvement, the only thing I found to be true is that it didn&#x27;t break my skin out.  I saw no benefits whatsoever.  The oil is thicker than I assumed (it did not soak in even after 1-1/2 hours;  had to blot with a tissue before applying makeup).  One  odd thing to note is that is mixes with water, which I did to thin it out.  Won&#x27;t be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> This Argan oil actually tames my frizzy hair....and I live in Hawaii where the humidity is never ending! It&#x27;s nice to have a product that actually does what it says.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered a bottle of this argan oil and I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now.  I have dry, naturally curly hair.  This winter has made my hair very brittle and frizzy, despite using 2 conditioners (Redken BodyFull and Aveda&#x27;s leave- in Damage Remedy).  Since I started using this oil, just 4 drops mixed in with a pea sized amount of Damage Remedy and a pea sized amount of Aveda&#x27;s Be Curly, my hair has transformed.  My curls are ringlets again.  Very few frizzies...so silky and soft and manageable.  It was truly like straw before I started using this on a routine basis.  I love the dropper--it&#x27;s essential for portioning out the oil.  The dropper is rather drippy, so I squirt all but a scant amount out so I don&#x27;t drip it all over the sink as I&#x27;m transferring it to my hand (I tried another brand of argan oil without any dosing mechanism and I always used way too much and looked like I had a Jheri Curl!).  A little bit will go a long way and it&#x27;ll last forever.  Totally recommend this.</li>
            <li> MY SISTER RECOMMENDED THE PRODUCT.I REALLY SEE A BIG DIFFERENCE.LOVE IT.I WILL  ORDER MORE AND WLL SURELY RECOMMEND IT TO FRIENDS.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Awesome product. Finally found one I can stick with.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Argan oil. I love the smell of the oil.&lt;br /&gt;It make my skin smooth and hydrated. Love it so much.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice oil. :)</li>
            <li> The other reviews are spot on. Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Really good product I use it for my hair after shower I put 3 pumps in my hand and massage it on my hair and focus on the ends and I noticed my hair has become healthier and shiner and more volume.. Also it makes it easier to style ( I have curly heavy hair) .. AND I can see some new baby hair on the sides !!</li>
            <li> Great product at a fabulous price!  I thought the email the company sent with uses for argan oil was a very helpful gesture. I&#x27;d buy again, this stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> The quality of this oil is amazing.  I gave it a 4 stars though because I hate the smell of it! But I guess that&#x27;s what organic plain argan oil smells like</li>
            <li> My wife replaced her face lotion with this as soon as we got it and is loving the results. She says her face has cleared up and that it has helped reduce the appearance of acne scars.</li>
            <li> I use this on both my hair and skin to moisturize and protect from the summer heat. It works well leaving a shine in my hair and is not greasy on my skin.</li>
            <li> Insta Natural was one of the first companies I had the pleasure to review a product for. I was so impressed with there professionalism, and the eager to go over and beyond to make sure that I was a satisfied customer, that I just had to apply for all of there products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Excellent customer service is KEY! that will only reflect even more on their products.  It shows that the company stands by their products and that satisfying their customers is very important.  From their skin care, to hair care and body Insta Natural is by far my favorite company.  Their products are amazing.  Everything I have listed above is not only the products that I have tested, but that is my complete daily skin care and hair care regimen.  I have seen a big difference in the look of my skin and my hair.  Insta Natural is definitely my &amp;#34;Fountain of Youth&amp;#34; I give Insta Natural 5 stars for amazing products and excellent customer service.  I look forward to continue to do business with Insta Natural.  I most highly recommend that you give them a try!</li>
            <li> I tried using this for hair after seeing argan oil commercial on TV but this brand is so greasy even just a little bit makes my hair a big oily sticky mess that seems lifeless and wont style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to shower and shampoo 3 times to get it all off. Its like a combination of motor oil and super glue mixed together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst product ever</li>
            <li> Perfect moisturizer for hair,face and all over body!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this oil... After my shower, I use Shea and then Argon...even a tad Tru my hair! Worth the money!</li>

THAN I USE THIS INSTANATURAL ARGAN OIL. SO WONDERFUL.  THANKS I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS AT FREE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use it as a mosturizer on my face and as hair oil in my hair.</li>
            <li> i am use it for my face, feel good</li>
            <li> i truely love argan oil and its unlimited benefits.Its good for your hair and your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Apply this daily to your hair for great shine and healthy looking hair. Apply on your skin for hydrated and moisturized skin.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs very easily into the skin and makes your skin more youthful. You can also add this to your daily beauty regime alongwith your moisturizer. just add a few drops of this argan oil in your palms and add your moisturizer, mix well and apply to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil has a mild olive kind of a smell which is its pure form of scent so its not really bad but its not very nice fragrant either. But the benefits of this product exceeds any. I was lucky to get this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li> Great price/ great quality! So glad I found this brand.</li>
            <li> I have been using this argan oil for a little over a week, I use it on my hair before I blow dry, hair feels shinning and less frizzy. I do also use it on my cuticle and notice it is less dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW***</li>
            <li> First of all, the quality of the argan oil is not right. The consistency is off and and freezing point is off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real argan oil has a freezing point between 10-12 Celcius, I left this in my fridge and it did not freeze.&lt;br /&gt;Hmmm, I wonder what is it instead?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most reviews seem like paid reviews written by some company. They all review the same items on their history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t trust this scam.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I have gotten several products by this company, and without fail they are excellent quality and do what they say. This one is no exception. It definitely made my skin very smooth, and my hair shiny and in good repair. My only complaint is a minor one: I am now used to being impressed by how good the vendor&#x27;s products smell, and this is the exception in that regard alone. However, this product IS exactly what it says: 100% argan oil. Not all oil smells good; this doesn&#x27;t smell horrid, just not lovely (and who doesn&#x27;t like to smell lovely before bed? :). It is still worth getting, but you might keep in mind that you&#x27;ll want to follow it with something pleasantly-scented if you&#x27;ll be in close contact shortly thereafter. Thanks for asking me to review this - I had heard good things, and you did not disappoint! If you have recommendations for what to use to scent this (like maybe a drop or two of lavender-scented oil?), please feel free to share!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Great on detangling my hair; making it soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes put extra on and leave it on for days then wash it out; feels fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have a hypersensitive sense of smell.  There is almost no odor to this product, which is awesome in my book.  It is light and adsorbs quickly into my skin and my husbands scalp.  He keeps his hair cut very short to the skin, because of his tufted hair foliculitus and we bought this product for him to try on the horribly itchy, dry and scaly tissue build up around those hair follicles.  So far its helping. I have an argon oil that I bought for my hair that has added chemical ingredients including fragrance.  While I will use it until it&#x27;s gone, I will replace it with this product for my hair because it&#x27;s chemical and fragrance free and works great on my hands and face.</li>
            <li> Love Argan oil based on the property. Havn&#x27;t seen much difference but I guess would take ore than few months of usage :) Good price with Amazon.</li>
            <li> This stuff really work, where has this been? My skin was chaffed from cold, I used two days and Gone! Love it love it!</li>
            <li> Works as well as the more expensive varieties out there, and at a really fair price.  Try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> Just began using this and it seems to be a good product</li>
            <li> This oil is fabulous!  I&#x27;ve only used it for four days on my cuticles.  It&#x27;s incredible how much stronger my nails have already gotten!  I&#x27;m going to use it on my hair to see if it really does make my hair shinier.  Hope so!!</li>
            <li> I like it but it gets once less star for stinging my eyes. The brand at whole foods never stings my eyes.</li>
            <li> Love it... For my hair, skin and nail !</li>
            <li> I just love this product!  I fell in love with it at my first aplication.... for the price this is definitely a steal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m growing out a perm, so the bottom few inches of  my hair is dry, damaged, and frizzy. Since my hair would be way too short if I just cut off the frizzy bits, I just live with it. Well, once I saw that this could be used on your hair, I was so excited! It just takes a few drops for my nearly waist length hair. I rub it on my palms and then run my hands through my hair, then comb. It leaves my hair manageable and not frizzy at all. I love this product and look forward to trying it in different applications soon.</li>
            <li> I love the oil, it works well on my skin. Having recently begun buying organic foods &amp; products I was delighted to be able to get the Argan USDA Organic.  The company sent a follow up email to make sure I got my product and interest in how I liked it.  It is competitively priced and it came exactly as stated on the web site.  I will be re-ordering as soon as I have used about 2/3&#x27;s of the bottle up.  The oil is not &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; on the skin of my face or my hands either for that matter.  I use it now as well as my Meadowfoam oil. I find these work well with my &amp;#34;overly dry&amp;#34; skin.  Good communications from store to customer and their pricing.  You won&#x27;t be sorry with your purchase and I did read some people talked about an odor, that was so faint that a few seconds in the air &amp; it was gone!  Its Organic and perfume free.  (read some time where some fragrance(s) actually come from and you&#x27;ll be glad they keep it all organic)!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 4 weeks.  I waited to write a review as I wanted to be as honest as possible to other consumers.  I use this oil on my face, neck and the upper chest area.  My skin has never been softer and it is very smooth.  I feel better using a natural oil as opposed to a chemical filled moisturizers.  Keep in mind, this is not a miracle oil, I&#x27;ve not seen a dramatic reduction in lines or wrinkles as I was expecting, but that is ok, I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s, aging happens.  I will continue to use it and purchase again as it is just healthier for my skin and I love the softness I&#x27;m experiencing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using argan oil as my facial moisturizer for about a year now and it&#x27;s wonderful.  My skin is softer, not oily, and blemish free.  I was using a different brand, but switched to this based on the other reviews.  I was not disappointed. I&#x27;ve tried other types of oils on my face and nothing works like this. The bottle will last a long time....I only use a few drops a day--less than the size of a dime. The dropper&#x27;s opening is larger than what I consider normal so the oil comes out without you having to squeeze it, so be careful. Other than that, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Love this product. First, but not the last time I&#x27;m buying it.</li>
            <li> It looks good product, I just used few times but it seems high quality and has no smell which is good for me..</li>
            <li> It came pretty fast. Its a great product my skin feels nice after it it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. You don&#x27;t need a lot of the product for your face so it&#x27;ll last a while. It didn&#x27;t cause me any break outs. The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because its still fairly new to me and I would like to see more moisture in my face but i think that will happen the more i use it</li>
            <li> This product is simply amazing, I was a little exceptical about having so many uses, but it actually does. I am currently pregnant and I have been using it all over my body as a stretch mark prevention so far my skin is hydrate and no marks at all, during my pregnancy I had some acne issues as a cause of my hormonal change, I use this oil on my face every night the results are just amazing has helped me a lot to have this under control and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy sensation AT ALL!. since I notice it makes amazing things to my skin, I was brave enough to give it a try on my hair, the result is just as good as all the reviews. My hair feels and looks amazing and healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will get this product again in a second once I run out of mine!</li>
            <li> I bought this several months ago.  It does wonders for my face.  Even my husband noticed how it worked on the bags and dark circles under my eyes.  This stuff is all the adjectives together that you would apply to any other  product.  Seriously.  I will never be without it from now on.  I cannot say enough good things about Argan Oil from this company.  Hope they keep me on their mailing/email list from now on.  Can&#x27;t thank you enough, y&#x27;all process a pure miracle.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Nice product. I use a bit at the ends of my hair to help with the dryness from the sun. My daughter mixes 3 drops with her hair mask to leave on at night. Washes it out the next day. Does not leave your hair greasy.</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil feels fantastic. Even though it is an oil I do not find it at all greasy. I love to use it around my eyes. It is not irritating or anything like that. It has a hint of a smell- like all plant based oils do but it is not overwhelming and I find it diminishes after applying on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell shows only how pure and unprocessed this Argan Oil is. Perfect even for sensitive skin. I am switching to cruelty free products only and I am happy that I already know that I replace my Nivea Creme with this one- it works perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not even leave me shiny and I do have actually oily skin! Just take a tiny drop and it will sink into your skin. The only ingredient is: 100 % pure and certified organic virgin cold pressed argan oil. That is it! Bam! Another simple product from nature that works wonderful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a naturalista in many ways, so of course I pounced on this exciting 100% natural product &amp; couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out for myself. What is it you ask? InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil of course. First off, I absolutely love the cobalt blue bottle, it caught my eye and drew me in.. I unscrewed the top to find a dropper.. like an eyedropper, only bigger, and full of the nectar of the gods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is natural and my wavy locks have enjoyed the nourishment of this product for a month now. A little pure organic oil goes a long way. I drop about 4 or 5 drops into my palms, rub my hands together gently and attack my tresses. I work the oil into my scalp and massage it into the strands, and the ends of my hair. I have used the oil after a fresh wash, before a blow dry and on an average day just for moisture. My hair is softer, more manageable, and shines like a polished diamond. I was reluctant to use the oil on my skin, but I tried it, and raved at the way this liquid silk immersed my skin. What is Organic Argan Oil? Well it&#x27;s equivalent to Moroccan/Liquid Gold. Argan Oil is pressed from the fruits of the Argan Tree[Argania Spinosa], a tree that is native to Morocco and can live up to 200 years. There are many uses for this unbelievable product, I will name just a few of my favorites:&lt;br /&gt;•As a face moisturizer-After cleansing, massage a few drops on face/neck [Argan is considered a dry oil, and is never sticky or greasy, it absorbs immediately into your skin]&lt;br /&gt;•Leave-in conditioner-While hair is still damp, add a few drops to your hair and scalp, to hydrate and moisturize [don&#x27;t forget to use the oil on dry hair too, before blow drying, it works wonders]&lt;br /&gt;•Cuticle &amp; Heel softener-Massage into cuticles to soften and promote nail growth, generously moisturize feet, pull on a pair of socks overnight, to replenish dry, cracked heels&lt;br /&gt;•As a bath oil- Drop just a bit into your warm bath for smooth and supple, re-hydrated skin results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how raw and natural this product is. There are no harsh chemicals or preservatives to complicate things. I have enjoyed using this product from head to toe, and have added it to my daily beauty regimen.s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how raw and natural this product is.

            <li> A squirt or two rubbed through your locks will add a lustrous shine and bring out impressive highlights. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this product, at this price. I&#x27;ve bought some other products from instanaturals, and they continue to impress.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. The is the best argan oil I have tried.Trust me I have tried many and this is the beast so far. It leaves your skin soft and glowing. I use it for after shave and after shower. It works wonder on crack heels.. This is a must have.</li>
            <li> For real, I love this product. I read lots of things about how the really good Argan Oil isn&#x27;t going to be cheap, yaddah yaddah, so I must admit, I was a little skeptical about Insta Natural&#x27;s great price. I purchased my bottle in the winter, specifically to use on my face, as I was putting my skin through the ringer that season - hot and dry indoors to cold and windy outdoors.  Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t sure how I felt about it for the first week or so. Lots of people said to only use a little, but I was convinced they didn&#x27;t know my life, so I slathered my face with the oil (to heal it from the nasty cold wind, of course). Yeah, not a great idea. Because seriously, you only need a little bit of this stuff. I think the reason I was getting such mixed results at first was because I was convinced I needed to use a whole bunch. Once I began limiting myself to three pumps TOPS, I was hooked.  I have been using three pumps on my face every night before bed. It does take a little bit of time for it to soak in, but I think this has more to do with my using three pumps than anything else. I could lessen the amount used to have it soak in faster, but I don&#x27;t mind going to sleep with a slightly oily face when I know I&#x27;ll be waking up to smooth, soft skin. I also apply just a tiny (TINY) bit in the morning before putting on my makeup, and that seems to soak right up.   I&#x27;ve been using the same bottle for five months and am only just now reaching the final ounces. My complexion has cleared up. My eyelashes are longer (which just sort of happened as a byproduct), and I could not be happier. The customer service at Insta Natural was great too! When they reached out, asking me to write a review, and I mentioned not being sure how I felt about the product yet, they went above and beyond to ensure I was being taken care of. They truly believe in their product, and frankly, I do too. :)</li>
            <li> Great. Product!  My hair feels fuller and my face feels softer and looks younger.  I am going to try it on my nails next.</li>
            <li> I had been using Savanaah&#x27;s argan oil, but it is currently unavailable at Amazon.  I picked up this oil instead and I really like it.  It smells a little bit stronger than what I had been using previously, but the scent evaporates quickly and the oil is lightweight and makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> I used to work at cosmetic company for 10years. I thought to put oil to skin first after cleansing wasn&#x27;t good idea especially in the morning. but This oil is so light and make my dry skin so smooth. Great for morning before make up and night time.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for your skin and hair.  I now have all my family using this product.  It works on all types of skin and great on baby hair.</li>
            <li> I mixed this with the rosehip oil and the results were fantastic my legs felt so soft after i shaved them  and my face two. Just remember this serum is in thicker consistency so make sure not to get to exited and apply too much or you will end up with excessively oily skin  i&#x27;m not sure about hair but the reviews seem to say excessively shiny.  I also use sum on my lips and it worked pretty good, not as  moisturising  as my lip balm but still really nice for a all in one serum.  Unfortunately i couldn&#x27;t use it for more than a few days because my mom decided to keep it, I asked her why did she do that she told me her hair told her two lol.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle product! I had been searching all over for 100% argan oil and this is the best! Most other argan products are not 100% pure but this one is.  I use it on my face, it&#x27;s great for your hair and it helps reduce the effects of psoriasis. My boyfriend suffers with occasional flare ups of psoriasis / and just a bit of the argan oil on the affected area helps increase healing and reduce any red flaky irritation! Amazing customer service. We will definitely be long time customers of this incredible product!!!</li>
            <li> Love the product and that it is certified organic.  I use this in my sugar scrub I make and use in the shower.  Great for my hair and my four legged friends dry skin.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite things about this brand is that the products are cruelty free!&lt;br /&gt;Uses include: moisturizer, skin, hair, body, nails, massage oil, aftershave, acne treatment, toner, conditioner, etc.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite use for this is for softer hair, stronger nails and cuticles. I am currently using 5 insta natural products daily and I am in love with how they well they work! I recommend them to everyone!</li>
            <li> Great customer service, excellent product. The  dropper tends to drip too fast so be careful.&lt;br /&gt; Love it on both hair and skin. No junk, just pure oil!</li>
            <li> Do not buy. You&#x27;ve been warned.&lt;br /&gt;Like a lot of the reviewers said, real argan oil is golden in color with a nutty scent. This one is clear with a strong sulfur smell.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this argan oil is real or pure.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product, and says it works really well for dry and frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I must have received rancid oi! It smells like something rotting; it would make me vomit if I smelled it any longer than a split second. Really upsetting.</li>
            <li> Works great...I use it in my hair and it helps controls the frizzies.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews and started using this oil as soon as I received it. It is so useful on face-nails-hair that I have made it a daily routine. Absorbs quickly,no odor and feels like silk on my sensitive skin. Will continue to purchase this item and would recommend argan oil to a friend.</li>
            <li> Great for hair and body. But not for face, caused major breakouts and clogged pores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic moisturizer!  I&#x27;m 32 years old, and am starting to show some winkles/aging, etc. and this helps keep my skin very hydrated and minimizes the look of aging.  I have to use about 4 drops though.  Never greasy.  I used to use Coconut Oil on my face and from now on I will always use Argan Oil.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Great for my frizzy hair!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase, it&#x27;s a good product and good price. I will continue purchasing it under the same conditions. I like the pump on the bottle too.</li>
            <li> We have been using argan oil for a while and love it.  What I appreciate about this brand is that it it organic, cold pressed, and is 4 ounces instead of the usual 2ounces.  We have not yet opened it but I am sure it will be great.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Suitable for hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distinctive products&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> How do I even begin to describe just how much I love this Argan Oil from InstaNatrual? I am a younger person in my mid-twenties that believes in taking care of my skin now rather than later. I am always looking for a product I can use now that just might help my skin in 20 years from now. I love using this oil on my face after my night mask, and sleeping with it on. I wake up to a beautiful hydrated soft glowy complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t stop there, I also use this Argan Oil on my hair as a oil treatment. I place some in my hand and brush it through my hair, leave it on overnight, and the next morning I feel like I have Cindy Crawford hair! Soft, manageable and shiny. But wait, I also use it on my nails and cuticles to help moisturize my nails after a polish change, stimulate nail growth and to keep my hands and fingers healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if this is just my bottle, or others, but I do have to be super careful with the dropper. I have to hold it upside down until I am ready to use it because basically the dropper just let&#x27;s the oil come right out, instead of in drops. It can get a little messy if you are just trying to get a few drops out. Big deal? Not really. I can live!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am highly impressed with this Argan Oil. I now use this as apart of my nightly skincare / body routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like? On-time delivery, pump dispenser, and great looking hair made his deal a sure winner.</li>
            <li> This is my good to oil for hair and skin. I am impressed with the quantity and quality!</li>
            <li> Meets my expectation.</li>
            <li> Oil wasn&#x27;t as effective as I would have hoped given the price (a bit thin and &#x27;watery&#x27;</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry skin and sun-damaged skin.</li>
            <li> In comparison between this and Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan oil...hands down this is the one too beat! Not only is the value and size an amazing steal but the quality is nothing short than pure, and undiluted luxury. Pure 100% Argan Oil, and the good stuff, none of that binder and filler stuff! I used it every night in place of my moisturizer and my Acne-prone/Oily skin drinks it right up! Like all facial oils this does have that slick oil feel afterwards but it doesn&#x27;t bother me, especially since I only use it before bed. Great for mending those split ends as well! Love this stuff, winner winner!</li>
            <li> Nice, light, &amp; I am going through it WAY TOO QUICK! I use it for everything and idk even if I am supposed to use it for half of what I do, but as long as I don&#x27;t ingest it, i think I&#x27;m good. lol</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and I felt a difference in the way my skin felt the following morning!&lt;br /&gt;It was tighter and felt very supple.</li>
            <li> Have always read about the benefits of argan oil, but never tried it before this-- it is excellent for skin and hair-- husband loves it for his very dry hands and nails</li>
            <li> Extremely happy with this product and this company.  Use the Argan oil daily and have no complaints; my skin is soft and happy.  I use it in my hair and as soon as I get out of the shower on my body.  I also use on my face after I wash it.  AMAZING!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Just the best oil I have used lately, it glides on and sinks in, no greasy feeling either...why use all these expensive cosmetics ? Getting lots of compliments how smooth and radiant my skin looks. Love it!  Ordered it after I tried my daughter&#x27;s and right away knew it works for me, faint smell is sweet and I use it in my hair as well which is very coarse...after shaving great as well and my neck really thanks me.  Amazing though all these negative reviews....sounds almost like a smear campaign to me....just saying!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I noticed a huge difference in my nails after only a few applications - they were brittle and peeling and now they&#x27;re much stronger and break much more infrequently. My curly hair is also responding nicely - it&#x27;s curling better with less frizz. I&#x27;ve been applying it daily to my face, too, and my skin is softer and smoother! Great all-purpose beauty product!!</li>
            <li> THIS oil is wonderful and you get so much for the price.You only need a drop or two and four ounces will last me all year.Great quality and great price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil in hopes of getting softer hair like they say would happen.  I actually felt that my hair became dryer after using this product.</li>
            <li> This is great!! It does feel a little oily when put on your face as opposed to some other comments but it did wonders for my skin. I&#x27;m assuming it is not doing anything bad to my hair either but I would have to straighten it to make sure. I do feel like I have to wash my hair more frequently when I apply it though but it is definitely a must have in your beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan oil for my hair for a while but I wanted to buy a better quality oil without the unwanted ingredients.  I found it in this product. It is pure, cold pressed, 100% organic, in a beautiful cobalt blue glass ( that is quality packaging ).&lt;br /&gt;After showers my skin on my face feels dry so I put about 3 drops on my fingers and apply it to my skin. Woala my skin looks happy and moisturized. It does not feel greasy at all. By the way a very good quality oil is really good for you inside and out. Some oils are good for internal use, some are great for external use like this one.  I also put few drops on my hair. This Argan Oil not only makes my hair smooth which I love, it also makes my hair shiny. My hair looks healthy even though I cut my hair only twice a year.  It is a great moisturizer for all over your body.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Instanatural Argan oil!&lt;br /&gt;I received the product leaking out from the glass around the bottle ( I only lost little oil so I only asked for a dropper replacement ) because the dropper broke somewhere on its journey. I contacted the seller and in few hours or less she responded and sent me a new dropper. I received the new dropper 2 days later.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping and outstanding costumer service!!! Thank you Instanatural  LLC!</li>
            <li> I am still trying to figure out the right amount for my hair, so it won&#x27;t look greasy.  Either it looks too greasy or my hair is still frizzy.  However, I do like the fact that it is organic and does not contain any other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot</li>
            <li> The odor is a bit stronger than other argan oils I have used before.  With that said, the price point for this one is very nice.  I also appreciate that the bottle is dark (to protect the integrity of the oil) and that it has a pump (which is so much more sanitary than the droppers).</li>
            <li> I wonder if I got a bottle of rancid oil because my son complained of bad smell every time I used it.</li>
            <li> Just purchased our second bottle of InstaNatural organic Argan oil! We have tried about 6 different brands of organic Argan oil, and this is our favorite. Perfect consistency, ultra moisturizing and non-comedegenic. We use it for facial moisturizer, and my boyfriend uses it to prep his face pre-shaving. Great price, amazing product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff  Can&#x27;t believe I used to spend $48 for a smaller bottle.</li>
            <li> I dont even like to give one star to this product. First of all I seriously doubt if this is real argon oil or just some chemical in form of oil. It has a different smell and sticks to my skin very badly. It neither gets absorbed in skin nor goes away after washing. It really ddnt do anything to my skin or hair. Just worried wasting money on this item. I used it for a week and couldn&#x27;t stand with the smell and the stickiness it creates in my skin. Highly not recommended..</li>
            <li> I love this product..am using it for my hair cuz i noticed the ends r getting dry..it really helped with keeping my hair moist..i use it everyday just a small amount is enough.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get hunged up on the fake reviews. Look at the 1 star and beleive me, this is not real argan oil. Probably some cheap GMO, Pesticide filled corn oil. Argan oil is not this stinky or irritating to your skin.!</li>
            <li> Argan Oil has so many great uses, its great to have pure oil in such a large quantity. I used it on my stretch marks while pregnant and it helped minimize the appearance of them! It was perfect for my stretching belly :)</li>
            <li> received as described.</li>
            <li> Works very well...even helps bruises.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase---Have been using on my face, hair and nails and find it very moisturizing.  Will continue to use . Also use on my dry skin on arms and legs----</li>
            <li> By far the best Argan oil that I have used. Just be careful, argan oil can clog pores despite the claim to the contrary. If this is not a problem of yours, then you will love the product.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, and I love that it has a dispensing pump top. No waste!</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle I purchased.  I really like it!</li>
            <li> This is a nice rich oil. There are many uses (the seller, super nice, emailed me with a whole lot of ways I can use it for -hair, skin). She is very friendly and will answer any questions you have!&lt;br /&gt;I use a little bit of the oil and put it around my eye area after washing (when my skin feels tight). Feels Smooth and relaxing!</li>
            <li> I Adore HOW Smoothed MY Skin Is I Have A CNET Blemishes AND THIS Stuff Actually works. I always knew it would be a great hair treatment but never for my face so when I got the opportunity to try this product out I was thrilled and pleased. I put a couple of drops in my shampoo bottle so therefore my shampoo won&#x27;t strip my and adds extra moisture to my hair. I find my hair to be more silky and soft. Thanks insta naturals everyone and anyone would be satisfied to have this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used the professional oil products that are blended with Argan oil., but decided to try it alone. I do not care for the scent of this product, but it does fade after a few minutes. Sometimes I will mix a drop of my favorite essential oil in it to make it smell better. It helps a lot and doesn&#x27;t make the product not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on everything, from adding a few drops to my bath, my lotion, rubbing it on my cuticles, or just rubbing a few drops into my hair. It gives my hair a beautiful shine and brings out my naturally wavy texture. It&#x27;s even great on dark spots and scars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love to add a few drops to the homemade scrubs and creams I make! It&#x27;s a fantastic addition to my DIY Natural medicine cabinet!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Start using it and your face will love you for it! A must have beauty product!</li>
            <li> I need a very rich oil for my skin , because of the medication I have to take . It may still work , as I&#x27;m still using it.  It probably would work well for others .</li>
            <li> This is the first Argan Oil that I&#x27;ve purchased. I use it as a nighttime moisturizer and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt; It is a generous size and a great value!</li>
            <li> This is a great Argan Oil by InstaNatural.  I have grown to love all the products I have purchased from them.  Their customer service is awesome, delivery is fast, and the product is well packaged.  I use this oil directly on my skin, in my home made body butters, and anytime I need a little extra boost for my hair.  Highly recommend1</li>
            <li> Big bottle, lots of oil.  Smells a bit funky at first, but apparently it&#x27;s supposed to, and the smell fades after a few minutes in your hair anyway.</li>
            <li> The bottle was larger than I thought so more product for the money.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it mixed with my face moisturizer and have already noticed my skin improve.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about Insta Natural&#x27;s Argan oil is that it is very fast absorbing. My skin soaked the oil really fast and it literally goes on silky smooth on my skin and feels like &amp;#34;liquid gold.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s also not too oily / greasy like others so I was very happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has always been dry, especially in the winter. After using Insta natural&#x27;s oil for a a few weeks, I&#x27;ve already seen great improvement.  I can literally feel the difference and feel like a million bucks with this natural moisturizer. I started using couple of drops on my hair face first and have started applying a few drops to my skin and hair as well. This is definitely replacing the expensive hair conditioners I&#x27;ve been using as it makes my hair really soft. And for the value, it can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that this Argan oil brand doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like some of the other brands I have tried in the past. I definitely recommend giving this a shot if you&#x27;re looking for a great Argan Oil brand to try.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for another argan oil, which contained more synthetic ingredients than true argan oil. This oil is 100% organic argan oil. It has a faint argan oil smell, which reminds me of Morocco (I spent a holiday in Casablanca a few years ago). I bought the oil for my hair, but I actually really like to use it on my face. I have an oily skin, but the argan oil get&#x27;s absorbed very quickly, and makes my skin super soft. It&#x27;s a generous amount for a fair price. I hope it will take a couple of months to finish this bottle, but I&#x27;ll definitely order a new one once I run out.</li>
            <li> When you order this product you receive an e-mail of some ways you can use the product, I found that very helpful! I have been using it on my face every night and have really enjoyed the way my skin has been looking and feeling. I really like this product and the price, I will definitely be ordering it again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about Argan Oil forever.  I knew I needed to get 100% organic.  I found this product on Amazon and I&#x27;m so glad.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days, but if my opinion changes, I&#x27;ll add to my review.  This oil is very light and not greasy at all.  I have a lot of gray hair and for those of you who do, you understand how your hair changes when it turns gray.  This Argan oil is great for your hair - made is so soft &amp;amp; shiny.  I also used on my face &amp;amp; body after showering.  Skin feels smoother and definitely more hydrated.  The price is great for a good-sized bottle!</li>
            <li> Let me just tell you that I have high expectations with this product since I already tried two other products from InstaNatural and they work great. I have also tried a different brand of Argan Oil but that one got a &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; smell. InstaNatural&#x27;s Organic Argan Oil does not have a strong smell and that&#x27;s why I like this one the minute I first opened the bottle. I know that this is a multipurpose and not just for the hair, but I am concentrating on my hair so that&#x27;s where I used it. Every other night, I do a scalp massage using it. I also use it as a leave in conditioner after I wash my hair. After two weeks of using this product, I can definitely see and feel a difference in my hair. It&#x27;s smoother, more manageable and frizz-free. YAY!</li>
            <li> Argan oil is a must-have for healthy hair [and skin]. I like to mix a little with my leave-in treatment after showering, and with regular use, repairs dry, damaged hair. My hair is strong, shiny, and vibrant, and that&#x27;s why! I have very curly hair [hence why I braid it], and it works wonders for keeping ridiculous curls under control.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that there are four organic oily argan ounces sitting in my bathroom for less than $24. The product is fantastic, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. This is going to be my go-to from here on out for Argan oil. No doubt about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, great dropper! The packaging is wonderful, and I can easily measure what I need with ease.</li>
            <li> Stinks like poop!  Had to dump it in garbage.  Wasted my other expensive oil trying to blend to remove, neutralize, or reduce the stink.  No use.</li>
            <li> Received the product on time and it is advertised.  I haven&#x27;t been using it very long, but it does seem to be working well on my skin.  There is no odor problem with this product.  Very clear instructions on bottle and good followup from producer.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for two weeks, i love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my hair, just few drops and then rubble into the hair. The result was great, hair looks a little shinny, moisturized and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin soft, you do need to reapply several times during the day. Don&#x27;t need to put too much on, two or three drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will purchase again and recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  had the Argan oil for a little over 2 months and have used less than 20% of the bottle. I love it, it&#x27;s MUCH lighter than the olive and carrot oils that I normally used on my hair.  I only use a small amount at a time because a little goes a long way, I have long, fine hair so 5 to 6 drops will cover it all.  When I first used the oil, back in the beginning of March, it had a very light nutty scent which was nice. Approximately 2 months later, I open the bottle and it has a sour odor.  I checked for an expiration date and it says 12 months after opening.  I know it&#x27;s an organic product so I expected it to go bad at some point in the future but not this quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I will say that the Instanatural LLC, gets 5 stars for customer service. They responded quickly and offered a great resolution.  Their customer service is EXCELLENT and they will continue to get my business.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with how this works. I get very frizzy hair (due to highlights) and mixed a couple drops in with my styling smoother and worked great. Going to try on my face tonight. Love that this is organic and has so many great uses to try.</li>
            <li> My first time using the Argan Oil and am so very pleased.  Great on my hair, hands, feet, all-over body treatment.  The post-purchase customer service emails from the seller is very appreciated, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Moisturizes my skin beautifully. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the pungent, sour smell...unsure if that&#x27;s what other reviewers are calling &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34;. Received a couple nice automated emails from the company. Overall pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Awful stuff, stinks to high heaven. Tried to return but went out of town and missed the ship date on the label. Yuck don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this argan oil for a few weeks now and I love it. My skin is glowing, I feel beautiful. No more make up,all I need is argan oil and I&#x27;m all set.</li>
            <li> The Argan oil is great.  I will definitely order more.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I am so excited about Instanatural products! I hope that comes across in this review - I feel I can&#x27;t say enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I have tried many, many skincare products. Many of them very good products. None of them have stuck - I just keep trying. I have finally found it and have no need to look any further! I didn&#x27;t even realize I was searching until I tried Instanatural. Now I know I don&#x27;t need anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been concerned with the ingredients I put into my body and onto my skin. Most skincare products, even when touting natural, have included ingredients that I can&#x27;t pronounce, were made in labs, and are unnecessary. Instanatural ORGANIC Argan Oil is just that -&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil. I have tried others and they are perfumed and contain other junk. They don&#x27;t feel good on the skin or hair. Instanatural has a natural smell - earthy, and feels welcome and performs well on skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this daily, after shower, on my face and hair. It&#x27;s the best, most nourishing feeling and my skin &amp; hair both are so thankful - you can tell! I use this oil as a daily use product, and the Rosehip oil as a treatment at night or for skin irritations or rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No need to use anything else - I have found Instanatural!</li>
            <li> Have you ever tried a product and instantly fell in love with it? This is it for me. Why did it take so long for me to find a product like this? I have no idea but I am delighted that I have found this organic 100% pure argan oil.. This is wonderful for dry skin, dry hair. As a matter of fact, argan oil can be used for so many things. I can see how this could be used from head to toe. A drop goes a long ways. Less is best when it comes to argan oil.  Use a small amount at a time. It goes far, believe me. It comes with a dropper which is the best way to use it..a drop at a time. I am  going to experiment with this and try adding a couple drops to my bottle of shampoo.  I love the versatility of this this product.  There are so many uses for this.  How often do you see this?  Unbelievable 100-Day 100% Money Back Guarantee. Try it at our expense &amp; Buy with confidence!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this oil helps a lot&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear it under my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also using on my hair because I have dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality oil  - my hair loves it! I use it as part of my regimen for dealing with my insanely thick, curly hair and it makes a huge difference. Penetrates quickly too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read good things about benefits of Argan oil and my hairstylist recommended to try it out. So, I ordered it and was patiently waiting for its arrival. When the postman dropped the package next to my door I found out that something happened to the oil inside and the whole box was soaked in oil. :(&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got very upset and thought I would have to go through bunch of hassle to replace it... But I was extremely pleasantly surprised... After emailing Instanaturall about this incident they were very pleasant, personal, supportive and understanding of the situation and shipped a new package to me straight away! In just two days I had my Argan oil in perfect shape this time.&lt;br /&gt;I started using it on my hair and love how it moisturizers and make my hair more manageable and shiny without looking oily or greasy like some other oils do. I now started using this oil on my daughters curly hair and absolutely love the result! I can brush her curls easily now and her hair looks amazing! When I have time I also put a little oil on my fingernails to make them stronger and look healthier!&lt;br /&gt;So far I am very pleased with the product and with the customer service! If I will ever be in need of other oils I will be absolutely ordering it from here!</li>
            <li> Moroccan Argan Oil has been all the rage lately and I just had to try it for myself. I know we are supposed to use it on hair, but I wanted to try some other ways to use the oil as well. I had heard some claims on the internet and wanted to try them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by a few things. First off, the smell is that of fresh green olives. It took me by surprise, but it did wear off as soon as it was absorbed. It absorbed quickly and was shiny at first, but that also dissipated. It worked very well on dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my feet before I went to bed and it made them so soft.</li>
            <li> Do not trust all the paid reviews.&lt;br /&gt;This argan oil is very poor grade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably left over and unusable spoiled argan oil sold for cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is HORRIBLE. Smells like vomit and you should not put anywhere near your face</li>
            <li> The oil is great on my skin, nails, face, and hair.</li>
            <li> I love this Argan Oil! If you&#x27;re looking for some, look no further. I&#x27;ve tried so many different kinds, but the kinds that they offer at places like CVS, Target, and other beauty suppliers often contain other ingredients. When buying Argan Oil, I realized I had to look for 100% pure organic Argan Oil that came in an amber glass bottle (as not to lose it&#x27;s properties by exposure to sunlight). I was lucky enough to try this kind by InstaNatural, and WOW, I&#x27;m never using anything else. I have hair that flows past my bottom, which I dye, blowdry, and straighten frequently. I use this oil overnight in my hair, as well as a small amount after I shower. I can already see that my hair is much shiner, thicker, and healthier overall. Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Works well, great product.</li>
            <li> Large bottle and 100% pure for an amazing price!!! I use this on my hands and feet to sooth the dryness. I also put a drop or two on my face before applying makeup. Best of all it comes with a pump spray attachment.  This makes it so easy to use on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also sent an email with many uses of this product!  5 star item!!!!!  Will buy again and definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal. The bottle is huge compared to most bottles of Argan oil you find in the market. The price is also a plus. The oil itself is good quality.</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail extremely quickly and was thoroughly impressed with the product. I have purchased poor quality Argan oil before (even some from Morocco), but this is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one of the dry regions of the USA, I really need a moisturizer like argan oil because lotions do not typically work. I&#x27;m sticking to InstaNatural argan oil for as long as I can. With this value, it isn&#x27;t worth it to try to use anything else!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son&#x27;s hair and so far so good!!!! Will update again after a longer use period!</li>
            <li> I love everything about argan oil!! I can&#x27;t wait to use this one</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;my hair is so much softer! thank you&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Can already tell a difference in my skin clearing up and my scars going away!</li>
            <li> InstaNatural is a great night cream.  It&#x27;s light and makes my face feel like baby skin.  Much better than a heavy night cream.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my extremely dry, brittle hair. It worked instantly. The first time I used it my hair didn&#x27;t look like a broom anymore. I have tried it on my face also. Nice results but I want to save it for my hair. Every time I use it I get the same results. Healthy looking hair for a change.</li>
            <li> I personally haven&#x27;t used the product, but will purchase for myself soon.  In the meantime, my mother uses the product and likes the way it absorbs into her skin without a heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> I have been reading a lot about Argan Oil and wanted to try, I choose this product because it&#x27;s organic. After using is for a few weeks now I like it, feels good on my skin. Too soon to say if its making any different, but my skin seems fresher/not dry. Have not tried it on my hair yet. Just starting using it on my whole body after a work out.</li>
            <li> My mum and sister recommended that I try using argan oil on my hair. I wasn&#x27;t sure which brand is good and I came across this brand of argan oil and decided to give it a try. I love the product and I&#x27;ve been using it as a skin moisturizer and also for my hair. I also love how it is organic and is great for its price.</li>
            <li> TRY THIS. Is your hair dull, dry, breaking? Do you color your hair, perm it, blow dry it?&lt;br /&gt;I am a professional stylist. You can come to me for all your problems and pay me a large sum of cash, or you can use this product.&lt;br /&gt;If I didn&#x27;t try it for myself I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no split ends. I have not cut my hair in 6 weeks and my hair is 1.5 inches longer. Now your hair grows 1/2 a month...your split ends will take that away in  month.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t believe me...do your own experiments and  test if for yourself!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WANT LONGER, SHINIER, HEALTHIER HAIR? USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!  YOU&#x27;RE WORTH IT&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a super product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Argan Oil, Rosehip Seed Oil &amp; their Moroccan Rosewater for the past month and I am extremely happy with the results. I wanted to give it some time before reviewing it and my skin has reacted really well to it. I use the Argan Oil in the morning as a day moisturizer, the Moroccan Rosewater as a toner at night &amp; the Rosehip Seed Oil as my night moisturizer. I&#x27;ve also used the oils in my hair, nails &amp; neck to great results. I&#x27;m a satisfied customer &amp; would recommend their products.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this argon oil was as good as a more expensive brand I bought but I find it to be oily and doesn&#x27;t absorb easily. This makes me believe it is not 100% pure argon oil. The price was too good to be true. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of the oil.  It&#x27;s not too thin or too thick.  The amount of oil you get for the inexpensive price is great.  It definitely compares to Josie Maran Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I was quite interested to try this oil, since according to the description, it is good for everything from hair to skin to nails to -- increasing one&#x27;s intelligence? Ha -- just kidding there, but seriously, it seemed that this oil was a miracle or something. I was happy to get a bottle to review. The hard thing was deciding what to use it for. I just wasn&#x27;t crazy about putting oil on my hair. Blame it on those long-ago teenage days when my hair had plenty of oil on its own. Hmmm ... what on my body was in need of a miracle? I decided to try it on my heels. They have those visible lines, which I suppose are commonly referred to as ... cracks (that sounds so bad). One evening while watching TV, I put a few drops of the oil onto my heel and massaged them in for a few minutes. Then I repeated this on my other heel. Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot. I did notice that the oil absorbed quickly, with no strange odors or lingering oiliness on my fingers. A few nights later, I pulled out the bottle again to repeat the process. And I noticed -- much to my surprise -- that my heels looked better. The lines didn&#x27;t appear white anymore, and they were less visible. Additionally, my heels felt smooth on the couch, and not in danger of &amp;#34;catching&amp;#34; on the threads in that dry, icky way. Suffice it to say that rubbing a few drops into my heels is now a favorite activity during evening TV sessions. I expect the 4 oz. in this bottle to last for a year, at least. I&#x27;m a satisfied customer, and I anticipate being able to go longer between pedicures thanks to Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> Great product. Totally recommend for hair, specially in the summer.</li>
            <li> I expected to enjoy using their argan oil and InstaNatural actually surpassed my expectations. The oil comes in a nice heavy dark blue bottle, and you get 4 ounces which is more than twice the amount that most companies are selling. It comes with a dropper which I love because it allows me to control the amount I use. This oil spreads easily and a little goes a long way. I have used this argan oil as a leave in conditioner on my hair, to moisturize my face, as as a full body oil, cuticle conditioner and to smooth knees, elbows and heels. It works. Period. I will continue using it until every precious drop is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I’ll buy more.</li>
            <li> This product is trash and the worst waste of my money! I am not sure if this is Argan oil or just water in a bottle, but I am sure that it is not USDA approved! So if you are thinking about ordering this product then go to another one. I have also had trouble with their customer service in the past which hardly speak English! Do not order this product!</li>
            <li> love this oil.  lightweight and easy to apply all over.  i use this after getting any facial treatments and after shower to keep skin moisturized.  try applying on slightly damp face and body to seal in moisture!</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy thick wavy I am so excited to write this review because it works so well on my hair. All I do now is shampoo and condition. Then add about half a dropper full on my hands and rub them together. I evenly comb it through my hair and then just let my hair air dry. I get nice moist and shiny curls after my hair is all dry. After using it for a few weeks now I have noticed that my hair feels healthier and less dry. I have a lot of problems with split ends right at the crown of my hair and have always had a problem keeping them down. Just a little dab of the oil on my hair line solves the problem.</li>
            <li> Great Product. 100% pure, use it for my dry legs and sometimes in my hair. Multi-purpose and fabulous! way better than any chemicals to put on your skin hair or nails. :)</li>
            <li> This oil goes on nicely and has no odor. Absorbs quickly. I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both LOVE this product!  After a lifetime spent out of doors, my skin is once again moist;  my hair glistens.&lt;br /&gt;She has been using it on her feet and legs as-well-as her hair and face-it works.</li>
            <li> This is the bomb!!! I have used this as a facial moisturizer twice a day and my skin feels amazing. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have had flaky scalp my whole life and even have used medicated shampoo (which did not work).  This oil was a miracle worker and my flaky scalp has not been around for 2 weeks, since I started using this product.  I put a few drops in (right in the problem areas) before I take a shower and it has worked beautifully.  I am even using the argan oil on my face.  I am no longer using my face lotion and I am quite impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> I have tried Argan Oil in the past from different manufactures with mixed results so I was very excited to get to try this [[ASIN:B00H93NJLS Argan Oil by InstaNatural]].  I typically have oily skin and hair so I didn&#x27;t know how well this product would work for me.  But I can say it has performed quite well and I think I may be hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this product is the generous size at 4oz (120ml).  Using only a couple drops per application, this product size seems to last forever.  The pump dispenser helps me to get even amounts for application without going overboard with the product.  I have been using this Argan Oil on my hair for the last couple weeks and find it has really improved the feel and look of my hair.  I&#x27;ve tested it out both before showering and after and find I like my results best applying it after a shower, has really helped to reduce frizzyness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this [[ASIN:B00H93NJLS Argan Oil by InstaNatural]].  My experience has been really great however this product may not work for everyone but that&#x27;s okay.  What makes this a stand out product is knowing that even if you fall into the bracket of people this may not work out for, the manufacturer is willing to make things right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> I have used this product on my hair and face as well as dry areas on my body (I live in a very dry climate). I have very sensitive skin and this product has caused no irritation and has been a light, gentle and effective moisturizer. I do see a difference in my hair as the ends look healthier and feel softer. I also used the oil on my boyfriend&#x27;s face and scalp/hair and he liked the way it made those areas feel. Great product and really superb customer service.</li>
            <li> Nice product that moisturizers well.  It absorbs fully eventually, but takes a little longer than some other products I&#x27;ve tried.  However, it&#x27;s significantly less expensive so to me it&#x27;s worth the extra couple of minutes in the morning.  I can&#x27;t say it has helped my mild acne but it definitely hasn&#x27;t made it worse.</li>
            <li> Great value. Great oil. The pump was a pleasant surprise as well.  We will re&#x3D;purchase for sue1</li>
            <li> This argan oil is great for multiple uses, face, hands, cuticles, feet, hair ets. I use it every day, more than once a day and my cuticles have improved.It is less expensive than the other leading oil out there and it works just as well. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Of the many uses argan oil has, I was only really interested in one...hair! I am mixed race and so is my daughter. It is sometimes difficult to find hair products to suit our needs. I am always trying to find a product that is super light because we have fine textured hair, and also very moisturizing because our hair tends to get dry and hers is also very curly. I was told about argan oil by a friend and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter usually has a ponytail aka ball of curls on top of her head. I have used other products on her hair and I have found them to be sticky, greasy, way too heavy, and in a number of other ways inadequate and definitely not giving the results I was looking for. I wanted light, silky, shiny, and moisturized. After washing her hair, applying the argan oil, and a quick blow dry I got what I wanted. I also found that using the argan oil on her curls without blow drying keeps her curls beautiful, shiny, and moisturized. I definitely recommend this for anyone with textured hair.</li>
            <li> I love this multi purpose oil,I first tried it in my hair left in on for about 20 min then rinsed my hair was very soft. I ask used it on my skin and the oil left my skin soft with a glow.When my hair needs a shine,I just apply to my hair daily and go.I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase. I use it every single day. I am 30 years old and have had moderate to severe adult acne for the past 5 years. Upon reading other reviews, I thought this product would help with my acne but it only exacerbates it. I&#x27;m ok with that just because since it is an oil, I didn&#x27;t have high expectations. However, I do use this in my hair and on my entire body. My hair has never been so soft and my skin feels greatly moisturized. I do use this under my regular body lotion. All in all I am very happy with this product and will certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my mom and so far she likes how the oil feels compared to others she&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> Received promptly and at the time they said I would receive it. I am really liking the product and I use it on myself,  husband, and baby (who had cradle cap).</li>
            <li> Appreciate the value of my Argan purchase - will be ordering more.  Will pass along to others who use this product</li>
            <li> This oil is smooth as silk...... I was ordering some oils online and I had never used argan oil before and I thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl. The reviews are excellent, it is certified organic, and if I don&#x27;t like it I get my money back? Yeah I&#x27;ll try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I used this I wasn&#x27;t dissatisfied with everything I used before ... and now I don&#x27;t see how I survived!!! :) I now use argan oil in my body wash, in my coconut oil as a moisturizer, and alone in my hair--a little goes a long way! I have to use three times more jojoba oil to get the same effect in my curly hair. Because I use it all over my body and it gets all over my hands, I notice my nails and cuticles are prettier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered the product from amazon, instanatural shipped it right away and the package was delivered on time. I received a genuine email from the FOUNDER OF THE COMPANY to make sure everything worked out for me, if they could help in any way, if I received my package, and if I enjoyed the product. I am thrilled with their service as well as their product. I mean, you cannot get more personal than this! The founder was genuinely interested in my opinion of the oil and how I used it. They even offered suggestions on where/how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I will be ordering this oil from instanatural again and I plan to explore their other high-quality ORGANIC (ooh la la) products. :D Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Seems pure and clean. The dropper is great since you only need a few drops of this. Seriously, only a few drops. Anything more and you&#x27;ll be greasier than a slice of papa john&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I am genuinely impressed with InstaNatural&#x27;s Organic Argan Oil.  I had tried a few organic fair-trade argan oils before and they always made me break out.  I simply chalked it up to an individual intolerance at the time as I have very sensitive skin.  I was re-stocking my supply of various natural moisturisers when I came across this product and between the positive reviews and the money-back guarantee (which I really hoped I would not have to test), I decided to give argan oil another shot.  And let me say that I am supremely pleased that I did!  I typically alternate between organic cold-pressed coconut oil, rosehip seed oil, grapeseed, and evening primrose oil as a counteractive measure since my skin starts to revolt when I regularly use the same type of oil for an extended period.  I have been using this argan oil consistently since I first ordered it a few weeks ago and I&#x27;ve yet to experience any adverse effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regards to usage, a few drops really do go a long way and I always recommend that a hydrosol be misted over the face prior to moisturising.  If the price seems a bit high, just know that you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find the more &#x27;exotic&#x27; oils in such a large bottle at a fair price unless purchasing in bulk and not everyone has the time, money, or storage for that.  Organic cold-pressed oils are never going to be cheap, at least not if you want them to be pure and ethically-sourced.  One does pay a premium for quality and in this instance, I&#x27;m glad to say it was justified.  That said, it was still cheaper than the other argan products I had previously purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil comes in a cobalt glass bottle with a long glass dropper which makes application very convenient.  It has a delicately sweet scent that is quite pleasant (to me anyway) and I take issue with the reviewer who claimed this was adulterated in some way.  While I am hardly an expert on all the organic argan oils of the world (well, really Morocco), being an avid cook, I&#x27;m pretty sure I know what olive oil smells like (and on that fragrance note, olive oil itself is often a counterfeit mixture of canola and chlorophyll; seriously, Google it).  Fact of the matter is, none of the previous argan oils I had tried smelled this good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciated that the seller made a sincere effort to follow up on my order.  It&#x27;s not often one sees that kind of commitment to customer satisfaction.  I look forward to making the InstaNatural line a staple of my beauty arsenal.I&#x27;m pretty sure I know what olive oil smells like (and on that fragrance note, olive oil itself is often a counterfeit mixture of canola and chlorophyll; seriously, Google it).

            <li> I have used this in my face, nails, hair and love how quickly it absorbs. My frizzy hair was tamed with just 4 drops. I then used it on my husband, friends and even my dog ( fleas don&#x27;t like oil ) everyone but the dog loved it too. Just a little goes along way, this bottle should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about Argan Oil—but I had read a lot about it on the internet. After a lot of researching different companies, I decided to go with Insta Natural. I haven’t looked back since. What this oil has done for my skin and hair—it’s definitely the best out there.</li>
            <li> I have to leave this product a 5 star. I usually put on oil right after shower when body still wet in the shower instead of putting on lotion. I purchased this oil just out of curiosity because I have purchase moroccan oil for my hair and the result was fabulous. This oil leaves instant silky&amp;smooth texture. Unlike other type of oil leaves greasy texture.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention the seller follows up right after, he has been very helpful and fast reply to all my questions. Definitely a brilliant online purchase experience. I will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> Well pleased. Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> It stinks! I can understand it may have a smell because its argan oil but it honestly stunk so bad that I didn&#x27;t want to put it on, I had to return it.</li>
            <li> Use daily and it leaves my skin soft and silky and has no odor.  This is the best moisturizer I. have used...at any price.</li>
            <li> I have it for a month. It is good especially for Hair, Face. I have not yet tried on for my Skin &amp; Nails since it is summer time here.</li>
            <li> I am 70 years old and come from a generation of men that never were particularly concerned about their appearance.  However, I have to admit I have from time to time enjoyed comments about my healthy head of salt and pepper hair as I&#x27;ve gotten older making me look &amp;#34;distinguished.&amp;#34;  I guess there are some vanities that go along with being a &amp;#34;senior,&amp;#34; i.e., old!  However, the last few years I&#x27;ve noticed my hair getting thinner, brittle and frizzy.  I thought if there were some way to make a difference, with very little trouble or effort, I would be willing to do it.  As an experiment, I ordered the oil.  To my surprise, it works!  I don&#x27;t want to have a greasy look so I put a few drops on my scalp at night and massage it in.  The next morning in my shower I wash it out, and it leaves my hair looking shiny and healthy.  That&#x27;s all their is to it.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite product! I instantly noticed a difference once I started using this product. I use it when I see or feel a blemish appearing on my face, I use it when I give myself manicure and pedicures, and I use it in my hair. I cannot get enough of this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is typically very dry and frizzy, but it&#x27;s also very fine and think so I have a hard time finding products that help moisturize and smooth my hair without weighing it down or making it look oily. This product works so well with just a tiny tiny drop or two. It makes my hair look, smell, and feel wonderful. I normally hate my hair, but I am now beginning to love it. I&#x27;ve had others notice that my hair looks different even and I happily show off the Argan oil. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails are not bad at all, but my mothers hands and feet are AWFUL. They are seriously so rough and dry, it&#x27;s scary. Lol but I&#x27;ve used this on her a couple of times (I&#x27;m too stingy to give it up to her) and she has noticed a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be very high quality and I really love that&#x27;s it&#x27;s organic and reasonably priced. I have purchased a coupes of products from this brand and I am always impressed with them. I highly recommend this brand and product! You will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I did receive a complementary bottle of this product to test and review. I am not obligated in any way to give a favorable review. All views expressed are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, big glass bottle, tinted blue (argan oil needs to be in a dark bottle to retain its properties). It&#x27;s high quality USDA certified organic argan oil, and it feels and works great. I use three or four drops on my face at night after my cleansing and vitamin C/HCA routine. I worried at first that my pillowcase would get oily, but it doesn&#x27;t. The argan oil sinks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t rub off. It doesn&#x27;t stay oily at all, and the mild scent goes away once it&#x27;s dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also very nice on hands and hair, whether you just use a few drops in damp hair or mix it into your conditioner. It&#x27;ll give your hair extra shine and smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many argan oils before and this is one of the best, and easily one of the best deals considering how big the bottle is. My preference would be for a pump instead of a dropper, but either way, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> If your balking at getting this let me tell you their are alot of drops in this bottle, and a little does so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my legs after my shower instead of moisturizer, 4 drops and it beats my best lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not detect any odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used it on my hair, it did not leave it oily, but replaced my conditioner and felt like a leave in conditioner does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the thing I like best is it&#x27;s one bottle that can do so many different things!</li>
            <li> I decided to try it based upon the other reviews for use on my beard.  After a couple weeks use (about every other day at night) I saw an improvement in my beard.  Not nearly as many tangles and it was overall softer and not as frizzy.  A little goes a long way and it has a pleasant nutty smell that quickly fades.</li>
            <li> Great for hair. Made my hair feel smooth and natural. It look healthy and shinny.</li>
            <li> Bought to moisturize dry skin and hair. Little goes a long way! I use it once every other day right out of the shower and my skin hasn&#x27;t been itchy and my hair looks healthy. Also have used on my face and hasn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this product, I really like it. I have some days using it and I feel the change. This is helping me as I did not expect!! I am very pleased with this Argain oil...!! Try it !!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan oil for over 5 years and love it. I have been searching for a less expensive alternative and I believe I have found it. This argan oil is 1/4 the price and is comparable. The instanatural brand does have a stronger  nutty fragrance but it does not linger and is not offensive (not to me anyway). The consistency is not the same. Instanatural Argan oil is not as clear and is a little thicker than JM brand but absorbs into the skin the exact same way. For the price, this argan oil is good. I personally prefer Josie Maran Argan oil ( especially for the face) but I find this argan oil is more affordable and gives the exact same results.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is very healing and moisturizing to the skin. I like InstaNatural brand and believe it is a good buy. Depending on what you are using it for, it usually takes only a small amount, thus it lasts quite a long time. I have found InstaNatural, as a company, to be very helpful when I&#x27;ve communicated with them, and found them to readily answer my questions, and to stand behind their products.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Makes my skin really soft..especially needed on my hands</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with dry patches of skin on the back of my neck for years.  My doctor said it was eczema and wrote me a prescription for a cream.  This cream discolored my skin and really only temporarily got rid of the problem.  When I returned to my doctor and voiced my displeasure, she recommended argan oil.  She said it was better than any prescription she could write.  She was absolutely right!  I did some research and purchased my first bottle and am thrilled with the results.  I use it every day and my eczema has completely cleared up!  It takes a few weeks to see the effects, but it does wonders.  I&#x27;m so glad I found a solution and will be using this in my every day skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Great price, but the dropper is not so great, as it immediately starts dripping as soon as you remove it from the bottle.  Still, this is an inconvenience I am willing to deal with given the price.</li>
            <li> Been faithfully using every night after cleansing with an Organic Rose Toner. My pores have minimized and my face is 70% less oily. Great Quality and last a very long time! A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  Loved using it on my skin, nails and cuticles.  Liked using on my hair but had to be careful to use only a little.  I am thrilled that I found this product which is unscented since I do not care for scented products.</li>
            <li> I love using the product on my skin, especially after spending time in the sun. It  does not feel oily at all and feels wonderful on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, the price is right and so is the oil, argan oil is the best and I&#x27;m loving this one, I love that it&#x27;s great for the face, dry skin, cuticles, hair ends, and I love mixing it in with my hair conditioners, leave ins, masks and I also use it for manicures and pedicures as well as hair treatments. It works great too if you mix in a lil of your favorite conditioner some of this oil and some water in a spray bottle and there you go your own home made leave in conditioner. Perfect and natural which is the best, very versatile</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer.  A little goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy, and I have oily skin.  Also great for nails and cuticles.  The smell is very mild.  Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Excellent price! Offers every benefit of other brands&#x27; Argan oil (reduces appearance if wrinkles; quickly and completely absorbed; no oily or shiny feel or appearance). I only wish I had known about this years ago (I am 62).</li>
            <li> Too soon to determine how well it works. The product has a mild order that I don&#x27;t care for but the smell soon goes away.</li>
            <li> This Argan oil is great! I use it for my hair, take 10-15 drops and massage into scalp and ends of hair and leave it overnight. The next day my hair feels so shiny and soft. I have long hair and it was starting to fall out, this in combination with weekly coconut oil treatments took care of that and now my hair is the best it has been in years! I also use this oil for my face, dry heels and cuticles and it is very moisturizing!!&lt;br /&gt;This oil is organic and pure, has no chemical additives like other oils advertised for much higher price. this is a great oil for a great price and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> It feels wonderful and makes your skin so soft and absorbs quickly if you don&#x27;t apply too much.  Highly recommend for face, forearms and legs.</li>
            <li> Best oil for dry hair...</li>
            <li> As a moisturizer &amp;#34;Organ Oil&amp;#34; made my hair soft and controlled frizz, although it seems a little bit greasy. For a long time after bleaching my hair, it looked  frizzy, dry and damaged. Usually I use a little bit of olive oil to treat its dryness but now, I am done with dry and damaged hair :)</li>
            <li> As I wrote before regarding Instanatural argan oil will never change, and I am writing it again! This is a very good product! I use it everyday under make up, and I have good result. The issue that I had with the the pump bottle has been fixed. They sent me not only the pump, also a free bottle of argan oil. Good customer service! Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> It works good if I can resist the temptation to put too much in my hair.  I look at that little drop and think, &amp;#34;Oh, that can&#x27;t be enough&amp;#34;.  It can and it is</li>
            <li> This oil is great. You only need a drop of two for your hair to make it look shiny and feel soft. It is especially good on color treated hair. The instructions say you can use the oil on your face but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet. I have sensitive skin and I am afraid I will break out but I use it on my arms and legs and so far  no break outs. Instead my arms and legs are soft all day.</li>
            <li> A friend requested this Argan Oil as a gift and highly recommended it.  I bought some for her and decided I should try it also.  I have exceptionally dry skin.  Well, this stuff is WONDERFUL!  I have used it on my hands and feet and especially on my nails for 5 days and it has worked wonders.  It absorbs quickly and leaves my nails healthy looking and skin soft.  I highly recommend it.  The company is very interested in customer satisfaction and provides exceptional customer service.  Try it!</li>
            <li> Great product.  The skin on my forehead is now becoming a bit dry but the rest of my face is normal. This oil is perfect. I rub 5 drops in my hand and then spread it on right after washing. It&#x27;s not great oily. It gives me this great glow like when I was a teenager.  The oil soaks in and then I use my regular moisturizer all over. My skin is soft and pretty.  Get this oil. It is miraculous!</li>
            <li> I was using a different brand of the argan oil and it was working good. Then I tried this brand of argan oil and it broke my chest out, so I wasn&#x27;t going to use it on my face. Sorry, but this product was not satisfactoy. I will not be buying this brand anymore.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful oil. I used it have dying my hair and it put all the moisture back in my hair! Also it worked great on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Argan oil for my skin and have noticed how much my skin is improving. I apply the oil before bed and then apply Instanatural vitamin c serum after cleansing my face in the morning. I also apply the oil to my hair after washing before letting it dry. My hair is less frizzy, super soft, and shinier! I&#x27;ve never used Argan oil before this so I&#x27;m really impressed and LOVE it. I recommend having Argan oil as part of your beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> I love the way it quickly absorbs into the skin.. i am adding my favorite essential oils for my skincare.</li>
            <li> Great deal. Great oil. A little goes a long way so this size should last awhile even though I use it for everything for the entire family.</li>
            <li> First of all, packaging on this &amp;#34;liquid gold&amp;#34; is perfection! The bottle is super durable (I may have dropped it by accident... whoops!) and the dropper delivers exact amounts every time. Mine came with a dropper in a blue bottle, so it looks like Insta Natural is trying a new look, but I&#x27;m sure the pump works just as well!&lt;br /&gt;My roommate used it to moisturize her legs, prompting me to use it before shaving! It not only made my legs extremely hydrated, it gave me the closest shave in the history of ever! The combination gave me silky smooth legs for at least a week!&lt;br /&gt;The only down side I&#x27;ve encountered is that Insta Natural&#x27;s Argan Oil doesn&#x27;t absorb very quickly. While this isn&#x27;t such a problem when you&#x27;re using it in the shower, another of my roommates did have an issue with using it as a cuticle/hand moisturizer before bed. She said her hands felt drenched and oily and worried that she&#x27;d get the product all over her sheets. The next day, her hands were exceedingly soft, though, so you win some you lose some?&lt;br /&gt;Basically, this product is wonderful AND versatile :)</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try InstaNatural&#x27;s brand of Moroccan Argan Oil it because I have found that is one of the most nourishing oils. This  product is great because it is organic, undiluted and USDA Certified Pure Moroccan Argan Oil. Being a concentrated, full strength oil, the silky feeling it gives both hair and body leaves a rich sheen that is light yet lasting. I enjoy smoothing just a few drops on daily after showering to nourish our skin and this is an excellent moisturizer to use when styling my hair with heated appliances. My husband likes the quick absorption of the Moroccan Argan Oil without the oily feel or heavy scent of other lotions. An excellent value for natural, organic Argan Oil that can be used from head to toe.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, well packaged, and oil is light and easily absorbed. No heavy fragrance at all. Follow-up emails about my satisfaction were welcome and helpful. These people really understand the concept of customer service!</li>
            <li> My experience : I would recommend this for skin although the results do not last. I live in vegas.  Dry weather.  I put it on my hands and cuticles overnight, I can feel difference on moisture but not huge.&lt;br /&gt;It did not work for my on damp hair before styling it.  My hair weigh down and felt greasy. I was des appointed on my way to work. However, it worked as a pretreatment overnight.  Next day I shampoo my hair. I noticed hair was shiny.&lt;br /&gt;On face did not work for me. It was to greasy and I already have oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;Big bottle for the price. I&#x27;m planning no reorder after I finish this.</li>
            <li> Okay, I am going to be embarrassingly honest here. I had never heard of Argan oil before discovering it online. I had heard of its supposed magical powers and figured, \\&quot;Why not give it a try?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is just as a described: HUGE. You don&#x27;t realize how much 4 ounces really is, but this bottle is going to last a long time and I love that it&#x27;s multipurpose:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix a few drops in my shampoo and wash my hair then condition. After rinsing I apply two to three drops on my scalp and brush through my hair. It absorbs. It is not greasy at all. Since the smell is barely there, it doesn&#x27;t leave any type of odor. My hair is actually shinier AND I have a lot less fly-aways. Which is always a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had also read about its ability to reduce the appearance of scars. I thought it was just hype, but I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and a scar on my leg has been greatly faded. (I apply the Argan oil in the morning and at night). It was a fresh scar from a skin biopsy and I believe it will continue to fade with regular usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, but not least, sometimes facial wash just does not get all of the eye make-up! Chemical-free and gentle eye make-up remover? Sign me up! I put some of this onto a Q-tip and go over anything my facial wash missed before continuing with the rest of my skincare regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only possible issue is that because of the viscosity of the oil, it drips from the dropper. I believe that the cap has been changed so the product now dispenses from a pump instead of a dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product. Highest recommendation!</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of argan oil for the purposes of review. All opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;I had the opportunity to sample some Insta Natural 100% Pure Argan Oil. So what makes this product special? Well it’s more of what is NOT in the bottle. If you read the ingredients, you will only see one ingredient. Argan oil. That’s it. This is the real thing, harvested from the argan tree in Morocco. Every bottle of Insta Natural Argan Oil is certified organic. It preservative free, and also fragrance free. This is a product which is a great option for people with allergies or chemical sensitivities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for a period of two weeks. After showering and towel drying my hair, I dispensed a few drops of Insta Natural Argan Oil into my palms, rubbed the oil vigorously between my hands and applied it to the ends of my hair where it tends to be the driest and most damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The temptation when using a product like this is always to use a little more than the label recommends. However, I can assure you that you DO NOT want to apply too much of this product. When they say 100% pure, they really mean it. If you use more than a few drops, then your hair will appear oily and limp. A little (really little) bit goes a long way, and that’s the truth. A handful of drops (5-7) is what I needed to make my shoulder length hair look soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product. It was very moisturizing, to both the hair and the scalp. It is also a great tonic for dried cuticles, as I have only recently learned. If you are going to invest in a good quality argan oil, then you will not be steered wrong with this product. Insta Natural offers a 100% guarantee on their product. If you are not satisfied, then you will receive your money back, no questions asked.</li>
            <li> I have not tried this yet, however the pump top that came with it is too small to fit on the bottle. I have no way to seal the bottle now</li>
            <li> Nice quality and feel (doesn&#x27;t feel like i&#x27;m putting oil on my face). I use it everyday (summer/ winter) for my face and my skin stays hydrated. I&#x27;ve stopped using hydrating creams from beauty stores and have solely been using argan oil. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Thin and poor quality compared to other Argan oils we have used</li>
            <li> Good product. Almost time to reorder more.</li>
            <li> 100% natural and I love the way it just absorbs into my skin and hair. Not oily just leaves me soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Very nice substance - just a drop or two rubbed in my palms and then my hair keeps my hair shiny and keeps the frizzies out (I have long, fine, medium-thick, naturally wavy, frizzy hair). Be careful to use very little and increase if you need to - it&#x27;s easy to over-do which brings on the greasy look.</li>
            <li> I had bought another brand the first time but it was not as good as this. It was more expensive and the bottle was only 4 ounces. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have been using different argan oils for about a year now.  I am dark skinned, with brown hair that is fine and thin.  In the winter it gets very dry where I live and lotions do not cut it for my skin and my hair is a frizzed out dry mess.  I use this argan oil on my body after a shower, on my face at night and in my hair to control frizz.  It works great, there is no smell and I don&#x27;t have dry itchy skin.  Be careful when you use this on your hair, a very little goes a long way, and make sure to just get it on your ends and comb through.</li>
            <li> Great product, love this stuff !!!</li>
            <li> One con, the delivery person left it on my doorstep and the bottle froze which caused some of it to leak out. The product itself is great though and already seeing improvement in my hair after only 3 days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil for my hair for while now, not realizing how great it is for skin treatment.  We&#x27;ve had a horribly cold and dry winter, yet my skin is much less dry than usual since I&#x27;ve been using argan oil.</li>
            <li> This oil is completely diluted with something cheaper for sure. The oil stinks and doesn&#x27;t work well on my facial complexion. It sits on my skin without absorbing and smells very bad. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it!</li>
            <li> I used this product for 30 days and I saw a difference in my nails and hair.  My nails grew stronger than usual. My hair was shiny (not greasy) after a couple days of using it and stayed that way.  It made my highlights shine a bit more.  I also used on my son&#x27;s forehead- he is 12 and has mild acne and it cleared it up to a point he doesn&#x27;t fight me to put it on.  For the price and the big bottle you receive- I highly recommend this product.  Yes, it has an odor but nothing horrible at all.  This is on our daily routine now!</li>
            <li> I have used this for about two months now.  I&#x27;ve used it mostly for my hair and scalp about 3x a week. My hair looks shinier and healthier.  It also eliminated my itchy scalp/ dandruff.  I will continue to use this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this product.. I can use it from my head to toe as my daily moisturizer.. Its gives me soft skin.. Would love to recommend to evryone</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times in my hair sparingly since I bought it and like it so far.</li>
            <li> The oil works great and it is just as described in the product description.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is that I am in love with Argan oil!!! I love how one oil can help with my hair, nails, and skin. Argan oil has a very faint smell so you don&#x27;t have to worry about your nose being overwhelmed. It comes in a large bottle and it goes a long way! I only use a few drops to help my nails and skin every day so my bottle still looks full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried Argan oil on my nails and cuticles because I have always had brittle nails. I have tried eating certain foods to help my nails, but nothing would work. I know part of my problem is that I do a lot of yard work and house work so my nails take a beating daily. From the first day of using this oil, I noticed that my cuticles were healthier and my nails were stronger! After a week of using the oil, my nails look amazing! I love having strong nails and healthy cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I do a lot of yard work, my fingers get really dry can cracked. After the first day of applying the oil to the rough patches, my skin was a lot softer. After I kept using the oil, my cracked skin was no longer cracked! All I have to say is that this oil is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now going to try using it on my hair to see how it will help my dry ends. I am already expecting great results because it has&lt;br /&gt;worked great so far. I definitely recommend getting this oil because it can help make your nails, cuticles, and skin look beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I tried argan oil for the first time a couple years ago and fell in love with it. The bottle of Instanatural Argan Oil is a little different from what I have used before because it has a dropper. It drips pretty much on its own so you have to be careful not to make a mess. I love to use it on my daughters hair because she has really dry hair and then I rub any extra on my nails to make them shiny, soft, and strong.</li>
            <li> This is very good for dry and itching skin. I wish I had known about it earlier. It is better that the expensive lotions.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I use it on my face and body. It makes your legs look great and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. It works better then the most expensive facial lotions too. I&#x27;m addicted to it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after coming home from my stylist one day with super soft silky hair. I found out my stylist had placed several drops of this oil in the conditioner.  It is amazing!  I have started using it on my skin and nails and my skin has a glow/shine and is super soft.  I also use this product on my son&#x27;s hair.  He is a swimmer and refuses to wear a swim cap so after 4 days of water polo his hair is straw.  I started mixing some of the Organic Argan Oil in his conditioner and it has worked wonders.  It makes his hair soft and we can actually run a comb through it.  We both use it directly after getting out of the shower and absolutely love it.  It is not greasy, it has a very pleasant aroma and neither one of us find the need to use lotion anymore.  This is all you need and I love that the product is organic.</li>
            <li> Soothing and comforting. Lots of oil for the price. Arrived speedily. I use it sparingly. Thank you for great product.</li>
            <li> I have an almost 2 month old daughter, so I am constantly washing my hands to make sure they are clean. Not only that, but washing bottles and bottles and BOTTLES...at least 3 times a day....my hands were DRY! I&#x27;m not talking about &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;...I&#x27;m talking about SERIOUS cracking, bleeding, they feel like they are on fire DRY (my palms too! Crazy...my hands have NEVER been THIS dry). I was SO EXCITED to try out the oil. I&#x27;d been using lotion on my hands, but it didn&#x27;t really work long term...I wanted to try out and really give the oil a chance to see how effective it was. Well, let me tell you, from the first time I put it on my hands, it was a 1000% difference. I could not believe how quickly, with only a little amount, already relieved my dry, cracked hands. I have various dry spots on my skin - ankles, knees, elbows - so I started applying the oil there too. I was blown away by the wonderful results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely and whole heartedly recommend this product.  And how could you go wrong?!? They have a 100% LIFETIME Money Back Guarantee! Give it a try. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> this oil is great on my skin and hair, hydrating, smoothing, everything you want. I use it alone or with moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I always purchased much more expensive product. Received this &amp; just as good but less pricey. I will reorder again.</li>
            <li> This awesome bottle of Argan Oil is 100% pure Argan Oil and can be used in your hair, body, nails and on your face, especially if you have dry skin or hair like I do. A few drops of this wonderful oil will solve a lot of problems! It&#x27;s oils are not thick like some others I have used in the past. It absorbs quickly and you won&#x27;t have that sticky icky feeling like some oils will leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love it in my hair. I have very dry, frizzy hair when I first wash it and blow it dry and if I don&#x27;t use a few drops of Argan Oil to tame my hair, well, it&#x27;s not a pretty sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use the dropper and just a few drops do the trick. I love this idea because it will save this precious oil. I know in the past when I have used some oils that pour directly from the bottle, I had a tendency to over pour and ended up with more oil on my hands than anywhere else. This wasted a lot of oil that would have otherwise been used on my face or hair. So, I love this idea because this way it will last a good long time because the bottle is 4 fluid ounces, enough to last quite awhile if you watch what you are doing.</li>
            <li> My daughter, for whom the argan oil was purchased, says it&#x27;s almost as good as Josie Moran – only the smell is not as good! It feels as good as any argan oil that I have tried and better because it feels so great on the skin! Would recommend to anyone who wants softer, smoother, moisturized skin and hair!! :)</li>
            <li> ,My sister recommended I try argan oil for my dry skin.  This product works really well.  At first I used too much on my face which caused a rash.  However, no problems at all when I cut down to using a couple of drops twice a day.  I also use it on my arms and legs to prevent dry skin.  It works really well to keep your heels from getting dry.  I will definitely order more when I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li> Ever since I went to Morocco a few years ago, I have been obsessed and addicted to Argan Oil. I use it for everything (my hair, skin, nails). Nowadays, it seems that every product on the market claims to contain Argan Oil and more often than not probably doesn&#x27;t, so getting a bottle of InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Organic Moroccan Argan Oil was heaven sent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite it&#x27;s many benefits (there really is a lot), I like Argan Oil because of its high concentration of vitamin E and essential fatty acids that works great on my dry skin and helps make my hair stay soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the bottle I smelled the slight nutty scent that I expect of true, authentic Argan Oil. There is no way for me to know for sure, but that smell let me know that the bottle definitely contained the real oil. Although I wish I would have gotten the pump bottle, the dropper version still makes it a lot simpler for use with less mess and less waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were ever afraid to try Argan Oil, InstaNatural offers a LIFETIME 100% Satisfaction Money Back Guarantee, so it you&#x27;re not completely satisfied, you can return the bottle and get a full refund, but I know you won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> After trying many lotions &amp; creams for my child&#x27;s eczema, the Argan Oil started making a difference within hours.  After a few days of application, the skin was noticeably smoother, softer &amp; redness reduced.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this product if you are having problems finding something to soothe eczema!  Just make sure to do test areas on clear skin to rule out allergic reactions before putting on any affected areas, especially for children!</li>
            <li> I bought this argan oil months back when the company I guess was just starting out on amazon. There were no reviews but they did have the best presentation(Glass bottle with dropper and the wrapper didn&#x27;t look like a scam)so I took my chances. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with that decision. InstaNatural is by far the best company that I have come across selling argan oil. I have gone to a couple different health food stores and sampled many different brands of argan oil and compared to my bottle of InstaNatural no one is better to me. They are giving me the best price at about $23 a bottle for 4oz and there are usually sales on their oils. The oil is fresh with a very faint sweet natural aroma, a light golden color and the perfect consistency. As long as you don&#x27;t use too much it soaks in to your skin in about a minute and leaves it supple and smooth. If you look greasy you used too much, less is more with this stuff. I have really dry skin particularly my hands/feet and I&#x27;ve seen a lasting improvement in those areas. I use this oil all over my body as soon as i get out the shower when my skin is still damp and a bit in my hair and its working great. And after 4 months(February till now in June) of full  all over body use I still have about 20% of the bottle left.  This oil/company knows what they are doing, where else are you getting a 4oz GLASS bottle that is actually USDA certified for less than $24, look around amazon and go to the stores this is the best deal. And something I&#x27;ve noticed with other companies as they get more and more popular they raise their prices, I bought my oil in February when there were no reviews, now with over 300 reviews and a 5 star rating InstaNatural has kept their oil at the same reasonable price, usually less than $24 with occasional flash sales. Also the customer service is A+. They answer their email within the hour and are polite, understanding and helpful. I don&#x27;t care how good your product is if there is bad customer service I&#x27;m notbuying again. The people at InstaNatural are delivering wonderful high quality and fresh oils with fantastic customer service. I have 2 bottles and will for sure continue to order and recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have mid length hair (down to mid back) and live in southern ca. which can be very dry.  I mix approx 6 drops of the argan oil into my conditioner and it leaves it soft and conditioned.  sometimes i&#x27;ll put maybe 3 drops on the ends of my wet hair when i get out of the shower for a leave in treatment.  when used on just the ends i don&#x27;t notice any lingering greasiness (my ends are super dry so they absorb it).  if i put the oil anywhere else on my hair i do notice some greasiness. but as others have noted that just means a good leave in conditioning treatment and after the next wash my hair is silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also mix about half a dropperful into my lotion.  i&#x27;ve found this keeps my skin moisturized all day.  love it!</li>
            <li> The more I use this the more I love it! I use it on my face 2 times a day, after my shower and in the morning under my makeup, I also use it in my conditioner. My skin and hair have seen huge improvements! I love this product!</li>
            <li> Good quality, good price, but the oil has a strong smell, which I&#x27;m not crazy about.  The smell does dissipate as the oil is absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and great service. Would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Pure Argan oil is one amazing oil that is essential in my&lt;br /&gt;hair care regime. It gives the hair a slight shine and&lt;br /&gt;also soothes itchy scalp. Now what I recently discovered&lt;br /&gt;with this particular oil is that it is good on softening&lt;br /&gt;cuticles as well.  I am sure it has many more uses&lt;br /&gt;but I mainly use it for those two only as&lt;br /&gt;it works so well on my natural hair and hands.</li>
            <li> I was provided a sample to review of insta natural 100% pure Argan oil and was extremely pleased with the results.  This oil absorbs quickly and goes on so smoothly.  It really had no discernible smell, certainly nothing objectionable.  I take fish oil 2X per day and that smell can be hard to initially get use to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product for over a week and saw instant results.  My hair, which has gotten coarser over the past few years, has taken on a healthy sheen. I massage 2 drops into my scalp and then over the rest of my hair after my shower.  The results are instant and more importantly they last through the next washing, no matter how humid it is outside.  I have also massaged two drops into my skin before putting on makeup.  The oil dries fairly quickly and leaves your skin with a healthy glow.  Not oily, but smooth and translucent which makes my makeup much easier to apply.  I have not used this product on my nails as they are very strong due to the fish-oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisified with this product and would most definitely purchase other products from this company.  The packaging is very attractive and the 4oz bottle is much larger than expected, and should go a long way. It is certified organic which is also an important variable for me and impossible to find in other skin/body/hair products.</li>
            <li> As the first argan oil I&#x27;ve ever used despite all the hype, I&#x27;m pleasantly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself has a sort of sweet, earthy scent and is pale yellow/ brown in color. (I suppose a lot of people would find it unpleasant, but I really like it!) Being that it&#x27;s 100% pure argan oil, I was please to see that it&#x27;s true and nothing has been added to this product. Thus far, I&#x27;ve only used this product as a moisturizer for my hands and nails, but my plan is to eventually treat my hair with it. I have quite dry and damaged hair that could really benefit for argan oil, or so I&#x27;ve heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for using it on my hands and nails, I like it as I would any other. It seems to do a good job of moisturizing my hands (which get cracked). As it&#x27;s an oil, it doesn&#x27;t take much to go a pretty long way. A couple drops does just fine for my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the full review on: maegal . blogspot . com</li>
            <li> I have heard great things about Argan oil. I am, however, a skeptic about beauty products. Back when dinosaurs roamed the earth, I was a model. One of the first things you learn with modeling is that most cosmetic products are hyped far beyond their stated results. I am happy to say that this product is excellent! It does absorb readily into the skin. I used it on my face as well, and my skin really was noticeably softer. I highly recommend this product and will order again. Delivery was timely too.</li>
            <li> I had just finished another brand&#x27;s bottle of argan oil before I decided to try this brand because of the price for the size. I did not think there would be a huge difference in quality, but this bottle blew me away. The texture is so smooth and I look forward to putting this on my face and hair every night. There is a slight scent to it, but the smell fades after three seconds. I usually use a pump for my face and then use the leftover residue for my hair. This argan oil is so pure and smooth. You will not regret buying this.</li>
            <li> Nice oil for the skin, but it smells pretty odd.</li>
            <li> The oil comes in a four ounce dark glass bottle with a dropper attached inside the screw-on cap. I really love this packaging since it&#x27;s practical and sturdy. The dropper lets you dispense the product a few drops at a time, which is perfect, since a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s a myth that you can only use oils on very dry skin; as long as you&#x27;re only using a few drops, this oil will work well even on combo skin like mine and won&#x27;t turn you greasy or make you break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The argan oil has a light amber color and a very faint nutty scent. This works great for moisturizing the cuticles or for softening dry, rough patches of skin. It&#x27;s a slightly &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; oil, so it doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling super-slick. I also like using it on the ends of my hair, before applying a leave-in conditioner, to help tame any split ends or roughness. If you want a good makeup remover that won&#x27;t stink, sting or dry out the skin, try a few drops of this on a cotton pad before washing the face as usual. (Be careful around the eyes--anything stings once it&#x27;s in the eyes, natural or not.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this replaces a host of other less green products--hair masks, cuticle oils, etc.--and it&#x27;s a great price per ounce.</li>
            <li> Unlike so-called &amp;#34;Argan&amp;#34; oil that I&#x27;ve used in the past, this oil is odorless. I combine this Argan oil with rosehip oil along with a few drops of lavender essential oil to create my own night time moisturizer, which works great on my skin. 4oz is quite enough for making a variety of skin/hair DIY products!</li>
            <li> So this stuff is awesome! The first time I tried it my hair was extremely frizzy but I didn&#x27;t have time to wash my hair. So I put some in my hair and my frizz was almost gone even though it was a very humid day and I have very curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;After that I use this every time I was my hair. I rub the oil in before I brush and it makes my hair curlier, more manageable and practically no frizz. Now I no longer need to use leave in products or anti frizz cream. Looking forward to using this more!&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for a review.</li>
            <li> Nice product and a nice price.  I use this with my lotion every evening.  The picture shows a pump type but mine came with a dropper type cover.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a natural bottle of Argan Oil for the longest, and when I stumbled upon this product I found something GREAT. This oil has done wonders on my hair ever since the moment I received it. It has left my hair moisturized and soft. I have slept in it and it hasn&#x27;t been greasy like some oils nor has it smelled odd. I love it. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for a product that could better their hair, especially curly gals like me! I know this won&#x27;t be the last time I buy this Argan Oil, but I do know that it will be the only argan oil I buy from now on. Another plus, is that it isn&#x27;t expensive. I know this sells at around $16.00 but trust me when I say that for true natural argan oil this isn&#x27;t that bad. There are Argan Oils out in the market, similar to this product, that sell for much more for much less. This was such a good buy- I can&#x27;t emphasize  it enough!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever used argan oil, then you&#x27;d know this isn&#x27;t it. It smells expired and it just made my face break out. Please save yourself the trouble and don&#x27;t buy the cheap crap, buy Josie or something more legit.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is a joke. Seriously?&lt;br /&gt;It caused my entire face to break out like crazy like hives.&lt;br /&gt;I had to stop it and and took anti histamine and it went away 2 days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this argan oil.</li>
            <li> I am a bit picky with anything I put in or on my body. After doing long research over several other products I came across this and I absolutely love it. In fact I loves it so much I ordered it twice in a month. I use it for my hair, nails, and body. I will be a returning customer.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful. I use it on my face every night and in my hair. It really helps make my hair smooth and helps brighten your complexion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of how this product smells, therefore, I don&#x27;t use it often. A little goes a long way and I would be very careful putting it into your hair unless you are planning a deep oil treatment and then washing it out. I doubt I will be buying again but I plan to give it a chance.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic Argan OIl,  I actually looked at so many and researched before I bought this one.  Not only organic but this company impressed me.  Their pricing on this was below all others I looked at and am truly impressed with the product. I love it as it has many uses. Use as a moisturizer on my face, mix with other oils as a carrier oil and on and on. I will be buying more and I would suggest that you check out their web site and find out what else they have and just see how this smaller company will soon be among the favourite ones on Amazon!!!  6 stars on this one!</li>
            <li> I use Argan Oil on my face every night,  The oil is quickly absorb into the skin and softens the winkles.  I also apply it to arm and legs to fight dryness.  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> Good for everything. One of my favorite oils for hair and area around eyes. Preferably store in really cool place, but not in refrigerator.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and packed well. Quality product and excellent value!  Would definatley buy here again!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I love it.  It absorbs readily and my skin feels soft and moist. Thank you, LC</li>
            <li> I never had a problem with any argan oils before, but this one is extremely drying. My skin became more dry from using it and my hair also looked dry after using this product. I do not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and Argan oil helps me.that oil makes my skin healthier .I like it very much!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the product for long.. but can comment that the service was very responsive to rectify a minor problem.</li>
            <li> This is 100% argan oil and it has very strong nutty smell to it. I bought this argan oil to make my damaged hair healthier. When you apply the oil to your hair, you can smell the strong nutty scent. But after some seconds it will be gone! It gets absorbed quickly to your skin and hair because it doesnt make your hands oily after applying it to your hair. This makes your hair smoother and healthy looking. Like other oil treatments make sure not to pour it onto your hair. I usually apply little bit at the bottom of your hair then with whatever left in my palm I use it where my hair is dry. I am glad I bought this product!! Totally worth my money and also great customer service!</li>
            <li> The product did work but not like I wanted it to. I liked how it did contain some frizz but it left my hair oily.</li>
            <li> I have been using argan oil for a while now, I am have tried some of the brands. I really liked the expensive one, the famous one, HOWEVER, I ordered this based on the reviews and I AM SO GLAD THAT  I DID. This is a great oil, right color, right smell and it is a great big bottle. I use it all over, and it is the only body and hand moisturizer that does not make me itch.  I recommend this product to every one. Great product and a great value for your money. Thank you</li>
            <li> InstaNatural Argan Oil is such a great product! Since it works all over the body, it has allowed me to reduce clutter in my cabinets and saves me time since I only need to use one product for multiple benefits. It does a great job of smoothing my hair, leaving it soft and shiny (Only use the recommended amount on the bottle. Any more will weigh down the hair) and leaves my skin feeling moisturized. I have severely chapped lips, and InstaNatural is the only product that I have found that keeps them hydrated. Since you only need a few drops each day, this stuff lasts a long time, making it an excellent value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a complimentary bottle for the purpose of a review, however, I was under no obligation to post an Amazon review of it. I just believe in the product enough that I want everyone to share in its benefits.</li>
            <li> Meaning...it&#x27;s very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair weighed down at all.  I have very fine hair and that was what I was worried about. I use about three drops and rub in into my ends.  The remainder goes right on my skin and rubbed into my nails! You&#x27;re really getting a 3-in-1 product when you think about it - for skin, nails, and hair! I love that it&#x27;s cruelty free and organic.  I also love that this bottle is going to go a long long way when you figure you only use 2-3 drops at a time.  It absorbs quickly and you&#x27;re not left feeling greasy at all! This is really saving my hair &amp; skin from the Winter!! I was happy to have received this product for review purposes and I&#x27;m happy to share my honest opinion of it with people! I will definitely be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I love the expensive jm argan oil. So thought I would try this since its cheaper, nice big size for the price, only usedmonce so far. it goes on same as jm brand not greasy however it does have a lite order/not bad. I still prefer the expensive brand but will use this too.</li>
            <li> This is the kind you want, with Argania Spinosa. It is less greasy than my last argan, which I also liked. This one absorbs into the skin quicker. I like it for my hair as well. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> The only way I know where to use Argan Oil is for the hair. I&#x27;ve only tried using it on my hair so I was surprised that it can be used on the hands, nails, face, arms and legs as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s true that when using Argan Oil, a little goes a long way. When I first used an Argan Oil years ago, I didn&#x27;t believe the instructions to just put a small amount on the palms and massage it into the hair. I mean, I have long, thick hair so how can a small amount be enough for all my hair right? WRONG. I pumped about 3 pumps of the Argan Oil and BOOM! I look like I didn&#x27;t take a bath for years. My hair was so oily and flat and looked damp that I had to take a shower again. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with the InstaNatural 100% Argan Oil, I followed the directions carefully and since I have short hair now, I only used 2 drops of the Argan Oil. I liked the effect since my hair looked shiny and a bit tamed afterwards. The dropper is a plus since I can control the amount more than when using a pump or the pour method. I also like the effect on my face. At first, I was hesitant since my face is naturally oily, WHY WOULD I PUT OIL ON MY FACE? But I tried it just for the sake of saying I tried it as a moisturizer as well on my face. Well, I was surprised AGAIN because it was absorbed quickly and my face didn&#x27;t look oily at all. I loved it. :) Plus, it worked well on my elbows and knees since these are my &amp;#34;problem areas&amp;#34;. It made my elbows and knees softer and smoother in just one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it on my nails and hands and was glad that my nails appeared better after rubbing the Argan Oil on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how the InstaNatural 100% Argan Oil serves as a multi-purpose beauty product. The bigger bottle is a plus since a lot of serums/oils I&#x27;ve tried are way smaller than this. :)</li>
            <li> I was planning to use this for my hair as a treatment and still will but I just have to leave a review and say how impressed I am already. I have some dry elbows from the winter dryness and when I first opened the argan oil to smell it and check it out, I rubbed a couple drops on each elbow and I swear this is the best product for dry skin. It&#x27;s not greasy or slippery. It soaked right in and left my elbows feeling silky smooth. I also want to comment on the smell or lack of. I expected it to have a strong smell and it doesn&#x27;t I&#x27;m not sure what to call it but it has a really, really light woody smell that is really neutral. I appreciate that because most hair and body products are super strong and I can be real sensitive to some smells.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is all over the place these days. Apparently it&#x27;s a miracle solution to all your hair, skin, nail, and grooming problems? It should be, given that it&#x27;s about the same price by weight as copper. I have tried it with wet hair before styling, with dry hair after styling and I think it works moderately better than the Bain De Terre hair serum I have been using for several years. It spreads out better, but can leave you looking like Courtney Love after a 10 day bender if you use too much. I also tried it on my face as directed. It did seem to make my skin feel hydrated a lot longer than lotion, but I also had some breakouts soon after. I can&#x27;t say for sure if they were related, though. I have been putting it on my nails after I peeled off my latest gel mani (I know, major no-no) and basically destroyed my nail beds. They are peeling and cracking like the earth after an apocalyptic meteor strike, but I still don&#x27;t blame the Argan oil. I will keep using it and see if I see better results over time.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite what was expecting, but then I&#x27;m used to the organix version. It doesn&#x27;t have any scent, so I added a few drops of rose oil. It&#x27;s a good oil for my skin, but too oily for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this amazing product.  I use it as a moisturizer for my face and body and on my hair.  I&#x27;m 70 and older hair and skin need this special treatment.  Its made a huge difference in the condition of both. There&#x27;s nothing like it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the quality of the oil and the quality of the container too, easy to use pump is a nice touch. I find good oils last longer when packaged in glass and a few drops after a shower is all you need. Oils packaged in plastic get yucky fast, this is much nicer.</li>
            <li> I love this dry feeling oil. I know that I am putting a chemical free product on my skin and don&#x27;t have to worry about my sensitivity to chemicals. I use it on my face, body, hands and hair. My manicurist asked me what I was using as my nails were getting stronger. I highly recommend this brand of Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I just received my Argan Oil and I LOVE IT!!! I love this brand! I use it with the Rose Hip Oil. My face, skin and hair are in Heaven!&lt;br /&gt;I am 52 years old and everybody thinks I am in my early Thirties.  I am buying this along with the Rose Hip Oil and giving them to my friends as Christmas presents.</li>
            <li> I love this argan oil. It has no smell and works well as a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s makes my skin and hair feel amazing,</li>
            <li> This is a great product; it feels so nice on my skin, it&#x27;s light and smells fantastic.  My hair feels like silk and not all weighed down.  I for sure will continue using it.</li>
            <li> The price was right for this organic argan oil.  I use it as a supplement to my creams and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> bad boxing and shipping it came broken and ruined other items with it , on star is more than a lot..</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff!!! My hair is long and wavy and it makes the waves just pop! My hair is softer than ever. I also use this on my daughters hair.She back of her hair is a little tangled as that&#x27;s how she sleeps, and I put just a little bit on her hair and her curls come out. It softens the back of her hair as well. Also my husband&#x27;s grandmotherused.It on her hair. My mother uses it on her nails. This product is amazeballs. It&#x27;s the best $17 I&#x27;ve ever spent!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Argan oil for a few years. I use it for my hair and skin when I need extra moisturizing. When I first tried it, I had a sample from an expensive designer brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Argan oil is just as nice and so much less expensive. It&#x27;s also certified Organic, which is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and recommended.</li>
            <li> I am a balding man and I can assure you that this oil restored the health of my hair from years of chemical damage and stress. I think this might be a miracle potion. LOL.. In all seriousness, this is worth every penny. New hairs are starting to grow in also.</li>
            <li> Performs exactly as described. Love this product. I use it in my hair to moisturizer. I have fine thin hair and put a little bit in my palms and rub it together then into my hair. It doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down but instead controls flyways and makes my hair shiny. I also use it on my lips at night. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I have to say this oil is fantastic. I have extremely dry skin and during Chicago winters I used to apply 2-3 moisturizers at a time and my face still got very dry. Since I started using this oil (morning and night), my skin has been radiant and beautiful. The dryness is gone. My skin tone is even and my face just looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I love InstaNatural &amp; I love Argan Oil so when InstaNatural sent me their Argan Oil to review for me GlamRiver blog I was SUPER HAPPY!  Argan Oil is one of my favorite oils.  I use it on EVERYTHING!  It works great on every skin type, I have oily skin and I like to put it on my face, decollete and shoulders at night at wake up in the a.m. with super soft, hydrated and smooth feeling skin!  I also use it on the ends of my hair to prevent damage and help with flyaways.  If I could afford it I would put it all over my body everyday, that is how much I like this stuff!! :)</li>
            <li> instanatural 100% Pure Argan Oilis a multipurpose, and it works on my skin and nails - where I really need it because my cuticles are messy. It gives my nails a natural healthy shine and it&#x27;s improving the health of those ragged cuticles I mentioned. I use it after I wash my hands, with no oily finish. I always read the reviews on products that I try to find out what kinds of things I should look for, both good and bad. This is odorless, absorbs into my skin immediately leaving it with a natural glow, and it makes my hands look so much better. Over time my skin just feels and looks healthier.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face in the morning and it feels GREAT. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair or nails, as I don&#x27;t feel the need. But my again facial skin plumps up with this and I feel it is nurturing my skin. I rest assured knowing it is 100% pure and organic.&lt;br /&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit &amp; Planet&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;Beyond Broccoli, Creating a Biologically Balanced Diet When a Vegetarian Diet Doesn&#x27;t Work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few organic Argan oils, and so far I&#x27;m really impressed with this one.  My hair seems more shiny (not greasy), lasts in my hair longer as I usually need to reapply after day 2 or 3 as my ends look dry again.  The curls last longer and are bouncier and just overall looks more healthy.  I got the larger bottle with the &amp;#34;squirt&amp;#34; dispenser and I like that much better than the dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it a bit on my face as well, nothing dramatic, but nicely absorbed and soft.  Also, seems to make my nail cuticles happier as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase this brand again, and would recommend it too!</li>
            <li> Not to happy with this product, I&#x27;ve tried over the counter versions of Argan Oil but I was looking for 100% Argan Oil to get more benefits out of it.  The over the counter versions have worked better than this product, I use it mainly for my hair and as I recently cut it I wanted something more natural to nourish it.  My hair always ends up super greasy and the oil acts as some kind of holding product (like spray) leaving my hair just like a mess. I&#x27;ve tried 3 drops and it was too much, 2 drops still too much, 2 drops only on the ends it doesn&#x27;t work, 1 drop and still my hair ends the same way OILY AND GREASY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to use it on my arms instead and although it absorbs quickly, it doesn&#x27;t nourish my skin either. (I&#x27;ve used it for the past 3 weeks).  Maybe I got a bad batch or I&#x27;m not using it correctly but now I&#x27;m just stuck with 4 oz of something I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> Yes quite satisfied. It&#x27;s a superior product to others I&#x27;ve tried in the past. Hair and scalp health improved noticeably the first week. The IN face serum will also be a re-buy product. Appreciate the instructional information sent email post order too. Excellent customer service/ care.</li>
            <li> For years I have had perpetual acne on my chin. The hard, cystic kind. I never had acne as a teenage and it seemed so unfair to be fighting wrinkles and pimples at the same time. But on any given day, I had at least one &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; blemish coming in and one &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; one finally shrinking away. Anyway, I have tried oral antibiotics (doxycycline and erythromycin) which helped some but have side effects. I&#x27;ve had chemical peels and laser treatments. I have had some success with a Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s acne product, too. But NOTHING made it go completely away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was ready to start Accutane. For those of you unfamiliar with what that entails, let me tell you: monthly Dermatologist visits, monthly blood work, proof of 2 forms of birth control (despite being over forty, married, and husband having vasectomy), and THOUSANDS of dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I postponed my Derm appointment and gave this product a try after seeing something on Pinterest. It is WONDERFUL. My skin has not looked this good for years. I am so happy. I am also much better off financially and have more free time b/c I am not running to the Dermatologist every month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little greasy as you might guess. It is, after all, an oil. However, it is not as greasy as you&#x27;d think. If I have plenty of time before I am going out, I can actually wear this before applying makeup. If I am in a hurry and need to rush out, I skip it until end of day. But, it soaks in faster than you&#x27;d think. It leaves your skin as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure what to say about its effect on wrinkles but I do think my skin looks &amp;#34;plumper&amp;#34;. The turgor and texture are definitely better. If you are looking for something to change fine lines... I can&#x27;t comment on this b/c I haven&#x27;t really paid attention to this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I don&#x27;t use this on my hair, but I suspect it is great for hair. I think this b/c of a little unpleasant (but acceptable) side effect from daily use. I&#x27;ve notice that my facial hair seems to be growing faster. I am blonde and what I am talking about is that soft, fine, almost translucent facial hair that you get. Not like a burly mustache or anything. I used get a facial threading about every 3-4 months (maybe less frequent...) and it seems like I want to get it done more frequently now. Which recently led me to increase use of the product around my sparse eyebrows. We&#x27;ll see if it helps. But, if you are hoping to thicken your hair, this may help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price for a product that will last at least 2 months if used properly, it is worth a try if you are suffering from acne.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Great on hair and body. 100% pure. Not greasy and no smell after applying. Highly recommended. Super impressed to get an email from the company asking if I liked it and if they could help me in any way, while also supplying a list of recommended uses. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It amazes me that an oil can soak in so fast and even be reapplied&lt;br /&gt;and still it soaks in.  I even put it over serum c and it makes my&lt;br /&gt;skin even softer.  I use it as a body lotion too.  It is the best.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and wonderful service.  I&#x27;ve used it on hair, face and nails.  Didn&#x27;t like it on hair so much but face and nails have been great. Because I have fine hair, it seemed to weigh it down, even after shampooing. I bought it for nice skin.  I saw a show on TV that said that French woman use this to avoid plastic surgery.  Time will tell.  :)</li>
            <li> 5 stars because is a light oil. Smooth with a pleasant mild scent of nature. It is well absorbed not living any trace of greasy sensation.&lt;br /&gt;I only treat my skin with virgin oils and this one is fabulous. I use it in my son&#x27;s skin too. I do not know how effective it is to sooth scars, ( he has a cat scratch scar on his cheek) but it will certainly benefit his skin from it, regardless.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product and company. The oil is high quality and a much better price than similar products I&#x27;ve seen in the store. I have been using it on my face and fingernails and loving the results--moisturizes really well but doesn&#x27;t clog pores or make my skin feel greasy. The company seems great too, they emailed just to touch base and be sure I received my order and was happy. Will order from them again when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used Argan oil before but after watching several youtube videos recommend the product I decided to give it a try. I was hesitant to use it on my face because I didn&#x27;t want to look like a grease ball but I was surprised at how the product is just absorbed by my skin and leaves a dewy look. I tried it on my hair too and am very impressed with it. I&#x27;m very happy with this particular brand.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I hoped it would be.  Bigger container than I anticipated, so that&#x27;s a good thing.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. It is not greasy, I don&#x27;t break out and I see a positive difference in my skin.  This is my 2nd bottle. Delivery was perfect.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this oil at first because 4 fl oz of argan oil at $25 (sale, $50 retail) is suspicious, I haven&#x27;t used argan oil before but I have done my research. I ordered it anyway because I wanted an organic leave in conditioning oil for my waist length-baby fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works SO WELL! It leaves my hair shiny, manageable and soft. I&#x27;ve now mixed it in with my Burt&#x27;s Bees body wash, shampoo and conditioner, and my facial moisturizer. I only use about 3 drops in my hair after a shower and it has helped so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is a clear light canary yellow, and it definitely has an oily consistency, but it isn&#x27;t heavy. It smells nice to me, kind of a musky earthy nutty smell, like a walk in the woods, but if you find the odor offensive, it&#x27;s gone in about 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty sure this is the real deal, will be purchasing again, IF I RUN OUT! :)</li>
            <li> This feels fantastic. It moisturizes without clogging pores! I love it!! I use it as my night time face moisturizer!</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft and smooth.  I have oily skin and this does not cause acne, it actually cures me from breakouts.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money. No results. It is like overpriced water. It did not help hair or dry skin. It may have been just for me, or my expectations were too high. I wish I had not wasted that much money. The stars are only because the seller was a great communicator, but not for product...at all.</li>
            <li> I like that it is organic. I feel that it is as good as the more expensive Argon from the beauty supplies. I would definitely buy&lt;br /&gt;this product again.</li>
            <li> A lot healthier to moisturize as it is all natural.  Definitely  recommend.  Great for face, hair and nails.  Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product so far. I use it on my skin daily and really like the effects. It is not oily and moisturizes well. This bottle will last forever because you need very little.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job of nourishing and rejuvenating the skin...evens out skin tone and texture. I use it on hair and face.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this oil.  I have eczema on my scalp, and it is dry, itchy and uncomfortable. No matter how much I shampoo and condition my hair, I still have sores and scabs on my scalp. It can be quite embarrassing at times, and it can look like I just have really bad dandruff, or give the impression that I don&#x27;t take care of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing has really helped, and of course everyone has helpful advice of what to try. I have tried it all, but until just recently, I had not tried this Argan Oil. And am I ever glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results have been fantastic! The number of sores have lessened, and my scalp itself is not as dry, not so itchy and is really more moisturized than it has been for quite sometime.  My hair also noticeably shinier and healthier than before I started using the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used the oil on my nails and cuticles, and they have grown longer and stronger.&lt;br /&gt;This Moroccan Argan Oil is working, does what it says and I would highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other quick thing that I LOVE about Moroccan Argan Oil...&lt;br /&gt;The seller really believes in their product and offers a lifetime 100% money back guarantee. What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t bother repeating what so many others have said about this oil, I&#x27;ll just say all of the positive comments others have offered are accurate!  Just a tiny amount of the oil is amazing at softening cuticles and making color-treated hair feel soft and &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;.  If you&#x27;re considering buying it, just do it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> Moisturizes well without feeling greasy. Surprised at how big the bottle is! Would buy again!, though since they&#x27;re so generous with the amount, it&#x27;ll be a while</li>
            <li> Been using it for my hair and face. This argan oil is wonderful. My face and hair are loving it.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is amazing. You can use it on your face, hair, lips, declotte, cuticles, anywhere you want to be softer. It is an incredible moisturizer. This is the pure, organic, all-natural, real deal. Try it. You will so love it.</li>
            <li> Love this oil! I use it alone on my hair and it makes it silky smooth. You don&#x27;t need a lot just a couple of drops spread in your palms and work in your hair. I also will use it as a deep conditioner I cover my hair with the argon oil mixed with a couple of drops of peppermint oil before I work out (at home) it feels amazing from my scalp down after I wash it out! I also mix it with rosehip oil and use it on my face. It makes my skin so smooth and soft! This is a great vendor and a real value, will order from them again!!!</li>
            <li> This oil is great and about a quarter of the price I usually pay!  I will be buying only from here in the future and recommending it to my friends.</li>
            <li> This multipurpose moisturizer oil 100% pure and certified organic virgin cold-pressed argan oil can be use for softening hair/repairing/conditioning, glowing skin, and stronger nails.  The bottle says other uses for acne treatment.  This moisturizer is oily.  My wife uses it at night for her hands and feet.  Notice smoother, softer hands and feet.  Also her nails seems shinier and stronger.  This is a high quality pure argan oil.</li>
            <li> Like it very much. Will purchase again. I have waist length curly hair, make combing it out after a wash much easier and my hair is very soft.</li>
            <li> Like a lot.  Really like the pump bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this one as much as the Pura D&#x27;or that I used to use.  About 1/3 way through I started noticing an unpleasant smell.  I&#x27;m still able to use it, but I&#x27;m kinda waiting for it to run out so I can go back to the old kind.  The oil quality itself is fine though.  It is good for your skin.  I&#x27;m able to get rid of my moisturizer altogether.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it all when it comes to acne care, and this product is the only thing that comes close to clearing up my skin. I use it as a facial moisturizer and it has done wonders! I also use it on my hair. I will definately be purchasing another bottle!</li>
            <li> I have used argon oil before too but this one is more better than previous.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it on my hair and face and body. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t smell great, but I&#x27;m happy that it has no artificial scent either.</li>
            <li> After a few purchases of &#x27;argan&#x27; oil, only to find they were &#x27;blends&#x27; or somethign other than argan oil, I was pleasently surprised ot not only get this with a coupon but also to get genuine argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;I use this not only on myself but I also have a bottle on hand for my foster dogs with dry skin problems, in particular a papillon with allergies and an older chihuahua.&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my hands especially the nail beds, and on my hair/scalp.  My daughter also uses it for her psoriasis on her feet/legs and this really really helps with the dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;I also use this on my face when I feel the need but only after using a hyaluronic acid gel/serum since this combo really seems to help with absorption of this.&lt;br /&gt;This has a slight nutty scent, for those saying it &#x27;stinks&#x27;, if you are comparing it to the over processed and odorless (or altered aroma) products, you aren&#x27;t using real argan oil anyway - this is what it should smell like, and the color, absorption is spot on.</li>
            <li> I use this for my hair sometimes but I use it on my face every day morning and evening under my moisturizer. You could use it as a moisturizer too if you wanted. Good quality. Just be careful where you put it. This is the third bottle that fell and broke of argan oil I have.</li>
            <li> I mainly use this stuff for my hair and it feels great! Never thought argan oil could make a difference because i have really course hair but when i tried this for the first time i was in shock. Made my hair shinier and smoother. Looks like i&#x27;ll be ordering from these guys for a while Love this product and it&#x27;s totally legit! I got some argan oil off a website and the oil was runny and felt like water. This stuff is great and does the job!</li>
            <li> I recently came across a blog posting which praised argan oil as a wonderful skin moisturizer, particularly for your face. As someone with a combination skin type, I can go from having a very oily face to a very dry face depending on the weather and my diet, and I had been looking for something that I could use as a moisturizer that would help keep my face consistently moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having made the decision to give argan oil a shot, I searched around and found that InstaNatural&#x27;s argan oil was the best bang for my buck in terms of price, quantity and quality. It&#x27;s been a few weeks since I have received my order and I am very happy to report that I am loving it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first glance / feel, I was apprehensive to apply it my face as it is somewhat thick and oily. Based on the two drops in the palm of my hand, I thought to myself that there was no way I was going to put that on my face as I would look like an oily mess. That said, I&#x27;m always up for a challenge, so I rubbed my hands together and applied the oil to my face. My immediate reaction was to say out loud, &amp;#34;No way! Not for me.&amp;#34;  It felt way too heavy and oily to be used a facial moisturizer and I figured I&#x27;d return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, about five to ten minutes later, it had completely absorbed into my skin and I couldn&#x27;t even tell that I had put anything on my face. My skin wasn&#x27;t greasy at all. In fact, it was the complete opposite; even-toned, extremely soft and hydrated. I&#x27;ve been using it every day since and, again, I really love it. I will absolutely be reordering this again from InstaNatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great customer service, top notch!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the very expensive brands so not sure what the difference is. This is comparable to the NOW Foods oil, they have the same smell and texture. I use it every day and night and my skin feels smooth and not oily at all.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is extracted form the kernel that comes from the Argan tree that is found in Morocco. It has so many benefits in it&#x27;s natural form for the body to even using it in foods. I have used Argan oil for many years now for my hair because I use a Keratin process to straighten it. I have thick long Latina hair and I avoid using products that weigh my hair down making it look greasy, stiff or dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair goes through a lot - from chemical straightening, to coloring and high temperature appliances such as blow dryers and flat irons. Argan oil protects my hair before using heating appliances and then locks in the look after. Rich in Omega 3 and 9 which helps to prevent hair loss and repairs damaged hair follicles. Absorbs quickly into your hair without weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply to wet hair just before blow drying to eliminate friction and prevent hair breakage, or apply to curly hair to give it a polished look that will last all day long. Protects, adds moisture and shine...naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty impressed on the size of this bottle, it is quite large for the asking price. It comes with an eye dropper which is a nice touch since most other brands you have to pour it out and you tend to pour out too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great comment I must mention is that the odor disappears after a few minutes of application. I don&#x27;t understand how but I love it! This is 100% Argan oil with no perfumes. If you know your Argan oil you know they are not pleasant smelling unless the have perfumes added. However, after rubbing this into my hair, the odor &amp;#34;magically&amp;#34; disappears and I am felt with no harsh smelling scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter if your hair is thick, dry, frizzy, thick, curly, or just out of control - Argan oil will help. Do some online searches for the many uses of Argan oil. Besides using it &amp;#34;as is&amp;#34; from the bottle, you can use it as a hot oil treatment, skin moisturizer, dry scalp and eczema treatment, treat dry hands and cuticles, treats mild acne since it has Oleic acid, use it to grill vegetables, add some lemon and use as salad dressing. The list can go on and on....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product sample.and cuticles, treats mild acne since it has Oleic acid, use it to grill vegetables, add some lemon and use as salad dressing.

            <li> Really like this so far.  My hair feels a lot better since I have been using it.  I like the way it feels on my face.  It absorbs quickly and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I received the Organic Argan oil on the estimated date.  Well packed.  I use this oil on face and hair, I love it.  I would recommended.</li>
            <li> great ,very happy with product</li>
            <li> My hair and nails love this stuff! Nails were strong and longer than ever.</li>
            <li> Love it. Exactly what expected.</li>
            <li> I love this product and compared to the other name brand stuff this will save you hundreds. I use it on my skin and hair...On my skin as a night time moisturizer and a leave in conditioner take the frizz right out and you just need a tiny bit for the hair and face....</li>
            <li> I love how soft and radiant my skin looks using this product for just two weeks.  It never feels dry and not oily either.  Just great!</li>
            <li> I started tow days ago and followed the instruction to apply on my face. so far so good !</li>
            <li> The only reason I brought this was because it is advertised with a pump top and I figured it would be more convenient. The pump top, however, IS TOO SMALL TO FIT THE BOTTLE. WHY WOULD ANYONE SELL THIS ALONG WITH A PUMP TOP THAT DOES NOT FIT?! It doesn&#x27;t matter how good the product is if the outside IS CHEAP-LOOKING. I would definitely not repurchase as it looks very cheap and the expiration date is no where to be found. SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING THAT ADVERTISES HONESTLY!!!! NEVER BUYING FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Seen the same oil in other places for much more. After reviewing the ingridients and making some research, is absolutely the same. If you use this type of oil, you&#x27;ll save $$$$ getting this one.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful Organic Argan Oil for Hair, Face, and Skin.  My hair, face, and body just drinks in the Argan Oil and makes my wrinkles less obvious and my skin feeling moist without feeling greasy.  I use it on my eyelashes and eyebrows to keep them growing and healthy as well.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> I love this argon oil from InstaNatural. My skin felt different the first time I used it! It leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturised, but not greasy. It is the first Argon oil I have used, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands, but I can say that InstaNatural has been just as great as the product they offer. They go above and beyond making sure you are 100% satisfied, plus they have the best prices!</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff. It&#x27;s the best skin conditioner you can find and at an amazing price.</li>
            <li> I used argan oil before but it&#x27;s too expensive to keep buying it from sephora so I switched. Thought this one would be the same but It is not. It broke me out too bad that I have to stop using after couple days. I tried it on my hair but the effect is not really noticeable. It may be good, just not for me.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a large, less expensive bottle of organic argan oil to use on my face and hair, and also on my children&#x27;s hair. This was exactly what I was looking for. First, the bottle is huge. This will last me surely through the entire next year (I have 22 inch long hair and use on face daily). The packaging is nice, the oil works exactly like my 43.00 a bottle Morroccan oil. The only reason I took off one star was because the smell really is ghastly. I was expecting a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; smell but this just smells off. I can&#x27;t put my finger on what it smells like, but I don&#x27;t like it. However, the smell, while bad, is pretty faint and disapears after application so I can definitely live with it. Would buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> This is the first argan oil I&#x27;ve ever used, and I love it.  The seller sent wonderful emails before and after delivery, and the product is great for my hair and my son&#x27;s skin after a bath.  I will buy again - especially since the customer service is so fabulous.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this oil. There is a little odor, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because it is natural. I use it on my hands, especially my cuticles. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I received a bottle to review. I&#x27;ve never tried oils for hair care. I use oils all the time in my lip and skin care products and knew of their amazing ability to help heal and keep things soft. I was nervous after reading reviews about the smell it would have and honestly I have to stick my nose right in it to get the little funk that it does have. The smell was not at all as bad as I was expecting. As for using it in my hair. It makes your hair feel incredibly smooth. It doesn&#x27;t take much at all. My hair is super soft, smooth and feels better than ever! Not to mention my scalp is MUCH less flaky than it&#x27;s ever been. I did also try it on my dry scratchy elbows which I get with the hot dry summers, just a few drops in my palm and rub in and my elbows are well on their way to being normal again. After trying this stuff, it is now a staple in my skin care products. It works really well and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I received it quickly (in two days), and started using it right away. I love how soft my face feels long after application (my skin is usually pretty dry - especially in the winter!). It absorbs so fast - I can put on my makeup without having to wait. It&#x27;s the only moisturizer I use now and it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts! All pros to this product - can&#x27;t think of a single reason not to recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Very nice argan oil. I also really love the pump as compared to the dropper that comes with some other brands. Absorbs quickly. Exfoliate your skin thoroughly and use argan oil once a day after bathing/showering, and you can have crazy soft skin. I primarily use this on my arms, so I cannot say how it works on one&#x27;s face. Really wish I&#x27;d discovered this kind of oil sooner, but better late than never. Also, this company has great customer service and has very good pricing compared to some other brands out there.</li>
            <li> Good argan oil and Amazing customer service.!</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great on my hair and skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good luck with this argan oil.  It does work well, and it has definitely helped with my dry skin, but it hasn&#x27;t been a miracle product for me (yet).  I will definitely continue using it and likely order again when I finish this bottle.  I have no complaints, but feel the need to alert you to the fact it does have a &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; scent.  Someone on here compared it to a cloth bandage; I don&#x27;t see that at all.  I think it smells more like a nut brown porter.  But the scent does fade very quickly.  Big benefit:  this oil is considered a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; oil, so it&#x27;s not greasy at all and absorbs really fast.  Overall I recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after using an expensive brand that came in a tiny bottle.  This 4oz.bottle is a real value and seems to have the same results.</li>
            <li> Great purchase.  I love this 100% pure Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I mix this with whipped Argan Oil and you can wear during the day.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  Makes my skin feel silky smooth and I swear I have fewer fine lines on my face because of it!</li>
            <li> I did use it on my face and noticed that it made me break out a bit.  I have to be careful, but for deep moisturizing for my hair - it&#x27;s fantastic.  I mix it with my existing conditioner and let it sit for a minimum 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any difference but I will check back in a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Nice product not too greasy. I use it on my face, neck and hands. It does helps prevent break outs which I sometimes experience. I will definitely buy again.  It&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> I already wrote a review......here it is again.  I like it, it&#x27;s great stuff.  I use it on my frizzy hair to calm it down, it works great for that.  Also I like the fact that it is unscented.</li>
            <li> Great Product!!! My wife loves it!!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin beautiful,glowing,smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I ordered it when the weather was still warm.  Now that Dec is almost here and the air is very dry, I have been using the product on my skin and hair.  It is easily absorbed without leaving my skin greasy and my skin remains  hydrated even after light washing.  I will likely purchase more of this product as the winter is long.  I highly recommend this product to others as it is effective and affordable. This is a must have product.</li>
            <li> Working as expected so far.  It seems much thinner than a previous brand of argan oil I have used...not sure why it&#x27;s so much thinner.    Update (11/8/14):  I have been using this argan oil for quite some time now.  I use it every morning on my face prior to putting on my makeup.  I use it every night after my bath to moisturize my hands, cuticles, and face.  It absorbs very well and doesn&#x27;t leave a very oily residue.  My face is not breaking out and feels very silky after using this argan oil.  At first, I was worried, as it seems much thinner than another brand I&#x27;ve tried.  However, I am pleased with this product so far and I intend to purchase it again when I run out.  I do find, as others did, that the bottle (sprayer) seems to seep/leak after use and it can get messy.  Other than that, I am pleased!</li>
            <li> Since I first started using it about a month ago, my cuticles and nails are looking so much better. They are not splitting or peeling like the were before. I have also started trying it on my feet.  My toenails and heals have always been a problem because I have dry skin, but even more so since we moved to Arizona.  I love that this product is organic and therefore good for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she has not been able to use it long enough to warrant a 5 star rating just yet but does like the feel and quick absorption--makes her skin soft and helped control frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;It came in a timely manner. There are so many other oils out there but the price and reviews helped us make the decision to order so we will most likely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Great value, great product. It&#x27;s nice that it comes in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this after we saw a similar sized bottle with similar claims selling on HSN or QVC for over $100. Actually that was weeks ago. I don&#x27;t really follow up with my wife as it pertains to her health/beauty buys, but yesterday, she pinned me down (literally) and forcefully &#x27;repaired&#x27; the cuticle of my left index finger, and used the Argan oil to moisturize it. By the time I wrestled myself away from her, she had finished the one finger, but I wasn&#x27;t about to sit there and let her do NINE MORE. Are you kidding me? But today, 24/hrs later, that one lonely finger (I&#x27;m not using it to type this, that&#x27;s how amazing it looks) is noticeably more moisturized and probably smarter than the others.</li>
            <li> I am 38, this oil makes my skin feel like I am 20 again. I love it. It immediately soaks into your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue. Very happy with this purchase. Great price for the product too.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of skin issues.  Extremely dry and itchy skin.  This oil is the best thing I have used and I never want to be without it.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. Keeps my hair smooth &amp; healthy feeling</li>
            <li> I really like this Argan oil.  Not only is it organic, but it is a great price.  Packaging is good, smell is not strong at all.  Really makes my skin feel soft.  Ordering process was easy and received order quickly.</li>
            <li> Argan oil supposedly has many benifits and so I use this to make DIY products for my family. InstaNatural is a company that I trust to offer real 100%  Argan oil and not a blend of inferior oils with Argan mixed in. When mixed with essential oils, it makes for a wonderful potion that my skin drinks up. I have not used it in my hair, as it would probably weigh my hair down. There is hardly any fragrance at all and I will repurchase when the bottle is empty. A little goes a very long way, so I expect it to last for a long time. Great price for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Argan Oil. I never really thought oil would work for me since my skin is so oily but I have heard so much about Argan Oil I thought I would give it a try. I&#x27;m not used to spending a lot on facial products but the bottle is 4oz which really is huge, especially since you only need to use a couple of drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this on my face, hair and body. I have very oily, sensitive skin and this was very gentle on my face, absorbed quickly, and worked great as a facial moisturizer. I rub a few drops on my hair after a shower and it helps with the frizz. I have also applied on my hair before a shower and that left my hair really soft. I add in a couple of drops on essential oil (for scent) with a few drops of the oil and use on damp skin after a shower and I loved that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of people have complained about the smell, and it does have an earthy smell, but to me that just means that this is a pure, untreated oil. I don&#x27;t even notice the smell when I use it anymore and the smell does not stay on your skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem was with the dropper it came with. The oil would leak out before I could squeeze the dropper making a bit of a mess on the bottle and dispensing more than I wanted to use. However, it appears that they have fixed this problem by changing the bottle to a pump dispenser. Well done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very happy with the product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a natural way to moisturize. I am planning on mixing this with other oils this winter and making my own lotion. I look forward to finding more and more uses for this great oil</li>
            <li> I love this oil!  I use it on my hair, which is very thick and coarse, my face, and my hands.  It has a pleasant smell and absorbs very quickly.  I put in on my face, dry my hair and it&#x27;s fully absorbed!  I bought a bottle for my daughters and daughter-in-law for Christmas and they all love it too!</li>
            <li> I use it for skin and hair.  I use several oils, just wanted to see if this oil was any different.  It acts just like any other oils.  I add a few drops of my own natural oil based perfume to make it have a more appealing smell.  I wouldn&#x27;t call the smell bad, just natural for that oil and it doesn&#x27;t smell at all on the body or hair.  When not in use I keep it in the fridge as I do with other natural oils.  It needs to come to room temp. before you can use it.  I like it but then I like oils.  I use almond and hazelnut mostly but I make sure there is nothing else added to the oil. This is my second bottle and I no longer add any other oil or perfume to it.  Once applied it no longer has that &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell.  I really like and use it a lot more often than when I first tried it.  It is very good on my hair and skin -- I hope it will continue to be available.</li>
            <li> We have been using the oil for a few weeks now for twice a day. It has tremendously improved my 7 year old&#x27;s skin problem on his face. He has a kind of rash on his cheeks. It&#x27;s been there since he was a baby and it&#x27;s due to developing sweat glands. So he has little bumps like oil seeds.  Less rough and softer to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 2 kids and i also use the oil as a replacement for our body cream. The smell is nutty but mild and you don&#x27;t smell it after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the first bottle but due to shipping and handling the content of the oil spilled out. I received the 2nd bottle as a replacement. I will continue to use this well absorbing and non greasy oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a big bottle but we are halfway thru the 1st bottle! Any luck you have larger bottles for sale?</li>
            <li> This is a very big bottle for the price. This seems like a good product, contrary to some of the negative reviews on here. Maybe there was a bad batch in the warehouse, but mine did NOT smell bad and it was golden in color as it should be. That being said, I am used to argan oil having a slightly nutty smell which this did not have (I prefer the scent). The oil also comes out of the dropper much too fast, so be careful. It absorbed fully, although I do recommend using it at night for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also comes with a guarantee if, for some reason, you are not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and would be nice for the skin.  I do use it on my hair and have not noticed any particular benefit.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops of this wonderful oil makes my skin feel soft and smooth.  I use it on my face as well as my arms and legs.  When my scalp feels too dry from sun or swimming, I massage a few drops of argan oil onto my scalp or add a few drops to my shampoo.  The 4-oz bottle is really large!  You won&#x27;t run out of this oil any time soon.  There is no fragrance added to the oil, so the scent is purely of the oil itself, which isn&#x27;t unpleasant and doesn&#x27;t linger.  I will always want to have this oil available.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, a little goes a long way.  I have really dry skin and my hair is really dry.  I used this on wet hair.  The first time I used to much, its trial and error like any product.  The 2nd time I used the right amount.  I also put it on dry hair and I massage into my scalp whenever it feels dry and itchy and I don&#x27;t have dandruff, just over 50 and very dry skin. The oil is thin, not thick, but it does pack a lot of oil in a couple little drops.  I&#x27;m used to using Chi&#x27;s keratin silk oil and its thick and I can use a lot of that and not have too much.  So this product was a nice surprise of how little you need. I also have been using it on my nails and cuticles and my nails aren&#x27;t chipping like they had been.  Stopped peeling too.  I use their Vitamin C serum and the Rosehip Serum and love those too.  Quality products!</li>
            <li> I can compare this product with Elma&amp;Sana argan oil.  I like argan oil and I used to get Elma&amp;Sana brand.  Elma&amp;Sana comes in prettier blue bottle and is not as smelly as this product.  Yes, this product has a stronger smell and I would not put it on right before I go out but the smell does seem to dissipate after a while, and for overnight use, etc., it should be fine.  And this product feels thicker than E&amp;S, I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a good thing, but it certainly does the job of moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I choose this product over E&amp;S because E&amp;S is more expensive and the worst part of that product is that I have received leaky bottles from them several times.  I wanted to get some argan oil product for my parents who live overseas and I could not risk getting products that would leak on the way over there.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my dry skin, and it seems to be improving daily.  I have tried other products, but to no avail.  I think I may have found a solution.</li>
            <li> I love it!  It soaks in within about 5 min, unlike coconut oil that stays greasy for quite some time!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best!! I have tried other argan oils (Josie Moran) but Instanatural  is better and the price is a bargain.  I will definitely continue using this product.  Try it , you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to soften my skin and give it back a glow for a while, read about Argan Oil in a human interest story so I looked it up and found this product.  As I have aged, and also returned to a northern climate, dry skin has been an issue....immediately I have enjoyed softer, more supple skin on my face, and my hands as well.  You need so little to feel so good....glad I purchased this product!!</li>
            <li> I am VERY happy with this product. I&#x27;ve been using it on my face and hands for moisture and also my hair. Just today my sister, who hasn&#x27;t seen me in several months, said &amp;#34;your skin looks great! whatever you&#x27;re doing, keep it up&amp;#34;. I have recommended it to several people and I definitely plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I received this Argan Oil for review and I love it!!! I was already a huge fan of this liquid gold. This makes my hair shiny and bouncy, I use it as a daytime moisturizer but the uses are endless. As a hair treatment I left it on my hair fifteen minutes before washing and washed my hair like normal. The results were a soft and bouncy mane. My skin meaning face has cleared up as well with argan oil all you need is a little and pat it onto your face. I love that this argan oil has a dispenser for easier use than the traditional medicinal bottle. This is truly My secret beauty weapon:)</li>
            <li> This oil is really nice and lightweight, but I think that I&#x27;m a little wary of its organic certifications.</li>
            <li> I bought this earlier in 2014, and it came in a blue bottle with an eye dropper to dispense.  It looks like the packaging changed - I liked the blue bottle a lot and read that it was one of the best for keeping the oil fresh, but as long as it&#x27;s dark, I think it&#x27;s okay.  The oil has the rubberband smell, which tells you it&#x27;s quality argan oil and is a nice, natural smell.  This is a great deal for a huge bottle that will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the oil. It&#x27;s not greasy and it absorbs quickly. I have tried using as a moisturiser for my face, and also as a hair serum. No breakouts and 1 pump dispenses just the right amount of quantity needed. I warm the oil on my hand and just pat it on my face. For my hair, I use it on my ends after towel dry and before i blow dry. Quite happy with both uses however still too early to judge the results. Will continue using and update results.</li>
            <li> My cuticles and rough heels are finally happy after only a few days!  A little goes a long way and it absorbs quickly.  Even the fine wrinkles around my eyes are softer.  I will definitely order your Argan oil again.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> It took me a month to like this oil. I was disappointed first. Pump was leaking...all over my drawer in bathroom, in zipper bag in my purse,.. awful mess. However the company refunded me for that. I have been using it now for a month and I can tell it changed my skin. My décolleté is so smooth now, face too. When I rub my eyelids, I can&#x27;t believe how moisturized they feel now. My skin looks more plumped. It fixed my cracked heal like a magic. It&#x27;s a  good one. Out of other oils I have purchased last month ( Jojoba oil, Rosehip oil and Grapeseed oil) this one smells the best. Still like a food, but with a hint of fruit or something nice in it.</li>
            <li> I love the huge bottle this stuff comes in. I originally ordered this oil for my dry hair. A small amount does indeed add shine and softness to my hair. I loved the way it felt on my hands while I was applying it to my hair so I decided to add some of the oil to my home-made face and body cream. The oil penetrates quickly and it leaves my skin so soft. The oil does have a slight odor but the benefits are so worth waiting for the smell to dissipate. This is great oil and it is very reasonably priced. I have used it every day for about a week and I simply love the results I am already witnessing. I am looking forward to seeing my results at the end of a month! I am happy I bought it and I will definably buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very nice packaging and quality overall. Very happy with the product,</li>
            <li> So far so good!  The smell takes a bit getting used to but it goes on smoothly and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Excellant transaction and product. Use this on my hair skin and nails. Awesome moisturizer !! I have purchased 3 bottles so I always have it handy. At home and work.</li>
            <li> Love this product and happy it is US certified organic.</li>
            <li> Good Product, great value, useful for dry skin, hair and nails</li>
            <li> smells good; more fruity than nutty. Absorbs quickly, skin looks great. Really good value, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to start off by saying that this is PURE, high quality Argan oil. I&#x27;m sometimes doubtful of the purity of&lt;br /&gt;Argan oils because it is too easy to buy &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; and have it turn out to be a blend. It is also certified organic by&lt;br /&gt;Ecocert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the pump bottle that InstaNatural packages their argan oil in. Its really easy to use and you don&#x27;t get too&lt;br /&gt;much or too little with one pump. The bottle is decent sized, but doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg. It will last a&lt;br /&gt;while and won&#x27;t be expensive to replace when you run out. This argan oil doesn&#x27;t have any added scents or other&lt;br /&gt;oils, so it looks and smells exactly as it should. No surprises. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil has so many great uses, it is pretty much an all-purpose oil. I have really damaged hair because I dye my&lt;br /&gt;hair neon red, so I use this to help with the damage, split ends, and frizz. I&#x27;ve also used argan oil on my nails&lt;br /&gt;and skin. There&#x27;s a reason why argan oil is referred to as &amp;#34;liquid gold&amp;#34;. It has so many different uses! You can&lt;br /&gt;use it for acne, as a moisturizer, as a toner, as an aftershave, as a conditioner, shiny hair, glowing skin, cuticle/heel softener, nail&lt;br /&gt;strengthener, bath oil, body oil, and so many more things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Argan oil and this one is no different. I use this in my hair everytime I shower to help keep my hair soft and smooth and it definitely works. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair oily or greasy at all, unless you overdo it! You only need one pump for long hair.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product.  After using a well known (expensive) organic toxin free moisturizer I was looking for something toxin free but cheaper. I started to use coconut oil and although fine for my body, it made my face break out.  This argan oil is perfect. Very affordable and it will last a LONG time.  Gives my skin a nice glow with no toxins and no breakouts. I wish I had found this a long time ago!</li>
            <li> Love argan oil. Made my hair very soft and gave it a nice smell. not greasy. I like applying this to my skin for a brighter complexion. A must have product</li>
            <li> This is great argan oil. I love how it feels and it absorbs so nice. I really like that it has a pump which makes it easy to dispense.  My mother had me order it for her after trying some of mine and is loving it as well.</li>
            <li> Like it a lot. Makes my hair shine and skin soft.</li>
            <li> I received  it on time. The product  is great.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and used to have bad acne, but after a few bouts of accutane I developed dry skin. Now, I have to use a moisturizer. After trying to find the best one, I found out about argan oil and am impressed. It makes my skin feel moisturized and helps soothe problem areas. It&#x27;s great for the hair as well. I will be purchasing more of this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product a couple weeks now.  I really like it.  I use it as a moisturizer on my face.  It isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  I love the dropper.  The size and price was very good for this product.  I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> This Argan Oil is wonderful and can be used for many reasons including one&#x27;s skin  However, I would suggest that you half this amount, half the Argan itself for it is far too perfect and could also get into the eyes.  You are far too generous and this could last me until the day I die.  So, I really think that diluting this wonderful oil and put it into a smaller bottle and keep the price the same.  You would also have more Argan for others who have to wait for the next batch.  Just a thought.</li>
            <li> Had it for two months and it smells rancid now, hadn&#x27;t used it for a couple weeks and when went to use it the other day it wreaks. So now going to end up throwing away a large portion. I will probably not buy again bc half is going to waste.</li>
            <li> ABSORBS QUICKLY, SOFT SKIN, THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Got rid of the tickly frizz but its not oily or greasy and works great on itchy dry skin &amp; dry hair/scalp.</li>
            <li> Great customer service and the product is amazing as well! It works just as advertised and is great for controlling acne.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. A little goes a really long way. I can see myself not using this product for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> i put it on my hair over night and i felt like it never soaked through&lt;br /&gt;my hair was oily as heck in the morning and i only used a few drops&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the bottle leaks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not completely satisfied</li>
            <li> I just recently started using Argan oil for treating my dry/cracked hands due to winter. It’s been hugely helpful – not only does it help soothe the dryness, it does an excellent job of helping heal the cracks at my fingertips. Absolutely wonderful stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand of Argan oil is priced less than the oil I&#x27;ve been using, but there’s zero difference. It offers the same benefits, there is no odor to the oil (other than the usual small “earthy” scent that is typical of Argan oil) and it comes nicely packaged in a very attractive cobalt blue glass bottle with a dropper. While it does not have the “gift box” packaging other Argan oils have, it also does not have the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is imported from Morocco and bottled in the US. According to the label it is USDA certified organic and has not been tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need very little to get results. I use a drop or two per hand and that is plenty. A 4 oz bottle such as this will last a LONG time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any oil product, it feels oily when it is first applied. But, after a few minutes, the oil sheen dissipates and the oil is absorbed. I have not noticed any greasy residue after using it on my hands and fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality Argan oil at a good price. Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;[Sample provided for review]</li>
            <li> stuff works great on hair and skin... I love it - my skin has problems and this is balancing it out leaving my skin glowing</li>
            <li> great product for a great price.  no additives.  seems large cosmetic companies are adding argan oil to everything and charging ridiculous prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This argan oil is a pure, simple, organic product.  The manufacture and sales provide jobs for Moroccan women and have influenced farming practices.  There are no &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; ingredients in the oil---it contains Vitamin E, but is absorbed readily by the skin and not sticky. It&#x27;s a fine all-purpose moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was prompt and well-packaged.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have been using it on my hair and face...really combats the harsh effects of winter on my body!  The price is right and the large bottle is a plus.  I will definitely order this product again!</li>
            <li> Wonderful for hair, skin, nails.  What&#x27;s not to love.</li>
            <li> I am sure the product is great.... but mine arrived all leaked and the box had oil stains!&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the box, wrapping materials were all soaked in argan oil.</li>
            <li> I have had this only for a week or two but I really like it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love argan oil and I cannot say enough good things about this product. It&#x27;s super nutrient-dense while feeling really light and absorbing immediately. I like to use it on my hair and body as it leaves everything super moisturized and soft!</li>
            <li> Love it. light, not unpleasant odor. Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I am in my 60s and have been looking for the perfect hair/skin care product forever!  Well, I look no more!  This organic argan oil makes my hair and skin silky and luxurious.  It soaks in and nourishes, unlike other products which only coat hair and make it look slick and sticky.  I fact, today, after shampooing (which is always an iffy time due to frizziness and dryness) I was paid two compliments on how nice my hair looks.  And the lines on my face seem less with my skin looking nourished.  I love this product and highly recommend it to anyone.  The scent is natural, nutty and green, so it is not perfumed.  I will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> Works as expected, pricing is also good.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped and received promptly and intact!  The oil has a nice smooth texture when spread on the skin and is absorbed very quickly and is non-greasy but silky to the touch.  The bottle has nice pump delivery system.  I use it mainly as a sealer for my hair during styling and part of my moisturizing routine and will be reordering.  I especially like that it&#x27;s organic and pure maintains its nutrients.</li>
            <li> This product seem to be very good and organic , however I recently began using it. I also think that the price is very good considering the amount.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  It feels great it my thick waves hair.  Not greasy at all.  It&#x27;s more of a dry oil.  Will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an itchy rash on my face &amp; tried a number of home remedies including essential oils. But the Argan oil has really helped alot! This is my first experience using it &amp; only takes a tiny bit to do the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase of InstaNatural Argan Oil. I bought it with the intent to help moisturize my dried,fried,color treated hair which is waist length and IT WORKED GREAT! I&#x27;ve had many compliments on my hair since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Nice big bottle. Dispenses well.</li>
            <li> Great product....my wife and I use this on our faces ......a lot cheaper than most .....packaged perfect</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on my hands and face.  Not greasy.  My skin feels soft with this product.  I use a little in my hair also.  I wish I would have known about this product years ago.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to use as a carrier oil for the essential oils I use on my muscles. I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s a great quality oil and an extremely economical price. Best part is when I&#x27;m done rubbing it on my skin, I run my hands thru my hair for a beautiful shine:)</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the skin! My skin feels fresher and softer since using this. It also blends well with essential oils.</li>
            <li> I used this as a hot oil treatment for my hair,  just place some oil in a container and put in hot tap water to heat and applied to my hair and after 20 minutes I washed it out. My hair seems to have less split ends and is shiny.  A great product and it is all natural.&lt;br /&gt;**Product provided by the company**</li>
            <li> Great value! If you use Argan oil on a regular basis the bottle size is nice so you don&#x27;t run out as often. Will purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful results for my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Great product! Really defines my curls and keeps hair from being so frizzy.</li>
            <li> It is fine, with the dry and hot weather here in the desert, it keeps me well oiled</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fine/thin hair, acne and nails.......It&#x27;s not the miracle cure-all for me that the internet says Argan oil is. I have not personally tried any other brands, but I do like the bottle and the pump that the InstaNatural comes with. I have not noticed a significant thickening of my hair or less acne. I am personally trying to use less commercial products (leave in conditioner, hand lotion, face moisturizer), so for these purposes, it works great. As a general moisturizer, I think it is a better option then what I have been using. It absorbs quickly, so I don&#x27;t feel like a grease ball and doesn&#x27;t leave grease marks on my clothing (Almond or Olive oil don&#x27;t seem to absorb as quickly).&lt;br /&gt;I think the price on Amazon is great. I bought my first bottle in December 2014 and just recently bought a second bottle (even though I still had about 1/4 bottle left).When using just a 4 drops/pumps a day for my hair, face and hands, it lasted me over 6 months. But I have started using it all over my body after a shower, so this second bottle will get used up more quickly :)</li>
            <li> Leave my face not oily.... Excellence product...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot about this product I did buy one from the hair dresser but that one was also filled with added ingredients for smell,it smell great but I wanted one that was pure so I bought this product that is pure and was organic, I fell in love with this oil, I use it on my skin also, it is said to do wonders for the people in the Amazon who are constantly exposed to harsh climate, I most certainly would recommend this product for smoother and soft looking skin.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  My facial skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> I have suffered from a wide variety of issues with my nails over the years e.g. cracking, flaking, spots, fungus, etc. I didn’t think I would see any improvement, but I was willing to give the INSTANATURAL ORGANIC ARGAN OIL FOR HAIR, FACE, SKIN, &amp; NAILS a try. After using the oil for two months, I can’t say for sure if there have been any actual physical benefits. However, my nails do look healthier than they did before I started using it and there has definitely been less cracking and splitting. I have only used INSTANATURAL ORGANIC ARGAN OIL FOR HAIR, FACE, SKIN, &amp; NAILS on my nails, so I can’t really say if it has any other benefits or works as advertised. I was provided a sample of this item from the manufacturer for examination and possible review.</li>
            <li> I bought this for split end control and it works really good as long as you don&#x27;t put it on your scalp if you have thin hair as it weighs it down and feels greasy.  After reading the reviews I decided to try it on my dry skin.  It works wonders on my face without being greasy.  It didn&#x27;t work so great on my winter dried legs.  All in all it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Purchased this because I wanted to try 100% argan oil.  It is not as think as the other products I have used and great for dry hair and skin.  When the product was delivered it was leaking.  I contacted the manufactuer through an email he had already sent telling me different ways to use the product.  He responded right back to me that he would send another one which I got two days later.  Great product and great service!</li>
            <li> The oil is very nice. I use it on my face, neck and hands daily. Absorbs well with a light sent. Will for sure reorder.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I use it on my hands, face, hair, and dry spots.  The product absorbs quickly and is not greasy.  It&#x27;s a great product and very affordable!</li>
            <li> Large size for the price. Lots of uses: hair nails skin. I am sure this will last for a very long time</li>
            <li> Love the product. Makest skin soft and there is no scene to it at all, which is a good thing, because I wouldn&#x27;t want to be smelling my own face all day long. :)</li>
            <li> I have never written a review on Amazon but felt this company and product deserved an endorsement. They were conscientious enough to ask if I was pleased with their product and did it in a polite and non intrusive manner. I love the oil and have added it to my daily regime. I look forward to doing more business with them.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve written a product review.  I really like how this product makes my hair and skin look and feel.  I&#x27;ve used camellia oil for at least 20 years and even though it gives the shine to the hair, it will get weighted down if I wore a hat or a bicycle helmet.  This product, on the other hand, does not give me a &amp;#34;helmet hair&amp;#34; if you know what I am talking about.  The only compliant I have is it gets absorbed into your hand quickly before you can rub it onto your hair or skin.  Therefore, you can use up the product fairly quickly.  I wish they would sell a larger bottle in a cheaper price (for volume discount).</li>
            <li> I rated it five (5) stars because it is an excellent product. It works very well for me and I love it. I shared this with my daughter, friends and sisters. I am orderning more for them very soon. I have tried a lot of argan oil products and it works very well, if not better than the more expensive ones sold by QVC.</li>
            <li> My mom (Asian) is in her early 60&#x27;s and she had dry damaged hair.  She dyes her greys every few months and blow dries.  She started using this for a week by rubbing a bit in her hands and then rubbing it into her hair.  She left it on for a few hours and then washed it off.  Her hair started to look shinier and felt smoother.  It was instantly noticeable after I didn&#x27;t see her for a week.  Even her friend&#x27;s started commenting her how nice her hair was and asked what she had been using.  She really liked this product and started recommending it to all her friends.  It&#x27;s a hit.  I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more of this in the future for her.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks and have notice my skin is smoother and clearer. i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Nice quality Argan oil, I like it. Like this dispenser too. I mostly use it for my hair and dry spots on my face. Great quality, cold-pressed, organic, what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> Great oil. body absorbs it quickly and leaves a smooth texture. Highly recommend it, actually I already purchased two more.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My hair is very dry and brittle and this completely smoothes my fly aways! It also softens my hands as I usually rub a few drops on my hands and then run my hands through my hair. Normally would have to wash my hair everyday in order to make it manageable, but this product allows me to simply comb and recurl a bit a second or even third day. I purchased another product from this company that simply did not work for me. I requested a refund and with no hassles received a refund for the purchase price. This company has fantastic products AND great customer service, a combination that is hard to find these days!</li>
            <li> This winter I developed a very dry area around my mouth and tried several different products (none of which worked well) before trying this one.  It was a painful condition since it would hurt to even smile!  After about one week of use the dryness went away completely.  Since then I have been using this religiously every night.  My skin feels supple &amp; well moisturized when I wake up in the morning.  May not be suitable for wearing under makeup in the morning (but I did use it the first week since my dry skin was very severe).  It is a natural product, doesn&#x27;t have any perfume added, the natural smell is slight &amp; easy to get used to.</li>
            <li> I would recommend very nice produced</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Living in the desert, my skin is very dry and this is the best oil that I have found.  It takes just a few drops.  Goes on lightly and absorbs quickly.  Also use a drop or two to condition dry, flyaway hair.  Very impressed by the personal attention from the company.  They care about their customers and want to make sure that they are satisfied.  Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Finally, I found a hair oil product that works. I really love the small, texture and quality of the InstaNatural argan oil. The only dowside to this product is the price and size, but the quality definetly worths. Just wish they had reduced the price a little. If you want a hair and body oil that is trully natural, health and on top of that smalls great dont look again. instaNatural argan oil is the one for me...</li>
            <li> As good as other reviews said it was. Love it</li>
            <li> Big difference from other brands-my hair loves it!</li>
            <li> I saw Dr. Oz talking about how great this oil is for your hair.  After receiving my order of Argan Oil, I have used it from the top of my head to my feet and love it.  It is an oil but it absorbs easily into the skin and does not immediately wash off your hands leaving them soft but not oily. Just one or two pumps goes a long way.  I tried putting it on my hair after washing it but it did not take the tangles out.  I went ahead and used my conditioner.  After towel trying it, I just put a small amount in my palm and worked the oil through my hair.  When I blow dried my hair it was so manageable and soft.  I even use this oil on my face.  My makeup even goes on must smother.  Try it, it is natural and if you like it half as much as I do, you will be hooked.</li>
            <li> Amazing for hair and skin! Love it!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the InstaNatural Organic Argan Oil I purchased.  I received it in the mail sooner than expected and the quality of the oil is as advertised.  I will purchase this again.  Thank you!☺</li>
            <li> Argan has always been one of my favorite oils. I usually have to treck to an Ayurvedic store to find Argan without and preservatives or cosmetic chemicals that are added to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the few times I encountered a brand that bottles pure argan oil. My only concern is that there is a distinct smell to pure argan oil that was missing from this. I believe it is due to the cold press procedure, which isn&#x27;t actually bad since it removes impurities from the oil that can hinder the overall shelf life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received free for review purposes</li>
            <li> Product works well, and doesn&#x27;t leave hair and skin oily feeling like most products. Wish it smelled.</li>
            <li> My latest go to favorite for my hair (very dry ends). Has done wonders for my nails and elbows.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  How have I lived this long without having used this before?  I used it as hand lotion at night and noticed my fingernails got stronger right away!  Incredible! I normally use organic coconut oil as lotion but this absorbs and feels better.  I&#x27;ve since put a couple of pumps on my long hair after showering and haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference on my curly hair.  Even though I bought this for my hair, I&#x27;m very impressed with how good it is for the skin and nails.</li>
            <li> This is definitely my HG product!!! I have bought this for all members of my family and they love it as well.  I use it on my oily/combo skin as a moisturizer daily and nightly.  Throughout the day it does not make me oily.  I have noticed it does clear my zits within a few days and it makes my skin really smooth.  I also use this for my hair as I have hair loss.. I believe it may help but it&#x27;s too soon to tell.  I use it on eczema as well, and while it may not heal it completely it does relieve it.  It has also lessened the appearance of my scars on my face which is pretty amazing as I have some acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother says her pores seems smaller and her overall appearance of her skin has been smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is the smell.  Initially it has a very strong odor when first opened.  It has a putrid smell.  But, I got used to it.. It seems the odor does lessen.  The good thing is this oil absorbs quickly and the odor dissipates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely magic in a bottle though!! I will be using it for life!!</li>
            <li> Works great as a beard oil. Absorbs quickly into hair and skin. Low odor.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and the company is very attentive to its buyers.</li>
            <li> At first I received a very rancid and stale bottle. I contacted InstaNatural immediately and they quickly sent me another bottle with 2 day shipping. I was very impressed by their customer service and understanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving the new bottle I noticed the plastic seal on the new bottle was much better secured and was very fresh and earthly smelling, the way it&#x27;s suppose smell. I&#x27;m loving this product! It&#x27;s worth every penny! I use it every night before I go to bed and I have been seeing small but great results in such a short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product now! InstaNatural is a great company with a great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and am really enjoying it. I use it on damp hair. I start on the ends and then smooth a bit onto my frizzy baby hairs around my face and finally run my hands through the rest of my hair with what&#x27;s left. I only use one small pump. You have to be very careful not to use too much. When I let my hair air dry it looks much better then usual. However, this stuff really shines for me when I blow dry my hair. My hair comes out silky smooth and all the FRIZZY baby hairs all around my crown are soft and tame. I put some in a roller bottle and I use it on my cuticles a few times a day and I roll some under my eyes before I put concealer on. I really like this stuff and will buy again!</li>
            <li> I like the smell, texture and the packing. Started using it just now, so I am not sure how effective it is with stopping hair loss.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for 4 months and will continue to buy it.  My hair is dry and fly away and this oil allows me to leave the house not ashamed of my hair.</li>
            <li> I love Argan oil and have tried different brands.  However, I&#x27;ve discovered that not all oils are equal.  I have used Josie Maran&#x27;s in the past but find it to be too expensive (although I do still use her body butters).  I highly recommend this brand of Argan oil because it&#x27;s certified organic, cold pressed, has a light texture, no smell and IT WORKS!  I use it on my face, neck, arms, legs and hair.  Use very little otherwise it will feel too greasy.  I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and people think I&#x27;m 10 years younger!  Finally, another reason I recommend this product is because I trust the company.  They offer a lifetime satisfaction guarantee.  What else can you ask for?  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for healthier alternatives to the items I use to make my skin better, younger, softer.  When I saw that InstaNatural had an Argan Oil, I jumped right on it.  Argan Oil is a long lasting moisturizer that is gentle and can be used anywhere.  I appreciate how fast absorbing it is and how quickly I can get into my clothes or touch surfaces without feeling too oily.  As a hair treatment, I like to use this after washing my hair, and before I heat style.  My hair ends up soft and manageable without feeling weighed down or greasy.  For facial use, I like to use this Argan Oil on super dry spots, which has been a godsend this winter.  I also like to use this as a heavy duty moisturizer after using my facial brush or any exfoliant.  Calms my skin, and ensures that I will have the softest skin after.  It has made for a fantastic body moisturizer!  Using it right after I get out of the shower, when skin is still damp, it creates a lovely sheen on the skin and also makes my feel very smooth.  This is a huge bottle  and completely worth the investment!  Will repurchase/</li>
            <li> I tried it today and perhaps I used too much (really hard to know which thick hair) because it seems a little greasy/stringy but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just due to too many pumps. It doesn&#x27;t really have much of a smell, it did remove my shampoo smell when I put it on, which kinda sucks as I love the smell of my shampoo, hehe.</li>
            <li> Smells like cow manure.  Get the Watts brand instead!</li>
            <li> I have used other argan oils, wanted to try this one out.  I like it.  I can actually put it in my hair, which the other ones were too greasy to do!  I primarily use it as a face moisturizer.  Love it!  Great alternative for those people who have issues with coconut oil breaking them out!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple brands of Argan Oil as a face moisturizer and my face breaks out more with this brand than others.</li>
            <li> This oil is the best.</li>
            <li> Best Argan oil I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> After trying a small sample from a high-end brand known for its argan oil (JM), I knew it was something I definitely wanted to put on my face but wasn&#x27;t willing (able, really) to spend that much. So I went on searching for another version of that liquid gold and decided to purchase this item. I was surprised by the size and packaging, but even more surprised by the fact that I couldn&#x27;t stand the stench! Oh well, less than $18 down the drain, no big deal, glad I gave it a try. Then InstaNatural sent me an email asking me about how much I liked it, and I spoke my mind. I received a prompt reply from a really sweet and efficient sales associate letting me know that another bottle was on its way free of charge! She was right, the new bottle has no smell at all! Turns out the first one had gone bad during shipping in the scorching heat of the season. I am madly in love with and grateful for this stuff! I apply liberally, as there&#x27;s none of that ten dollars per drop issue that I hate worrying about when pampering myself, all over my face, down my frequently itchy neck (thank you for that, family genes) and then all the leftover on my hands. It works wonderfully at instantly and completely calming my very dry and sensitive skin, and making my nails strong and pretty. But even more awe-inspiring is the fact that I rub it on my eyes (closed) to get it all over the skin and lashes, I hate that &amp;#34;tap lightly with your pinky finger&amp;#34; annoying method recommended by the high-end beauty industry. I pile it on! That&#x27;s not really necessary, as a few drops work just as well, but this way is a lot more fun. It has NEVER hurt my eyes and it has almost erased all of my wrinkles! And the lips, OMG! None of the hundreds of lip balms I&#x27;ve tried come close to what this does for my lips. Plump, perfect, have never peeled or cracked ever again! Thank you InstaNatural for making me so happy about finally having the one and only perfect facial moisturizer I&#x27;ll ever need!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product I have ordered online where both a money-back guarantee was offered, AND the seller followed up with me to see if it was helping. That&#x27;s great business practice. I apologize to the seller for not getting this review in sooner. I have pain disorders which were raging when I got this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it helps to look better when you feel badly. I have very long, fine curly hair. And this oil takes me from looking like Roseanne Roseannadana to smooth. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I really like using this for my hair as well as for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It is nice to know that it is all natural and not something with a mixture of 20 other ingredients that I can&#x27;t read.  Good Stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past month. It is very hydrating and my skin has been feeling more healthy. I also use it for my cuticles and my hair, the argan oil also is very versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended Steps:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Cleanser --&amp;#62; Toner --&amp;#62; Argan Oil --&amp;#62; Serums --&amp;#62; Moisturizer  --&amp;#62; (Additional for Daytime) Spf/BB cream with spf&lt;br /&gt;2.) DON&#x27;T use a full pump, a lot of product comes out. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;3.) When you apply the oil, rub the oil with the palms of your hands and then pat and massage it onto your face. Concentrate on the areas that are more drying first. (I have combination skin, so I put the product on my cheeks and dry patches and then I move onto the rest of my face and neck!</li>
            <li> Great product. It leaves my hair soft and without freeze even in very humid weather during rainy season in Panama. I&#x27;m happy with it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy using this argan oil. I comb it through my hair and leave it there for at least a couple of hours before I shampoo and condition it. It has definitely helped with hair growth and hair health. My brown hair is straight and thick. I have never subjected my hair to harsh treatments such as dying, bleaching or a perm, I do not use a curling iron or straightener and I hardly blow dry my hair. I am trying to grow out my hair long so that I can donate it. This product is absolutely helping!</li>
            <li> My wife tried a lot of products and organic argan oil was the answer it&#x27;s the best oil that touch her body it&#x27;s one answer for a lots of questions we love it we will keep use it</li>
            <li> Used daily, and it seems to keep the fine facial lines at a minimum.  I put on after morning shower, on face, and then run hands through my hair to leave a little extra oil there - keeps away the frizzies.  I get full use out of this because i also use it on my nails and cuticles. ( Helps somewhat, although that seems to be a never ending challenge for me... getting the nails to grow!)  Overall, a great product that replaces other serums, oils, etc.  Very light scent, and this price is one of the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I finally know what people mean by glowing skin WITHOUT being greasy. (And my skin is naturally more on the oily side, or I should say was, before this product.) This absorbs so nicely into skin and hair and balanced me out.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It really helps with dry cuticles and it also helps moisturize dry hair. It dries very quickly and does not feel sticky.I do love it!</li>
            <li> I have to say this is the best argan oil I have ever used! I was originally intrigued by the affordability of the product, how it&#x27;s organic, and fully potent. It has moisturized my hair and skin better than previous argan oils I have used, including Acure, Josie Maran, Pur D&#x27;or, and a whole foods brand. It absorbs into my skin and hair the best, and had the richest color and texture. I&#x27;ve found my go-to all-over argan oil.</li>
            <li> I love the pump and the fragrance is barely noticeable and goes away almost instantly.  My first experience with argan oil was a different brand and this was my second.  I greatly prefer the slightly fruity scent of this to the other and what smell there is dissipates much quicker than the other, stinky smell.  Even though I didn&#x27;t like the smell of the other brand, the results were worth the smell.  For me, this has the same great results with a much more pleasant smell.  Add the pump dispenser compared to a dropper lid and this is hands down much better!  I will buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> seems greasy to me and have not seen that it helps at all...but have felt a  burning feeling on the back of my hands, but not moisturize at all...definitely not what I thought it would do.</li>
            <li> Great Quality product! Pour it in your shampoo or your favorite lotion. I was introduced to it thanks to a blog review I did for them.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing for hair .. would recommend</li>
            <li> Excellent! Have been using the product now for over a week and the experience has been great. I&#x27;ve been using Argan Oil for over 2 years and this product is just as good as any of the more expensive options at other retailers. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I use this product for couple weeks.it doesn&#x27;t feel very oily. It feel very good and I enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing!!! I have been using Josie Maran for over a year, and this product is just as good, if not better. I can&#x27;t believe the amount of money I have spent with the other brand when this product is just as good, I kind of feel like I&#x27;ve been being ripped off. Please don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this. Some reviews talk about it smelling bad, or being vegetable oil, they must be new to Argan oil. It smells like argan oil. It feels like Argan oil. It looks like Argan oil. When I put a drop of Josie Maran next to a drop of this, they smelt, felt, and looked EXACTLY the same. I actually even believe that it absorbs a little quicker than JM. I use it on all three of my children. One has eczema and he needs no other treatment then a few drops of this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making such an amazing pure product as such a reasonable price!!!!</li>
            <li> for hair amazing, makes it shine in a very healthy manner my beard especially.&lt;br /&gt;keeping in mind it is a leave in conditioner and you see the effects of it in the morning shower.</li>
            <li> I was always under the impression if you had an oily face you did not need to put more oil on it;  I was wrong!  Long story short I had excessive oil on my t zone, with break outs all over my face and being over 40 years old, uhhggg.  I use to try to remove the oil only to make it worse.  I found reasearch on Argan oil,  tried it with great aprehension and LOVE the results.  This Argan oil has helped with my excessive oil,  wrinkles, even my finger nails, they have never look so good.  I put it on in the mornings and night after using Shea Moisture baby soap with frankincense and mhyrr.  Only three squit&#x27;s does the trick face and nails and sometimes the ends of my hair.  The price of this organic oil is not really an issue after you see how long this bottle will last.  A long time that is!</li>
            <li> It works pretty well, although you have to put it on before you shower. The one problem I had with it was the smell. I found it a little gross, but if your going to wash it off anyway its not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> Product Review: I have very dry skin and most oils or serums feel greasy.  This argan oil is light and not greasy.  I use under moisturizer as an extra boost and really love the look that it provides, which is to give my face a slightly luminous look. I also use a small amount on my damp hair after washing. So far I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Company Review: I had a slight issue with the packaging and notified Amazon, to no result.  They never responded.  I then notified the company directly and their customer service is excellent!  They quickly resolved the issue and went the extra mile to go beyond the simple fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my experience, I heartily recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After doing some research on Argan oil, I’ve come across many sources stating the miraculous benefits of this liquid, with some going as far as to call this product “liquid gold”. After 2 weeks of using this, I’m not sure if I’ve experienced every single benefit it was supposed to provide, but I’ve seen some of my scars fade–and that’s already more than what most skin care products have done for me. Argan oil is a hot product right now in the cosmetics market, and you can find it in shampoos and premium lotions nowadays, and it’s always pretty expensive due to the extensive labor used to extract it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this argan oil is superb–it’s cold-pressed to maintain its vitamins, and it’s also certified organic, so I’d assume that’s a good thing as well. You get a large 4oz bottle of pure argan oil for a decent price, so I’d definitely recommend this product if you’re looking for argan oil for your skin or looking to try something new (this was new for me!), then give this a try. There’s no offensive odors or anything–it just smells like oil, and it gets absorbed fast. Perhaps it would work for you! I’d be happy to answer any questions below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was given a review sample</li>
            <li> Bought this based on a couple of very thoughtful reviews I read. I&#x27;m glad I did, because I love the product. It goes on greasy at first, (How can you not expect that..it&#x27;s oil) but it absorbs very quickly, and leaves skin feeling soft and smooth. It has a very slight nutty odor (The same odor as the actual raw kernels when crushed), which should be an indicator that it&#x27;s the real deal, but it dissipates very quickly. I use it right out of the bottle on my face and neck, but also as an added ingredient in homemade body butters. It mixes well with Shea butter, olive and Coconut oils, as well as essential oils if you need fragrance in your homemade lotions and butters. I like this product a lot and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this versatile product so far. I use it on my face as a moisturizer and my face. My hair is a lot softer now</li>
            <li> I use this all over. My legs, nails, face and hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> Use this every night. It absorbs into the skin in 1/2 hour or so. sometimes I don&#x27;t even apply night cream. Keeps my skin soooo soft.</li>
            <li> OUTSTANDING DEAL, LOVE THE PRODUCTS, AWESOME~ Just perfect! Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Thank you! Great service fast shipping thanks!</li>
            <li> Great oil, outstanding customer service!, February 22, 2015&lt;br /&gt;By yorkiemom&lt;br /&gt;Verified Purchase(What&#x27;s this?)&lt;br /&gt;This review is from: InstaNatural Organic Argan Oil For Hair, Face, Skin &amp; Nails - 100% Pure &amp; EcoCert Certified Organic Argan Oil Multipurpose Moisturizer, 4 Fluid Ounce (Health and Beauty)&lt;br /&gt;I bought this Argan Oil based on the great reviews it has and I have been very happy with the product. I add a couple pumps of it to my homemade vitamin C serum, and I also rub a few drops of the oil on my face in the morning before putting my makeup on. It gets absorbed very quickly, and keeps my skin moisturized and supple all day long. I don&#x27;t need any other moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I also have to thank InstaNatural for their outstanding customer service. When I first purchased their oil, the bottle opened in the package during delivery and oil leaked inside the box and all over the other products contained in my order. I contacted InstaNatural immediately and they promptly proceeded to send me a second bottle free of charge. I appreciate a company that is ready to go the extra mile to make sure that their customers are happy and is so ready to stand by their products.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you InstaNatural!</li>
            <li> Been using this almost daily for my hair. It goes right on without the heavyweight of other oils. I use olive oil on my nails, but you could use this.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using the Insta Natural Argan Oil Hair Treatment and Elixir for the last several weeks. She has reported softer, healthier feeling hair. When asked what her favorite thing about the oil is, she responded with the way it has leave in or wash out options, that it is natural and not full of chemicals or perfumes, the pump that gives her exactly the amount she needs for that particular day, and that because it is good for all hair types we can use it on our daughters as well as recommending it to anyone/everyone. It is refreshing to see products in which all the ingredients can be pronounced and it has such a natural feel and smell to it. It is a great product.</li>
            <li> love this oil for my hair and face and cuticles.  Very dry skin with dark spots  works well with softening them</li>
            <li> I put 8 drops on my hair every other day.  I have long wavy hair that I can easily straighten when I add the oil.  No frizz!!&lt;br /&gt;I do use it as my moisturizer under makeup and it is working quite well.  I will most likely be ordering more of this plus checking out other products sold by InstaNatural.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is nothing but miraculous in terms of its ability to soothe, heal, soften and bring youth back to the skin. This oil is lovely, but a little thinner in consistency than others I have used... however, the results have been the same.  Highly recommend it. There have been some reviewers that don&#x27;t think this is actually argan oil, since it does not have the &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; smell, or that it smells rancid.  I have not found that to be the case, and have just received my second bottle of this oil.  So, give this oil a try.  It will not disappoint you and the price is great for an organic product.  The company has very good customer service and is interested in honest opinions and feedback on their products.</li>
            <li> I have used this for almost 2 weeks now and my face and hands have never felt this soft. My face actually appears smoother with this oil than when I apply my primer---and I love the way primer makes my face look.  I am hoping to see an improvement in my nails, too. I have very soft, peeling nails, and have tried products specifically for those issues, but no success.  This argan oil might help with that...I will give it some time.  I have some of Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil products, but they are very expensive (they work, too).  When I compare the products vs the costs, I can&#x27;t imagine why I would ever need to spend the extra money again. I hope this manufacturer adds other products to their organic argan oil line-up.  Maybe some of the creams and lotions...  I would definitely buy them if they continue to be competitive with their pricing and make products that work as they should.  I enjoy the customer service this company provides, too. They follow-up with their customers to see if they are satisfied or have any problems or questions.  That is certainly rare these days!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> good oil. makes hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> works really well on my hair and skin, love it.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  I use it for around my eyes, my hands and my feet.  But I found it best to mix with lotion.  It seems to help distribute the oil very well and you don&#x27;t have this greasy look on your skin.  At first I use only on my face.  I am using quite a few products for my face to combat aging effect (sigh).  I added the Argan oil to my routine.  I put it on last mixed with the cream.  My skin certainly looks younger and fuller.  I have extremely sensitive skin.  After awhile, my cheek started to itch a bit.  So I stopped using it all over my face, but just focus around my eyes.  Again, I have extremely sensitive skin and most products don&#x27;t work for me.  So this is actually pretty good.  So far, I have used it for 2 months, and it doesn&#x27;t cause any problem around my eyes.  After seeing the effect on my face, I started using it on my hands.  In Connecticut, we had a very harsh winter, and my hands became very dry.  I mix the argan oil with Aveeno to apply over my hands.  Then I used it on my feet because the skin on my feet became very dry and cracky.  I used the Pediegg thing to remove the dry/old skin, and then put the oil on.  My feet feel very soft.  I don&#x27;t use it on my hair, but you can do that too.  I use the Argan hair mask from the same company for my hair.  It is very good for my hair.  My hair shines!  So check out that product as well.</li>
            <li> Using just a drop makes my hair look and feel oily - and I have very thick hair!</li>
            <li> Great product! Seller emailed all the ways to use this product and also did a follow up to make sure I was satisfied with the product! Definitely will purchase this one again!!!</li>
            <li> Disappointed very much. I don&#x27;t know why peple said it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I will purchase this item as long as it is available on Amazon.  I use this on hair, skin, and nails and it wonderful.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Low quality argan oil that is diluted and not pure. Doesn&#x27;t have the golden color and nutty scent&lt;br /&gt;Rancid. Smells sour and like vomit.&lt;br /&gt;Smells horrible. Look above&lt;br /&gt;Can cause bad reaction. It did to my friend who tried it on her face and caused bad rash&lt;br /&gt;Everything!</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way. Especially using it on my nails and cuticles with big improvement. Also a tiny drop wroth my facial moisturizer.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Packaging was very secure! Bottle has a squirt nozel which helps control the amount used. I bought the product because my face was insanely dry and I wanted something natural to add moisture to my skin. This is perfect for those of us who love our face to look smooth and healthy!!! I&#x27;ve used the product on my face for a few days and I will order more!</li>
            <li> It gives your hair a slight wet look. The product was a bit oily. I felt like a greaser if you put more than 1 small pump. A small bottle will easily last you more than a year. I will probably try another brand a year from now but I may buy this again if all brands are oily.</li>
            <li> Oil goes on smoothly and is a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; oil - meaning I don&#x27;t feel greasy after I use it. There is also no scent, which is a huge positive for me. I use it on body and face and it leaves skin soft and moisturized. Will definitely buy again when this bottle runs out!</li>
            <li> Good buy.  I love Argan Oil for my skin.  This is a little heavier then I am use to, but you just adjust the amount you put on.  I use twice a day morning and night after showers so I do love the larger size for the money savings.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops on my hair when it&#x27;s still wet. My hair looks so shiny and healthy after I blow dry. The oil helps with split ends and protects my hair against heat which is great. Plus, it&#x27;s 100 % pure and organic.  Nice seller and great customer service. Will keep using their products.</li>
            <li> Great oil. I use it everyday (more than once). I love the huge bottle; I use it on my face, my hair, my elbows ... Also, excellent customer service from this company and that is a major plus! Great customer service always wins me over!</li>
            <li> Love it over 50 younger men think I am much younger.  Have been married 35 years.  I have young single men asking me out.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Great smell and works excellent. Clears blemishes, hydrates skin very well and moisturizes cuticles.</li>
            <li> Love it.! My hair was really dry and this product is giving it shine and protection. I also use it on my face every night. I also use it on my baby&#x27;s hair after I shower her.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love the easy spray bottle. Doesn&#x27;t give the oily feel. Geeat for the skin.</li>
            <li> good price and good product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item along with the Niacinamide Cream Serum from my friend&#x27;s Amazon account since she has the Prime, so then I can try it out sooner. I love this argan oil. I have been using this on my face and hair everyday for about 3 months now. The oil keeps my skin moisturized and no more breakouts! And also it keeps my hair so soft. I&#x27;ve tried more expansive brand of argan oil, I can&#x27;t tell any difference. but for the price, I love this better.</li>
            <li> Love - Love - Love this Argan oil. 100% Pure &amp; Certified Organic Cold Pressed Moroccan Argan Oil. What&#x27;s not to love? And at a great price. I use it on my face and around my eyes. I use it on my body and in my hair. It is wonderful. This Argan oil has replaced most of my other moisturizing products as well as my styling products for hair. My husband also uses it and loves it. I even purchased a bottle for most of my favorite people for Christmas last year. Wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Argan Oil for a couple of weeks and like it very much for skin, hair &amp; nails. Not crazy about the fragrance, but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I love this company. If you are looking for top quality and excellent service I highly recommend them. My skin and hair love this product. I use it daily and the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  I have ditched my regular moisturizer in favor of Argan Oil.  I simply use one little pump, which coats the tips of my fingers, to moisturize my face before putting my makeup on in the morning.  I have always had a problem finding a moisturizer that takes care of my dry skin, and I&#x27;ve finally found it.  It&#x27;s healing as well.  I had a small brown patch on my face that I had picked at and after using my Argan Oil, it healed up in no time.  I make a lot of my own personal care products, such as shampoo and body butter, and it works great in those too.  Highly recommend it.!</li>
            <li> WOW WHAT A SAVINGS OVER JOSSEY&#x27;S JUST NO SCENT</li>
            <li> After one application on my face and hair...my face is softer and my hair smoother !!! I&#x27;m so happy with the oil. It does not have any scent. I used it over night and woke up with super smooth face and hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re curious to find whether Argan Oil works for you, this bottle from InstaNatural is a good start, especially for the price. I personally feel there is no need to buy Argan Oil based solely on the name of the brand. This oil does just as good a job as any of the more expensive options that are on the market. The oil comes in a glass bottle, which is always a good indication of quality. I&#x27;ve been using this regularly for just about 2 months now and have had great results. My dry skin is always a struggle in winter, and argan oil does a wonderful job of penetrating the top layers of my skin and bringing much needed moisture and relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually when I use a cream based moisturizer alone, my makeup will end up settling on top of my skin and by mid day, my forehead appears scaly and dry. Adding argan oil to my skin care routine has made a huge difference for me. I personally use it as a base beneath my daily moisturizer, but other with less dry skin may be able to get away with just this.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery!! Product as described!!</li>
            <li> It works very well on my skin and hair. A must Buy!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Moroccan hair oil for 2 years now and decided to finally try the real thing, what they claim is the main ingredient - argan oil. This is 100% pure, organic argan oil; with no synthetic fragrances or fillers. 1-2 drops rubbed into the tips of my hair and -voila- shiny, soft hair. Works great as a hand moisturizer, absorbs easily and makes your hands baby soft. The pump as a dispenser is also great - especially compared to other oil products that have droppers that leak, particularly when you only need a few drops. A little goes a long way. Interesting complex smell, like a mix of chocolate and olives...hard to describe but pleasant and not overpowering. Highly recommend this product and this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural stands behind all of their products and provides some of the best customer service out there. This oil arrived with a small leak in the box on delivery. I emailed InstaNatural and mentioned the leak. Without hesitation, the next day they shipped a replacement oil at no cost! The new one arrived with no leak and was absolutely free! I was very impressed with how they showed they care.</li>
            <li> I use the oil on my body and love the soft texture it gives. I use it on my face at night and a little in my hair after washing it.. Gives a healthy controlled sheen and I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a scent but this is very natural and true to what it says it does and doesn&#x27;t have a scent at all</li>
            <li> Actually I first heard about Argan oil from my hairdresser. It makes my hair so shinny. Love it.</li>
            <li> this is my 2nd bottle of Argan oil from this company. I use it in my hair, hands and face and am very happy with it. I do not know what some of the other reviewers are complaining about as far as the smell. I do not detect this oil having a smell. I like a bit of fragrance on my skin, therefore I mix some lavender oil  to it before using.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me. The first time I used it, I experienced a mild discomfort. The second use was much worse. Itching and hives.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Works awesome for hair and face!</li>
            <li> great product and service</li>
            <li> loved it order my second bottle today , it has a nutty smell but it fades after a minute or two. My skin is silky thanks to this product I apply twice daily after showers. For hair I have very thick n dry hair: it&#x27;s done some good for it but it&#x27;s not enough on it own to fix my hair problem. Would defiantly recommend for skin use.  Only con: I wishthe bottle was bigger</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing for my hair.  My hair tends to dry out a bit in the summer, and the dreaded frizzies that come with extra humidity around here.  After I shower, I&#x27;ll put a few squirts of this in my hair (concentrating on the ends), then follow up with my normal routine of gel.  This combination completely reduces/eliminates frizz and leaves my hair soooooo smooth, brings out the curls, isn&#x27;t greasy or oily feeling and lasts all day! The pump is a great feature, very easy to use and to control the amount of product used.  There are times when I don&#x27;t have time for a wash, yet my hair needs to have some taming - a little bit of this and I can regain that softness with no frizz.  The scent is an &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; type scent, not overpowering, but smells natural - it makes me feel great that the product I&#x27;m using is all natural.  After applying it, I rub my hands together and the oil spreads nicely (it is a bit thicker than say, coconut oil) and soaks in.  I use it on my arms and tattoo - it brings out the colors in the tattoo and leaves my skin so soft and again, not oily!  I&#x27;m very pleased with this!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted! ! 100%. Will repurchase</li>
            <li> After a couple of days this product started to smell terribly...actually smells like vomit...badly!! The company sent me something prior to receiving my oil saying that natural Argan oil has a smell to it, but this is so bad I can no longer stomach using it. It&#x27;s a bummer because it is a nice big bottle and I absolutely love how Argan oil makes my skin feel. This is my third bottle, first from this company, and this is the first time I&#x27;ve experienced this putrid smell. :(</li>
            <li> This oil is awesome!!!  I love love love it!!!</li>
            <li> This Argan Oil is fantastic, and the price is even better.&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing this as &#x27;stocking stuffers&#x27; for my girlfriends this year.&lt;br /&gt;I have compared ingredients with other brands that are 5x the price and there is no difference.&lt;br /&gt;This seller has excellent customer service, any and all questions answered.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> Really great product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for my hair and face.  It absorbs completely and smells great.</li>
            <li> Works well so far. It came quickly and is comparable to other Argan Oils I have used.</li>
            <li> The product does seem to be as described, I&#x27;m disappointed in the packing. This &amp; another essential oil were packed in a large box that  included a case of six 32 oz. bottles of juice.  Both oils were out of their packages, banging around loose in the large box &#x3D; insufficient packing material. Also, the frigid temperatures [currently 13 degrees] had both oils nearly frozen, one had crystalized!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see much of a difference between this brand and other brands of Argan Oils. It&#x27;s good and I use it in my hair and on my face as moisturizer. I gave it 5 stars, though, for the size you get for the price you pay. It&#x27;s amazing!! With some of the other brands you pay more and you get less. Definitely try this out, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard many great things about InstaNaturals Organic Argan Oil, I had a friend who used it and her skin looked amazing, I ordered the oil but it spilled in the box for some reason the packaging came damaged.  I didn&#x27;t really get to enjoy the oil but put a little bit on my hands.. Oh so smooth my hands felt as for the rest  of  All of the oil it was leaked in the box.. As for Amazon they were so gracious to refund me back for all the products that were damaged, Thanks Amazon.. As for the Oil, just from the little I was able to rub on my hands wow it made my skin feel nice... Pretty soon I will try again and reorder, I could tell that this Argan oil is of good quality by the texture.. The  only thing is I hope the company reinforces it&#x27;s packing perhaps bubble wrap the bottle make sure the cap is sealed tight and put pieces of foam so a spill won&#x27;t occur, unless it came from an amazon location. Nevertheless,  good packaging can avoid spills like this from happening because truly the Argan oil is really fine..  Thank you...</li>
            <li> This stuff cured my dandruff/dry scalp after the prescription shampoo from my dermatologist did nothing.  I guess it was just the winter dryness that caused it.  I use it on my toddler&#x27;s cradle cap as well (it washes out of her hair much more easily than baby oil).  Now that I&#x27;m pregnant again, I plan to use it as a moisturizer and avoid all the chemicals that are in most lotions.  The only downside of the oil being completely pure with no additives is that it doesn&#x27;t smell nice.  It has a mild natural smell that isn&#x27;t bad but that I don&#x27;t really like.  But that&#x27;s a small price to pay for a natural product!  I like the pump bottle too.</li>
            <li> I use this for my beard. I have now started using the oil for my finger nails. The oil has really soften up my nails and they are not tearing as easy as they were. So for either of these uses, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> There were so many argan oils on Amazon I seriously didn&#x27;t know where to start. I think I was stuck between getting this or the Pura d&#x27;or argan oil but went with this since it was a few dollars cheaper. It also didn&#x27;t hurt that this product was ECOCERT and USDA certified organic which is always a plus.    I received the product within 2 days via Amazon prime. It is housed in pretty amber bottle which I appreciate since the packaging limits sun exposure which may potentially degrade the oil and reduce the time the oil stays fresh. The bottle came with a pump which squeezed out a tiny amount of product which I love because I HATE dropper type of packaging since I  never fully control the amount of product coming out. You get just the right amount of product to cover the face and potentially the neck when using this product.    The product smells kind of nutty, kind of like Tamanu oil if you ever used it (but it smells a lot better since Tamanu smells like s*** and this is at least bearable) and little bit like soy sauce (I seriously dont know if its cause I put soy sauce in my cooking Im super sensitive to the smell but seriously it smells like a tint of soy sauce O.O). I have use a multitude of different facial oils before and I appreciate how quickly this product absorbs into the skin without making it feel super sticky and nasty. I would classify this as a lighter dry oil like Rosehip Oil. As for the effects, my skin felt plump and moisturized after using the oil and not overly greasy like other carrier oils. In the morning I would wake up and my skin kind of looked glowy (not really sure since theres always a fine line between glowy and oily but lets go with glowy). My skin would stay sufficiently moisturized throughout the day which is good since winter heating ravages my skin like no other.  I did not break out from this product which I was thankful for since I break out from basically anything and everything under the sun since my skin is so freaking sensitive.Overall, I believe the quality of the product is exceptional. Packing is great. Smell could be changed but I&#x27;ll deal with it since the product itself works so well. But yeah if your on the fence whether to go with this brands argan oil compared to the hundreds on argan oils on Amazon, its worth a shot!</li>
            <li> I love this oil!  It has been amazing on both my face and for my nails.  I also like the pump at the top...it is so much easier to use than a dropper!  Love this product!</li>
            <li> Really good stuff. I prefer the dispenser on this bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am using it on my hair, face and hands and see a difference already.</li>
            <li> I like this more for my nails than anything and the dropper makes for easy precision targeting of my cuticles when I want to moisturize them. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love to use this wonderful product on different parts of the body such as my face, neck, elbows, hands, nails, knees, feet, scalp, and hair.  I love using it wherever I encounter dryness.  I apply it right after a bath or shower.  It absorbs quickly and soon afterward, if not immediately, the area looks and feels softer and more moisturized.</li>
            <li> I keep a bottle at my computer desk. My hands drink this stuff up! Great for my nails too!</li>
            <li> The delivery was as expected...superfast</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I use Instanatural emu oil and love that product. I received a free bottle of Instanatural Argan oil to try. Everything the emu oil was doing the Arigan oil added to. I never had a lot of wrinkles, I am 71,just some lines around my mouth and on my forehead  I hardly notice them now. And my skin glows!  This is a fast absorbing oil. A little goes a long way. And be sure to rub it in. It is great for moisturizer, hair and nails.&lt;br /&gt;No need to try other brands Instanatural is my brand.</li>
            <li> Organic Argan Oil from InstaNatural is wonderful! My order came on time (very prompt) . The Argan oil has so many uses and just helps especially in the winter dry air. I use it for hair, face, at night for moisturizer and nails. I would order again from InstaNatural and plan to check out their other products.</li>
            <li> The product works as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy, so I can only put it on the very ends of my hair or when I&#x27;m planning to wash it the next day.  Haven&#x27;t tried it on my nails, but I have dry, ugly cuticles so I am curious to see if it will help this winter.  Seems to be quality at a great price!</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan Oil for a few months now and I love it. There are so many uses for this product, you can use it for many parts of your body. It is great for dry heels and skin. I also use a drop on my cuticles and they look so much healthier. I add a few drops to my hair to prevent split ends (it has been working very well for that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very good and versatile product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer: I received this complimentary product for review. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This oil is like a miracle in a bottle! As an African woman with A LOT of hair issues this oil has allowed me to use just this product on my hair as a leave-in conditioner, heat protector and adds sheen! My hair is soft and beautiful and it finally MOVES! It smells amazing as well and I always use the excess on my cuticles. In short this is the best thing ever!</li>
            <li> I love this product. The oil is so useful for skin, hair, nails.  It leaves your skin so soft.  It has a clean smell. I don&#x27;t go anywhere without it!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It totally exceeds my expectations. Received great customer service, quick delivery. I will definately purchase this again!!!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this to apply on my stretch mark scars. But I been using this on my face and I&#x27;m honestly surprised it started making you look abit younger and gives your face the shine it needs! I am living in a really dry area so moisturizer is a must for me or else my skins start cracking, especially in fall and winter...and this kills two birds with one stone; make my skins shine and prevent cracking. Now I don&#x27;t know if this remove scars but so far they look less obvious now. Overall, a good product for its price.</li>
            <li> I used to loose 70-80 hairs on daily basis but now it reduced to 20. Thanks Argan oil.</li>
            <li> Will not repurchase, I have dry skin on my face, usually use bio oil, wanted something natural. Tried this. Have been using it for over 3 weeks. It really does not agree with my skin. It looks worse, (example, I put it all over my face including eye area, the next morning my eye lids look like prunes, had no issue with bio oil doing that, tried it a couple of times, with same results) doesn&#x27;t seem to hydrate my skin as well as the previous product I used. The smell is unpleasant. I think I need to go back to the drawing board with this one.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied by the quality of this product. I used the argan oil for my skin (face and hands) and I was impressed with the moisture that it provided (I only had to use 2 drops to cover my face and hands in the same application) . I was a bit worried before purchasing it by the smell of it (I have used jojoba oil before, but I hate the smell of it). This product has a really nice smell, a bit on the nutty side. It is certified organic (it has the label on the back of the printed label).</li>
            <li> 1. This is an excellent oil. I use it for my beard and it helps tremendously in controlling the frizz (beard hair is a lot thicker and frizzier than head hair btw).&lt;br /&gt;2. You don&#x27;t need to use more than 10 drops each time, so this 4 fl oz bottle lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;3. The seller is really nice, he talks to his customers very respectfully and warmly.&lt;br /&gt;4. I am not an oil expert, but for what it&#x27;s worth I do believe this is 100% argan oil. And here&#x27;s my little proof for saying that: I have used olive oil, coconut oil and a couple of hair serums before, and none of them have worked as well as this. We all know from reading online that argan oil is the best for hair. Since this has been the best for my hair (albeit among a limited number of alternatives) this must be argan oil! ;)</li>
            <li> Not only is ths product great but the company is outstanding.  They gave me a list of suggestions for what this product can be used for and have checked to see if I am satisfied since purchasing.  Great company to buy from I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Really good hair and skin product</li>
            <li> I ordered this with the Rosehip Oil. Again, the communication with the seller was phenomenal. They stand behind their product, are extremely knowledgeable about it and reply to your questions immediately. Moreover, the product came packaged beautifully and looked professional. I also, I really love the pump delivery. It keeps everything clean and sanitary. I have really enjoyed using it and see a difference in my skin already.</li>
            <li> I bought this brand because it&#x27;s cold pressed and organic. I&#x27;ve used it for the past 4 days on my hands and neck, which were looking very dry and crepey. I&#x27;ve noticed a definite improvement in my skin; it&#x27;s moisturized without being greasy. I like it that the bottle comes with a dropper because you really only need a few drops.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very fond of the smell. I purchase argan oil often because I love the smell but this wasn&#x27;t very appealing unfortunately.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the scent of the argan oil.  It is not much of a scent, however it does slightly smell like an unused cloth bandaid when first applying. For the price, however, I can deal with a slightly unpleasant scent as the scent does not linger. The oil is absorbed quickly into my skin and it is an amazing moisturizer.  I do not have any breakouts from this argan oil.  I have been using argan oil for about 6 months now and I also use this on minor scrapes for my daughters.  It greatly improves healing time and helps reduce scars.  I would most definitely purchase this specific brand again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with InstaNatural Argan Oil. I&#x27;ve used it on my hair and have experienced noticeable results. It works great when applied to my fine, thin, curly hair giving it shine and body without weighing my hair down. It is the only product I use in my hair after years of trial and error using expensive products, creams, and gels. I have also, used this oil on my nails and cuticles. It is a wonderful, non-greasy moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived promptly with no issues. I would order this product again.</li>
            <li> Besides using this product on my hair, hands and feet, I also use this product in lieu of a moisturizer for my face.  My skin looks and feels so much better.  I&#x27;d rather use this natural one ingredient product than a manufactured moisturizer with garbage ingredients in it.  Just a small drop is needed.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it for her feet.</li>
            <li> Great for skin, hair, everything! Love the dispencer...........far better than a dropper.</li>
            <li> Remember to exfoliate your dry scalp first!! It took amount 10 minutes to apply it. I left it in my scalp/hair for one whole day. It reduced my dry scalp dramatically after the first usage.</li>
            <li> Silky, smooth, shiny, not oily... better (in my opinion) than Josie Maran-- which I love by the way.</li>
            <li> Good buy for your money. Use it in my hair and on my nails. Good addition in mixing body butters. Will buy again</li>
            <li> This is great stuff! I wish I knew about this along time ago really works its magic!</li>
            <li> Love this product. It is amazing for both my hair and my skin. Thanks so much</li>
            <li> This is a great versatile oil! I&#x27;ve been using on my hair. It  helps smooths split ends, frizziness and dryness from my hair. This oil is also fast-absorbing and long lasting. I’ve been using it on my nails and hair and love the results. It doesn’t really have a scent to it, but it absorbs quickly. At night, I&#x27;ve been mixing it in with my hand cream too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own</li>
            <li> The oil works very well. The only problem is that a small portion of it had leaked out in the box.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it is just great.</li>
            <li> BEST QUALITY, SO useful for various parts, such as hair, face, foot etc, ans also reasonable price, I am so happy to meet this wonderful product in amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. It is probably one of the best I&#x27;ve use thus far and that includes Jojoba, shea butter, black Jamaican, etc. It was recommended by a couple of co-workers and my daughter, so I decided to try it! A great choice for skin and nails. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Have been using it on the eczema on my face it took the dry spots away within a day! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> perfect product. i really enjoy using it and added it to my everyday routine !</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I really love how it is light and yet very moisturizing I use this oil as my night cream and my skin feels soft next day  very reasonable price,Great product really and good customers services will definitely recommend to my friend and will come back for more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased or used argan oil before cause I could never bring myself to pay the high prices I&#x27;ve seen for it. But my sister has been using it for years and so I&#x27;ve both smelled and seen it. So let&#x27;s start with what I already know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Real pure argan oil is a clear golden colour, with the texture you&#x27;re expecting from an oil. This is golden, but very thick, almost viscose and cloudy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Argan oil has a faintly nutty, though not unpleasant scent. Another reviewer stated that this one smelled like vomit, and I figured, hyperbole. Nope, I promise you, this smells like straight up, throwup. Made my stomach turn and I almost lost my dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, why did I finally take the plunge and purchase this when I was so reluctant in the past? I didn&#x27;t. This is my fourth product from this company. The first three they sent me for blog review purposes gave me the worst reactions to skincare that I&#x27;ve had in a long time, and ever really from a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brand. I&#x27;m talking a burning, itching face and swollen eyes. When I contacted them and let them know this, they offered me this product for my sensitive skin. I told them sure why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be using this, it&#x27;s going straight in the bin. From a company that I was already a bit leery of, to get something that is almost the polar opposite of the product it purports to be, makes me highly suspicious, and I won&#x27;t take chances with either my skin or hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They may not be a sham, but I don&#x27;t trust their products, and something is most definitely fishy about their product line.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST Argan oil I have EVER used!! I have tried many different brands and this one is PERFECT!! One pump does my whole face.. Other brands I had to use a lot more and never seemed to absorb very well. Makes the best moisturizer for face, body, and hair. Does wonders on my sons dry patchy itchy skin as well.  Argan oil has so many uses and I&#x27;m so glad I have found the Perfect one!! Very Happy customer .. Very Very Good Company with wonderful customer service</li>
            <li> Lovely multi-use product as advertised.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> quality product will buy again</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful. The only issue I had was that it had leaked oil when it arrived. It wasn&#x27;t enough for me to return it for another, but packaging methods should be modified in the future to avoid this problem.</li>
            <li> I love argan oil and have used it for years on eczema... its very soothing.. I used a few drops daily on my feet for amazing relief.</li>
            <li> my husband said best product for dry skin!</li>
            <li> This organic Argan Oil is so good! It is not greasy and absorbs quickly. I like it on my hair and I use it on my face and hands. It makes your hair so shiny and healthy looking. The one suggestion I would have is that the dispenser bottle have a small nozzle on it - sort of like a soft soap bottle. That way you could see better how much oil is coming out. Love this product!!</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel amazing.  It goes right in, and it has a fresh, clean scent.  I had been using jojoba oil, but this is even better.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I have used a few different argan oil products for my hair this one is the best by far.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only moisturizer I am using these days. Keeps my skin smooth all day long. I love it!</li>
            <li> Great price - just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is produced from the kernels of the argan tree (argania spinosa) and is found exclusively in morocco. It is the rarest and most expensive oil on earth and is used mainly to moisturise hair, skin, nails, face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received for review the product is presented in a 120mL brown glass bottle and comes with a capped pump action spray. It is colourless, relatively runny and has a pleasant mild nutty odour. It is very fast absorbing and leaves a thin shiny layer of oil on your skin after it has been applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application of the product is done differently for each body region, however in general it involves using only 1-3 drops per application and it is likely to be more effective if used every 1-2 days:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair-&lt;br /&gt;Apply 1-3 drops to the scalp or hair of washed hair and massage the oil in gently. Leave on hair for 30 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin-&lt;br /&gt;Apply 1-3 drops to a washed face and massage into skin in a circular motion. Leave to dry for 3-5 mins and add makeup (if required).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nails-&lt;br /&gt;Apply 1-3 drops around cuticles and fingertips and leave to absorb naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product for several days I found that it made my hair, skin and nails shinier and covered up my scars and skin imperfections very well with a thin layer of oil. My skin looked hydrated and healthy without feeling greasy. I have not been using it for long enough to see what it can do with continued use however I will document my findings in this review over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product also has the benefits of being organic and extremely concentrated which means that it&#x27;s much healthier for your body and is likely to last a lot longer than other products which may need to be used in much larger amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Rarest and most expensive oil on earth.</li>
            <li> Good oil, use it on my hair and it feels OK</li>
            <li> I usually buy Josie Moran Argan oil but thought I would try this one.  I will not buy this one  again.  it smells,  it has a heavier consistency and does not absorb as quickly.  I have discontinue using for my face and now use for on my feet until it is gone.</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan Oil for only a short time, so I cannot attest to its benefits. I live in a desert climate and dry skin is a problem. I used it on my face and liked that it didn&#x27;t feel oily, but when it used it in my hair, even the very small amount I used made my hair feel oily. So, I&#x27;m only using it on my face for now and will report back as soon as I&#x27;ve finished using one bottle.</li>
            <li> I love it, my hair loves it, my skin loves it, and my dog even loves it!  Best results for me so far are by using a pea-sized amount on the bottom half of damp hair.</li>
            <li> Winderful, soothing, awesome !</li>
            <li> No words can describe how amazing this product is! Long story short, I am in my twenties, male, growing out my hair a little past my shoulders - I wash it once a week. Before discovering this product, my hair would begin to show signs of oiling halfway into the week... but not anymore thanks to this 100% Argan oil by InstaNatural. I pour a small amount on tower dried hair and let it air dry, two hours later my hair is so freaking sleek and shiny! and best of all it last an entire week and completely eliminates my dirty/oily look! Totally recommended it! Will be ordering more as soon as I run out.</li>
            <li> So glad I tried this product. I love that its pure and organic with no detrimental ingredients. I use it on my face, hair, hands, elbows etc. It really rehydrates my face and makes it soft and not oily. A few drops is enough to cover the entire face. It absorbs very well not leaving an oily residue. The oil has no smell which is great. My skin has never looked better. And the customer service the BEST! Thankyou InstaNatural for making this product:)</li>
            <li> Feels great to put on dry skin. Especially when our water gets hard and dries your skin/hair out a bit. No smell that I can detect, which is actually kind of nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve primarily just used this on my hands. This winter, my hands became horribly dry. My nails were peeling and cracking like never before. I&#x27;ve always had issues with thing nails, but it was noticeably worse. I bought this to try. I use this at least a few times a week. My nails are growing longer with less splitting and peeling than anytime I can remember. Happy I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I love Argan oil - this one comes in a bigger bottle than most with a pump top. I find it to be naturally healing and fine even for my very sensitive skin. I do put it on my face and hair. I&#x27;ve also added essential oils to make it like a relaxing spa treatment.</li>
            <li> I use this argan oil every day. It has a mild scent that doesn&#x27;t bother me. I use it liberally as a face moisturizer and a little in my hair after showering. It has never made me break out. I also use it on cuts or irritated skin. Sometimes I use it on my body or over my tattoos to moisturize, but usually use coconut oil for my body since it is less expensive. Despite my frequent use one bottle lasts me months. I also like the new pump versus the dropper they used to use.</li>
            <li> arrived fast great for hair, face ,</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price. I put some of this in my hair after a shower and let it air dry and the argan oil keeps my hair looking naturally in control and keeps it nice and soft.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used it on my hair.  It shines and defrizzes.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT QUALITY! i love it. the service is great as well.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase from instanatural and I&#x27;m very pleased. The argan oil is a wonderful beard conditioner.</li>
            <li> When I got to try this argan oil it is incredibly lightweight and is easily soaked into the skin and hair. It is a bit potent in scent, but for 100% pure, what do you expect? The scent quickly disappears once it is absorbed into the skin or hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I used it on my hair a bunch as well as my cuticles while reviewing it over the last few weeks. My nails tend to get really dry and rough this time of year especially, and I love how noticeably smooth and soft my cuticles have been while using this amazing product. My nails look healthy and shiny too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it out on my face and my hands as a moisturizer too. I loved that even though it is an oil, my skin still soaked it up right away. It rubbed right in and didn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy at all. It also kept my skin feeling moisturized all day long! My skin seemed to look and feel healthier and it gave it a nice glow as well.</li>
            <li> Insta Natural 100% Pure Argan Oil from Morocco is the perfect product for skin and hair. It absorbs into the skin so quickly and leaves it silky smooth, with no oily or sticky residue. My skin has the dryness, wrinkles, and brown spots that come with a very long life that has been well lived, and it is also super sensitive. Finding something that alleviates the dryness and doesn&#x27;t irritate has been a life-long quest. And the quest is over: I found argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insta Natural Argan Oil comes in a beautiful dark blue glass bottle (always buy argan oil in dark colored glass to prevent degradation) and with a dropper in the top. I find that half a dropper of oil is all I need to cover face and neck, and it&#x27;s an ideal moisturizer alone or under makeup. It&#x27;s also a marvel for hands and cuticles that have the \\&quot;dishpan\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic, cruelty free, preservative and fragrance free...and something must be said about its unique aroma. It&#x27;s an aroma that becomes more appealing with time. I have grown to absolutely love it. Insta Natural&#x27;s oil is a bargain at any price, and this 4 oz. bottle will last a long time, with each drop of treasured oil absorbed and appreciated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soooo excited that I&#x27;ve found a place to order this marvelous product at this price.  I use Argan oil not only on my face but my hair, arms, hands and legs also. 5 stars in my book!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I have purchased it 3 times and will continue to do so.  I use this as a beauty product, and an ingredient in my handmade soaps and creams.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I love argan oil and this brand makes the best. This company is outstanding - I received the bottle with a cracked top an wasn&#x27;t sure what to do. I checked my email 2 days after receiving the oil and the company had sent a personal email making sure I was satisfied. Who does that?! Not many people... So I replied asking if they sell replacement tops with the squirt dispenser and they are actually sending me one for free. I am thrilled that they are getting my business! Also I used to buy a brand that came in a 1oz container and this 4oz bottle is awesome. Will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> This oil is great for moisturizing and even for my hair. There is a faint smell which goes away after a few seconds. I&#x27;ve tried other brands which were smaller bottles and far more expensive, but this was a great quantity for natural, organic argan oil with a reasonable price tag.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Argon oil because I&#x27;m sensitive to most hair products,  I found that it is great on my hair, made it less flyaway, very soft and manageable and I didn&#x27;t have a reaction to it. Yay! Feeling brave, I tried it as a night moisturizer for my face and I woke up with a pimple on my nose, first one in many moons. So for me it works wonderfully for hair, not so much for my face. But I still gave it 5 stars as it&#x27;s an organic product that is pure, without additional ingredients, sustainably produced and does exactly what it says for my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the argan oil, it is a great facial night cream/ oil for me and all natural without chemicals</li>
            <li> I have been using Insta Natural Argan Oil for two weeks and instantly noticed a change in my nails, a huge change, no splitting, cracking, breaking and the cuticles look great too !  My face is much softer but the wrinkles show only a slight improvement, I&#x27;m 66 and always looking for a miracle face lift in a bottle.  Maybe I expect too much.  I mix the oil with my moisturizer ....it&#x27;s not oily or leave a film.  I will continue to purchase this product and would recommend it to all.  Everyone wants smooth skin, even your feet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a little over 2 weeks and I love the results.  it is the best Argan Oil I&#x27;ve ever used.  I use it on my face, neck and hair, my skin is softer and more radiant, my hair which tends to be dry and frizzy looks and feels a lot better.  A few drops goes a long way. I love the fact that it is organic and packaged in a glass bottle.</li>
            <li> Great buy, high quality product. Use just a drop or two to moisturize face after cleansing.  I&#x27;ve also used on my hair after shampooing/conditioning to give it a little more shine.  Good sized bottle that will last forever.</li>
            <li> Great oil. I use for my hands and nails and it helps keeping them in top shape. Its a big bottle for that money, it will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;Good seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing so far, that it smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mother and she fell in love with it! She has raved about it so much that I purchased one for my self today! Cant wait to use it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. After being indoors this cold, cold season this product was a welcomed relief for dryness. Liked the idea of being able to use on Hair and skin. I have been very pleased and would definitely recommend this product to friends and family!</li>
            <li> 100% organic argan oil from Morocco.  I use it on my face to moisturize and all over my body.  My skin is smooth and soft. Although this is an oil, it is not oily.  If you order this elsewhere, you will pay 2-3 times more.</li>
            <li> Awesome producy !!  Awesome customer service.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural offers incredible customer service and wants you to be happy. I&#x27;m not crazy about the pump and would prefer a dropper bottle. The product is very good.</li>
            <li> Love this product. soaks in to my skin faster and feels more instantly hydrating than other organic Argan oils I&#x27;ve tried. I can mosturize and apply my makeup 15 or 20min later. I was NOT able to do that with other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It works better than a lot of argan oils I&#x27;ve used before and it controls frizz without weighting it down.</li>
            <li> I just discovered Argan Oil; I had purchased a much more expensive brand, and was happy with it, but my checkbook wasn&#x27;t so happy, it was so pricey.  That was until I discovered this brand,  it&#x27;s basically the same exact thing but for a fraction of the cost.  I love it.  I use it as a moisturizer.  Also for my hair and nails.  I LOVE IT!  leaves my skin so hydrated and makes hair shiny.  I would very highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I had doubts !!  Its just oil, so wondered what I could really expect.  It is true that its not as &#x27;greasy&#x27; as you would expect and that it soaks in pretty well.  I have been using it on my face and neck daily under my regular moisturizer.  I am beginning to see a difference in the texture and elasticity of my skin in those areas.  I am older (65) so I&#x27;m not expecting miracles, but it is doing nice things for me so far.  Haven&#x27;t tried it on my feet or hands as I&#x27;m busy using up other products there, but I am encouraged enough that I will try those areas next.</li>
            <li> I had not tried Argan Oil until recently; now that I have, coconut oil has a worthy competitor. InstaNatural Argan oil is alright, although three drops is not always quite enough.</li>
            <li> Great product, love it!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product, really, I did.  I have never used argan oil and was excited to try it.  However, after using it for a day or so, I noticed an odd smell...something on the order of slightly rancid almonds.  Having no previous experience with this oil, I wasn&#x27;t sure if that was normal and discontinued using it.  Fast forward 2 months to today, I asked a friend who has used argan oil for years to smell it.  Immediately, she told me that it was old.  She agreed that it smelled rancid.  My bottle has a sticker with an expiration date of 12/16.  It is too late for me to return the bottle and to be fair to the seller, I want you to know that I did not contact them. (The option is no longer available in my past order list, presumably since it&#x27;s been more than 30 days.)  Perhaps I just got a bad bottle, but for those of you who may be new users like me, if yours smells old, it probably is.</li>
            <li> I regret trying a new salon recently because my hair was over processed. I&#x27;ve experimented on a bunch of products since to help restore the fried ends. This product does not contain alcohol and does a good job improving the condition of my strands. It also does really well keeping my hair close to tangle-free.</li>
            <li> This is the best Argan Oil we have ever tried...and we have tried a lot!  My son uses this on his hands several times a week after he goes rock climbing.  Now that it is warm, he climbs twice a week outdoors, and once a week indoors.  This leaves the callouses on his hand (they are necessary to protect his hand), but smooths, softens and heals.  His hands feel like silk.  It is also noteworthy that he is a busser at a busy restaurant for work (really hard on hands also).  I add a few pumps to my lotion bottle, and it leaves my skin smooth and silky without any greasy residue.  This is an exceptional price for such an amazing multi-use beauty tool.  Love it!</li>
            <li> The Product is good and on Time</li>
            <li> Just received this a week back and loving it. The skin does feel smooth. I got an email from InstaNatural which is first from any maker for me. They sent a write up of all the good things about this. Looking forward to at least some of those.</li>
            <li> I love argan oil.  I use it on my face and hair.  It give a beautiful shine to my hair without leaving it oily.  For my face it is quickly absorbed and leaves my skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I seems to be authentic. I use it from head to toe. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love! So much better price than QVC.</li>
            <li> This is pretty amazing stuff. It only contains 100% pure, certified organic argan oil. That&#x27;s it. You can use it for so many things! I&#x27;ve been using a couple pumps in my hair after I wash it and as a cuticle oil, but you can apply directly onto the skin or mix with your favorite lotion, too! I really liked the lightweight feel of this. It&#x27;s a much bigger bottle than what I&#x27;ve gotten in stores and with all its uses, it is well worth the price! Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
            <li> I use it daily, and with the reasonable price, I can afford this awesome product.</li>
            <li> I love to shop from amazon .com.&lt;br /&gt;They have everything l am looking for.&lt;br /&gt;good product and best prices.</li>
            <li> I use to pumps after I wash my hair and the ends feel amazing! I live in an area that has hard water and use shampoo bars, SI my ends are sometimes a little dry. I took my cousin&#x27;s advice and purchased this. You have a devoted customer!</li>
            <li> Now using my second bottle. I have very sensitive skin, which is getting dryer with age. The Argan Oil has worked wonders for my face. Everyone keeps telling my how my skin seems to glow. A bonus side of this oil is that I massage a little on my nails after massaging it on my face. My nails have improved noticeably, and are growing stronger without breaking or peeling. It is also great for dry, fine hair. I just run my fingers through my hair after applying the oil to my face and my hair is much healthier looking as well.&lt;br /&gt;Love the new pump spray vs the dropper version before.</li>
            <li> The Argon oil was exactly what my daughter in law wanted for Christmas.  She was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It definitely compares to the more pricey brands that you find in the stores.  Use it every night + it has made such a tremendous difference in my face.  Will buy again!!</li>
            <li> I Received This Product Free Of Charge For An Honest And Unbiased Review To Sample And Share My Opinion About 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil By InstaNatural I Can Happily State That This Is Real Argan Oil. It&#x27;s Amber-Colored As It Should Be, With A Very Slight Olive-Like Scent Which Is Completely Normal And Natural. I Was Quite Interested To Try This Oil, Since According To The Description, It&#x27;s Good For Everything From Hair To Skin To Nails And Also With What I Have Read, That The Vitamin E And Fatty Acids In Argan Oil Repairs Damaged Skin And Provides It With Nutrients Which Will Prevent Further Dryness And Irritation.I Would Like To Start By Saying That I Really Liked The Bottle It Came In With Most Argan Oils I Have Tried Come With A Dropper And You Place The Drops In Your Hand. This One Comes With A Squirt Nozzle, Which Allows Me To Use A Little More Oil At One Time And Makes It More Easy To Use. I Have Used This Product For 2 Weeks I Tend To Use This Oil In My Hair As A Conditioner,  As A Moisturizer,  And On My Nails Toes/Fingers.</li>
            <li> Love it.  It adds a lot of shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> The item was as I expected.</li>
            <li> I loved that this product was 100% argan oil (most products list argan oil as one -- and not the first - ingredient).  I use it everywhere - hair, face, hands, feet, anywhere on my body.  The oil absorbs quickly so you can use it just minutes before putting on makeup or clothes.  If you haven&#x27;t tried argan oil, this is the product for you.  As I said, it&#x27;s 100% argan oil - great product; great service -- shipped immediately.</li>
            <li> Absorbs into my hands to fast before I can apply it to my hair</li>
            <li> Excellent product will order this again.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I have been using it daily and the skin softness is noticeable.  Great Product.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Slight smell.  Not offensive, but noticeable.  Goes away after a few minutes after application.</li>
            <li> Great for hair and skin. Works well for acne prone skin(if dry).</li>
            <li> It does the work...but has a weird smell...</li>
            <li> Love everything about this product.  The aroma is fantastic.  The bottle with the pump is very convienent.  I wear this product as a daily moisturizer with or without makeup. I also use it in my VERY dry hair in between shampoos to add shine.........it is amazing!  I carry one with me to work and have one on my make up table.  I will continue to purchase this product.  My skin is amazing............I am in my 40s and I am constantly being told I look like my 20 year old daughters sister............ARgon oil is amazing........this product is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is super fresh and the pump works really good really really wonderful quality oil!</li>
            <li> I use this for the ends of my hair and it does wonders. My hair has been softer and has a healthy sheen that wasn&#x27;t there before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my dry hair</li>
            <li> It makes my hair extremely greasy no matter how much oil I use. I tried to use it for my nails, but don&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> I love InstaNatural argan oil. I use it on my face after using vitamin C and hyaluronic acid.My skin looks better than it has in a long time. I use it on my hair and my body. I got it fast and at a great price.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this oil as a moisturizer and hair essence.  She is very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I have used Argan oil from other vendors and this is definitely the best I&#x27;ve used so far. After just 3 days, I noticed a significant difference in my skin and I plan on purchasing several more as I have been using it daily now for over 2 weeks and I am totally pleased with the results. I also like that the pump action to squirt the oil out of the glass bottle is not messy at all. In my opinion, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Order came fast and was a great size</li>
            <li> I have hair just past my shoulders, curly/wavy and often dry and frizzy. I rub one pump of this between my palms, run it through the ends of my hair, and everything becomes soft and springy, not at all greasy. Nice!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite argan oil and I was sad when I couldn&#x27;t afford to order it for a little while, but this is the only oil I will use for my skin and the ends of my hair. It truly works miracles! Great for fading dark marks and healing or &amp;#34;coating&amp;#34; split ends of hairs. I also noticed it restores elasticity to the skin, especially around the eyes and really delicate areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning the many ways that argan oil can be used, but so far I&#x27;m very glad I purchased it.  I&#x27;ve been using it daily on my face and hands, in place of the hand lotion I had been using.  My face is smoother and has cleared up an allergic rash that had been bothering me. The oil also has softened and moisturized my feet, which get very dry in winter.  I especially like its lack of odor, which helps anyone who is sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I purchased this on a friend&#x27;s recommendation. The product is pure argan oil, and because it absorbs right into your skin there is no greasy feeling left behind. It works especially well for those dry patches I get on my elbows, but frankly it&#x27;s the most versatile beauty product I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair - Use it on either wet or dry hair, reduces frizziness, but useful for all hair types as it adds shine without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Skin - Perfect for softening and hydrating the skin, no greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;Hands - Works wonders on those dry chapped hands, or returning softness to those hard working hands. I&#x27;ve also noticed my nails are a lot healthier since I started using this product, which is a nice bonus!&lt;br /&gt;Feet - Rub into tired and achy feet, or just to make your feet soft and touchable, the perfect after pedicure treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Face - A lovely non-greasy face moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great use is for scar tissue, since it softens and reduces itchiness. I really can&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough, I can truly say that it has replaced every other moisturizer that I used to buy, and I now look for all types of beauty products that contain argan oil in a pure form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also a nice size and good value for money, this oil can be pretty pricey but this particular brand is quite reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d love to know if this product is safe for babies, or nursing moms!</li>
            <li> Now that I’m entering the final weeks of my pregnancy, my skin needs all the moisturizing help it can get to make the last big stretch. The InstaNatural Organic Argan oil I received for review is perfect because it has just one Ingredient: 100% Pure Certified Organic Virgin Argan Oil (Argania Spinosa) and can be used on skin, hair, and nails (multi-use!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar is a great size, the oil is of good quality, and I’m all for a product that does multiple duties (hands, face, skin, hair, nails, etc.).</li>
            <li> I have tried this product on my face and hands and very happy with it , it absorb nicely.</li>
            <li> This product looks good and genuine. I bought  it for my wife  who started using it.  She really appreciate it and is even already recommending it to her friends. Great value.</li>
            <li> My wife saw this on one of the shopping networks for 4X the price.  Has an earthy fragrance but she doesn&#x27;t mind.  Pure oil.</li>
            <li> After using this for only a few weeks I already have healthier hair and skin!  My hair has even grown about half an inch where normally it just breaks off!  Love this product and have already told my friends about it!</li>
            <li> Fantastic company. Never have I seen such amazing customer service. The product itself is ok, but I have very dry skin and was hoping to get some relief by using this oil, unfortunately it didn&#x27;t really help that. However, it is a nice light oil, moisturizers ok, just not for my very rough dry patches. Highly recommend this company though.</li>
            <li> I love this Argan oil, it&#x27;s so versatile. I use it on my nails, rub it into the nails and also the cuticles. I add a few drops to my hair a couple of times a week, feels healthier and shiny.  I also use it when I get out of the shower, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> Nice product. Terrific value and very prompt service!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  My skin feels so hydrated and it&#x27;s not oily at all.  A little goes a long way.  My heels look amazing and it even works on psoriasis.  Keep up the good work!!!!!!  P.S.  great price!</li>
            <li> This is just a great product!! I am currently using for my hands and feet and planning to use my face as well. I love how smooth it makes your skin. Love it!</li>
            <li> 100% Organic Argan Oil, this is a very light quickly absorbed product. Not greasy. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 months and I&#x27;m very pleased. Goes well under makeup. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a short time but it makes my skin feel soft and supple with no greasy feeling whatsoever. If it continues to soften my 47 yr. old laugh lines, I will marry this oil! Great product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this Argan Oil.  It is a staple for me, and now for my hubby.  He&#x27;s had skin issues for years, but this wonderful oil has great healing properties.  It&#x27;s also a great anti-aging oil...I massage it into my face at night as a great moisturizer, which keeps my skin looking great. I&#x27;ve gotten used to the nutty scent, which goes away almost immediately.  I would recommend this product to improve the condition of your skin, hair and nails.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how the oil will work out over time,but I like the feel, low odor and it is 100% argan oil, no additives.  I will check back in and post on how it works over time.</li>
            <li> I love its lush texture. Even its mildly nutty smell is pleasant. Very pleased with your product. As good as the Argan oil I bought at a cooperative in Southern Morocco 4 years ago</li>
            <li> I was having some trouble with dry skin on the face. I tried jojoba oil which worked well but left my face feeling too greasy. This Argan oil works wonders. It smells a little bit nutty which is great. It goes on smooth and I usually forget I even put it on so I&#x27;m happy with that. I tried running some through my hair just to see what would happen. Wow I was surprised. It gave my hair this soft lustrous appearance and smooth feeling that I was not expecting. Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> I have used this organic ARGAN oil for about a month 1/2 and I am in love! It is so good I just use for about everything! Lol... I started using in my hair as a treatment then decide to use as a leave in and also to blow my hair works great! It leaves my hair shine and soft without weighting it down. Moreover, I noticed how nice it feels on my hands so I started to use also on my chest and legs they feel very smooth  it penetrates very well no greasy nothing like these. I&#x27;m now using on my nails too along my cuticles, I don&#x27;t know yet the results in my nails  I have hope that it will make them stronger (recently they have broken all the time). I am very happy with this oil It is so light, the skin and hair absorve very well I really love it! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I purchased the InstaNatural Argan Oil a few months ago and I love it so much I wanted to write a review. I use the oil as a daily moisturizer, applying it after washing my face. I let it dry for a few minutes and put my make-up on with no problem. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or make me look greasy. My favorite part about it is that the wrinkles on my forehead are hardly visible when I have the oil on. Definitely recommend this amazing, quality product over any other brand of Argan Oil I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I had a perm on my hair and my hair and scalp were so dry.  I have used the Argan oil for about a month now and my hair has improved 100%.  It is soft and silky and healthy looking.  Try it and see for yourself, remember that 1 drop goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;bb</li>
            <li> This is my very first time trying Argan Oil, actually I hadn&#x27;t even heard of it until I was offered a chance to get a bottle for free.  Amazing!  So it seems to have 100 different uses but I am using it on my very dry, thick and unruly hair and it is taming it!  I have red, thick, course hair and can spend tons of money buying all the different moisturizing products out there that offer no results!  But after shampooing I used a couple drops of the Argan Oil and rubbed it into my towel dried hair and then combed through before blow drying.  After blow drying I used a couple more drops and it smoothed down my hair, left it with a nice little sheen and very pleasant smelling!  The oil has a bit of a nutty scent to it, which I really like.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with all of the InstaNatural products I have had the pleasure of trying out and reviewing.  They use all natural, pure ingredients and they are all made right here in the USA.  So fun for me to go outside of the box and try new things I had never even heard of before vs. using chemical treatments!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before buying this but have been disappointed.  It was my first try at a natural oil for my face instead of &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; moisturizers.  It has an old smell, but I&#x27;m not too picky about that, I just haven&#x27;t noticed my skin feeling or looking any better since switches to this oil.  I&#x27;ve been using it for months now.  I even used a bunch on my scalp/hair once and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.  It works fine enough to finish the bottle but I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist keeps recommending a keratin treatment for my thick, course and bushy hair.  I ordered argan oil instead.  I am so glad I did.  My skin looks and feels healthy and my hair...I can&#x27;t believe this is my hair!  I have found that after only one application, I only need to apply the oil to my hair every 2 or 3 days.  After a week of use, I  can skip a day on my face.  This big bottle will last quite a long time.  I read that argan oil has a very long shelf life anyway.  On another note, Instanatural sent me an email with other beauty tips and after a few weeks, they sent me another email to make sure I am happy with the product.  Their offer of superior customer service was outstanding.  I will definitely order from them again!</li>
            <li> I like this oil but it&#x27;s a little bit heavy. .or thick better for body I think. ..I use it sparingly on my hair.</li>
            <li> I Love this oil and use it more than once everyday ... it is light ... very moisturizing ... I just ordered more.</li>
            <li> Great value, but I did notice a difference from the more expensive argan oils I use.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle did not state that it was cold pressed by the Berber community, like the more high-end, &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; ones do.&lt;br /&gt;What I did was went back to my other brand when using argan oil on my face, but continued to use this on my body and hair.&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is so multi-purpose: You can use it as your cleanser, in lieu of moisturizer or serum, as a leave-in or wash-out hair conditioner and even as a bath oil.  It is worth having a less-expensive, almost-as-good option on hand; you do not need to be using the best for everywhere you use argan oil!</li>
            <li> good product I recommended</li>
            <li> I bought this argon oil for my face, and so far i am really happy with it!  I have sensitive skin and break out when using most face products, or from hormonal changes.  I seem to be having less breakouts since starting to use it, and i LOVE the way my skin feels!  Very happy customer!</li>
            <li> I was told about argan oil for conditioning hair so I purchased InstaNatural argan oil and found it to be useful as a facial moisturizer and good for nails and cuticles. So far I am pleased with it in each use. It is wonderful for long hair esp. the dry frizzy ends.  The product was delivered quickly and InstaNatural has been very nice to work with.  Just reordered and am still very happy with the product. I did prefer the dropper instead of the spray, but the argan  works the same so I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot about Argon oil so I am giving it a try.  My buying experience was very positive from InstaNatural.  This was definitely the best price for 100% organic argon oil. I am very happy!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE InstaNatural&#x27;s Argan Oil! I love that it is organic and has no other additives in it. It&#x27;s great as a moisturizer and I have been using it instead of conditioner. I notice my hair is very soft but not greasy - win! I also use this oil on my face and noticed my acne has been less inflamed. My Mom even made a comment about it! I would definitely recommend InstaNatural&#x27;s Argan Oil… it&#x27;s the real deal you can&#x27;t beat!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty big bottle! A little goes a long way. I have very dry hair, so after washing my hair, I put this in it while it&#x27;s still damp. It gives it an added moisture as I style it.&lt;br /&gt;You only need several drops, not a lot. I like that you can use this for your skin as well, but I have just used it on my hair. There is a lot of uses for this!</li>
            <li> This Argan oil does it all for skin, face, nails and hair care, its amazing!!! It is worth the price and I love the nutty aroma.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month and my skin feels so soft! This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but this oil works great on eczema &amp; any dry skin.  Also a great dry hair conditioner!  Just a little rubbed in the palms &amp; run through the hair makes it easy to comb, &amp; shines!  Don&#x27;t use too much for this, a little goes a long way for both skin &amp; hair.</li>
            <li> This product accomplishes what I wanted, but less is more.  I remember reading another customer&#x27;s review about how she used too much and it made her hair greasy and she had to rewash it.  I did the same thing!  Literally half of the amount is required of my previous Argan Oil brand, so definitely a cost saver!  It has a nice smoothing affect on the hair.  I have curly hair and use a flat iron to straighten it, and using this product on my hair wet helps to smooth it and reduce any frizziness!</li>
            <li> The package arrived quickly and well packaged. I also ordered a rosehip oil with the Argan oil. Upon opening the bottle of  rosehip oil it was clearly stale and old. Hence the rosehip oil went bad and is unusable.  I would imagine that this product is not ordered much from amazon. Which I conclude means it had sat on amazon&#x27;s warehouse shelf for months possible years past it&#x27;s usable date. So I have reservations about the quality and freshness of the Argan oil. I have been using the Argan oil on my face, neck and hands and it&#x27;s alright not as good as other Argan oils that I have used. Possible because of the same reason the rosehip oil was stale and old that it sat on a shelf in amazon&#x27;s warehouse and it lost some of its freshness. Oil does go bad. Lesson learned, I will not order oils from Amazon in future. I will go directly to the company and order.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this argan oil! Multiple uses include hair, skin, nails, body and more! Only a few drops go a long way! Great value for the money, this bottle will last for months! A+++</li>
            <li> This is for all my girls, or guys, who have dry skin, hair, or nails. First off this stuff is amazing! It&#x27;s not only super good for my dry hair, I also use this stuff for my nail beds as well. I don&#x27;t use this on face, but I do use this on my knees, and on my thighs. This argan oil is huge. It&#x27;s bigger than any other one, I&#x27;ve ever seen before. And trust me, this bottle will last me a long long time. This is a good deal for those of you who are considering picking up the Josie Maran argan oil. Not only is this one only $20, it&#x27;s also made from the same stuff that the more expensive ones are made out of.</li>
            <li> I really had my doubts if the Argan oil would do as the product claimed. And, it does. I have to say, I am completely won over. I use it on my face it has helped my complexion. It has helped moisturize my face and it seems to even out the coloring as well. I have also used it in my hair after my shower and my hair is softer, and it appears to be healthier.  Just a little goes a long way.  Argan oil has a ton of uses, I googled it and found a lot. So google it! Again, so worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;The price is a GREAT value.&lt;br /&gt;The company ships it out FAST! I had it in my hands 2 days after I purchased it. FAST! I will order from this company again for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy!</li>
            <li> I am using this oil on my face, neck, and chest as my daily moisturizer because what I have read indicates it&#x27;s good at treating mild acne. It does have a slight odor that I don&#x27;t really like, but it&#x27;s certainly not strong enough to prevent me from using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using it a few days, but my skin seems to have that healthy glow and I haven&#x27;t gotten any new acne yet. The jury is still out on acne prevention, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put my makeup right on top of it and then need a little shine reducer dusted over my face before I&#x27;m ready to go. Keep it away from around your eyes if you are using eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I used this in a hair mask for myself and included it in a face mask for my sister and it totally delivered! The bottle is huge for the price and is such an awesome bargain! Why spend 2-3 times more on Josie Maran when you could get the same (better in my opinion) quality for a third of the price?! So happy with my purchase and the customer service is awesome!</li>
            <li> You can tell this is a quality hair product. My hair feels so much more healthier now that I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month! Great product!</li>
            <li> please use 1 drop a day....this product is powerful...it is a great moisturizer but it can  be used to cure other ailments... I started using it a few days ago and I don&#x27;t want to say too much because I fear some pharmaceutical company will find a way to fight against this natural remedy....please buy this product before I buy it out...When you find a product that works in this day and age its a god sent..</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have found Argan oil and especially the organic kind.  I first heard about argan oil from my hair stylist who was trying to sell me a tiny bottle of Argan oil mixed in with a ton of other junk for an exorbitant price.  Being weary of all the added ingredients, I looked around and realized you can buy the pure stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a few different brands that are pure and organic and honestly, so far, I&#x27;ve loved them.  I recently started using the InstaNatural brand and it is everything you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few drops does wonders on your hands (my hands are the softest they&#x27;ve been in years), on your face (I usually break out with the smallest amount of any type of oil on my skin.  Definitely no break out with this oil), and your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now stopped using any lotion on any part of my body.  A few drops of organic argan oil all over and I&#x27;m good to go with smooth, silky hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other products on the market, the price on the InstaNatural is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for review.</li>
            <li> I love Argon Oil and have now tried five brands. This one is hands down the best yet. It soaks in immediately and leaves my skin soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ways I use this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cuticles--instant smoothing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in bathtub--a few drops in my bath water makes my entire body skin soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hair--best conditioner ever, leave on overnight and washout in the morning for amazing softness and frizz control&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer--smooth on rough feet, elbows, hands, face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;undereye moisture--every morning and evening I dab a pinhead sized drop under my eyes, instant line eraser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;scar repair--smooth this over any scars and see them imrove&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t smell this one at all. And the bottle is huge compared to what you usually get. You only need two or three drops of this at a time for anything so this should last a long time. Be careful of this dropper. It lets a lot come out, more than I needed so I am extra careful when I take it out of the bottle to only use about two drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this Argan Oil and am delighted that I was sent a sample to try.</li>
            <li> Love it! The product does wonders for my skin and hair and the price is beyond compare.</li>
            <li> I love this product: it has so many uses and, best of all, they work!  I highly recommend it to those with dry skin or hair.  It is absorbed so easily and fast that it only takes a few seconds to disappear into the skin.  And, the results  - a smoother, softer skin and a very light sheen in your hair - can be seen and felt seconds after applying it.</li>
            <li> very good and i will buy it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Argan oil by other brands &amp; never had any issues. This one made me breakout every time I used it on my face &amp; I got itchy when using it on my body. I don&#x27;t why or what&#x27;s different in it, but I have clear skin, never had acne or breakouts but this did it to me. I used it on my hair ends not to waste it. Maybe be better for hair than skin.&lt;br /&gt;I had Watts &amp; one I bought at Tjmax, both pure &amp; organic &amp; they work fine &amp; NO breakouts.&lt;br /&gt; Sadly , I can not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Jenni</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the customer service on this product!  The follow-up emails with product use suggestions, as well as checking to be sure you were &amp;#34;satisfied&amp;#34; with the product as intended.  I am using it primarily on my face as a moisturizer, and still experimenting with the correct amount to use.  It absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy at all, as you might think an oil would do.&lt;br /&gt;  Not sure if it will significantly reduce wrinkles/age spots yet, as I haven&#x27;t been using it that long.</li>
            <li> I have always used Moroccan Oil, but it&#x27;s SO EXPENSIVE. I found this referenced in a review for MO and checked it out. I have curly hair and it is light and leaves my hair super shiny, also great moisturizer for skin. I love it, and it takes so little that this bottle will last forever.</li>
            <li> Lovely product.  So many uses.  Additionally, wonderful follow up and customer service.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for using Argan oil for my hair in this form. I have thin, fine hair and it makes it look greasy. I have mixed some with my mousse and that was much better. Also, this smells very natural which I don&#x27;t really care for.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I&#x27;ve tried accutane twice. I always broke out within a month from finishing Accutane, and i still had those annoying scars!    When i heard about this product i was scared to use it on my face, i mean its oil for crying out loud. But boy im glad i got the guts to just try it. My skin literally has never been so great in about two yeas. My scars and hyperpigmentation (i think thats how you spell it..) has faded significantly! I feel so confident about my skin! I can literally walk out with no make up and still feel amazing and going back two years i wouldn&#x27;t even step out of the door of my own house because i hated my skin.    This oil is just wonderful, it gave me hope. Now, i have been getting a few breaks outs here in there but they are so manageable now! This product is said to see great  improvements within 21 days or even up to two months. I have only been using it for about 14 days, and even though i do have a couple minor breakouts, i can instantly see results with the texture of my skin, it seems alot smoother. With in time i hope the breakouts will stop. This may not work for everybody but at least try it!!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to those who have thicker textured hair. I do not recommend this product to those with fine hair, because it may leave your hair feeling a little heavy. It has a nice nutty scent that isn&#x27;t too empowering. I love how this product has a pump so application is a breeze. The product was sent to me on time and was protectively packaged so there was no leakage.</li>
            <li> This oil leaves my skin very soft and is quickly absorbed so my skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily.  I like the pump bottle.  It is easy to use without making a mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve replaced my Oil of Olay with this product! My skin is smooth and youthful. It has a nutty smell but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. Good stuff...worth trying.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT WAS DISCOUNTED IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST UNBIASED REVIEW** ARGAN OIL IS WORKING ON MY DAUGHTER&#x27;S HAIR, FOR YEARS I THOUGHT SHE WAS JUST GOING TO BE STUCK WITH HAVING A HEAD FULL OF NAPPY UNTAMABLE HAIR.  NOT SO, AFTER SHE HAS BEEN USING ARGAN OIL SHAMPOO AND OIL AS A CONDITIONER HER HAIR IS SO SOFT AND MANAGEABLE.  THE NATURAL HAIRSTYLES SHE WEARS NO LONGER LOOKS TANGLED AN DRY.  I JGIVE THIS PRODUCT 4 THUMBS UP!</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with this oil. I use it on my hair while its wet and it is not heavy and it doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue. I am pleased. There is also little to no aroma! Im adding this to my list of FAV&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Thanks to the generosity of the supplier, we have had the opportunity to test this excellent product. We’ve used argan oil indirectly as a minor constituent of massage oil so I was interested to try the pure product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been using it for a few weeks as a replacement for the hand cream I usually use and am very impressed. It takes a little while to absorb but thereafter feels nice for ages and leaves a pleasant, slightly nutty aroma. Being a roofer’s labourer and out in all weathers, my hands have a hard life and I’ve noticed that cuts and scratches seem to heal more rapidly since I’ve been using the oil. I can’t really comment on the condition of my nails as they’re so hard anyway but I have noticed that the irritating hard skin that accumulates at the edges of the nails is softer and not snaggly (so that thankfully I don’t have the urge to nibble it). I also use it as a post-shaving moisturiser in place of my regular one and I actually prefer it and, in the interest of experimentation, have also been rubbing a drop into my scalp after showering (I have very short hair) and have noticed none of my usual itchiness or slight dandruff. I should point out that my skin is naturally dry so I don’t know how good it would be on an oilier complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has been using it as a substitute for her usual post-shower body moisturiser and is perfectly happy with the results and she also seems satisfied with it as a pre-wash hair conditioner, where just a couple of drops massaged into her hair and left for 15 mins. or so before shower time seems to result in shinier, somehow bouncier hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As so little is used each time thanks to the neat pump dispenser, even after weeks of testing, the 120ml bottle is still ¾ full so it will last for ages. I’m so impressed that I may well buy some more when it eventually runs out rather than buying a non-organic equivalent; given that the product is absorbed into the skin, it makes sense to avoid absorbing pesticides at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it appear that argan oil is a bit of a dermatological cure-all, it is one of the most environmentally friendly products around and is a very important export for Morocco. Much like Portuguese cork oak, it is a totally sustainable &amp; an economically important product providing much needed employment, particularly amongst Moroccan women where co-operatives plough the profits into education for the workers and their children.to avoid absorbing pesticides at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it appear that argan oil is a bit of a dermatological cure-all, it is one of the most environmentally friendly products around and is a very important export for Morocco.

            <li> I bought this because I understood that it was recommended by Dr. Axe. I was hoping that it would help with dry skin but I can honestly see no difference. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Amazing face moisturizer especially for winter! You will never need anything else ever again! Just give it a try, it will change your life.</li>
            <li> I have not made up my mind about this product.  It was a bit disappointing to me when I found out that it was not the product that I thought I ordered.  I read one of the reviews questioning the color of the outside and the bottle color.  You replied that you had recently changed the outside cover of the product and the bottle was now brown.  Prior to the change the outside cover was blue therefore, I thought I had ordered a NuMe product.  I love the Arganics by NuMe--Argan Oil and that is what I thought I had ordered.  I do not like the scent of your product even though you said it would disappear quickly.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the usage ideas sent to me via email and the extreme speed of delivery. I am new to using argan oil so I am learning and experimenting at this point. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try face oils, they seemed so contrary to everything I had been taught about taking care of my skin. But the winter weather had made my skin flaky, dry and dull. This brand of face oil was highly recommended and fairly priced, so I thought I would try it.  While there is a slight learning curve to application, but my skin has never looked or felt better. No more dry spots, no tightness or oily spots and my skin tone has evened out a great deal. There is a faint nut like odor to the oil, but it vanishes as you rub it into your skin. I highly recommend this product for anyone seeking a well balanced mosturizering oil.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I love how my skin feels and looks and it&#x27;s also a very good moisturizer or a base before you put on your make up. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> It makes you shine, look beautiful. Wrinkles are going away.  Awesome product, nothing but argan oil.  Also there is NO smell. Actually bought it a second time.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Argan Oil for my skin for the past two weeks. My skins feels soft but not greasy,oil absorbs well. This has replaced my very expensive facial moisture cream and eye cream. One product does both. I have very sensitive skin but have had no issues with this oil. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is amazing organic pure Argan in mega size and a great price!! I use in my bath, face, skin, cuticles, hair...so I need 4 oz. I will be back for more from this seller they actually send emails to ask if your satisfied--yes, very :)</li>
            <li> Love it.  I apply it on my face and hair everyday.</li>
            <li> Fast and great service! the oil is excellent! i use it all over. face, body, hair! i just love it! i have tried different argan oil from different companies but this one is the best Argan oil i have ever used in my opinion. I will for sure recommend it to my friends and family. I ordered a bottle for my mother. she is going to love it. thank you instanatural. :)</li>
            <li> Josie Marrans is much nicer argan oil, this one is okay not impressed with the way it smells...</li>
            <li> So basically, my skin is mostly dry but a little oily on my cheeks, and some black heads on my chin.  I got this because it is completely organic, it&#x27;s cold pressed, and there is nothing else in it. No perfumes that could irritate my skin at all. I wanted to get the Josie Maran %100 pure argan oil, and Got a sample of it and used It, but two things. 1. Too expensive. And 2. Nowhere did it say it was organic or anything which  is something I care about.  IF YOU HAVE OILY SKIN, get this!!!!! I know it sounds crazy right??? It&#x27;s not. TRUST ME! Most oily people might be scared to put oil on their face but you need it. Your brain is making a lot of oil hence making you break out because It thinks you need it. So by putting the argan oil which is GOOD oil on your skin, you are telling your skin and brain that you have oil now and it doesn&#x27;t need to make so much.  :)  my skin is very soft, moisturizer, and looks great. :) I put it on at night. Personally, it&#x27;s too much to use it in the morning.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and its so reasonably priced . I use it in my hair before shampooing to get a great manageable shine . its also a nice size and only a few drops in your hair that you leave in for about 20 mins than shampoo as usual it really helps my dry hair look nice and soft .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a low cost sample to try it so I could make an informed review for it , you cant beat it for price and purity</li>
            <li> First time purchasing this brand.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Product is amazing. Silky and smooth. It smells awesome and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this OIL for 1 month now and I positively have noticed a difference in my skin.  People are commenting on how soft my skin looks.  My skin feels baby soft.  You only need a few drops and it goes on feeling greasy but then once absorbed in skin-- the greasy feeling goes away.  I use it under my make up every day and I put some on before I go to sleep at night.  It also works great on your scalp and hair and makes your hair shiny.  There is no funny smell to this product either..  I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I wanted to LOVE this but it kind of stinks.  I can&#x27;t describe the smell, but it is not good.  Maybe mine was spoiled when I got it.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil on my nails for not even 3 weeks and they look much stronger , healthier and don&#x27;t chip anymore. It seems a dream because I had fragil and chipping nails all my life.  Love this oil also on my skin and my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this blindly for use in my hair. That is not this product&#x27;s best use. I use it on my legs and cuticles, and it&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
            <li> Great tproduct and so much cheaper than the other SHOPPING CHANNEL brand. It is 100% Argon oil as they say. GREAT BUY AND  GREAT PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> The argon oil is very nice. I am discovering though that I probably prefer a cream on my face. Is there any argon oil product that is like whipped or of a cream consistency for facial use? Again, the product is excellent.</li>
            <li> Insta Natural Argan Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am not sure I am a fan of Argon Oil.  It is not the brans, as I have reviewed Insta Natural products in the past and have considered them to be a very reputable company.  I think I just do not personally like the whole oily feeling.  The oil can be used to soften the cuticles.  It can be used with a shampoo product to help with the scalp and hair.  It can also be used on the skin as a softener and massage oil.  It can be used when shaving.  It has a ton of uses which makes it very multi-purpose.  I even tried to mix some in my favorite body lotion.  There was no lack of trying.  As the winter weather is starting to thrust upon us- I mean come on- I was driving in snow two weeks before Thanksgiving- my skin has been getting extremely dry and ,y hands are doing that lovely cracking thing.  I am going to give this oil another shot and continue to rub it into my skin through the winter and hopefully see results.  But, at this point, I cannot say I am a fan.  It has to grow on me.  #InsatNatural</li>
            <li> I use it as a daily leave in conditioner because I have extremely dry hair. I&#x27;m an active person and wash my hair almost daily. This has kept my hair somewhat hydrated and has reduced my split ends. Highly recommended, best organ oil by far. I applied this every morning upon waking up.</li>
            <li> Very emollient. Great for hair and the bath. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I couldnt be any happier! I&#x27;ve used josie maran for years but not only do I like InstaNatural better the value is great as well!</li>
            <li> I use this product to make beard oil and it works great! Need to use it on my hair next.would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is great, and being 100 percent pure, you can use it on your skin, unlike Moroccanoil products. If you can&#x27;t afford argan oil, look into apricot oil! Much cheaper and great for hair, split ends and fine lines. This makes my hair look and feel silky and healthier.</li>
            <li> Good , i like it. But I almost don&#x27;t feel smell. Is it normal?</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for several weeks and now getting comments on how great my skin looks. I&#x27;m using this liberally and even combined it with face cleanser.</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil for skin and hair. Have used it in lotions I have made and the results have been outstanding. I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased to have been told about Argan oil for my dry hair by a coworker.  My first purchase of a &amp;#34;miracle argan oil&amp;#34; (full of chemicals) was disappointing.  The bottle of Insta natural is pure oil, very light and has a barely noticeable nutshell sort of odor which I can barely detect.  I am quite pleased with the batch I received.</li>
            <li> Need a couple of drops more than the one I used before but it does exactly the same thing leaves my skin soft and it minimizes the lines better than any cream I used before, and I find that the Argon oil works great for the dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> It is the first time I am using the argan oil and I am happy I decided to try. It is amazing on my face and hair. It absorbed fast and contrary to what I have read in other reviews I detected no foul smell. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Love this argan oil! The thing I love most about it is that it&#x27;s 100% pure argan oil! Doesn&#x27;t get any better than that. I mostly use it on my hair (when it&#x27;s damp before I dry it ) &amp; face (after I wash it before bed). And a little goes a loooooong way so it will last you a very long time. So you can&#x27;t beat the price! Highly recommend!!&lt;br /&gt;Side note: The people at InstaNatural are super nice &amp; helpful, received an email from them shortly after my purchase making sure I&#x27;m satisfied with their product. Thanks InstaNatural! :)</li>
            <li> This argan oil is very light, no fragrance and absorbs fast.  I use it several times a day on my face over my lotion and it holds all the moisture in since it is so dry where i live.  One of the best Argan oils I&#x27;ve used. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This Argan oil is great for my face and works wonders on my baby&#x27;s cradle cap.  the only drawback is the bottle leaks (i just keep it in another container to prevent a mess and collect the leakage)</li>
            <li> This is my second time trying Argan oil, and I like this brand better than the previous one I&#x27;d tried. I use it on my face and the rest of my body, and it&#x27;s very smooth and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Product arrived a couple days sooner than I anticipated which was nice. I&#x27;ve used it on my cuticles, hair, face and other body parts with excellent results. I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I LOVE argan oil and have been using the JM version daily for 2 years... at 3 times the price.  The much lower price of this 100% organic product along with the positive reviews drew me in.  I&#x27;m totally happy with the results.  It does have a slightly different feel than the oil from JM (a bit heavier), but no difference in how it performs. Absorbs quickly into skin without any oily residue or feel.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; that others have claimed. I use it for everything, everywhere, every day....face, hair, skin and nails....either straight or mixed with other products.....huge, positive difference.  Recently got a sunburn and applied a couple times a day for a week and never peeled!  Miracle in a bottle and can&#x27;t beat the price.  Glad I made the switch and will definitely be buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> Simple, organic beauty is possible thanks to InstaNatural. This was my first Argan oil experience and I am eager to use it for everything possible. As mentioned on the bottle: hair, skin, nails, aftershave...the list goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil comes in a whopping four ounce glass bottle with a medicine dropper. I just love this old-school no mess way to protect and dispense restorative oils. I was really surprised that Argan oil seems very thin when dropped but thick when smoothed onto skin. Even though it was thicker than other oils I have tried, it disappeared quickly into my dry winter skin, leaving it with renewed glow. Another thing that surprised me was the total lack of smell in this oil. There is none. At all. You can use it as a moisture base for whatever skin or body care or cosmetic you wish and it won&#x27;t interfere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This organic, cruelty-free oil is a safe and pretty darn cheap way to keep your hair, skin, and nails healthy and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using argan oil for a couple of years now. I like to try different brands to see how they all stack up. So far my favorite have been Watts, Slice of Nature and AAA. Well, I love Josie Maran too because hers is what started the ball rolling for me but it is just so expensive that I would never be able to purchase it as often as I do the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became intrigued by instanatural because of the seller&#x27;s gracious responses to those who reviewed it negatively and also by their in-depth product description, which they obviously took the time to write themselves rather than copy and repeat the generic information available anywhere on the net. They care about their product and their customers. Anyhow, I bought some, and received a very nice email from them with suggestions for the use of argan oil. I already know what the uses are but it is still a nice gesture and no doubt of great help to those using argan oil for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can happily state that this is real argan oil. It is amber-colored as it should be, with a very slight olive-like scent which is completely normal and natural. It absorbs into my skin beautifully, just as it ought to do. I use it on my face: 3 drops beneath my regular moisturizer - and on my body: about 3/4 dropper for each leg and 1/2 dropper for each arm beneath my body lotion. My skin looks younger than my years, has a subtle glow, is smooth and supple, and the effects last between showers, which are every other day. I occasionally use argan oil for eye-makeup remover and it does not burn or sting while getting it all off (I suggest dampening a cotton pad with water and dripping about 5-6 drops of oil on if using for this purpose).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethical seller equals quality product. I love this argan oil and am more than happy to recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love this Aragon oil it makes my hair feel super soft and I only apply a few drops of it after I shower.. The reason why i bought this was to have a moisterizer after i shower and keep the ends healthy my hair is not damaged but could use some moisterizing I have seen a difference already in my hair its a lot more shinier and smoother.. I highly recommend buying this product your hair will thank you for it!!</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is great. It really is an amazing thing these days when something actually works ...&lt;br /&gt;I found it by mistake. Shopping for work clothes and waiting for a dressing room to open I came across &amp;#34;Argan Oil Lotion..&amp;#34; (a tiny bit of Argan oil mixed into a lotion) I found it discounted at a very low price for a huge 32oz jug.&lt;br /&gt;It was only $9.99 so I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;I used the lotion for a few weeks and was surprised to notice the radical improvement in my skin and hands.&lt;br /&gt;Only then did I bother to read the Lotion bottle and Google Argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I have simply purchased the real thing.(Oil Only.)&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this brand on Amazon at a great price and I am totally satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;Major</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it on the ends of my hair (it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it greasy), on my skin - especially under my eyes (doesn&#x27;t break me out), and my boyfriend also sometimes uses it to soothe his eczema. It&#x27;s a great natural moisturizer that is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This is a nice value and generous amount. It&#x27;s not as thick as others I have tried but it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I am really falling in love with this product. It comes in large bottle, has no smell, and absorbs quickly into my hair and skin. My hair is damaged from over coloring and styling....and adding this before I flat iron is really making a difference in the text and sheen of my hair. Thank you for this product....I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The seller of this product really stands by it 100%.  I had an unbelievable experience back and forth via email after purchasing this product.  Very courteous and concerned with my overall satisfaction and experience.  I couldn&#x27;t recommend this seller enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had really wanted to love this oil, as I&#x27;ve heard such wonderful things about it.  When it came, however, I was finding that the smell simply was too much for me.  I was using small amounts, and even mixing with some of my other &amp;#34;fragrant&amp;#34; products, and to me the smell still lingered.  Let me make sure to note though, I am a bit hyper-sensitive to smells, and have an easy to trigger gag reflex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the smell, it&#x27;s a wonderful oil.  Absorbs absolutely beautifully, evens texture and tone, non greasy.  While I&#x27;ve been sick and unable to smell anything, I&#x27;ve used the oil more extensively, and it really is a cosmetic wonder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller suggested since I am so sensitive to the smell, using a refined version of the oil might be a good alternative.  I highly recommend this product as-is to anyone who cares about the condition of their skin and hair.  The seller backs it, so it&#x27;s worth at least giving it a try.  If you know you&#x27;re super-sensitive though, you may want to try refined or odorless argan oil instead.</li>
            <li> I put a drop or two in my palm, rub hands briskly together to warm the oil, then run it through my hair. It helps brushing through long tresses.</li>
            <li> I like this oil and it has a very light smell. It is too soon to know what I think of it in terms of its&#x27; benefits.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using argan oil and I really like it. My skin looks great and I really like the light smell the oil does have. It&#x27;s not even a fragrance I can name, but a faint scent that I actually like. I would definitely recommend this product; you get a lot for the price and the dispenser is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The best price and seems like very high quality. Makes me break out if I use it every night, so only use a few nights a week.</li>
            <li> VERY HAPPY WITH IT SO FAR.  USE IT ON MY MY FACE EVERYDAY &amp; BODY EVERYDAY.  IT MAKES MY SKIN SO SOFT. THANK YOU FOR A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I ordered this, as well as their Organic Rose Hip oil, and both are terrific. I find this Argon oil to be very light, in texture as well as scent, and adding a few drops to your skin and hair after a shower really makes your skin soft and your hair shiny and manageable. The 4 ounce bottle is very generous, and the quality is top shelf. As well, as I wrote in my review of the Rose Hip oil, Instanaturals is the real deal, a Company that stands behind their product, and is staffed by professionals. In a marketplace saturated with lousy sellers, I have been overjoyed with Insta Naturals, and will continue to order exclusively through them,</li>
            <li> I love this oil for my face!  Highly recommended it to all my friends.  Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price</li>
            <li> I just received my first bottle of Argan Oil about two weeks ago and so far and am loving it.  I put on my face morning under makeup and night time before bed and on my hands and nails daily.  So far my skin feels hydrated and great all day long and my skin appears to look healthier.</li>
            <li> I travel and changes in climate tend to make my skin very dry, so I add a few drops to lotions, moisturizers or just use it alone all over.  It is wonderful!  Absorbs quickly and leaves no lingering scent to compete with perfume or body mist product.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Did lot&#x27;s of research prior to purchasing argan oil and must say this product fills all of the requirements of a high quality oil. Using it for hair face lips and nail care.</li>
            <li> I Appreciated the fast shipping and am very happy with my purchase.  I use this on my hair and on my skin some evenings before bed and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I am still trying to figure out if this is the correct product for me. But I noticed that the oil won&#x27;t mix with Moroccan oil. I added perfume to it to eradicate the funny smell. Overall, it seemed okay but I will continue to watch how my hair respond to it.</li>
            <li> I got this free to try. This can be used on your hair or skin and boy was this one good timing also.  Last week I used a deodorant I was very allergic too.  My underarms and the back of my arms broke out in a very dry and cracking rash.  I tried lotions and everything else I could think of, then this fantastic oil showed up.  I used it twice a day on my underarms and the back of my arms and after the first day could already tell a difference.  After about 3-4 days the dry spots were basically gone.  This was fantastic oil.  I am going to try on my legs next.  With the hot weather coming I am not going to have ashy legs this summer.</li>
            <li> I could go on and on about Insta natural products - LOVE them!  Brown pump bottle - so easy to use.  I have used both the Argan and the Rose hip oil .  Super pleased - skin feels so refreshed.  This is one of the best companies I have ever dealt with.  I am 74 years young.  Use this on feet and hands cuticles with excellent results.  Love it on my face, neck and chest areas.  Highly highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Will continue to repurchase again. I use it on my hair and skin</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS! IT IS NOT REAL ARGAN OIL. I put some into a container to take on a trip and it separated into two liquids of different colors.</li>
            <li> The order arrived promptly &amp; it is a great product for my hair; it&#x27;s making my hair soft &amp; shiny as I used per instruction.</li>
            <li> Used sparingly--a little dab&#x27;ll do ya--Argan Oil is a wonderful product. Frankly, it makes my face feel every bit as good as some of the expensive Estee Lauder moisturizers I&#x27;ve used for years.  I also use a few drops to moisturize my hair after washing, as well as on my hands. The seller&#x27;s price is very reasonable, and customer service couldn&#x27;t be better!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  First Time I&#x27;ve used a product like this.  I Like the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> I use this product every morning and evening and wake up with a beautiful and well nourished skin every day. The oil has a slightly nutty smell that disappears on application. After a few minutes, the oil is absorbed and my skin is ready for make up (foundation and the full monty). I even keep a bottle of Instanatural argan oil on my desk at work, and use it on my hands several times a day. I also put some warm oil in my hair about 2 hours before washing it (my hair tends to be dry these days) and I think it helps. I usually am very picky but I really like this product and fully recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product! Be sure to use no more than 4-5 drops on long hair. Also, be sure to blow-dry completely, or hair may feel a bit weighed down.</li>
            <li> 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil also known as liquid gold is a lightweight pure argania spinosa. It is said to have antioxidant properties and contains high levels of vitamin E.  It is used to moisturize and hydrate skin, face, Photo - Pure Organic Moroccan Argan Oilhair and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a free sample to try and it left my skin feeling fresh, radiant and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like most about this product is 100% organic, gluten free and it doesn’t contain harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I use this daily on my face, hair and body.  Pure, absorbs well.  I just bought a second bottle for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li> I was contacted by InstaNatural to try out some of their natural beauty products. Once I saw what they offered I jumped at the chance to try their items out. The first one I have tried out is the InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Argan oil is a type of plant oil that is produced from the kernels of the Argan tree that is native in Morocco. Natural Argan oil has a raw, green and nutty aroma, but what is so great about this type of oil is that the scent disappears minutes after being on your skin as true Argan oil absorbs very quickly and without that greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  InstaNatural strive to have their customers 100% satisfied. Their logo is actually &amp;#34;we truly care about you&amp;#34;. The Argan Oil comes in a 4 fl. oz (120 mL) glass bottle with a long dropper. Trust me while experimenting with this a little goes a long way. InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Argan Oil is so natural that the only ingredient is : 100% pure and certified organic virgin cold-pressed argan oil (Argania Spinosa). There are no chemicals or preservatives added, they do not test on animals and they even offer a 100% money back guarantee if you are not satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The InstaNatural 100% Pure Argan Oil is a multipurpose oil.  This is mainly used cosmetically but can be consumed. For cosmetic uses you can use it as a leave-in conditioner, frizz remover, moisturizer, lip exfoliator and softener, hair/scalp treatment, face mask and nail care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All directions for different uses such as those are on the bottle in pretty large print (at lease as large as you can on a bottle) and are easy to see and use. Most of the time you only need a few drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My favorite use of InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Argan Oil was as a moisturizer. I could not get over how in only one application my skin looks more radiant with a soft and supple appearance. It definitely filled in any lines and scars that I had. Plus as a moisturizer it also lasts for almost twenty four hours and protects against UV rays. When I used it on my body it also moisturized very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have dry skin so I use about three drops on my face and then some on the rest of me and I am moisturized for a good twenty four hours. It got rid of any rough patches on my feet, hands, knees and elbows in about two to three days of once a day application and I have been very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I also really like it as a frizz remover and detangler for my hair. I rub only 3 drops into my hair after I get out of the shower. I have thick hair so if you have thin hair you will barely need any otherwise your hair will look oily. It protects my hair from any heat damage I may do to it as well as make it shiny, soft and frizz free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Next Generation Stay At Home Mom gives InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Argan Oil 5 Stars!ty four hours and protects against UV rays.

            <li> this is a wonderful product at a great price point. it comes in a glass jar with a dropper applicator. use it on your face, legs, arms, nails.... wonderful and no bad smell whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Amazon: Please do not delete my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I bought the oil based on the reviews and the argan oil turned out horrible. The oil smells like vomit, does not absorb, thick like Olive oil and Broke me out like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The reviews are very Fishy!&lt;br /&gt;They mostly review all the Insta natural Product line with 1 line ads, not real&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see comment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this oil. The bottle is MASSIVE (most of the other oils I have come in 1oz bottles) and it seems to be of good quality. It has a nice light golden color as I would expect argan oil to. Not much else to say really, it&#x27;s great on my dry skin and hair, and the big bottle is perfect if you&#x27;re sharing with someone else!</li>
            <li> Outstanding product!&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding pricing!&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding delivery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used \\&quot;olive oil\\&quot; products for years with good results;  I have recently switched to Argan oil products; Argan oil is a much lighter product to use with wonderful result.  I am 70 years young and on a regular basis I am mistaken for being in my late 50\\&quot;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more is there to say?</li>
            <li> What can be better than certified organic argan oil imported from Morocco? There are no extra ingredients, nothing artificial, no fragrances, preservatives... NOTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for just about anything - I use it mostly as a cuticle oil. Add it to your current creams, etc. for added moisturizing benefits. Put it as is in your hair(for dry hair, dry scalp, etc.) The bottle has use directions written on it for a number of uses and you can find more around the web. Here are my favorites:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair: I wear wigs which have no source of oil. It helps preserve the life of my wig and perk it up without causing damage. This is great for any dry, brittle hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Acne+ anti-aging: It&#x27;s great for acne. Use of a face oil helps prevent acne breakouts by preventing irritation and balancing moisture production so you skin does not overproduce on oil. You need a natural non-comodegenic oil, and argan oil is perfect for that. Additives irritate acne so this is perfect - rub a few drops over fingertips and massage into face. Or add some to your daily moisturizing cream. It also has natural anti-aging properties - the Moroccan peasant women use it as such. Again, preservatives age skin, so argan oil is a perfect all-natural solution, and the price is a lot lower than high end anti-aging products that are often less effective. Since it&#x27;s a rare product that&#x27;s good for both, it&#x27;s the perfect solution for older people with acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rubbed it into my calluses as well and it relieved the burning. The bottle contains more information as far as uses are concerned - since this is a raw ingredient, you can use it to make your own things as well, and it&#x27;s extremely versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great price for such a large size - you use a few drops at a time so it should last you for a while. Also, since it&#x27;s a plain ingredient, you can use it for just about anything so you don&#x27;t need to buy as many products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it comes in a glass jar with a glass dropper - it&#x27;s easy to dispense a few drops at a time. It can drip, so remove excess from dropper before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance: there are no added ingredients and therefore you smell the argan which does not have a strong smell. If you are extremely sensitive you may not like it. It is great for men and women alike because of this.</li>
            <li> Love the quality and texture of the oil, and love the price for the 4 oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I use this as an overnight treatment to restore the strength to my dry damaged hair. Can&#x27;t wait to try the other uses as recommended by the other reviewers, and will be back for more.</li>
            <li> If you use this in your hair it will make it very shiny! It also provides strength to your nails too.. I will be trying it on my heels to prevent them from cracking....</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and then hoped for the best.  This is the greatest oil.  My face has never felt so soft and smooth and my co-workers are even asking me what I&#x27;ve done, because my skin seems to be glowing. I don&#x27;t like anything heavy on my face and wear very minimal makeup because of that.  This oil soaks right into your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel at all.  I feel like I&#x27;ve found the fountain of youth.  Wonderful product and I received it well packaged and on time.</li>
            <li> What I love about this is how large the bottle is, you definitely get a lot of product.  As with all 100% pure argan oils, the oil just felt way too heavy upon application.  There are other products I prefer to all argan oil.  As for this specific argan oil, there is no smell and it performs just like argan oil should.  I would suggest to use this product to moisturize the nail cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product to review, regardless, the review is unbiased and my own opinion.</li>
            <li> Fantastic value!  I love the pump dispenser - this is a high quality argan oil, goes on easily and is quickly absorbed into my skin.  This product is a good as another Argan oil on QVC in my opinion without the price day.  At this price I can use the argan oil all over my arms, legs and not have to ration is.  I will definitely buy this product again - please keep making this product.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great.  not seeing any dramatic results but i enjoy its multipurpose appeal</li>
            <li> Somehow this product is not argan oil as advertised. Not sure how they have such wonderful reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is some sticky and stinky oil that doesn&#x27;t look smell or feel like real argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0 star if i could</li>
            <li> My case is an odd one.&lt;br /&gt;I have a skin condition called verrucous dermal nevus. It&#x27;s not severe at all (so if you&#x27;re brave to search for images of it, that&#x27;s not what my skin looks like... Also, don&#x27;t search for images, it&#x27;s not great). In any case, it&#x27;s basically spotty areas somewhere in your body that can get bumpy and dry, and when they really feel like acting up they&#x27;ll throw in some itching sensation. It&#x27;s more cosmetic than anything, but the itching can be a bummer sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several methods to keep this under control, including glycolic acid peels performed by my dermatologist on a regular basis. This proved expensive and painful, since I was basically burning off the top layer of skin off my body every couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know where I read about argan oil, but I do know it was in one of the many websites about dermatological conditions that spoke about VDN. I decided to give it a try, since the worst thing that could happen is I lose those $15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had low expectations, since pretty much everything I&#x27;ve tried that claims to make skin better is simply not formulated for something like VDN. My conclusion after about two months of use is that I&#x27;m very pleasantly impressed with this oil. No, it won&#x27;t make my condition go away, and it&#x27;s unrealistic to assume a natural oil will make a genetic condition go away. However, the condition has subsided greatly since I started using argan oil, which I mix with an odorless body lotion (it claims to be the &amp;#34;ultra healing&amp;#34; type), mostly to be able to spread the oil more evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviewers have noted, it does smell badly at first, kind of like mulch which is not an attractive smell. But, the smell does go away quickly and it&#x27;s nothing that a little bit of cologne or perfume won&#x27;t take care of anyway. Besides, the results do speak for themselves. Whereas before my skin had large areas of uneven coloring and bumpy textures, the most I have now aresome spots that resemble freckles more than anything. It&#x27;s definitely enough to make me feel more comfortable in my own skin (that&#x27;s a pun I fully intended to make) when going to a pool, or the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you happen to be in the 1/1,000 of people that have this specific and annoying condition, all I can say is it helped me, and it might help you too.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for.  Perfect for both your hair &amp; skin making them both feel healthy.  I am also very please with this seller who replaced my first bottle which leaked (I did not ask for a replacement).  Would certainly buy this again.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly. It is amazing and works great for hair and skin;&lt;br /&gt;I found the seller to be very helpful and knowledgeable of his product.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lite and fragrance free oil that does exactly what you expect....moisturize....nothing else. The size and price was good also.</li>
            <li> I really LOVE this Argan oil. I have tried a few other brands and this by far is my favorite, and the best value I have come across. The pump is an added bonus, I don&#x27;t care for the dropper that comes on most competitors bottles, the pump keeps the product covered so the oil doesn&#x27;t get exposed to outside influences and such. I hope they don&#x27;t change a thing about it. I look forward to more organic products from this company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the oil. I put oil on my hair, on my face, on my fingernails, and my hands, and since it is a dry oil, like the company informed me, I didn&#x27;t even have a problem turning the door handles in my house like I did when I used to slather myself in canola oil and get stuck in the bathroom, hands uselessly slipping over the door handle until my wife finally let me out. I no longer have to endure dry skin, weak fingernails, or the disappointed looks of loved ones.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work for me as stated. Good customer service. returned the money.</li>
            <li> I like it ...it just left my hands feeling a lil oily</li>
            <li> Great product.  This is the first time I have purchased argan oil.  My skin has been dry from the winter weather so I&#x27;ve been using this oil on my hands and face. I love how it absorbs quickly and makes my skin look healthy again.  I would recommend this product from this seller, great customer service.</li>
            <li> Very great product! Has helped my skin tremendously!. I wish it was a little less pricey</li>
            <li> Great product especially for the price. I did price comparison shopping and this was the best price that I found for pure argan oil.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  Leaves your face feeling soft and smooth and helps with winter rough hands.  The price is remarkable at around $20.00 for 4 oz - a much better value than the expensive face creams out there.  I would have given it 5 stars if it had a more pleasing fragrance but it is all natural so I guess that is healthier than something &amp;#34;perfum-y&amp;#34;.  I will certainly buy this product again.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and gets ichy especially in the winter. This Argan oil is wonderful on my skin and cures the dry and ichy skin. I will be re ordering soon as my bottle is getting low.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product.  Previously, I was using coconut oil but found it was clogging my pores while still leaving some dry spots on my face.  The argan oil has evened out my complexion.  Great moisturizer without clogging pores.  This particular product is also a great value considering how much is in the bottle and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great value. I think most of the negative comments in regards of the product leaving hair too oily come from 1st-time buyers who might not know how to use  argan oil. Quick tip: just put 2 drops max in your palm, rub hands together a few seconds to warm it up, apply only to ends and sparingly mid-length (wet hair or dry) I got long thick hair and this does the trick. Rub the rest on face, neck or hands. A little goes a looong way. Only complain: wish the bottle was plastic istead of glass. This vendor&#x27;s oil is high grade. Get it :)</li>
            <li> It comes in a sturdy thick glass bottle and has a handy spray pump dispenser, that way you only use what you need. I would say one pump covers the back of my hand.It hardly has any scent, which I personally find really important when picking skincare or beauty products. I can&#x27;t stand flowery scents.&lt;br /&gt;The product does contain traces of tree nuts, so be aware in case of allergies or hypersensitivity. Saying that I have very sensitive skin and many allergies, and yet I had no reaction to this at all. Quite the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;Although it is initially a little greasy when you first spray it on, it does draw into the skin fairly quickly when you massage it in, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free copy of this product courtesy of the company, for the purpose of review.</li>
            <li> This product gives me a lot of surprises. Face become more radiant, skin is hydrated and protected and no longer sensitive. Hair looks much healthier. I tried adding it into my daily moisturiser. I expected my face to be oily after hours but it turns out my skin is in balance state. It really saves me a lot of $$$ as it is a multi-purpose moisturiser. No more body lotion, no more hair serum, no more hand lotion and save my daily moisturiser. I will definitely recommend it to my family and friends. Will repurchase!</li>
            <li> Yes, I always liked Argan Oil. It isn&#x27;t greasy and it keeps my skin moist.</li>
            <li> I love not having to use multiple products on my face.  I bought this as a moisturizer for my face but also use for hair and nails as suggested too. They even sent an email before I received the product with all the uses.</li>
            <li> I received a product that claims to be argan oil from insta natural but the there are other stuff inside it. Like solids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black stuff floating around, that look like fungus that grew inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if this stuff is not pure or expired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase.  I was looking for a light moisturizer for my face and this works much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. Reasonably priced. Natural.  Simply the best!</li>
            <li> Have only been using it for about 2 weeks now, but it works great so far. My face is sensitive and prone to acne and this product does not break me out. Moisturizes my face well!</li>
            <li> Works great and helps keep skin moisturized without leaving an oily residue.</li>
            <li> 100% argan oil... this is wat I needed with curly frizzy hair. Definitely worth it.  New favorite n cheaper too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using argan oil in my nails and my hair and I like it so much!! I&#x27;m really happy and I recommend to use it!!</li>
            <li> I love this when i got it yesterday my hands weren&#x27;t dry but my cuticles looked like they were dried up prunes and my nails i used to bite my nails are so soft and they snap break everything i can&#x27;t keep a nail, so you know i went nuts with this, i wanted to try it on everything because again i heard it&#x27;s good for your hair well i used the shampoo with it and got no results so i tried this alone as a treatment before using normal shampoo now i have soft hair! I don&#x27;t know what garbage is in the air where i live but it isn&#x27;t good for hair maybe for plants but not people this stuff takes my poor dry hair and makes it so nice and soft i did my hands well my nails and then i did my feet and i used this on my ankles and any dry patches! I went nuts and had so much fun! I&#x27;m so glad i was asked if i wanted to try this thank so much this was great to try now i am addicted to it and have to have it all the time! I&#x27;m definitely spreading the word about this to everyone who needs real Argan oil!</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my skin so soft i just love it, i don&#x27;t even need night cream at all. Just a few drops and presto!</li>
            <li> Good quilty and large bottle for the price. I have used expensive argan oil and this stuff is just as good but fraction of the price. Will buy again</li>
            <li> I have used many different brands of Argan oil on my hair over the years. This oil is light and relatively fragrance free, allowing me to also use  the oil on my hair and my body. It absorbs quickly which does not leave any staining. I am delighted with this product! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Use on my hair, because my hair is highlighted with bleach. It softened my hair and makes it look less dry.Just a little goes a long way and smells good. My hair is sofe, shiny and not dry.</li>
            <li> After hearing and reading so much about the benefits of Argan oil,  I decided to give it a try.  I searched the internet and bought my first bottle  of Insta Natural from Amazon (I always buy Amazon) after reading the raving reviews.  This stuff is amazing and does exactly what it promises:  soft, silky, manageable hair and smooth moisturized skin (face and feet).  It is NOT greasy and leaves no built-up residue  in my hair.  Although a little goes a long way, I&#x27;m somewhat heavy-handed and probably used much more than necessary.  I&#x27;m ready to buy my second bottle now but I will follow directions and use it sparingly.  The price is right and it ships right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an argan oil by garnier fructis on my hair for a while now and loved it so I thought I&#x27;d get something a bit nicer when I ran out. Unfortunately this is awful in my hair. Even the smallest amount makes my hair look greasy and unwashed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with how good my complexion looks after applying Argan oil. I recently completed chemotherapy, and my skin was looking pale and blotchy. Argan oil has helped restore a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I love the product!  It works so much better for me than 100% coconut oil on my face.  It goes on smoothly and is absorbed quickly and you only have to use a drop or two.</li>
            <li> My poor, cracked and dry skin has been revitalized with InstaNatural 100% Organic Arganic Oil. I love that this oil is 100% pure and absorbs quickly, unlike other oils that just leave my hands feeling greasy for 30 minutes. Within 1-2 days, my dry and red skin returned back to normal. After applying the argan oil, my skin feels soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil has a slightly nutty smell (reminds me of Neem Oil). The scent disappears after the oil is absorbed (within a few minutes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this brand and this product. I would purchase this product again. Long lasting and very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received the product to facilitate this review. No other compensation was received. All opinions are my own and are honest.</li>
            <li> I recently had the opportunity to try Insta Natural’s 100% Pure Organic Moroccan Argan oil. I have heard about this oil many times in the past and have really wanted to try this product to see if it was as good as it sounded. After a few weeks of applying a few drops on my hair, skin and nails… you wouldn’t believe how great this stuff works! I have been suffering with psoriasis since I was a teenager. My real problem areas are my scalp, face and elbows. My face has pretty much cleared up with the use of my doctor prescribed medication combined with the Argan oil. My scalp feels a lot better than before. I use quite a bit of the oil on my scalp at night before bed. It really seems to help with the itching and discomfort… even throughout the following day. I am so happy to have this oil at hand. I highly recommend this product. Especially to those who suffer with psoriasis or any severe dry skin problems.</li>
            <li> Works just as described, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like the oil, just turned out to be a little too oily for my skin type (I have combination skin). I absolutely loved the price, and also the fact that it&#x27;s USDA certified organic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll be ideal for people with dry skin. It has slight nutty smell to it..which is normal for Argan oil..although the smell fades off after a few mins. It&#x27;s a decent size bottle in a nice packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only Argan oil I have tried so far..so I haven&#x27;t really got a chance to compare it with any other brand out there! Hope this review helps!!</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference in the look and feel of my hair, especially after I lightened my hair.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is wonderful on the skin. I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle and bought a 3rd as a gift. I use it regularly under my eyes and on neck, and less frequently on the rest of my body. It leaves skin really soft and not greasy. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve tried it on my hair in the way I use another *Moroccan*oil* brand but this left my hair stringy and I had to wash it out. Perhaps I used too much or it should be applied to wet hair (only tried it once to mostly dry hair), so this is worth another try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a reviewer&#x27;s comment stating that this oil mixes with water, so I tried it and NO, it definitely does not mix with water. It repels water. It is OIL. Another reviewer said this oil is \\&quot;clear\\&quot;, when real argan oil has a yellowish or golden cast to it. This oil looks clear when it&#x27;s one drop on your skin, but if you put some into another small bottle as I did for travel purposes, it is definitely yellowish-gold in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it has a strange smell to it, but this is consistent with what I&#x27;ve read about real argan oil. The smell is very mild and is either not lasting or not strong enough to make my skin smell this way when I use it. The bottle is a good size and lasts a long time when used only under eyes and on neck (i.e. requires approx. 1/2 a drop for under my eyes), although it obviously goes more quickly when also used on arms &amp; legs.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! And I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the customer service I received. There was an issue with my order so I contacted amazon who took care of it. AJ with insta natural then reached out to me personally and offered a complimentary bottle for the trouble as well as took the time to answer a few questions I had. Amazing! You won&#x27;t find that level of customer service anywhere else! Will DEFINITELY be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase works as claimed on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Love the long dropper cap and inert fragrance..TY&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re concerned about controlling wrinkles as you age, this is the product for you.  The scent is light and best of all, you can use it by itself.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the skin.  I use it at night on my face and I also rub it into my cuticles on my fingers and toes. Argan oil is absorbed quickly and does not have any oily leftovers.  It has cleared up a few dry crusty patches that were on my skin around my hairline and it just gives skin a velvety smooth feelking.</li>
            <li> Is it supposed to stink??? A &amp;#34;nutty aroma&amp;#34; is one thing, this smell is another! Ewww.</li>
            <li> This is the worst purchase I&#x27;ve made.&lt;br /&gt;The product is unusable because of its smell.&lt;br /&gt;How can anyone possible put this on their face and hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eww!</li>
            <li> Wanted to purchase this as a moisturizer for my face since the winter weather has been taking a toll. Works well and absorbs quickly if your skin is slightly damp before applying or if you add the oil to your regular moisturizer. The bottle doesn&#x27;t have a typical dropper, but a convenient pump. This prevents you from wasting product or accidentally spilling oil everywhere. Shipping was quick and customer service was great as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using argan oil for about a year, and just switched to this brand.  Argan oil in general has really helped to balance out my face and help my acne chill out, as well as making my face feel softer overall.  I&#x27;m choosing this brand over the one I used to use because a) you get more product for fewer dollars, and the contents are identical, and b) the pump action on this bottle doles out a smaller amount at a time, so I can customize how much I&#x27;m smoothing onto my skin at any given time.</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure of this product but I have found I really like it.  I have eczema and it has really helped! I really like that it is not greasy feeling at all.</li>
            <li> Nice size bottle, good price. I have used it on my face, body, hair, hands, and nails! No irritation! Good product!</li>
            <li> COMPARING TO PREVIOUSELY USED ONE THİS ONE THICKER AND NOT DISOLVING , THAT IS I AM NOT USING IT I DO NOT MIND TO SEND BACK ?????TURAN  ARGUN M.D.</li>
            <li> This product gave me a rash on my face.</li>
            <li> after 3 days my hair became really smooth and shiny and a little oily.</li>
            <li> My hair is no longer frizzy .... nice texture to the oil&lt;br /&gt;Hair looks shinny and healthy</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for skin &amp; hair. It absorbs easily into the skin &amp; controls my straight hair flyaways. The customer service from this seller is awesome &amp; I would definitely purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> Great product from a highly attentive seller, but even in small doses, a bit too heavy for my frizzy hair in humid Florida.</li>
            <li> I really love argan oil. If you have dry skin, this is what you need. I put this on and my skin feels good all day.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair...more like a lion mane of hair and I have gone through using a variety of products and treatments that would help tame my hair.I looked up potential products and saw that argan oil is a great natural product to use. I looked online and found a pretty great deal in the product. And it works! i just use one pump and run it through my hair, especially the drier dyed sections and it makes my hair much more manageable.  I am a mixed asian woman and while my hair is wavy, it wasn&#x27;t enough to warrant more keratin treatments anymore. I was done with all of that and wanted to go natural. I just needed something that would help me manage the texture of my hair and bring out my natural waves and this product is it. Plus, AJ is so nice and they personally reached out to me to gain real personal feedback on their product. That&#x27;s invaluable customer service if you ask me!</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan oil for years and am pleased to have stumbled upon this particular brand.  Huge bottle makes the price VERY affordable.  It is dispensed through a pump as well which I much prefer over the standard dropper method.  Better control and no chance of spillage.  The oil is great for so many things... I use it as a moisturizer and also for my cuticles.  Highly recommend.  On a side note, this company is very service-oriented.  Not long after I received my products from Insta-Natural (I purchased three items from them) I received an email from them asking my opinion and how I was liking the products.  Very nice personal touch from a company that I feel truly stands behind their products!</li>
            <li> I am in my 50s and wish I had found this oil about 30 years ago.  It has helped my skin tremendously and now my four daughters are using it as well.  We all love it.</li>
            <li> I liked me, so I was not expecting this super</li>
            <li> Truth be told, I don&#x27;t know argan from Aragorn, but when the folks at InstaNatural offered us some samples of their products I figured the daughter would welcome them.  But the bottle was sitting in the shower and, reading the label, it seemed worth trying on my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s one of those things they don&#x27;t tell you about getting old, when those white hairs start growing in they are more wiry than the ones you used to have.  I&#x27;ve never conditioned my hair, but have had to start conditioning my beard.  And here&#x27;s the thing, I can&#x27;t attest to any of the other uses, but this argan oil has done a better job of moisturizing and softening my beard than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> i just received the bottle today,well packaged,i took a shower and applied in my face and neck ,it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have oil in your face,the skin absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> What can I possibly say about this lovely oil other than I love it?  My 65 year old skin, always prone to blemishes, simply soaks up the argan oil and looks terrific.  I use it on my face and the ends of my hair, and now that I&#x27;ve decided to give up my acrylic nails, I&#x27;ll us it on my nails as well.  After using the argon oil for several months, I have stopped using foundation.  I asked two of my friends over lunch the other day how my skin looked and they said it looks great.  I told them I wasn&#x27;t wearing foundation and one replied that if she had skin like mine, she wouldn&#x27;t wear foundation either; but the point is, I used to always wear foundation and they couldn&#x27;t tell the difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t promise that everyone will have the same results.  I&#x27;ve bought products that others raved about and they did nothing for me, but it&#x27;s hard for me to imagine that someone with tired, old skin won&#x27;t derive some benefit from this oil.  I&#x27;ve even bought some as stocking stuffers for my daughters this Christmas!</li>
            <li> not fond of the smell but great stuff.  not greasy or oily and truly does make the skin softer and keeps dryness at bay.  my hands are in the water a lot and this really helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seriously been getting compliments! Ever since I&#x27;ve been using this on my hair. People are saying I look wonderful and what are you doing.  Are you pregnant,  your glowing etc. etc. Awesome oil!!!</li>
            <li> This is perhaps the best Argan oil I&#x27;ve tried (I&#x27;ve used 3-4 different brands so far).  It blends in very well on the skin.  Will most likely purchase again!  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> At first &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34;, the Argan Oil seems a bit greasy, but a little bit goes a long way and it is very quickly absorbed by the skin. Makes my face feel years younger and softer. I love it.</li>
            <li> works great and has stayed fresh</li>
            <li> use it mostly on hands</li>
            <li> Great stuff and great value!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking of buying this just for your hair you should reconsider.  I purchased this product because it costs half as much as the bottle I buy from my stylist.  I haven&#x27;t used it on skin or nails but it does not seem the best for hair.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It works well on my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I use this almost everyday due to frizzy hair. My friends notice a lot of difference. It does have a smell when you first open the bottle. Works like coconut oil but not as hot (as in hair application). #GotItFree</li>
            <li> The argan oil is working wonderfully. I apply it to my face, my cuticles and my d&amp;eacute;colletage.  I will continue to order from InstaNatural. The quality is evident. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing!! It has helped my dry skin and hair tremendously! Also, I find that if I use a little on my face, it leaves it soft and glowing!! The only issue that I have had is that if I use it too often on my hair, it will get oily. Also, it is hard to use only  a drop or two with the way the bottle dispenses the oil. So, I find myself having to use it on my body as well as my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product and the customer service provided.  I have not yet had time to try all the potential applications, however, I would encourage others to order the product from InstaNatural.</li>
            <li> It smells really bad.  I was hoping to use this at work to keep my neck and hands moisturized but its awful-I&#x27;m afraid someone may walk past me and think I haven&#x27;t showered.  I bought this last year but don&#x27;t remember the smell being so unappealing.</li>
            <li> This product was not what I expected it to be.  I was under the impression it was the same product I have been using for a few years now and it is not.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this product again</li>
            <li> I love the packaging and the quality.</li>
            <li> Love the organic argan oil! I applies argan oil couple drops to my clean washed hair. No more store bought chemical stuff to my hair. It&#x27;s natural way to give hair nutrition. Great product!</li>
            <li> The BEST moisturizer EVER for hair or skin.  It soaks in almost immediately &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily.  I LUV this stuff!  I use it from head to toe daily. This one has a convenient pump which makes it so much easier to use without accidental spillage.  This seller emailed me a nice letter with suggested uses for the product &amp; again later to make sure I was completely satisfied with the product.  They provided amazing customer service!  I will definitely order from them again. ;)</li>
            <li> Love this oil! Makes my skin feel nice and soft. Also well moisturized.</li>
            <li> I really like this  product I  do a bit of  swimming at my work out  facility and my hair was always  frizzy and lots of split ends and this is helping a lot after only a few applications .I was given this product free for a honest  review and I would say it has good quality.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  I use it every night to keep my pregnant belly smooth and stretch mark free!!!</li>
            <li> I was using Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil at 5x the price. This works just as well. Save your money and buy this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crazy about Argan Oil. I use it every day, morning and night and my skin feels great. I have different Argan Oils everywhere in my house and InstaNatural Organic Argan Oil is one of my favorite. It is Organic, which is very very important for me when I&#x27;m looking for Argan oil and other oils, and cold pressed too.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is just perfect, the bottle comes with its cap, it can&#x27;t leaks during transportation, and with an extra treatment pump, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;All our family use this Argan oil. After using it our skin is smooth and soft. It is quickly absorbed by skin, which is a positive indicator for its high quality.&lt;br /&gt;I do love it for my hair, it is the best anti-frizz and moisturizing product I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using this oil from head to toe.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Instanatural for your great Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;Please, continue providing this product and all your other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount price!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s easily absorbed and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin oily, I used some on my hair and my kids hair, it&#x27;s organic and safe and the bottle is big and looks like it will last for a while you just need a few drops:), I would like to update my review to talk about the results when I use it for a while but I have been reading about argon oil and it&#x27;s great benefits and I am so excited.&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend,  great seller</li>
            <li> I use 4 drops on my face, usually at night-time. It also wears well for day use under makeup, though I prefer to use a day moisturizer that has SPF (though that realistically could be worn on top of the argan oil). It is helping to clear up a dry patch that I&#x27;ve had for months as a result of the hard water in UK taps. It doesn&#x27;t smell too strong - there is a much more expensive one that smells incredible, but I&#x27;d rather pay half the price and use this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I used this after I applied the Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum. Even my kids love this, they apply this before going to bath as hot oil treatment for their hair.</li>
            <li> This works great on my face &amp; skin.  Only a little is needed and it lasts a long time.  It&#x27;s a nice daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural Argan Oil is wonderful and has so many uses. I use a drop or two at bedtime for my face and wake up with soft, supple skin that has noticeably less lines on my forehead and around my eyes. I also use it to moisturize my feet, since it&#x27;s summer and I&#x27;m going barefoot a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a hair oil, this is the best. It absorbs quickly and is not too greasy. I only need about two drops on the ends of my hair to help my hair feel soft and shiny. It smooths out the split ends and tames frizz very well. I’ve used it both on wet hair and dry hair. Used on wet hair, it acts as a good conditioner and helps hair to style nicely without frizz. I like to use a little on my hair when it&#x27;s dry to smooth my split ends and keep frizz down. It really helps my hair look healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find a little goes a long way. I really like the dropper because it dispenses the perfect amount, so I don&#x27;t end up with too much.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I have very thick course&lt;br /&gt;hair and I rubbed the Argan Oil through my scalp and on the edges and it&lt;br /&gt;made my hair much more manageable and soft.  I also use it as a moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;on my face.  I agree with other reviews that it does not leave your skin oily, it leaves my&lt;br /&gt;skin feeling very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for this product and the quick shipping!</li>
            <li> Love the fact that this is organic. Argan oils are the rage these days. Fine bottle and nice flavor. A sample was sent for review purposes.</li>
            <li> This has become my argan oil of choice , definitely the best around and terrific value . I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> The pump for this product did not fit the jar and cannot be used. Please send a new pump.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is the worst smelling stuff I have ever tried in my life. I tried it on my face and it made me tingle like nobodies business. I broke out in a rash that last well over a week. I will NEVER and I mean NEVER be purchasing this stuff again!</li>
            <li> I expected a natural oil. The color should be amber with a musky aroma. This product is absolutely clear with no characteristic aroma. I&#x27;m not at all sure that this really argan oil. I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing!  My hair was fried from a perm and this saved the day.  It produced results within moment s of application.  Also great for cuticles, and skin.  Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It smells wonderful, kind of a light olive-y scent, and it sinks luxuriously into my skin. I incorporate it into my skincare routine and I also add some to my shampoo for extra moisture. It was shipped quickly and the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Instanatural argan oil is not what all the hype is about. Stick to a mothers market or wholefoods brand.&lt;br /&gt;This oil is completely diluted that it wont help your skin. Might as well use cooking oil.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and are looking for a great cold-pressed, organic, unrefined Argan Oil that will leave your skin velvety smooth...this is a great one! I use on my face, hands, and hair and it is amazing!</li>
            <li> Really works to soften skin!</li>
            <li> Love the pump bottle.  makes it&#x27;s so much easier to dispense the the eyedropper.</li>
            <li> Never knew how dry my face really was, until i used argan oil. Will definately buy it again</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping... Thank you..</li>
            <li> I found InstaNatural&#x27;s Organic Argan Oil to be an excellent value for the money, with almost no, but pleasant odor. I&#x27;ll be purchasing in the future when I need more. I use it as an occasional face moisturizer and often as an addition to my eczema lotion. I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Very smooth texture. Can use on nails, hands and scalp as well.  A very versatile product.Product was obtained Through I love reviews in order to review this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this with the intention of a hair oil, to use after blowdrying my hair in order to tame flyaways and frizz.  it doesn&#x27;t work great for this - leaves my hair greasy, and doesn&#x27;t spread well throughout.  Haven&#x27;t tried it much on skin and other areas yet.  It seems like a nice oil, just not for my (white girl, medium thick) hair.  UPDATE: Company refunded me in full for the product, no return necessary, so A+ for customer service.  (just realized I never updated this!)</li>
            <li> comes as said, this is my first Argon oil purchase as i am growing my hair out and my scalp gets dry.I put some in my conditioner and when i get dry skin due to the weather i put some lotion in my hand and then squirt some of this Argon oil in the lotion, mix it in hand and apply, it works wounders. I will by this again when i need some more.  !.</li>
            <li> Thanks for asking.  I will never be without this product again.  I have dry cuticles and hair because I work outside a lot.  The argon oil is making a great difference already.  It has a light, green, nutty scent at first but that dissipates right away as does the slickness of the oil, so I guess my skin and hair finds it  easily absorbable.  I think many individuals with needs similar to mine would also love this product.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more again soon.</li>
            <li> Second time buyer of this product and both have been good quality.</li>
            <li> The oil is fine. I like the smell but it is Overrated. The name argan sounds like magic but in reality good extra virgin oil has the same of better property. So why to by Argan oil? Some people like &amp;#34;rare&amp;#34; things. I guess it makes the feel more important. Hehe🌹&lt;br /&gt;Price is nice....</li>
            <li> Great product, love it so much!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my hair, and it smells great!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is just what I have been looking for.  I can use it on my face without it burning my eyes, and it makes my skin feel so soft.  You can imagine what it will make the rest of your skin feel like.  I have other argan products that I use on the rest of my body but I may have to start using this a well.  It also works really fast on chapped lips which is also a plus.  It feels oily when you first put it on but quickly soaks into skin and  I really like this for my dry skin. I don&#x27;t have to exfoliate as often because later in the day or even the next morning my skin still feels soft.  This is an amazing product and I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> High quality argon oil ,just as good if not better than that well known brand ,would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works really well!  Leaves my hair shiny and soft.  The only thing that surprised me is the smell.  It doesn&#x27;t smell great but the smell disappears pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> left hair really oily even when using a small amount, only use it over night and wash it out in the morning.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair. Very good customer service. East return.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  Price is great and the pump feature allows for dispensing the perfect amount with no waste.  I use this as a facial moisturizer.  I add a little tea tree oil as an anticeptiant and it&#x27;s perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Will definately buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this product on the whole family. Great for hair too.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle for the price! Argan oil is highly regarded in the beauty community as one of the most luxurious hair and skin products. A few pumps is all you&#x27;ll need for your hair (and I have long hair!). I also like to use two pumps to moisturize my skin. I think that for the price, this is unbeatable!&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: this product was sent for me to review, but all opinions are my own</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine what I would do without this!!!  Wish I had found it sooner!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin, hair &amp; nails. My whole body is soft as a baby&#x27;s skin. It doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel oily like baby oil or any other oils I&#x27;ve tried. This stuff is awesome. I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great product! Great customer service! Great price!</li>
            <li> I have been buying Insta-Natural Argan oil for a couple of years and it is the best price for the highest quality organic oil available. I ran out and was forced to pick up a small bottle at a large health food store which was five times more expensive for the same product with the same organic certifications.</li>
            <li> The product is as advertised and works well in my face cream recipe.</li>
            <li> I received my argan oil in the mail today and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I put a small amount in my hair and let it set for a while before shampooing out. I used an additional small amount in my damp hair before drying and styling. I can not give a full review of long term use but I will say the effects of using one time were amazing. My hair was much softer and smoother than when I use other products. The product itself does not have the best smell but that is something I can deal with since it is all natural. I look forward to seeing what the long term results will be but if nothing else it is an amazing product just to use as a hair product, especially for the amazingly low price.</li>
            <li> Left my hair nice and soft. I even used some on my skin and it helped reduce the dry skin. The only problem I had was the bottle was leaking when it arrived.</li>
            <li> 7.22.15- I have only used this for 2 days now and my review is pretty premature. I originally bought this to use on my face at night and I did. Haven&#x27;t seen much difference yet. I would wait to use it for a month at least before I review it&#x27;s effect on my super oily acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;But i wanted to write this review to say that I saw magical results in 1 night on my nail beds. I used exactly 1 drop and spread it all over my hands and rubbed it into my nail beds a little. I usually have skin peeling along my nail beds with very dry nails that arewalways peeling. The next morning I couldn&#x27;t see a single skin peel. It just healed overnight! I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and supple my hands were.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m continuing to use it on my face n hands every night. Will post an update after a.month or so.</li>
            <li> I apply the organic oil in my conditioner and lotion.  I also use it on my hair after washing it.  I love this oil.</li>
            <li> Bad packaging! Oil was spilled over when it arrived and the product is not all that it&#x27;s pumped up to be! They need to focus on packaging the bottle cap as well as the surrounding packaging better!</li>
            <li> I have hyperpigmentation and rosehip oil I decided to try and look after more than 25 types of this precious oil I decided to buy the Natural Insta for its excellent description and to my good fortune I was not wrong because I&#x27;ve had extraordinary results .... a month later decided to make another purchase and buy Argan oil, I only have a week using it and I am happy with the results my skin feels more supple, smooth, moisturized and my hair very shiny! Thanks for this wonderful product I will continue buying their other wonderful products ... thank you very much</li>
            <li> I bought this oil a month ago. it seemed to work for my hair and had a nutty fragrance to it. but in less than I month I noticed that it began to smell terrible like it had become rancid.</li>
            <li> I had never used 100% Argon oil before and this seems tacky, not silky like you expect an oil to be.  Maybe there&#x27;s something wrong with it?</li>
            <li> I was offered a review bottle of Argan Oil and figured I had nothing to lose by trying it so I accepted the bottle.  I opted to try this on my fingernails.  I have trouble growing my fingernails out because they often chip, break or split.  I have ridges in couple of my nails that run vertically through the nail causing them to crack when they grow longer. They are usually weak and bend and break easily.  Honestly I can&#x27;t believe how strong and healthy my nails have become in 3 weeks. My nails feel like they have several coats of miracle nail on them.  They have grown out long and none of them have cracked or chipped. I&#x27;m skeptical on the claims of a lot of products.  It&#x27;s often hard to tell if a product has actually worked but there is no doubt that using Argan Oil on my nails has made a difference. My nails never grow this long without applying multiple coats of a nail hardening product. I have used miracle nail in the past and achieved a similar result but this is so much better because I don&#x27;t have a coating on my nails that will peal off and chip away.  My nails are actually strong and healthy with nothing on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to use 1-3 drops around cuticles and fingertips.  I used more than that. I have been putting 8-10 drops in the palm of my hand and then thoroughly coating my fingernails and cuticles.  I then rub off the excess on my face or legs until my hands don&#x27;t feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this product is something I&#x27;ve grown used to.  The first time I applied it I didn&#x27;t love the smell  Over the past three weeks the smell has become &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a product to strengthen your nails this worked for me.  It can be used on hair and skin as well. There is a warning on the label that it contains tree nuts so if you have an allergy to tree nuts this isn&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see a picture of my nails here:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo18QT9GVP7CK41/B00H93NJLS/B00H93NJLS</li>
            <li> I just love it. I use this product on a daily basis.  Keeps my hair soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.. I use it for everything.. Face, hair nails and it is wonderful. I recommend this to everyone. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> great, high-quality oil to use all over - I put it on my face and hair every night&lt;br /&gt;I put a little on damp hair to defrizz</li>
            <li> Love this! Very light smell so not over powering at all.  Works wonders on your skin!</li>
            <li> Anything I&#x27;ve ever gotten from Instanaturals has been absolutely wonderful. This argan oil is top notch!! It&#x27;s in a wonderful pump bottle and is a whopping 4 oz.!!!! I have started putting it in my shampoo bottles, applying it on my skin right out of the shower and it is doing wonders for my nails. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent, it means I can use it it my shampoo without changing the intended smell. Same goes for perfume and body lotion. A little goes a long way and don&#x27;t forget to put in in your hair at night to give it a nice conditioning while you sleep.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quicker than I expected which I like, and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> im very happy with this product i used it on my face cause ive a super dry skin and i saw the result on softness immediately dunno how will be on the hair will try it next time</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received a nice email before item was delivered which gave suggestions on ways to use their product. The item came sealed in the bottle (no leakage). It does not have much smell, which is as I expected. I use 2 or 3 pumps with my body lotion and apply after my shower. It leaves my skin feeling very soft. Will buy again.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> When added to my regular hair conditioner, it adds additional moisture and shine; love it....thank you!</li>
            <li> I love argan oil, it is good stuff! I had a more expensive brand in a smaller bottle but this honestly works the same.Seriously, why pay more!!! It is multi purpose and moisturizing just like other brands in a large bottle. Score!!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and am so thankful that I discovered it. It is odorless and absorbs immediately into my skin. I&#x27;ve used it on my face and the backs of my hands; there is no greasy residue, only a moisturized glow. The bottle has a pump dispenser that expels just the right amount. The price for the size is a great value, I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> makes my hair feel shiny and soft, I have short rough hair.  works as a quick hairstyler as well, well for mens hair at least.</li>
            <li> Im using this for scalp, and helping me out for my very dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I tried using this just once and hated it. It made my hair turn into a ball all tangled up. It is sticky like glue with a bad odor.&lt;br /&gt;Eww</li>
            <li> this oil its amazing good for the hair,skin i put it in my face its really nice m hair so soft</li>
            <li> This oil is fragrance free and non-comedogenic for the face. It nourishes the skin nicely, however it doesn&#x27;t have any antioxidant effects or other botanic effects to improve clarity of the skin. Very little amount is needed and the amount in the bottle will last a long time. Highly recommended though and far superior over synthetic emollients.</li>
            <li> I loved this oil...I used it on my face every night and my face looks and feels great. I also use it in my hair and on my elbows and feet and it softens them beautifully !!! I would highly recommend this product !!</li>
            <li> So far I have been using it for about a couple of weeks only and it very seemingly works well...good quality product..most likely to repeat purchase :-)</li>
            <li> I have been using Organic Argan Oil for several years for various purposes.  I use it on my skin, especially my face after cleansing, for a smooth glowing complexion.  I don&#x27;t bother with the expensive manufactured serums that promise your wrinkles to disappear after so many uses.  I get down to the basics. Argan oil is all I need.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it to get soft shiny hair.  I simply apply a very small amount on my palm and massage it sparingly right onto my scalp and extend it throughout the hair to the ends.  (You don&#x27;t have to use a lot because it goes a long way.  The first time I did it I used too much and my hair turned out very limp because it was weighted down.)  I then gather it and put a plastic processing cap over my hair for at least an hour or two, shampoo and condition.  The result is a luxurious head of healthy looking hair.  I don&#x27;t have as much breakage since I&#x27;ve begun using this method. It really works!</li>
            <li> Great formula.  I use it for everything!</li>
            <li> Argan oil by InstaNatural is such a wonderful product! I love this for my hair!! It leaves my hair shiny and healthy looking! I just rub a few drops between my palms and lightly rake the product through my hair and WOW! Smells good, looks good and feels good! I don&#x27;t like silicones! I want the most natural products I can find for my hair and skin and this is perfect for both! There are so many uses for Argan Oil! It&#x27;s in many many products you can buy, but this is pure organic Argan Oil! You can use and mix it with natural products without all the chemicals! Check the label on that Argan Oil at the store! Where is Argan on the ingredients list??? Probably way under EVERYTHING! They are usually loaded with silicones that weigh hair down and mask damage. This will actually improve your hair, not just mask it. Try it! I love it!</li>
            <li> I have paid much more per ounce for cold pressed argon oil. I&#x27;d glad Amazon can source the same high quality for a better value. I use this oil on my face &amp; scalp &amp; love the results. It nourishes my face &amp; never feels oily. I always soak my face cloth in hot water &amp; place over my argon application. The steam helps pores absorb all the oil- like a mini facial each morning. If you&#x27;ve used Argon oil, you know what to expect at a good price. If you, read up on its benefits &amp; try it. I no longer put any lotions &amp; potions on my face, just organic cold-pressed argon. I&#x27; m very happy with my skin&#x27;s appearance &amp; feel.</li>
            <li> Not really the cure-all people make it out to be. It&#x27;s just another cosmetic oil. I was imagining that this would be a good substitute for face lotion but no. It actually leaves my hands feeling dry after I use the product. Uncomfortably dry. I think I like jojoba oil better.</li>
            <li> Great results. Fast shipping. Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft not frizzy anymore. One thing I don&#x27;t like is that it makes it looks thin too but great product overall. I&#x27;m getting lots of compliments on my long hair now.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it at least an hour before shower.</li>
            <li> Great product!!!! The founder is great as well emails you different ways to use this product! Truly recommend :-)</li>
            <li> I loved my purchase!!! I researched Argan Oil when I began hearing about it... The InstaNatural Organic Argan Oil was top quality!!! It was packaged extremely securely. I really enjoyed using it. Unfortunately, I dropped my bottle the base broke. The elegant,secure packaging, top notch product, all for naught if you don&#x27;t handle your product with care! :) Next time I&#x27;ll watch what I&#x27;m doing! ;)</li>
            <li> I use as moisturizer, on my body and hair and it is not at all greasy. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product. It actually works on old, sun damaged skin. And most importantly, it&#x27;s the real thing. 100% virgin, organic Argan Oil. This company got it to me within a few days; I&#x27;m very pleased. NOW, it they could only make it in larger bottles ! ! !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for moisturizing my face--I rub about 3 drops between my fingers and gently press it into my skin instead of rubbing it around. Then I follow up with a thin layer of moisturizer. Before getting this oil, I used to use a LOT of lotion. I then run whatever&#x27;s left on my fingers through my hair or just rub it onto my nails to strengthen them. I&#x27;m so glad I got this. Much better price than the Josie Maran Argan Oil I got from Sephora!</li>
            <li> FINALLY, my Argan oil is here.  And the top is very helpful, it&#x27;s saves me the trouble of having to pour too much.  Love it.</li>
            <li> great product,thanks.</li>
            <li> Love it, mix with my lotions.</li>
            <li> Now, many people say this stuff is amazing/clears acne/heals scars/raises your grandmother back from the dead.This is the REAL stuff...now whether it works &#x27;wonders&#x27; for you, or just suffices as a moisturizer, may be up to your individually. Argan oil is supposed to be non-comedogenic (not supposed to clog your pores), so supposedly is unlikely to cause a breakout or clog pores. From my own experience, it has not caused any breakouts (I&#x27;ve had quite a while of use--by a different brand at first, bought at Whole Foods for quite a bit more money). I believe this is also the real stuff as the consistency, color, and slight odor are the same as the type sold in the aforementioned store. It has a slight odor--not &#x27;fishy&#x27;, not unless you&#x27;ve had some strange experiences with cod liver oil, though.&lt;br /&gt;As for its supposed miracles... one can often read that this is practically magic, like &#x27;women of Morocco use it&#x27;. Careful with statements like that--are the women of Morocco the most beautiful in the world with perfect skin? That has about as much meaning as saying &#x27;women of the U.S. use it&#x27;, and telling you to buy foot cream.  FYI, not hating on Moroccan women--just giving an example. Just because supposedly another nation may traditionally use a specific product doesn&#x27;t mean that product is the very best of the best.&lt;br /&gt;For me, it&#x27;s been decent...nothing too special. It does moisturize my face, but leaves it looking OILY, so I put it on at night after a face wash, and in the morning first thing out of the shower (quite a bit before putting on make-up). And I do NOT have oily skin--it is sensitive, but normal (neither dry, nor oily, nor with a t-spot). Great at night after washing the face...great as a make-up remover that can get that eye makeup off without hurting those with sensitive skin. Removes super long-lasting lipsticks easily. Leaves lips moisturized. However, you know what else can do that? More than a few other oils. Sweet almond oil has a slightly higher possibility of clogged pores than Argan oil, however I&#x27;ve used that as well (for about ten bucks for eight ounces). Then there&#x27;s more expensive stuff, etc, etc. About using it on nails/hair/etc... you get the result of a good oil; you do not get access to the fountain of life and your choice of princess crown.&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Buy the stuff if the Amazon price is within your price point and you want to try it; at this price, the 4oz makes as much sense as a small portion (especially since you can also use it as a body oil, etc). If you don&#x27;t like it on your face, and it doesn&#x27;t perform magic tricks for your nails or hair, at least it&#x27;s a good body oil that you can use up.</li>
            <li> Organic Argan Oil is very good for the hair,skin and nails.</li>
            <li> I love this oil for my long blonde locks. I apply it to my hands and drag my fingers through the last 6-8 inches while my hair is still damp. Then I add a little more to the very ends and finish by drying my hands on the surface of my thick hair.  The youthful gloss from the oil turns straw like dried out long hair into beautiful shiny attractive hair.  It is also good for skin and nails but I prefer coconut oil for those applications.</li>
            <li> when i bought this it was cold pressed and a different bottle. Now it&#x27;s not cold pressed and a different bottle.. I don&#x27;t care the bottle is different.. but not cold pressed? i&#x27;ll be ordering elsewhere.. ladies don&#x27;t waste your money if its not cold pressed.. NOT WORTH IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! I use to buy a high end, well known name, Argan Oil from Sephora, that cost 3 times more then this one. I have to say, I love, love InstaNaturals better!!! It absorbs into my skin better and lasts all day! And, I don&#x27;t have to use near as much as I did from the  other brand. I am actually able to apply my make up on over this oil. I love this oil so much! It has such great benefits with so many benefical uses. This is the ONLY Argan oil for me!!! Thank you InstaNatural for your great quality products at such a friendly price!!!</li>
            <li> I add a few drops of this to my conditioner and hand cream and it works like a dream!</li>
            <li> Everything I need it to be. Great for hair, nails and skin. Only a little is needed.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> After cutting my hair a few months ago I&#x27;ve noticed that I have been getting split ends again and I wanted to purchase an oil to use on my hair. I originally bought coconut oil but I only used it once on my hair and then I finished it all up by cooking with it. I decided to give Argan oil a try since it is a very popular oil and I am so glad that I did. I have curly hair which gets frizzy when it&#x27;s dry and after applying this oil it defined my curls and left my hair so soft. I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day and by the second and third day my hair gets super tangled and frizzy but with this oil after the third day my curls are still defined and soft with minor frizz. Obviously I still have split ends but it seems this oil stops my dry ends from getting worse which gives me more time to grow out my hair and not get it trimmed every few months. The way I use this  oil is I towel dry my wet hair after I wash it then I apply a generous amount from the ends to the middle top and I rub it in for it to absorb better then apply the remainder to the rest of my hair and brush it out. I love it and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Love it! Use it everywhere, absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I find this sooner. It should be in everyone&#x27;s bathroom.</li>
            <li> I love argan oil, this is the first bottle I buy from this brand and I&#x27;m very satisfied. Great product +great customer service&#x3D; happy customer!</li>
            <li> I got this mainly for my daughter&#x27;s hair. It is frizzy and curly and knots up like crazy. We usually use coconut oil but I wanted to try this. After shampooing her hair, I put this in and it made it look so shiny and smooth. It took the frizz away. It doesn&#x27;t absorb as fast as I would like it to. But I do use it on her hair a lot and don&#x27;t have any complaints so far.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Still learning all the ways to use it and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I love it!</li>
            <li> As the headline says, this smells terrible. I thought argan was supposed to have a kind of nutty smell, so I am guessing mine is rancid. I tried it anyway. It did not absorb well even though I used very little.</li>
            <li> Works well, but has an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Update: Still love this stuff. And yes, bought it again from InstaNatural.  Fantastic product and lasts a long time. Fast delivery and very responsive company.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> The fragrence took some getting use to, but I am sensitive to scents.  I am using on my hair and see it calming my frizz and making hair feel stronger.</li>
            <li> After trying some products from InstaNatural I just knew I would not be disappointed by this oil. I have really coarse and frizzy hair. I hardly style it down because it just looks so awful to me. My hair looks dry and flat. The only products I  use on my hair is the normal shampoo and conditioner but have not found one to tame my hair. When I ordered this product and doing some research of the benefits of this oil I was anxious to receive it. It is a very versatile oil because it can be used on face, skin, hair and nails. How cool! I never knew one product can have so many uses. So the day I got it I wanted to put it on right away. That night I took a bath with my usual shampoo and conditioner routine. Then after I got out of the shower I applied this oil as a mask all over my hair from root to ends. I put it on damp hair and then put on a shower cap. I planned to keep it on for an hour so I watched an episode of my favorite tv show and relaxed. After the 1 hour was up I rinsed it with warm water and then blow dried my hair. As I was drying my hair I could already feel the softness and it was easy for my fingers to run through my hair. After I finished drying my hair it was so soft and shiny! The following morning my hair still felt soft and when I straightened my hair it looked so pretty. It gave my hair the perfect shine without looking greasy and the best part is that I had no frizz. I do an entire hair mask once a week and I also apply a little bit on my ends when I straighten my hair to prevent frizz. I thank this oil for giving life to my hair. I no longer keep it tied in a bun all the time. I can actually style my hair and don&#x27;t have to worry about it looking dull and frizzy. Although I got this product free to review this is my honest opinion about the product based on my own experience.</li>
            <li> Love that it has a pump instead of a dropper!</li>
            <li> I have been using my Argan Oil for a couple of weeks and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I use it on my face daily and feet (with sox) at bedtime. Very nice. It is absorbed quickly and definitely helps my skin in this cold weather. I have used Argon oil brought to me from a friend from Morocco and it was thinner and finer in texture. But this product is very close..</li>
            <li> Love this oil! Use it on my face, skin and hair. Leaves my skin silky soft, moisturizes my hair and leaves it shiny. Only need a few drops.</li>
            <li> On my third week of use. Went from blotchy red areas and dark patches on my face to an unbelievably smooth, extremely soft, hydrated even-toned skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my legs, arms and feet as well. You&#x27;ll need NOTHING but this product for total skin care. At 47, I have very dry skin, dry feet and EXTREMELY dry cracked heels. I massage this oil over my feet once (sometimes twice) every day just because it feels wonderful. The benefit is fabulous looking, healthy feet that always look freshly pedicured. You&#x27;ll LOVE this oil. I&#x27;m addicted!  ❤️</li>
            <li> So far, I really like this oil.  Will more than likely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Distinction: I like the effects but I&#x27;m still getting used to the smell.  It&#x27;s a rather nutty smell which is not necessarily offensive, but it is definitely potent.  Especially if you&#x27;re just migrating over from neutral smelling facial creams like Cetaphil or Nivea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 pumps of this bottle is more than enough to lavish on your face and probably too much for bedtime kisses.  I&#x27;d underscore the 3 pumps as directed on the bottle because the oil can roll off your hands and get onto carpet.  (I just realized some discoloration on the carpet was caused by oil, so I went at the marks with make up remover wipes, which cleared it out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effects are satisfactory so far!  My acne is healing and diminishing after about 10 days&#x27; use and this oil does not seem to trigger eczema.  (Some reviews talked about adverse reactions and I can only surmise that everyone is different in the way of sensitivities and allergies.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about this product at first because the description read like a panacea which is just not existent.  My dermatologist wasn&#x27;t even aware of argan oil.  Nevertheless, I was pretty desperate to get off of the steroid creams and antibiotics that my dermatologist prescribed.  So far, so good, although I did not completely substitute out my other prescriptions and creams.  It&#x27;s a balancing act with trial and error for anyone to customize their regimen.</li>
            <li> Love it. Love the new dispenser pump. Smells earthy and makes my hair and face smooth.</li>
            <li> I feel this has really helped my dry winter skin on my hands. It is much better after only a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I use this for my hair to fight against the winter static/ dryness and it&#x27;s been working wonders. I noticed a difference after one use. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of the great reviews, there are so many argan oils out there and I wasn&#x27;t sure which one to pic.  So, due to the 791 five star reviews, I chose this one and so glad I did.  It&#x27;s great for face, hair, and my husband uses it to shave.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRICE.  This stuff really works from hair to your toes.  Try and find this price for 100% natural argon oil at the big beauty and cosmetic companies -- you can&#x27;t.  My feet have not felt this good in years.  It is not oily -- it is soothing.  Magical oil.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and product packaging was well put together. The oil is a lil thick and have to get used to the aroma but overall it&#x27;s working well. I use it daily and use as a leave in before washing hair for 2 hours. Hoping the continued use will help with falling and regrowth.</li>
            <li> Amazingly, this oil does not leave a greasy finish behind and once absorbed, all that&#x27;s left is healthy looking hair. I add a pump to my leave in conditioner to help disperse it throughout. It also works well for winter cold rashes. I like the pump that&#x27;s included and the heavy duty glass bottle. The smell reminded me of grape seed oil. I will definitely be getting this again.</li>
            <li> I was so happy with this product that I ordered two more.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I have very dry skin, nails, and hair.  (PS I live in the desert).  I like the weight of the oil and the pump feature of the bottle.  So far no adverse reactions to the product.  I will forewarn you that it smells bad, there are clearly no added fragrances.  So if you have a weak stomach, you may want to reconsider.</li>
            <li> I use this after showering when my hair is still a damp. When it dries my hair feels lush and there is no frizz to be seen. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it using it on dry hair, when I did some of my hair looked moisturized while some of it didn&#x27;t. The smell takes a little getting used to but I love how it makes my hair feel. I use it on my nails too.</li>
            <li> I have long black hair. Due to being long, my hair splits easily and always tangled at the split ends. This causes a lot of hair lost whenever I shower or comb my hair. When I started to apply a few drop of argan oil onto my wet hair, my hair lost has decrease tremendously, leave a gentle feeling on my scalp every time I brush them. I also mix Mary Kay lotion with a few drop of argan oil to apply to my face for shine and it also works! I love the oil. Definitely will continue buying it!</li>
            <li> Great product. I like the pump dispenser too.</li>
            <li> I really like this Argan Oil. In comparison with a much more expensive Argan Oil I had this one performed better as Hair treatment as well as face oil. I don&#x27;t use it in the mornings, I use it at nights after my Retinol cream (I allow the retinol cream to absorb completely before applying this oil). As a hair treatment I use it overnight and wash my hair first thing in the morning, it adds shine and my hair looks and feel healthier. It also works very well as a body oil. It has a nice slight nutty scent as all pure Argan oil. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I mix this with my normal facial cleanser and shampoo/conditioner for added moisturization. So far i am loving the results. My skin does seem softer in the morning.</li>
            <li> after long research on argan oil THIS one gets the 5 stars. Even lightened dark spots.  ;))</li>
            <li> This product is everything the great reviews said it was.  Just a drop or two, that&#x27;s all it takes.  I use it on my face and neck after using the &amp;#34;face scrubber&amp;#34; I purchased.  I was intrigued by a review on that product that lead me to investigate Argan oil.  I&#x27;ve been using night creams for years, as well as day creams.  I can honestly say that just the Argan oil is enough.  No real need for extra creams, although I do still use them.  Just a small dab of those Over the Argan is sufficient.  I am more than satisfied.  My face feels smooth and soft.  It doesn&#x27;t appear to be too oily, in fact, once on, it is so well absorbed you can&#x27;t see a trace of an oily sheen.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple of weeks and the results after such a short period of time are very satisfying.  I&#x27;m sold.  Not sure yet if it does anything for my nails, but I have high hopes that will result in better, stronger nails too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the previous users who were so satisfied and took the time to write a review.  I had never heard of Argon oil.  A review of one product led to another.  Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Great oil&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil has always been a favorite of mine for a facial moisturizer  - it does wonders for the complexion&lt;br /&gt;Love that this line is organic and the pump bottle is very convenient as well</li>
            <li> I had the chance to try out Argan oil in exchange of my honest opinion. I love first off that it is organic, that is a big plus in my book as I don&#x27;t like to use a lot of harsh chemicals. My hair gets very dry and I figured I would try it out on my hair. It has given my hair a big boost in moisture and made it feel so soft, the smell also isn&#x27;t bad at all. You can use this on different parts of your body so it is great.  You really don&#x27;t need a whole lot for your hair which means that it will last a lot longer. I will buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing. I recently underwent laser skin surgery on my face for actinic keratosis. (precancerous cells) My doctor recommended laser surgery, but advised my skin would take a full 2 months before I felt &amp;#34;back to normal&amp;#34;.  Additionally, I was told my skin would be extremely sensitive to light, especially sunlight.  After surgery, then sent me home with samples of heavy duty creams to begin the healing process.  Not able to go to the store to purchase the creams after the samples ran out, I started using the argan oil, morning, noon and night.  In just three days, the results were so amazing that I took pictures and emailed them to my doctor.  He could not believe my healing results and said he never saw anything like it.  I attribute it to the argan oil.  This is truly an amazing product.  What it can for for your skin is incredible.  And a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with this product.  It has definitely helped with my dry skin.  I&#x27;m pleased with the price too.</li>
            <li> Always loved Argan oil for my hair makes it shiny and smooth the best so far</li>
            <li> I have been using for two weeks now and I must say I really like it.</li>
            <li> Came as expected, timely.  Enjoying learning about and using the product.  Glad it is organic.</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes my skin super soft during the awful cold of midwest winters. Plus they sent me some helpful ways to use to product and followed up after a few weeks. So along with this product working exactly as described, they customer service was excellent too! Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a really good deal as you get a large size for the price.  This oil is very light and has a lovely fragrance.  I have been using it on my hands and today tried it on my face.  It is extremely moisturizing and a little goes a long way.  Once I finish my foot cream I will use this instead as it has many uses.</li>
            <li> Bottled leaked quite a bit when I received it, you need better quality control. Otherwise great product. I use it on my skin as well as my hair. It only takes a tiny amount to cover an area.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Over the winter I developed itchy dry patches of skin on my hands, I put some argan oil on it and it went away after just three applications. This is wonderful because it is natural, and before I was using hydrocortisone and it did not even work as well as this. Also, my husband tends to have a dry scalp. This has cured that as well. I&#x27;ll put some on his head before bed and when he wakes up his dryness is gone. I also have found that after my shower, I can put some on the ends of my hair before blow drying to nourish and protect my hair. I also use this around my cuticles and for my feet to soften my skin. Argan oil has many uses and I feel like this brand gives the best product at a fair price. Thank you!</li>
            <li> it is everything and more than i expected.  Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I love Argan Oil! It&#x27;s not just great for your skin but it&#x27;s amazing for your hair. I have natural hair and I often do the L.O.C method on my hair and the InstaNatural Argan Oil is a big part of my hair regimen. I highly recommended. Especially for the price, the amount of product you&#x27;re going to receive you&#x27;re going to be repurchasing it.</li>
            <li> I like this instead of night cream on my face. The smell ISNT so great but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and expected, great product!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the Argan Oil. My daughter and I both use it and it really works.</li>
            <li> This product is great! A little goes a long way! You just don&#x27;t want to use too much because it makes your hair look greasy and oily if you do so. I haven&#x27;t tried using it on my nails yet, but I&#x27;m sure once I start they&#x27;ll look even better!</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  After only a couple of weeks, I can see a dramatic difference in my skin.  The last product I tried (Philosophy Miracle Worker) didn&#x27;t even come close to the results using this product.  So so happy!</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this brand as it went rancid real quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First bottle was fine but second bottle went rancid in matters of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have it already, please refrigerate it to increase its shelve ife</li>
            <li> this product is ok... when it arrived it was open- but sealed! So not sure if it was a faulty package. The oil was all over the place. It also has a strange smell not sure if it is the oil mixed with the oily cardboard...</li>
            <li> This Argan oil is great! A little goes a long way, and the product has instructions on the label saying how many drops you should use for everything.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love the Argan oil! Makes my skin feel wonderful!</li>
            <li> I really like this oil so far. I have been trying it for nearly five days. I love that it does not leave your face oily. It absorbs within 3 to 5 minutes and my face feels soft throughout the day. It is cold where I live and I usually have to reapply moisturizer throughout the day. I have not had to do this with my day and night treatments with this product.</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil arrived on time and in perfect condition. A generous sized bottle. I really like the oil. It&#x27;s light weight, smells kinda like olive oil. I do indeed use it for just about everything. You can put a drop in your palm, rub you hands together and distribute through your hair for texture and shine. I use it at all the problem areas of my face like around the eyes mouth and forehead and it does appear to lessen the signs of ageing. It&#x27;s a good moisturizer as it soaks in niceley. I massage it into my nails and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the Argan, but they are growing like crazy and are very strong and hard. I have no complaints. When this bottle runs out I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Feels weak I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin or hair.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy, even on oily skin.  Balancing and hydrating.</li>
            <li> I wish we had known about Argan oil when I was younger. There are so many uses for it.  One of my favorites is for my hair.  I take a shower and wash my hair, then wrap my hair in a towel.  After a few minutes I take the towel off and brush my hair.  Then I take some Argan oil just a couple drops and put  in my hands. I rub my hands together then apply to the middle of my hair down to the ends.  I don&#x27;t put it on the top of my hair.  It really helps my frizzies to calm down.  My hair shines afterwards too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I use it as a moisturizer on my face.  I wash my face then apply a couple drops, rub in my hands and apply to my face.  It makes my face feel so smooth and it&#x27;s not greasy.  Its a great moisturizer  product.  I did get this product complimentary  to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Love this oil, and use it as added moisture for skin and hair.  This is my first time using this brand, and must say that I&#x27;m thoroughly pleased.  Love the fact that it&#x27;s organic, and not heavyweight.  The light weight oil absorbs easily and relatively quickly...to a light feel and light polish.  A bit pricey for the amount, but well worth it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. i USE ON MY SKIN AND ON MY HAIR TO CALM DOWN THE FRIZZ. AMAZON SENT MY A WRONG ITEM IN PLACE OF THIS BUT THE COMPANY FOLLOWED THROUGH AND SENT ME A BOTTLE DIRECT.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I wanted to use this specifically for hair but my fine hair just turned into a big oily mess that wont style and weighs down my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it should be ok for thicker hair but I wouldn&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! Have been using it on my face and my face looks so much better already.</li>
            <li> Okay, I must have gotten a bad batch of this or something. It smells!! It says that argan oil should smell nutty... this smells like diarrhea. No joke. I looked up signs of &#x27;bad argan oil&#x27; and a really terrible smell is most likely due to the oil going rancid from being exposed to  too much oxygen. Which actually makes sense because when this came in the mail it leaked everywhere. I lost probably about 2 to 3 tablespoons of product to the box that held it. Anyway... not really impressed with this &#x27;liquid gold&#x27;. UPDATE: Costumer service contacted me almost immediately and offered to buy me a new bottle with 2-day shipping, since my first bottle was damaged. I got my second bottle today with no packaging issues :) unfortunately it still smells pretty awful but after reading some of the other reviews, I&#x27;ve found out that that&#x27;s pretty normal and actually means that it&#x27;s fresh (?). Overall a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> This oil works good for my hair. I use it everyday. I did learn that it&#x27;s a big mistake to get it in your eyes though, so be careful. I would definitely recommend this to anybody who is trying to keep their hair under control and who wants their hair to shine and come to life. I even put it on my beard now which makes it look a little better.</li>
            <li> We use Argan Oil quite often.  This product is a good quality oil.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as acure organic argan oil.  I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> After reading various reviews about this oil. I bought it, and I really like it. It does have a funky smell to it, so I would not suggest going out after applying it. I use it for face and scalp massage, and surely liked it.</li>
            <li> This produt is great for so many things like acne, dry scalp, split ends, frizzy hair, stretch marks, &amp; more. It&#x27;s Fast Absorbing &amp; Long Lasting: Absorbs instantly without leaving an oily film on my face and hair. It Left my Face, Skin &amp; Hair feeling smooth &amp; silky to the touch. This product is so awesome I&#x27;m so glad and excited about getting this oil to test out and review for free it&#x27;s definitely worth the moneyand i&#x27;m going to add this to my daily regimen!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s really cool that you can use this for your skin AND your hair.  I love multi-tasking products to make my regime simpler.  Another natural product from InstaNatural!</li>
            <li> Great company to do business with!  Nice product.  I need more time to try out the different uses for Argan Oil to give a review for my best use.  Right now using it for face and really enjoy the way it feels.</li>
            <li> This oil is fabulous. I use it on my hair, and on my skin. It gives my skin a nourishing glow and moisturizes my hair without being greasy. A great product. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Was very happy with my order</li>
            <li> I Absolutely love this stuff.  I add it to my hair products, lotions and use it alone as a face, body or hair oil. Smooths dry skin and flyaway hair. This is a great price for it versus a salons.</li>
            <li> There are an overwhelming selection of products available for skin care, therefore it can be very difficult to know which products are best if you want healthy, glowing skin. Two products which are currently gaining favor among natural skin care enthusiasts are rosehip oil and argan oil. The nuts of the argan tree are predominantly harvested in Morocco. Although argan oil is a relatively new and unfamiliar beauty product in the United States, it has actually been a skin care staple for many generations of Mediterranean women.&lt;br /&gt;As many people will know, rosehips are small fruits produced by a certain type of rose. Like argan oil, rosehip is very high in essential fatty acids. These have two benefits when applied to the skin.</li>
            <li> I saw instant results after using this product on my hair for the first time. I have shoulder length hair, slightly wavy, quite thick but very fine texture. I like to let my hair air dry because blow drying takes out the wave and the heat damages my ends. Most products that intend to add body actually do the opposite by weighing down my hair. This is finally a product that gives shine, encourages my natural wave and takes away the dry look from my ends. I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing so many good reviews on the oil and thought I would check it for myself. After receiving it and using it for a couple of days, I noticed the bottle was leaking and leaving a ring of oil at the bottom. I contacted Instanatural because I might have received a defective bottle and they were quick to send me a new bottle free of charge! And I also got to keep the old bottle. So I purchased a separate, nearly identical bottle to keep the argan oil in and haven&#x27;t had a problem since! I opened the second bottle and noticed a bit of oil around the nozzle area and decided to switch that into a different container as well because I did not want to risk it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, I love the product! It&#x27;s very moisturizing and I use it on almost my entire body, mainly my hair, legs and feet. I add it to hair masks and body lotions for an extra touch of moisture if I feel like my skin and hair needs some extra TLC. But overall, I am extremely satisfied with my product and the amazing customer service received! Not too sure if the bottle situation only happened to me, but be careful if that happens to you!</li>
            <li> Absorbs quick. I have acne prone skin, but found this does not break me out. I use for my face, eye area, course hair, and dry hands.</li>
            <li> Great quality and a generous size bottle. Shipped quickly and it&#x27;s doing wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as smooth as it should of been and I felt oily and sticky after applying.  Just didn&#x27;t absorb like promised.  Did not like</li>
            <li> OK this stuff is so effective. I literally had an area between my thumb and fingers on my right hand that had no responded to even dermatology intervention.. it looked like mummy skin in that webbing.  I used this for one month and am amazed. I also use it on my age damaged, sun damaged hair and it restores its moisture, and bounce.  I will always have this and use faithfully daily for whatever.  (note I am 68, so I know what I am credible in reporting issues with skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I love this argan oil. Light scent, great for cuticles, dry skin, hair, makeup removing, love it</li>
