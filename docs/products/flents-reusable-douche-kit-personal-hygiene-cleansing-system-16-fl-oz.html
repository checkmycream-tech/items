            <li>If anyone has any suggestions or ideas, I would love to hear them.  </li>
            <li>Hi, I could not find this product on the shelves of many drug stores or Walmart.</li>
            <li>Perfect and tiny.  </li>
            <li>I love this, it does the job.</li>
            <li>I have been using this Faultless Tiny Kit for over 30 years, and the quality had changed.  </li>
            <li>Love it even though the bag broke.</li>
            <li>Faultless Tiny Kit-</li>
            <li>and I think it could have been better described, and would not have ordered it.</li>
            <li>and I love the case it comes in.</li>
            <li>,what more can one say?</li>
            <li>I will buy more when I need them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>They are fine for what they do of course :-)</li>
            <li>That said, it (as with so many things these days) is not as good a product as the older version.</li>
            <li>I have used it once and have to say just the one time I have used it so far it is great.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s comfortable, and reusable in a world where most everything is disposable.</li>
            <li>the designers know holes at that position can be easily blocked?</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>like that I can use with my own warm water and vinegar as a natural solution.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to take when you travel.  </li>
            <li>Easy to fill.</li>
            <li>quality material easy to use would recommend it to anyone who is looking for this type of product</li>
            <li>Just be sure you keep it clean and sterile including the pipe portion.</li>

            <li>The good: great item small and comfortable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It came in plastic box, safely wrapped and excited (if that possible to be excited about this lol) to have found a replacement.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely little, perfect for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This size is perfect for traveling and it comes with a little pouch.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more economical than buying packaged products at the store.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Light weight, flexible.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>

            <li>I enjoy the product, nothing like it around, and I have been a product user for over 30 years</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Great for personal feminine use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li>I have used this particular aid off and on for years, and I am so glad I was able to find it again.  </li>
            <li>I feel very fresh and clean and I will continue to use this a couple times a week along with the Zonite douche concentrate.</li>
            <li>Small and compact especially great for travel.</li>
            <li>I had searched for this brand for a long time and was happy when I found it.</li>
            <li>Just as it is supposed to be,and shipped perfectly,When you travel this is perfect, packs in a small space.</li>
            <li>This makes it easier to use and keep clean.  </li>
            <li>Old school is better!</li>
            <li>It is very cheaply made and the latex exterior is very sticky</li>
            <li>For my needs, I found it easy to use and the right size.  </li>
            <li>Good Job Tiny Kit!</li>
            <li>This brand seems to last a good while.</li>
            <li>Glad they have absolutely everything.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Faultless Tiny Kit several times before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are very convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very convenient and easily tucked away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact, easy to use, easy to clean and storage is not a problem, nor does anyone have a clue what it is, because of it&#x27;s white zippered bag.</li>
            <li>This is a great little kit.  </li>
            <li>Simple and effective.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>and my wife always wants to clean up while traveling.  </li>
            <li>Great product for a small woman to use at home also.</li>
            <li>feel it important to mention that I ONLY use warm water as I have had repeated severe UTI&#x27;s in the past...before using this product and completely unrelated.</li>
            <li>Small and durable with a great price.</li>
            <li>Although this product is good when you get it, it breaks down within a year.  </li>
            <li>Overall, however, I do think it is a good product very useful for many women that need personal cleansing on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>Same fine quality!</li>
            <li>The box was fine but the bulb had a tiny Slit/hole in the fold that you cant see until it&#x27;s full and leaking.</li>
            <li>found it in the store for more than double the price.</li>
            <li>should my first one need replacing.</li>
            <li>I bought a second one, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Works exactly like I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Sad to see, this was once an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>it paid for its self in the first week...</li>
            <li>This is the exact product I was looking for and couldn&#x27;t find it until now.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>, thats how much I like it and believe in it!</li>
            <li>I have been rinsing it out better thinking that it might last</li>
            <li>This is a small bag which is perfect for occasional douching with medicated solutions.  </li>
            <li>Small, easy to store, and designed to be easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I live the discretion, however I am only giving 3 stars because just below the neck these will tear very easily.</li>
            <li>Fast arrival,product exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Be sure to thoroughly dry it off after use or the rubber will tear.</li>
            <li>Just using water is certainly sufficient.</li>
            <li>If you travel, who wants to carry around a large bottle of vinegar water.  </li>
            <li>A nice little product.</li>
            <li>This is a handy little kit that should meet your needs at home or while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;It appears well made, maybe</li>
            <li>This Tiny Kit fit the bill.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>so I really have no complaints.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Fast services too.</li>
            <li>materials are so much stronger now,  Time will tell.</li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Terry</li>
            <li>Used it some more by pinching the hole closed.</li>
            <li>Very</li>
            <li>Really works well.</li>
            <li>, I JUST HAVE TO ORDER 4 MORE WHILE MY HUSBAND TRIES TO</li>
            <li>REally forever.</li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>Very discreet in size.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and reasonably long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product several months ago as I was looking for something I could fill up with warm water in the shower and rinse myself as I felt necessary.</li>
            <li>It will not last even with warm water only used.</li>
            <li>The other weakness is the top of the bag that attaches to the pipe holder.</li>
            <li>Easy to dry and hide from the kids.</li>
            <li>the more the thin ones were tearing easily were attachment made</li>
            <li>One thing I haven&#x27;t liked about even the ones I&#x27;ve had in the past is that the spot where the bag wraps around the rim always seems to be susceptible to tearing.</li>
            <li>The last two I ordered haven&#x27;t last more than a year.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this Reusable Douche.</li>
            <li>Perhaps this is a safety mechanism lest anybody squeeze water at too high a pressure into the - ahem - body cavity.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had two other TinyKits (and liked them overall), but this one seems to be made of thinner rubber and the bag was not attached to the rim.</li>
            <li>This one has a cute little discreet bag to carry it in too.....</li>
            <li>More liquid is wasted than used.</li>
            <li>I love the portability and that it is compact with a case/bag so it doesn&#x27;t take up much room in my small bathroom.</li>
            <li>The warranty says, quote: This product is not considered defective from normal deterioration or wear ....</li>
            <li>Well worth the price solid purchase</li>
            <li>I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>If you must use one, buy several because they are effectively disposals after a few uses.</li>
            <li>These are the pink pouch and the white top ones.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing not having to constantly replace or have to run the disposable douche under warm water because it&#x27;s to cold to use.</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of a small reusable douche, I can use it any time.  </li>
            <li>This is the EXACT same thing.  </li>
            <li>And now not too many stores carry it, not sure why</li>
            <li>If you traveling a few time a year, like me, or you have a small shelf space in the bathroom, you need a compact douche - this is a great thing.</li>
            <li>It is not worth the money for more Chinese made junk.</li>
            <li>This item performs as expected and is cost effective relative to the single use feminine products.</li>
            <li>This is a good product although it had a very weak bag.</li>
            <li>So far Amazon is A+.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d hoped they had fixed that problem by now, but there&#x27;s not been any design change.</li>
            <li>Holes come near the mouth of it.</li>
            <li>SO FAR HASN&#x27;T WORKED.&lt;br /&gt;BETTY</li>
            <li>The ring sometimes comes off if too much pressure is applied to it, but you just put it back on and adjust positioning.</li>
            <li>I now have a much heavier duty one that is lasting longer; I do like</li>
            <li>But as a representative of my generation, I&#x27;m kind of fed up with those who don&#x27;t have the common sense necessary to survive.</li>
            <li>easy, small and portable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Small compact and easily packable for travel.</li>
            <li>I replace my tiny kit as needed as it gets older, but I&#x27;ve been using this product for years</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a flaw but simply the normal wear of the product after repeated use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>THESE NEW TINY KITS THAT</li>
            <li>Finally a hole developed in the bag near the opening.  </li>
            <li>Same old bag!</li>
            <li>I had searched high and low in the local area stores in my city, including Wal-Mart, but no one seemed to carry the reusable type.</li>
            <li>Generally lasts about four&lt;br /&gt;or five years.</li>
            <li>The old one (same brand)</li>
            <li>The soft &amp; pliable vinyl &amp;#34;balloon&amp;#34; when squeezed, occasionally slips off the stem.</li>
            <li>Such a nice design, such a poor execution in terms of materials.</li>
            <li>Let dry completely before putting it back in its case or it will mold.</li>
            <li>Faultless has definitely done us a disservice by lowering the quality of this product and I  am very disappointed.  </li>

            <li> I am happy to know that Amazon did have it available.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find this product on amazon.  </li>
            <li> Just mix a couple caps of Zonite into the TinyKit with some warm water.</li>
            <li> It saves on disposable douches you can buy at the store, doesnt take much room to store &amp; is especially great if you travel.</li>
            <li> Fits nicely in luggage.</li>
            <li> Handy and Neat Travel Item</li>
            <li> The kit arrived in perfect condition and obviously in a new package.  </li>
            <li> I like this product because it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size, soft and like a balloon but thicker.</li>
            <li> Works great, just the right size for travel.</li>
            <li> Very nice and economical.  </li>
            <li> Important item for all women to have so they can stay clean and I&#x27;m very glad that I got mine!  </li>

            <li> and I will gladly recommend the kit to others.</li>
            <li> I love these douche bags</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> Much better than the disposable douches.</li>
            <li> This is the best one I have found in the last 10 years.  </li>
            <li> If anyone has any suggestions or ideas, I would love to hear them.  </li>
            <li> Hi, I could not find this product on the shelves of many drug stores or Walmart.</li>
            <li> Perfect and tiny.  </li>
            <li> I love this, it does the job.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Faultless Tiny Kit for over 30 years, and the quality had changed.  </li>
            <li> Love it even though the bag broke.</li>
            <li> Faultless Tiny Kit-</li>
            <li> and I think it could have been better described, and would not have ordered it.</li>
            <li> and I love the case it comes in.</li>

            <li> They are fine for what they do of course :-)</li>
            <li> That said, it (as with so many things these days) is not as good a product as the older version.</li>
            <li> I have used it once and have to say just the one time I have used it so far it is great.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s comfortable, and reusable in a world where most everything is disposable.</li>
            <li> the designers know holes at that position can be easily blocked?</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> like that I can use with my own warm water and vinegar as a natural solution.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to take when you travel.  </li>
            <li> Easy to fill.</li>
            <li> quality material easy to use would recommend it to anyone who is looking for this type of product</li>
            <li> Just be sure you keep it clean and sterile including the pipe portion.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use</li>
            <li> Cleans easily.</li>
            <li> This item is effective at what it does and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly and I am completely satisfied with this transaction.  </li>
            <li> The good: great item small and comfortable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It came in plastic box, safely wrapped and excited (if that possible to be excited about this lol) to have found a replacement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely little, perfect for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This size is perfect for traveling and it comes with a little pouch.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more economical than buying packaged products at the store.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Light weight, flexible.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I use a light alcohol spray.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the product, nothing like it around, and I have been a product user for over 30 years</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great for personal feminine use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> I have used this particular aid off and on for years, and I am so glad I was able to find it again.  </li>
            <li> I feel very fresh and clean and I will continue to use this a couple times a week along with the Zonite douche concentrate.</li>
            <li> Small and compact especially great for travel.</li>
            <li> I had searched for this brand for a long time and was happy when I found it.</li>
            <li> Just as it is supposed to be,and shipped perfectly,When you travel this is perfect, packs in a small space.</li>
            <li> This makes it easier to use and keep clean.  </li>
            <li> Old school is better!</li>
            <li> It is very cheaply made and the latex exterior is very sticky</li>
            <li> For my needs, I found it easy to use and the right size.  </li>
            <li> Good Job Tiny Kit!</li>
            <li> This brand seems to last a good while.</li>
            <li> Glad they have absolutely everything.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Faultless Tiny Kit several times before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are very convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very convenient and easily tucked away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact, easy to use, easy to clean and storage is not a problem, nor does anyone have a clue what it is, because of it&#x27;s white zippered bag.</li>
            <li> This is a great little kit.  </li>
            <li> Simple and effective.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> and my wife always wants to clean up while traveling.  </li>
            <li> Great product for a small woman to use at home also.</li>
            <li> feel it important to mention that I ONLY use warm water as I have had repeated severe UTI&#x27;s in the past...before using this product and completely unrelated.</li>
            <li> Small and durable with a great price.</li>
            <li> Although this product is good when you get it, it breaks down within a year.  </li>
            <li> Overall, however, I do think it is a good product very useful for many women that need personal cleansing on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Same fine quality!</li>
            <li> The box was fine but the bulb had a tiny Slit/hole in the fold that you cant see until it&#x27;s full and leaking.</li>
            <li> found it in the store for more than double the price.</li>
            <li> should my first one need replacing.</li>
            <li> I bought a second one, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Works exactly like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Sad to see, this was once an excellent product.  </li>
            <li> it paid for its self in the first week...</li>
            <li> This is the exact product I was looking for and couldn&#x27;t find it until now.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> , thats how much I like it and believe in it!</li>
            <li> I have been rinsing it out better thinking that it might last</li>
            <li> This is a small bag which is perfect for occasional douching with medicated solutions.  </li>
            <li> Small, easy to store, and designed to be easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I live the discretion, however I am only giving 3 stars because just below the neck these will tear very easily.</li>
            <li> Fast arrival,product exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Be sure to thoroughly dry it off after use or the rubber will tear.</li>
            <li> Just using water is certainly sufficient.</li>
            <li> If you travel, who wants to carry around a large bottle of vinegar water.  </li>
            <li> A nice little product.</li>
            <li> This is a handy little kit that should meet your needs at home or while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;It appears well made, maybe</li>
            <li> This Tiny Kit fit the bill.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> so I really have no complaints.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Fast services too.</li>
            <li> materials are so much stronger now,  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> Thanks.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Terry</li>
            <li> Used it some more by pinching the hole closed.</li>
            <li> Very</li>
            <li> Really works well.</li>
            <li> , I JUST HAVE TO ORDER 4 MORE WHILE MY HUSBAND TRIES TO</li>
            <li> REally forever.</li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> Very discreet in size.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and reasonably long-lasting.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product several months ago as I was looking for something I could fill up with warm water in the shower and rinse myself as I felt necessary.</li>
            <li> It will not last even with warm water only used.</li>
            <li> The other weakness is the top of the bag that attaches to the pipe holder.</li>
            <li> Easy to dry and hide from the kids.</li>
            <li> the more the thin ones were tearing easily were attachment made</li>
            <li> One thing I haven&#x27;t liked about even the ones I&#x27;ve had in the past is that the spot where the bag wraps around the rim always seems to be susceptible to tearing.</li>
            <li> The last two I ordered haven&#x27;t last more than a year.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this Reusable Douche.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this is a safety mechanism lest anybody squeeze water at too high a pressure into the - ahem - body cavity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two other TinyKits (and liked them overall), but this one seems to be made of thinner rubber and the bag was not attached to the rim.</li>
            <li> This one has a cute little discreet bag to carry it in too.....</li>
            <li> More liquid is wasted than used.</li>
            <li> I love the portability and that it is compact with a case/bag so it doesn&#x27;t take up much room in my small bathroom.</li>
            <li> The warranty says, quote: This product is not considered defective from normal deterioration or wear ....</li>
            <li> Well worth the price solid purchase</li>
            <li> I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> If you must use one, buy several because they are effectively disposals after a few uses.</li>
            <li> These are the pink pouch and the white top ones.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing not having to constantly replace or have to run the disposable douche under warm water because it&#x27;s to cold to use.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of a small reusable douche, I can use it any time.  </li>
            <li> This is the EXACT same thing.  </li>
            <li> And now not too many stores carry it, not sure why</li>
            <li> If you traveling a few time a year, like me, or you have a small shelf space in the bathroom, you need a compact douche - this is a great thing.</li>
            <li> It is not worth the money for more Chinese made junk.</li>
            <li> This item performs as expected and is cost effective relative to the single use feminine products.</li>
            <li> This is a good product although it had a very weak bag.</li>
            <li> So far Amazon is A+.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hoped they had fixed that problem by now, but there&#x27;s not been any design change.</li>
            <li> Holes come near the mouth of it.</li>
            <li> SO FAR HASN&#x27;T WORKED.&lt;br /&gt;BETTY</li>
            <li> The ring sometimes comes off if too much pressure is applied to it, but you just put it back on and adjust positioning.</li>
            <li> I now have a much heavier duty one that is lasting longer; I do like</li>
            <li> But as a representative of my generation, I&#x27;m kind of fed up with those who don&#x27;t have the common sense necessary to survive.</li>
            <li> easy, small and portable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Small compact and easily packable for travel.</li>
            <li> I replace my tiny kit as needed as it gets older, but I&#x27;ve been using this product for years</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a flaw but simply the normal wear of the product after repeated use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> THESE NEW TINY KITS THAT</li>
            <li> Finally a hole developed in the bag near the opening.  </li>
            <li> Same old bag!</li>
            <li> I had searched high and low in the local area stores in my city, including Wal-Mart, but no one seemed to carry the reusable type.</li>
            <li> Generally lasts about four&lt;br /&gt;or five years.</li>
            <li> The old one (same brand)</li>
            <li> The soft &amp; pliable vinyl &amp;#34;balloon&amp;#34; when squeezed, occasionally slips off the stem.</li>
            <li> Such a nice design, such a poor execution in terms of materials.</li>
            <li> Let dry completely before putting it back in its case or it will mold.</li>
            <li> Faultless has definitely done us a disservice by lowering the quality of this product and I  am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This small, hand-held douche is very convenient and useable.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with the small one if you really want to do some proper cleaning...</li>
            <li> I think this one is going to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Have not used as it was obvious it had been sitting on shelf a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m concerned it may not last very long.    </li>
            <li> Will not last very long.</li>
            <li> , I used to have one like that, and it lasted me a long time.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re careful it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product in the small town I live it and couldn&#x27;t believe that Amazon had it.  </li>
            <li> I have used these little Tiny Kits for over 40 years and never had a problem with any of them except the last one I purchased.  </li>
            <li> I only put water in it, so I can not attest to the durability of the product if other things are put in it, but it is showing now signs of tear.  </li>
            <li> The rubber does break eventually but it takes a very long time.</li>
            <li> Also keep it dry after use.</li>
            <li> Not worth sending back.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a new one to replace one that got a hole in the bag and this new one is thin and not of the quality that I have always found them to be in the past.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to fill it all of the way up or after a while it will tear around the neck from the water pressure.  </li>
            <li> Item was as expected.  </li>
            <li> nozzle was a little on the long side and the bag has no structure so don&#x27;t plan on placing it on a counter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So that is my tribute to the long life of this little gadget.  </li>
            <li> This douche kit was just like the one my mom bought me over 20 years ago, and needed to be replaced due to fact that the bag ripped.</li>
            <li> CVS, Walgreens, other like stores????</li>
            <li> Comes with a small, white plastic bag for storage; discreet.</li>
            <li> There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any other product like it on the market however, so now I am in a delimma as to what to do about a replacement.  </li>
            <li> Very rough tip, as if they don&#x27;t know which body part their products are designed for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It has turned something that is normally accomplished in very little time into a time consuming, frustrating ordeal.  </li>
            <li> Not worth purchasing either.</li>
            <li> Small and compact, with no hanging up &amp; long hoses, etc.</li>
            <li> the rubber disintegrated in less than 6 months...disappointed.</li>
            <li> Expect to get a year or year and a half depending on frequency of use.</li>
            <li> I have had a few of these and they break down often.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t work for me but a little vinegar does.  </li>
            <li> I do like the little pouch to store it after use.</li>
            <li> After a few months of using this kit about twice a week, I noticed that the balloon portion that fits around the nozzle was a bit looser causing some water to squeeze out during use.</li>
            <li> It was supposed to be here within a few days of christmas.</li>
            <li> HAVE HAD TO REPLACE 3 IN JUST A FEW WEEKS -</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tolerate the disposable ones, what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s design to do, no more no les</li>
            <li> I needed something small, portable, and reusable.</li>
            <li> I usually just buy another one but they cost between $12-$15.</li>
            <li> Amazon came through as usual.</li>
            <li> Small and dependable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reusable, as opposed to the one-use-only kits usually sold.  </li>
            <li> a little thin but</li>
            <li> I bought a douche kit at least 20 years ago.  </li>
            <li> This douche bag fills that requirement as it folds up into a very small package that fits in her travel bag almost anywhere.  </li>
            <li> The bag looks a little weird</li>
            <li> Getting tired of products (and schooling) being dumbed-down to the lowest common denominator.</li>
            <li> that was s different brand but was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> SEEM TO BE WEAK IN THE NECK AREA AND JUST SPLIT OFF..</li>
            <li> product with a weak neck area.</li>
            <li> It was a hard plastic with tubes and weird stuff</li>
            <li> In addition to the tip being very hard and uncomfortable, the bag literally exploded after the 4th use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve found no alternatives, but will switch as soon as I find one.  </li>
            <li> This thing has uncomfortable edges.</li>
            <li> The Bad: very thin rubber, torn around the neck and had a tendency to leak around neck, before it got torn.  </li>
            <li> The nozzle is very uncomfortable during insertion and once inserted.</li>
            <li> The vinyl sticks together and is almsot impossible to get unstuck so that it can be refilled for additional uses.</li>
            <li> Well after tossing mine I was disappointed because they no longer carried them.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with this item.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use pre packed ones with a vinegar solution (very bad for your lady business).</li>
            <li> Edit 2: leaks horribly around the rim.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> So glad I bought this online....found it in the store for more than double the price. It&#x27;s compact, easy to use, easy to clean and storage is not a problem, nor does anyone have a clue what it is, because of it&#x27;s white zippered bag. Important item for all women to have so they can stay clean and I&#x27;m very glad that I got mine!  :)</li>
            <li> Old school is better! I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely little, perfect for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;The nozzle was a little on the long side and the bag has no structure so don&#x27;t plan on placing it on a counter.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it to take on a trip and it totally met my needs.</li>
            <li> I have used it once and have to say just the one time I have used it so far it is great.</li>
            <li> The kit arrived in perfect condition and obviously in a new package.  It was shipped quickly and I am completely satisfied with this transaction.  So far Amazon is A+.</li>
            <li> Have not used as it was obvious it had been sitting on shelf a very long time.  Although unopened, color of item was faded.  Not worth sending back.  Not worth purchasing either.</li>
            <li> We travel quite a lot and my wife always wants to clean up while traveling.  This douche bag fills that requirement as it folds up into a very small package that fits in her travel bag almost anywhere.  Great product for a small woman to use at home also.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product several months ago as I was looking for something I could fill up with warm water in the shower and rinse myself as I felt necessary. I LOVE this product and have reordered another kit to keep on hand should my first one need replacing. After a few months of using this kit about twice a week, I noticed that the balloon portion that fits around the nozzle was a bit looser causing some water to squeeze out during use. I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a flaw but simply the normal wear of the product after repeated use.&lt;br /&gt;I feel it important to mention that I ONLY use warm water as I have had repeated severe UTI&#x27;s in the past...before using this product and completely unrelated. I do not experience any irritation at all during or after use.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of a small reusable douche, I can use it any time.  It&#x27;s refreshing not having to constantly replace or have to run the disposable douche under warm water because it&#x27;s to cold to use.</li>
            <li> Edit: It was supposed to be here within a few days of christmas. It&#x27;s January 6th.  Edit 2: leaks horribly around the rim. More liquid is wasted than used. The bag should be attached to the white ring. It&#x27;s portable though.</li>
            <li> Perfect for home or travel. Small and compact, with no hanging up &amp; long hoses, etc.</li>
            <li> Very rough tip, as if they don&#x27;t know which body part their products are designed for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, what&#x27;s the point of placing multiple holes along the nozzle when one hole on the tip is simply enough to do the job?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t the designers know holes at that position can be easily blocked?</li>
            <li> If you traveling a few time a year, like me, or you have a small shelf space in the bathroom, you need a compact douche - this is a great thing. I bought a second one, and I love it. I take it with me every time in my travels.</li>
            <li> This is the same pouch my grandmother bought for me when I was a teenager. It&#x27;s more economical than buying packaged products at the store.</li>
            <li> I needed a new one.  The old one (same brand) I had for almost 15 years, and somehow I punched a hole in the rubber with my fingernail.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best kits on the market.  Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> This size is perfect for traveling and it comes with a little pouch.  Note: Be careful not to fill it all of the way up or after a while it will tear around the neck from the water pressure.  If you&#x27;re careful it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> the rubber disintegrated in less than 6 months...disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a great little kit.  Used often it will wear out at the neck, but it will give about 30 to 50 uses during its life cycle.  It is convenient because of its size and flexibility.  Going on the fourth one now and it has been the item of choice for about 10 years.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for home &amp; travel.  I have used this product type for years &amp; wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Heard about this kit from friends, works well. Easy to use and I will gladly recommend the kit to others.</li>
            <li> I love these douche bags BUT the lip always gets a hole in it where it rubs on the white ring.  It has a lifetime warranty and believe me, I have returned them for years and have received some 7 or 8 replacements.  They need to reinforce the neck area of the bag.</li>
            <li> A nice little product. Had one myself. Bought this one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> This douche kit was just like the one my mom bought me over 20 years ago, and needed to be replaced due to fact that the bag ripped. I wanted one just like it to replace it, and this one was it. I love the portability and that it is compact with a case/bag so it doesn&#x27;t take up much room in my small bathroom.</li>
            <li> I am on my third one, purchased locally rather than on Amazon. They wear out....but this newest one is thicker latex and I have hope that it will last longer. I just noticed someone else&#x27;s review that said they have a lifetime warranty, but I do not see that on the box. Yes, the latex sticks to itself when it dries, but just blow into it like you would a balloon and it will come unstuck. Four stars for short life span, otherwise would be five. Edit: The warranty says, quote: This product is not considered defective from normal deterioration or wear .... [etc] Meaning, this warranty is a shelf life, not a warranty. I kept my receipt this time so I can return it when it inevitably rips around the attachment point about two months into its use. Such a nice design, such a poor execution in terms of materials.</li>
            <li> A lot smaller than I realized!</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s design to do, no more no les</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two other TinyKits (and liked them overall), but this one seems to be made of thinner rubber and the bag was not attached to the rim. I had to put it on.  Also, it looks like the mold used to make the bag or the process that was used left flaws in the final product.  Still usable, but I wonder if the vendor is selling seconds or if the manufacturer has lowered their quality since I last bought one. I&#x27;m concerned it may not last very long.    One thing I haven&#x27;t liked about even the ones I&#x27;ve had in the past is that the spot where the bag wraps around the rim always seems to be susceptible to tearing. I&#x27;d hoped they had fixed that problem by now, but there&#x27;s not been any design change.</li>
            <li> This tiny kit was just what I was looking for. I needed something small, portable, and reusable. This Tiny Kit fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Will not last very long.Never again</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find this product on amazon.  I have  been looking for it at all the pharmacies.  I didn&#x27;t even think to look for it and there it was.  This item is the best I have found , easy to use and discreet to transport in overnight bag.  I would suggest getting a couple because they don&#x27;t last forever.  Be sure to thoroughly dry it off after use or the rubber will tear.</li>
            <li> Fast arrival,product exactly as described. Very pleased</li>
            <li> Works exactly like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> 4stars for design and function, but 0 stars for material durability.  Like others, I&#x27;ve experienced quality issues.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve found no alternatives, but will switch as soon as I find one.  Sad to see, this was once an excellent product.  If you must use one, buy several because they are effectively disposals after a few uses.</li>
            <li> This is a good product although it had a very weak bag.</li>
            <li> These are very convenient and easy to use. I live the discretion, however I am only giving 3 stars because just below the neck these will tear very easily. I usually just buy another one but they cost between $12-$15.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I had one that the lip ripped but it lasted quite awhile so I really have no complaints.  I didn&#x27;t realize there was lifetime warranty on it, I&#x27;ll have to check that option out if and when this one breaks.</li>
            <li> The rubber bulb doesn&#x27;t push out the water as well as a plastic bulb from like a store bought douche</li>
            <li> You cannot find this product in the stores anymore, only prefilled bottles containing vinegar.  If you travel, who wants to carry around a large bottle of vinegar water.  Why isn&#x27;t this product in stores anymore?  CVS, Walgreens, other like stores????</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Don&#x27;t use pre packed ones with a vinegar solution (very bad for your lady business). Just using water is certainly sufficient. I replace my tiny kit as needed as it gets older, but I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I will always have one handy!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s discrete, and does it&#x27;s job. it&#x27;s comfortable, and reusable in a world where most everything is disposable. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet.  Seems to be as billed.</li>
            <li> will use it some time, I used to have one like that, and it lasted me a long time.So this will also, I hope</li>
            <li> This product is a great size for travel and privacy.  It is very cheaply made and the latex exterior is very sticky</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere locally,(used to buy this at a local discount store), and could no longer find it, even at the pharmacy.  I have used this particular aid off and on for years, and I am so glad I was able to find it again.  Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Have had this type before, and wanted as a replacement standby. Would order again, if needed. Small and compact especially great for travel.</li>
            <li> Since the manufacturers of the prepackaged women&#x27;s care products seem to not care about us being &amp;#34;pinched&amp;#34;, I have opted to get rid of the &amp;#34;disposables&amp;#34;.  THIS WORKS GREAT.  Very nice and economical.  Lasts a long time.  Fast services too.</li>
            <li> Unbeatable design &amp; value!!!  Please make this product forever!</li>
            <li> I had one similar to this about a year ago from walgreens that worked well. It&#x27;s not something I use daily- Well after tossing mine I was disappointed because they no longer carried them. There was another I assumed would work as well that was s different brand but was really disappointed. It was a hard plastic with tubes and weird stuff so that went in garbage immediately. I had given up hope for another like this and in a whim searched online and could finally breathe. It&#x27;s the perfect size, soft and like a balloon but thicker. Easy to dry and hide from the kids. Don&#x27;t want to explain that now;)&lt;br /&gt;I like that I can use with my own warm water and vinegar as a natural solution. It came in plastic box, safely wrapped and excited (if that possible to be excited about this lol) to have found a replacement.</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered. I had searched high and low in the local area stores in my city, including Wal-Mart, but no one seemed to carry the reusable type. Amazon came through as usual. The bag is perfectly sized and the pouch is discreet and attractive.</li>
            <li> Small, easy to store, and designed to be easy to clean. Comes with a small, white plastic bag for storage; discreet. Use vinegar, avoid chemicals, save money....works for me.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to take when you travel.  An excellent product.</li>
            <li> Small and dependable.</li>
            <li> This was great for it&#x27;s purpose. I had searched for this brand for a long time and was happy when I found it.</li>
            <li> I love this product... it paid for its self in the first week... I picked up one for my daughter and will be picking up another for my neice.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these, one for home and one for travel. Within 4 months they both leaked with pin holes around the neck.</li>
            <li> They get holes in the rubbery material.  Back in the day, they were made to last.  The last two I ordered haven&#x27;t last more than a year.  Don&#x27;t know if I will get another one.</li>
            <li> TinyKit is now a regular product in my hygiene routine! I can not even begin to tell you what a wonderful product this is! Much better than the disposable douches. I feel very fresh and clean and I will continue to use this a couple times a week along with the Zonite douche concentrate. Just mix a couple caps of Zonite into the TinyKit with some warm water. I have never had any issues with Ph level or odor. I think every woman should be using this on a regular basis! The best feeling of clean ever!! A must try!!</li>
            <li> This is a handy little kit that should meet your needs at home or while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;It appears well made, maybe a little thin but materials are so much stronger now,  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> This product is reusable and perfect for in-home or travel use. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Although this product is good when you get it, it breaks down within a year.  Holes come near the mouth of it. I have had a few of these and they break down often. I have not seen any alternative product to use..if I did, I&#x27;d try it!</li>
            <li> This is the best one I have found in the last 10 years.  The bag is a thicker rubber so the sides do not stick together like the thinner ones do.  This makes it easier to use and keep clean.  I think this one is going to last a long time.  Good Job Tiny Kit!</li>
            <li> Light weight, flexible. Just a bit flimsy but great for travelling. Haven&#x27;t seen these in stores for years so I would suggest ordering several to have on hand.</li>
            <li> This is the exact product I was looking for and couldn&#x27;t find it until now.  For my needs, I found it easy to use and the right size.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> This product arrived well packed and ahead of schedule. It is perfect for travel or&lt;br /&gt;simply shower. Simply add water and use as directed. Generally lasts about four&lt;br /&gt;or five years. A &amp;#34;must-have&amp;#34; for ladies who consider that type of internal wash.</li>
            <li> This item is effective at what it does and the price was very reasonable. The bag looks a little weird so I might order a replacement. Would buy another when the warranty wears out.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used yet but it&#x27;s what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Item was as expected.  Delivery was fast❤️❤️</li>
            <li> In addition to the tip being very hard and uncomfortable, the bag literally exploded after the 4th use. It leaked the entire time, the screw in portion of the tip adapter does not come fastened into the the bag. It is held in place by the rubber molded ring in the neck. It is not worth the money for more Chinese made junk. It will not last even with warm water only used.</li>
            <li> Am I the only one who is having a problem with this product?  I have used these little Tiny Kits for over 40 years and never had a problem with any of them except the last one I purchased.  I ordered a new one to replace one that got a hole in the bag and this new one is thin and not of the quality that I have always found them to be in the past.  The vinyl sticks together and is almsot impossible to get unstuck so that it can be refilled for additional uses. It would be perfect for a disposable douche bag, but for a reusable one it is not convenient or enjoyable to use at all. It has turned something that is normally accomplished in very little time into a time consuming, frustrating ordeal.  Faultless has definitely done us a disservice by lowering the quality of this product and I  am very disappointed.  There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any other product like it on the market however, so now I am in a delimma as to what to do about a replacement.  If anyone has any suggestions or ideas, I would love to hear them.  Thanks.  Carolyn</li>
            <li> Product came as described. Discrete pouch was included with the product. Simple and effective. Well worth the price solid purchase</li>
            <li> Hi, I could not find this product on the shelves of many drug stores or Walmart. I am happy to know that Amazon did have it available. Thanks, Terry</li>
            <li> This &#x27;mini&#x27; douche is great. It saves on disposable douches you can buy at the store, doesnt take much room to store &amp; is especially great if you travel. The rubber does break eventually but it takes a very long time. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Reusable and simple. Let dry completely before putting it back in its case or it will mold.</li>
            <li> As my daughter would write.  I bought a douche kit at least 20 years ago.  Finally a hole developed in the bag near the opening.  Used it some more by pinching the hole closed. Finally thought maybe Amazon has something like it.  This is the EXACT same thing.  So that is my tribute to the long life of this little gadget.  Very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS Wish they would just show pictures of these things, would be helpful (they do show pics of sex toys for heavens sake).</li>
            <li> Really works well. Great for travel. Fits nicely in luggage. Easy to fill. Easy to clean. Very private and discrete.</li>
            <li> quality material easy to use would recommend it to anyone who is looking for this type of product</li>
            <li> TINY KITS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE 3 IN JUST A FEW WEEKS - MY HUSBAND USES IT FOR IRREGATION OF THE COLON ON A DAILY BASES - THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT WORKS FOR HIM , BUT THESE NEW TINY KITS THAT I&lt;br /&gt;HAVE JUST PURCHASED SEEM TO BE WEAK IN THE NECK AREA AND JUST SPLIT OFF..SINCE YOU HAVE&lt;br /&gt;NO COMPETITION ON THIS PRODUCT, I JUST HAVE TO ORDER 4 MORE WHILE MY HUSBAND TRIES TO&lt;br /&gt;MAKE THE NECKS STRONGER USING TAPE, ETC. ETC.WHICH SO FAR HASN&#x27;T WORKED.&lt;br /&gt;BETTY M EAVES</li>
            <li> This small, hand-held douche is very convenient and useable.  I could not find anything like this in the stores, and I was very glad to find it on line.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and of good quality.</li>
            <li> This thing has uncomfortable edges. Choose another one. It does work if you can tolerate the insertion and the pull once done.</li>
            <li> This item performs as expected and is cost effective relative to the single use feminine products. Just be sure you keep it clean and sterile including the pipe portion. I use a light alcohol spray. Also keep it dry after use. The two aspects I find a problem are the life of the product that never measures up to the guarantee. Expect to get a year or year and a half depending on frequency of use. The other weakness is the top of the bag that attaches to the pipe holder. I find it may slip off the rim as you squeeze the bag to dispense the solution or water. I would recommend using it in the bathtub or shower. Overall, however, I do think it is a good product very useful for many women that need personal cleansing on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Just perfect for my needs and frankly as I remembered!</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is very easy to use. Very convenient and easily tucked away. This product has met my expectations.</li>
            <li> These are the pink pouch and the white top ones.  They are fine for what they do of course :-)</li>
            <li> Great for travel and the size is perfect for storage even for home and privacy.</li>
            <li> Same old bag! Same fine quality! Glad they&#x27;re still making it! Glad the shipping service was so good! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Perfect and tiny.  Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this, it does the job. I can&#x27;t tolerate the disposable ones, what a waste of money. This is reliable and reusable. It lasts for years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Faultless Tiny Kit for over 30 years, and the quality had changed.  The bag had gotten thinner and became easier to rip around the lip part.  And now not too many stores carry it, not sure why, so I resulted to buying it on line.  And price had gone up as well.  I enjoy the product, nothing like it around, and I have been a product user for over 30 years, thats how much I like it and believe in it!</li>
            <li> The bag leaks and does not seal properly around the nozzle. The nozzle is very uncomfortable during insertion and once inserted. I am very unhappy with this item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small.  Compact.  And I only use it with water...  At the stores I kept finding big bulky ones.  Oh!  This one has a cute little discreet bag to carry it in too.....</li>
            <li> Love it even though the bag broke.</li>
            <li> Faultless Tiny Kit- Handy and Neat Travel Item&lt;br /&gt;Product works as described and very easy to setup and clean. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> easy, small and portable.&lt;br /&gt;I bought one some years ago and it lasted for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;met my expectations.</li>
            <li> i had been looking for one of these for a while. Good price</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 7 or 8 months now and it is still holding up.  I only put water in it, so I can not attest to the durability of the product if other things are put in it, but it is showing now signs of tear.  The ring sometimes comes off if too much pressure is applied to it, but you just put it back on and adjust positioning.</li>
            <li> The faultless reusable douche 16 oz capacity is the perfect size for carrying in your purse. It&#x27;s also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with the small one if you really want to do some proper cleaning...I&#x27;ve met lots of women in my life that could change their life around if they knew about this product...if you&#x27;re a female YOU NEED THIS FOR YOUR DAILY HEALTH program...</li>
            <li> This brand seems to last a good while. Small and durable with a great price. It is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is a good product by a good company that has been around forever.  REally forever. I couldn&#x27;t find this product in the small town I live it and couldn&#x27;t believe that Amazon had it.  Glad they have absolutely everything.  These will only last about 2 years.  I noticed on the instruction booklet that I shouldn&#x27;t be putting anything but water in the bag.  Really?  That doesn&#x27;t work for me but a little vinegar does.  I have been rinsing it out better thinking that it might last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product with a weak neck area.</li>
            <li> Purchased August 17, 2014.  The good: great item small and comfortable and easy to use.  The Bad: very thin rubber, torn around the neck and had a tendency to leak around neck, before it got torn.  Very cheap rubber.  This is not supposed to be disposable, I&#x27;ve only had it for 9-1/2 months!</li>
            <li> This product was not what I thought it was and I think it could have been better described, and would not have ordered it.</li>
            <li> I feel o review is necessary.</li>
            <li> Have used for years and they are the best.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Great product.</li>
            <li> Great for personal feminine use.  Small compact and easily packable for travel.</li>
            <li> Good quality and works well.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect size for someone like me who needs to use this once in awhile. It is so easy to use and I love the case it comes in.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I do like the little pouch to store it after use.</li>
            <li> I cannot find this product in stores.  Pharmacies carry the disposable products but not the reusable ones.  This is a small bag which is perfect for occasional douching with medicated solutions.  I have purchased one for my travel case, one for home and one for vacation home so I don&#x27;t forget.  You never know when you may need it and it does come with a plastic pouch for storage or traveling.</li>
            <li> Just as it is supposed to be,and shipped perfectly,When you travel this is perfect, packs in a small space.,what more can one say?</li>
            <li> I now have a much heavier duty one that is lasting longer; I do like the more the thin ones were tearing easily were attachment made</li>
            <li> Works great, just the right size for travel.</li>
            <li> I bought the Faultless Tiny Kit several times before.&lt;br /&gt;It works good, and  i take it with me when I travel. I will buy more when I need them.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this Reusable Douche.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Great product!</li>
            <li> Finally found this! Had one for 20+ years; compact for home or traveling. That said, it (as with so many things these days) is not as good a product as the older version. The soft &amp; pliable vinyl &amp;#34;balloon&amp;#34; when squeezed, occasionally slips off the stem. And the water, of course, goes all over. Perhaps this is a safety mechanism lest anybody squeeze water at too high a pressure into the - ahem - body cavity. I don&#x27;t know. But as a representative of my generation, I&#x27;m kind of fed up with those who don&#x27;t have the common sense necessary to survive. Getting tired of products (and schooling) being dumbed-down to the lowest common denominator.</li>
            <li> The box was fine but the bulb had a tiny Slit/hole in the fold that you cant see until it&#x27;s full and leaking.</li>
            <li> Convenient for travel. Cleans easily. Much larger capacity than a pre-filled store bought douche. Very handy to have. Comes with everything needed. Very discreet in size.</li>
            <li> This is the best and most convenient kit I have found.  It&#x27;s reusable, as opposed to the one-use-only kits usually sold.  Reasonably priced and reasonably long-lasting.  Easy to clean and use.</li>
    </ol>
