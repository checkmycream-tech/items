            <li>Either way, it works wonderfully, but be aware that it might just stop working one day like mine did.</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be great for a beginner because how light it is.</li>
            <li>This product was absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair to begin with so for me it is perfect!!</li>
            <li>Cute color and good price.</li>
            <li>It was so lightly warm that I was able to have it touch my skin and not burn.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very smooth and doesn&#x27;t break my hair.</li>
            <li>Did not have many expectations about this straightener.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this iron</li>
            <li>I enjoyed getting up in the morning and fixing my hair. . .</li>
            <li>It is better than the chi i had.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is just perfect in the humid Michigan weather.  </li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron i have ever used.</li>
            <li>For the price, this is an awesome flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good luck with Hot Tools products.</li>
            <li>I loved my chi and it worked so well that my expectations were high!</li>
            <li>Price was good, fast shipping</li>
            <li>It came in original packaging too:)</li>
            <li>After 2 years of use, the light continued to work but the plates would not heat up.</li>
            <li>Only one or two passes and you are good to go.  </li>
            <li>but this Conair is not bad either.</li>
            <li>But this one does the job with about two quick passes.  </li>
            <li>It heated up quickly, and got the job done quickly as well.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and does the job.  </li>
            <li>The price from this vendor was great and item received in just a few days.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soooo much better than my old one.</li>
            <li>I had recently bought a hot tools curling wand on Amazon and it was amazing,</li>
            <li>Hands down its the best flat iron on the market!</li>
            <li>but this iron gets rid if the frizz fast and keeps it that way all day!  </li>
            <li>This straightner works very well!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my chi</li>
            <li>I had been using a Chi, but when my Chi broke this Hot Tools straightener was recommended to me.</li>
            <li>Works great on my thick hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very affordable for this level of quality.</li>
            <li>Received the product very promptly.  </li>
            <li>Really straightens hair and flyaways well.  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t feel like it was very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I am someone who is very OCD about my belongings, so</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Had to send it back, and Amazon wouldn&#x27;t even give me a full refund for the clearly defective product I received.</li>
            <li>First I thought it&#x27;d be the one with the digital window</li>
            <li>If I wanted to spend the extra $20, I would have purchased the Hot Tools</li>
            <li>For someone like me, that has frizzy, wavy, thick blond hair, this straightener always managed to tame my hair beautifully and it would hold up all day.</li>
            <li>so when I finally decided to get a new flat iron, I went for the same brand and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Heats up quick, does not snag any hair and is good for thick or thin hair.</li>
            <li>The only positive was amazons service and making refunding &amp; returning so simple.</li>
            <li>It takes forever to heat up and I barely purchased this product.</li>
            <li>Very sleek and minimal looking as well.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty thick and hard to straighten with most flat irons.  </li>

            <li> No static either.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s so thick and frizzy</li>
            <li> I have thick hair also.</li>
            <li> and it has broken within 2 months.</li>
            <li> So, all in all, maybe I just got a bad straightener.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product.</li>

            <li> You get what you pay for. Did not have many expectations about this straightener. It takes forever to heat up and I barely purchased this product.</li>
            <li> My old flat iron had slowly been getting worse over the years from the coating on the plates wearing off.  I had recently bought a hot tools curling wand on Amazon and it was amazing, so when I finally decided to get a new flat iron, I went for the same brand and was not disappointed. It&#x27;s soooo much better than my old one. I have long (middle of my back) hair that&#x27;s so thick and frizzy but this iron gets rid if the frizz fast and keeps it that way all day!  It&#x27;s also very affordable for this level of quality. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Received the product very promptly.  No problems with product at all.  This flat iron is just perfect in the humid Michigan weather.  Heats up well.  Only one or two passes and you are good to go.  Really straightens hair and flyaways well.  Would highly recommend this product.  The price from this vendor was great and item received in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all. It was so lightly warm that I was able to have it touch my skin and not burn. The only positive was amazons service and making refunding &amp; returning so simple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for almost half a year now and it&#x27;s held up beautifully. I&#x27;m very glad I went with this brand. Heats up quick, does not snag any hair and is good for thick or thin hair. Very sleek and minimal looking as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this when my chi broke!! (It got pulled off the counter and busted in two!) I loved my chi and it worked so well that my expectations were high! This straightner works very well! Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my chi but it&#x27;s probably better for my hair!! It runs smooth on my hair and works great! I would recommend this to anyone! I have straight hair to begin with so for me it is perfect!! And the price is great too!!</li>
            <li> way too bulky for what I need it to do.. it seems to heavy and doesn&#x27;t get close enough to the scalp</li>
            <li> First I thought it&#x27;d be the one with the digital window and it didn&#x27;t feel like it was very sturdy. It&#x27;d be great for a beginner because how light it is. I returned it and went with the Sedu. Hands down its the best flat iron on the market!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product. I bought this for my daughter for her birthday and it has broken within 2 months. She used it maybe twice a week and it just suddenly stopped working. Apparently it is too late for me to return this item.</li>
            <li> The best straightener ive had yet!! I only have to pass it once over my hair and im done! It came in original packaging too:)</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron i have ever used. It does not hurt the hair it is great I LOVE this iron</li>
            <li> Love this iron!  Works great on my thick hair!</li>
            <li> For the price, this is an awesome flat iron.  My hair is pretty thick and hard to straighten with most flat irons.  But this one does the job with about two quick passes.  No static either.  It&#x27;s also very smooth and doesn&#x27;t break my hair.</li>
            <li> Not a very good straightener but fast arrival. Cute color and good price. It hurts to hold it after a while.</li>
            <li> This product was absolutely amazing. For someone like me, that has frizzy, wavy, thick blond hair, this straightener always managed to tame my hair beautifully and it would hold up all day. I enjoyed getting up in the morning and fixing my hair. . . for a little over a month and a half. For whatever reason, the straightener just stopped working after less than two months of use. I am someone who is very OCD about my belongings, so rest assured when I say I take care of my stuff and always store carefully to keep from damaging my things. But this straightener just went POOF! And it was done. Had to send it back, and Amazon wouldn&#x27;t even give me a full refund for the clearly defective product I received. So, all in all, maybe I just got a bad straightener. Either way, it works wonderfully, but be aware that it might just stop working one day like mine did.</li>
            <li> I loved this straightener. I had been using a Chi, but when my Chi broke this Hot Tools straightener was recommended to me. I believe I bought it at ULTA for about $60 2 years ago. Everything was perfect about it and had no problems.It heated up quickly, and got the job done quickly as well. I have thick hair also. After 2 years of use, the light continued to work but the plates would not heat up. I would recommend it as well, but I ended up purchasing a Conair InfinitiPro. If I wanted to spend the extra $20, I would have purchased the Hot Tools but this Conair is not bad either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for about 3 months now and I love it! It is better than the chi i had.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Heats up quickly and does the job.  I would recommend this product to a friend.  I&#x27;ve had good luck with Hot Tools products.</li>
            <li> Perfect, just what my daughter wanted! Price was good, fast shipping</li>
