            <li>It is absolutely gorgeous and full.</li>
            <li>, it made me feel better.</li>
            <li>i will most lukelt never buy from amazon again</li>
            <li>i absolutley love i reccomend getting a wig brush</li>
            <li>it was okay as a temporary wig until i got my hair re-done.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li>I have had this wig since 2012, and I am still in love with it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>love love love</li>
            <li>I have bought alot of wigs that were either ok or ok looking.</li>
            <li>problem with this is the top.</li>
            <li>CUTE.</li>
            <li>Better than the store bought one.</li>
            <li>but I love this wig!Its already styled and looks real!GET</li>
            <li>Overall very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It is fabulous!</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>i love this wig</li>
            <li>and I ended up falling in love.</li>
            <li>I love this wig, people think it&#x27;s my legit hair</li>
            <li>I feel so cute.</li>
            <li>color is ok.</li>
            <li>i wear hat, maybe ok.</li>
            <li>Good for a more realistic better quality Halloween costume wig.  </li>
            <li>it was so soft and easy to style and it came with a wig cap it is beautiful</li>
            <li>It fit pretty good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d receive compliments daily about how beautiful it was and many couldn&#x27;t even guess that it was a wig.</li>
            <li>The wig was a different color and it was incredibly shiny.</li>
            <li>looked real, texture wise.</li>
            <li>with a wig cap and some really cool purple socks!</li>
            <li>If you wear hat with it and can pull off full hair, get it!</li>
            <li>Customer service people are more friendly.</li>
            <li>But you can easily change the wig so it fits you.</li>
            <li>Easily falls off.</li>
            <li>color on the wig is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>Nothing a quick trim couldn&#x27;t fix, though!</li>
            <li>Now there&#x27;s a huge knot in the bottom</li>
            <li>, eh, sure, it&#x27;s worth $9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the colour, the length and style, plus it came with a hair net.</li>
            <li>I wore it only twice and took great care of it</li>
            <li>This hair is truly cheap.</li>
            <li>They used to be thicker, not shiny, have nice color depth, and have a real look to them.</li>
            <li>Overall, GREAT investment.</li>
            <li>It was soft, beautiful and looked quite real.</li>
            <li>I have free two-day shipping and it arrived right on time!</li>
            <li>I originally got this for some cosplays, but when I was in the hospital for 3 months, I lost a lot of hair from the medications and whatnot,</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>I originally got this wig for a cosplay I was doing</li>
            <li>It took 10 days when it was originally estimated about 30-40 days.</li>
            <li>The parting is a bit odd, but besides that it&#x27;s a good buy!</li>
            <li>Its not quite as full as the picture shows</li>
            <li>It gets tangled pretty easily if you don&#x27;t brush it.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter who has recently experienced hair loss due to illness.  </li>
            <li>but I believe there are two factors that wore it out that quickly.</li>
            <li>and the wig itself is sewn in a circular pattern, leaving a part that looks extraordinarily doll like.</li>
            <li>and after you wash it a bit the shine starts to go away making it look more realistic.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and would definitely recommend it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I was happy with that, but apparently no one had realized that the brown wig wasn&#x27;t my real hair, they were just talking about the purple clip.</li>
            <li>It looks and even feels very real!</li>
            <li>this wig looks very pretty.</li>
            <li>the color is more of a light aubern, not dark brown.</li>
            <li>The wig itself is very pretty.</li>
            <li>i trimmed the excessively long bangs on this wig and it is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I recommend this wig for anyone who&#x27;s looking it have fun with wigs and incorporate it into their fashion.</li>
            <li>This one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>worth the buy.</li>
            <li>so it looked more natural, but</li>
            <li>Strangers smile at me.</li>
            <li>I am already going to buy 2 more from them :) however, it kept slipping off my head</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to wear when going out sometimes</li>
            <li>This is the first one I ever bought,And I LOVE IT!Im 18 and already have natural nice long hair</li>
            <li>the bangs were way too long and just kind of went all over.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Will make more purchases if necessary.</li>
            <li>:) I was a bit scared it would be one solid color</li>
            <li>Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the top of it has a circle weave</li>
            <li>I would never be able to wear it in public unless I was truly going for the &amp;#34;fake hair&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Its a pretty color though.</li>
            <li>I wear the wig, my self esteem is so much higher.</li>
            <li>Everyone thought it was my real hair!</li>
            <li>This wig was exactly how I imagined it would be.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I got it took look pretty darn close to the picture.</li>
            <li>this is my first wig</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I was looking for and came just as described.</li>
            <li>the only negative I can think of is that its a little shorter than I would have wanted and the very top is a tad thin..but still a awesome wig for the price.</li>
            <li>I did cut it a little bit too still very cute.</li>
            <li>The seller shipped pretty fast and packaged</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s low lights and high lights which makes it just that more realistic looking!</li>
            <li>Just push the wig back farther on your head and the bangs are fine, and don&#x27;t have to be cut at all.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t matter if people could tell it wasn&#x27;t real or not</li>
            <li>I had to lift the wig away at my hairline to prove to people it wasn&#x27;t real.</li>
            <li>Very shiny.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it, but it seems it would melt it straight through.</li>
            <li>It got tangled fast.</li>
            <li>but looks can be very deceiving.</li>
            <li>Very adjustable.</li>
            <li>Also, a lot of people have thought it was real.</li>
            <li>i didnt really like it</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>it looks completely real though when i put on a beanie.</li>
            <li>The curls didn&#x27;t stay in much either.</li>
            <li>haha :</li>
            <li>I never noticed how much people avoided me until they stopped.</li>
            <li>Also the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Besides that, I really like this wig.</li>
            <li>There are some undertone red and brown highlights, making it look even more natural.</li>
            <li>and it was shiny and has cute soft curls that don&#x27;t fall when brushed.</li>
            <li>It also tangles easily since it&#x27;s so long, but a gentle brush can take care of that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pretty and soft!</li>
            <li>It came with a hair net and is very cute, I would totally wear this in public as long as the top of the seam is covered up (otherwise anyone would tell it&#x27;s a wig).</li>
            <li>I was really skeptical because the price seemed too good to be true</li>
            <li>I love the first one so much that I&#x27;ve been wearing it every time I leave the house for the past 4 months.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s understandable that after a few months it&#x27;s starting to thin out from brushing, but I think that lasting 4 months (and probably good for a bit more) is a pretty good deal, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t look realistic, but it&#x27;s a wig, so hey.</li>
            <li>and i could do nothing with this particular wig.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a African American styled hair as one of my friends said and it seems like it has no hair at all!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been hit on more in the last couple days (since I got the wig) than in the last year.</li>
            <li>It tangled easily but it is exactly as pictured after a little renovations of course.</li>
            <li>I am buying at least one more!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll need to play around with it a little more.</li>
            <li>I ordered the wig for a confidence boost after losing my hair from chemo only to go thru the whole losing hair process again!!</li>
            <li>it looks great the first day, then tangles like crazy from there on out.</li>
            <li>I was very nervous about purchasing this wig for a Halloween costume, but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived.</li>
            <li>it is so soft and looks almost real.</li>
            <li>It feels so soft and it looks like real hair.</li>
            <li>It is so natural, the hair is pretty, soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>My natural hair has fallen out from over bleaching and straightening, and by wearing this wig my natural hair has healed so much and grown a lot!</li>
            <li>It is very soft and looks decently realistic.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s longer it can get a little tangled, but gently brushing it seems to work it out fine.</li>
            <li>Bit did fall out right after opening when I brushed trough it</li>
            <li>the hair comes right off the cap, as if it were not sewn in properly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and natural feeling, very realistic.</li>
            <li>, so make sure you make your hair tight!</li>
            <li>It was a little long and kept getting tangled real easily</li>
            <li>This wig is simply soft and realistic looking.</li>
            <li>The wig is very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It was my first and my last.</li>
            <li>When I first put it on they were in my face too, but i just slid it back</li>
            <li>The wig is very long, but then again the picture shows a very long wig :) it looks just as it is shown: side bangs, curly-ish, and brown.</li>
            <li>It looks very realistic, and you can wear it daily if need be.</li>
            <li>It would have certainly kept its luster if I&#x27;d taken proper care of it.</li>
            <li>but I was completely amazed when my order arrived.</li>
            <li>Just not as natural looking as the model.</li>
            <li>came a day early which was awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li>Hair color is awesomely natural, I wear it all the time and people don&#x27;t notice its a wig * unless they can tell the difference because they know their wig knowledge</li>
            <li>I shot where the young lady had to wear it.</li>
            <li>Also the bangs are really long and pretty</li>
            <li>First of all, I wore it almost every single day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft and long, it doesn&#x27;t have the light brown highlights like in the picture, but it had a little bit of high lights.</li>
            <li>In reality, it really didn&#x27;t look too bad, some people who didn&#x27;t really know me thought it looked really nice.</li>
            <li>Overall, would recommend the purchase if you don&#x27;t have very high expectations for the \\&quot;naturalness\\&quot; of a wig (especially at this price), otherwise I would keep looking.</li>
            <li>but so far not enough to worry about it.</li>
            <li>not only does this wig tangle a horrendous amount, but it also drops chunks of hair frequently.</li>
            <li>No regrets on this purchase.</li>
            <li>and wow people relate to me soooo differently.</li>
            <li>I also had to trim the bangs a little bit to get them to sit right around my face.</li>
            <li>Even now, about 8 months later, after a bit of a haircut it still looks decent enough to wear in public and I still use it from time to time.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend but it does get a little hot.</li>
            <li>if you hava little to no hair it really good&lt;</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It is absolutely gorgeous and full.</li>
            <li> , it made me feel better.</li>
            <li> i will most lukelt never buy from amazon again</li>
            <li> i absolutley love i reccomend getting a wig brush</li>
            <li> it was okay as a temporary wig until i got my hair re-done.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I have had this wig since 2012, and I am still in love with it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> love love love</li>
            <li> I have bought alot of wigs that were either ok or ok looking.</li>
            <li> problem with this is the top.</li>
            <li> CUTE.</li>
            <li> Better than the store bought one.</li>
            <li> but I love this wig!Its already styled and looks real!GET</li>
            <li> Overall very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It is fabulous!</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> i love this wig</li>
            <li> and I ended up falling in love.</li>
            <li> I love this wig, people think it&#x27;s my legit hair</li>
            <li> I feel so cute.</li>
            <li> color is ok.</li>
            <li> i wear hat, maybe ok.</li>
            <li> Good for a more realistic better quality Halloween costume wig.  </li>
            <li> it was so soft and easy to style and it came with a wig cap it is beautiful</li>
            <li> It fit pretty good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d receive compliments daily about how beautiful it was and many couldn&#x27;t even guess that it was a wig.</li>
            <li> The wig was a different color and it was incredibly shiny.</li>
            <li> looked real, texture wise.</li>
            <li> with a wig cap and some really cool purple socks!</li>
            <li> If you wear hat with it and can pull off full hair, get it!</li>
            <li> Customer service people are more friendly.</li>
            <li> But you can easily change the wig so it fits you.</li>
            <li> Easily falls off.</li>
            <li> color on the wig is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> Nothing a quick trim couldn&#x27;t fix, though!</li>
            <li> Now there&#x27;s a huge knot in the bottom</li>
            <li> , eh, sure, it&#x27;s worth $9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the colour, the length and style, plus it came with a hair net.</li>
            <li> I wore it only twice and took great care of it</li>
            <li> This hair is truly cheap.</li>
            <li> They used to be thicker, not shiny, have nice color depth, and have a real look to them.</li>
            <li> Overall, GREAT investment.</li>
            <li> It was soft, beautiful and looked quite real.</li>
            <li> I have free two-day shipping and it arrived right on time!</li>
            <li> I originally got this for some cosplays, but when I was in the hospital for 3 months, I lost a lot of hair from the medications and whatnot,</li>
            <li> I love it so much!</li>
            <li> I originally got this wig for a cosplay I was doing</li>
            <li> It took 10 days when it was originally estimated about 30-40 days.</li>
            <li> The parting is a bit odd, but besides that it&#x27;s a good buy!</li>
            <li> Its not quite as full as the picture shows</li>
            <li> It gets tangled pretty easily if you don&#x27;t brush it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has recently experienced hair loss due to illness.  </li>
            <li> but I believe there are two factors that wore it out that quickly.</li>
            <li> and the wig itself is sewn in a circular pattern, leaving a part that looks extraordinarily doll like.</li>
            <li> and after you wash it a bit the shine starts to go away making it look more realistic.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and would definitely recommend it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I was happy with that, but apparently no one had realized that the brown wig wasn&#x27;t my real hair, they were just talking about the purple clip.</li>
            <li> It looks and even feels very real!</li>
            <li> this wig looks very pretty.</li>
            <li> the color is more of a light aubern, not dark brown.</li>
            <li> The wig itself is very pretty.</li>
            <li> i trimmed the excessively long bangs on this wig and it is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I recommend this wig for anyone who&#x27;s looking it have fun with wigs and incorporate it into their fashion.</li>
            <li> This one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> worth the buy.</li>
            <li> so it looked more natural, but</li>
            <li> Strangers smile at me.</li>
            <li> I am already going to buy 2 more from them :) however, it kept slipping off my head</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to wear when going out sometimes</li>
            <li> This is the first one I ever bought,And I LOVE IT!Im 18 and already have natural nice long hair</li>
            <li> the bangs were way too long and just kind of went all over.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Will make more purchases if necessary.</li>
            <li> :) I was a bit scared it would be one solid color</li>
            <li> Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the top of it has a circle weave</li>
            <li> I would never be able to wear it in public unless I was truly going for the &amp;#34;fake hair&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Its a pretty color though.</li>
            <li> I wear the wig, my self esteem is so much higher.</li>
            <li> Everyone thought it was my real hair!</li>
            <li> This wig was exactly how I imagined it would be.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I got it took look pretty darn close to the picture.</li>
            <li> this is my first wig</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I was looking for and came just as described.</li>
            <li> the only negative I can think of is that its a little shorter than I would have wanted and the very top is a tad thin..but still a awesome wig for the price.</li>
            <li> I did cut it a little bit too still very cute.</li>
            <li> The seller shipped pretty fast and packaged</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s low lights and high lights which makes it just that more realistic looking!</li>
            <li> Just push the wig back farther on your head and the bangs are fine, and don&#x27;t have to be cut at all.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t matter if people could tell it wasn&#x27;t real or not</li>
            <li> I had to lift the wig away at my hairline to prove to people it wasn&#x27;t real.</li>
            <li> Very shiny.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it, but it seems it would melt it straight through.</li>
            <li> It got tangled fast.</li>
            <li> but looks can be very deceiving.</li>
            <li> Very adjustable.</li>
            <li> Also, a lot of people have thought it was real.</li>
            <li> i didnt really like it</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> it looks completely real though when i put on a beanie.</li>
            <li> The curls didn&#x27;t stay in much either.</li>
            <li> haha :</li>
            <li> I never noticed how much people avoided me until they stopped.</li>
            <li> Also the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Besides that, I really like this wig.</li>
            <li> There are some undertone red and brown highlights, making it look even more natural.</li>
            <li> and it was shiny and has cute soft curls that don&#x27;t fall when brushed.</li>
            <li> It also tangles easily since it&#x27;s so long, but a gentle brush can take care of that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so pretty and soft!</li>
            <li> It came with a hair net and is very cute, I would totally wear this in public as long as the top of the seam is covered up (otherwise anyone would tell it&#x27;s a wig).</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical because the price seemed too good to be true</li>
            <li> I love the first one so much that I&#x27;ve been wearing it every time I leave the house for the past 4 months.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s understandable that after a few months it&#x27;s starting to thin out from brushing, but I think that lasting 4 months (and probably good for a bit more) is a pretty good deal, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t look realistic, but it&#x27;s a wig, so hey.</li>
            <li> and i could do nothing with this particular wig.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a African American styled hair as one of my friends said and it seems like it has no hair at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hit on more in the last couple days (since I got the wig) than in the last year.</li>
            <li> It tangled easily but it is exactly as pictured after a little renovations of course.</li>
            <li> I am buying at least one more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll need to play around with it a little more.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wig for a confidence boost after losing my hair from chemo only to go thru the whole losing hair process again!!</li>
            <li> it looks great the first day, then tangles like crazy from there on out.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous about purchasing this wig for a Halloween costume, but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived.</li>
            <li> it is so soft and looks almost real.</li>
            <li> It feels so soft and it looks like real hair.</li>
            <li> It is so natural, the hair is pretty, soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> My natural hair has fallen out from over bleaching and straightening, and by wearing this wig my natural hair has healed so much and grown a lot!</li>
            <li> It is very soft and looks decently realistic.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s longer it can get a little tangled, but gently brushing it seems to work it out fine.</li>
            <li> Bit did fall out right after opening when I brushed trough it</li>
            <li> the hair comes right off the cap, as if it were not sewn in properly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and natural feeling, very realistic.</li>
            <li> , so make sure you make your hair tight!</li>
            <li> It was a little long and kept getting tangled real easily</li>
            <li> This wig is simply soft and realistic looking.</li>
            <li> The wig is very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It was my first and my last.</li>
            <li> When I first put it on they were in my face too, but i just slid it back</li>
            <li> The wig is very long, but then again the picture shows a very long wig :) it looks just as it is shown: side bangs, curly-ish, and brown.</li>
            <li> It looks very realistic, and you can wear it daily if need be.</li>
            <li> It would have certainly kept its luster if I&#x27;d taken proper care of it.</li>
            <li> but I was completely amazed when my order arrived.</li>
            <li> Just not as natural looking as the model.</li>
            <li> came a day early which was awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li> Hair color is awesomely natural, I wear it all the time and people don&#x27;t notice its a wig * unless they can tell the difference because they know their wig knowledge</li>
            <li> I shot where the young lady had to wear it.</li>
            <li> Also the bangs are really long and pretty</li>
            <li> First of all, I wore it almost every single day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soft and long, it doesn&#x27;t have the light brown highlights like in the picture, but it had a little bit of high lights.</li>
            <li> In reality, it really didn&#x27;t look too bad, some people who didn&#x27;t really know me thought it looked really nice.</li>
            <li> Overall, would recommend the purchase if you don&#x27;t have very high expectations for the \\&quot;naturalness\\&quot; of a wig (especially at this price), otherwise I would keep looking.</li>
            <li> but so far not enough to worry about it.</li>
            <li> not only does this wig tangle a horrendous amount, but it also drops chunks of hair frequently.</li>
            <li> No regrets on this purchase.</li>
            <li> and wow people relate to me soooo differently.</li>
            <li> I also had to trim the bangs a little bit to get them to sit right around my face.</li>
            <li> Even now, about 8 months later, after a bit of a haircut it still looks decent enough to wear in public and I still use it from time to time.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend but it does get a little hot.</li>
            <li> if you hava little to no hair it really good&lt;</li>
            <li> This is my first wig ever, so i was surprised at how soft it was, and it didnt have that weird synthetic feel to it.  </li>
            <li> Second, I had no reasonable way to store it properly (no wig stand or anything), so I&#x27;d just toss it next to my bed</li>
            <li> and i came few weeks early</li>
            <li> So if you want to heal your natural hair, wear a wig for a few months, and I recommend</li>
            <li> why does the description have to be so long</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please understand that you will have to make some adjustments out of the bag such as changing the part and brushing it out, but it is nothing the average person can&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> a base ball cap., a beanie anything, but the tips still look too full to look real anyway, went to a sallys to shop one day and the lady who helped me with something told me, \\&quot;...</li>
            <li> All in all, however, the wig doesn&#x27;t have that icky wig-shine and it looks really natural.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like how empty some places</li>
            <li> Its not realistic looking!</li>
            <li> I have an average sized head maybe a little on the larger side if anything</li>
            <li> It was a little long, so I cut a couple inches off.</li>
            <li> very natural looking, i would suggest it for anyone who wants to change up their look without the commitment of extensions or growing their hair out (or just to cover up a bad hair day)</li>
            <li> It was a month late and looks cheap and verry fake.</li>
            <li> I can pin it down, though, so it&#x27;s not the end of the world.&lt;br</li>
            <li> also not shiny like other wigs!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a solid color, and has really subtle lowlights and highlights.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t start to wear out until around the month and a half mark.</li>
            <li> cause I have long thick hair and didn&#x27;t put it up that well</li>
            <li> Cap was a bit tight though.  </li>
            <li> U gotta mess with it for a little bit for it to look good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a little tangly when I got it (not frizzy though) and nothing a plastic paddle brush couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> That was when it started to get a little tangled</li>
            <li> Its a little bit shiner</li>
            <li> And it also shed a little</li>
            <li> Waste of money it looked like trash</li>
            <li> it may have worked out for others but this was an epic fail.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money and can not use.</li>
            <li> only annoying thing is that it doesn&#x27;t sit very well on my head.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve felt pretty bad about myself for a while.</li>
            <li> I would warn that if you have a small or medium size head this WILL NOT fit you.</li>
            <li> to my surprise all the wigs i got were wrong i oredered real human hair wigs</li>
            <li> There was also a small gift</li>
            <li> I usually dont wear them</li>
            <li> The wigs they send now are thin, extremely fake looking, and super fake shiny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;People who say the bangs are too long were wearing it wrong.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m having a hard time keeping them to one side without letting the wig show.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s a wig so not much to say about a wig that comes in the wrong color.</li>
            <li> It fits, but it sticks out a little at the sides, which makes my head look weird.</li>
            <li> This is not a wig for just a casual wig to wear since I have a little amount of hair</li>
            <li> I bought a couple wigs from other places and they were very fake looking.</li>
            <li> i was not happy one bit with neither of thevhair</li>
            <li> It will glow and you might look like a clown or worse.  </li>
            <li> so the part is weird</li>
            <li> There is zero fake wig shine, even in sunlight.</li>
            <li> You could never tell it was fake</li>
            <li> its fake.</li>
            <li> I used to order these wigs and then suddenly the quality declined terribly.</li>
            <li> Looks a bit fake in person, has some shine to it.  </li>
            <li> and then you can see how fake it looks.</li>
            <li> length is too long&#x3D;too fake looking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Looked crazy in person, but on camera was a beauty.</li>
            <li> so she knew I was wearing fake hair!</li>
            <li> then this and it really bad for me</li>
            <li> but all in all, not too bad.</li>
            <li> No wonder I felt so bad about myself.</li>
            <li> i was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate it</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that they changed :(</li>
            <li> Awful wig gave it to my daughter for dress up play!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> to my surprise all the wigs i got were wrong i oredered real human hair wigs and i got sythetic hair wigs</li>
            <li> I originally got this for some cosplays, but when I was in the hospital for 3 months, I lost a lot of hair from the medications and whatnot, so when I got out, I felt self-conscious, and wore this when I went out. It didn&#x27;t matter if people could tell it wasn&#x27;t real or not, it made me feel better. In reality, it really didn&#x27;t look too bad, some people who didn&#x27;t really know me thought it looked really nice. I have a somewhat large head and it fit perfect. Since it&#x27;s longer it can get a little tangled, but gently brushing it seems to work it out fine. It&#x27;s a very nice wig.</li>
            <li> Waste of money it looked like trash i was not happy one bit with neither of thevhair i orderd i will most lukelt never buy from amazon again</li>
            <li> I got this today in the mail, and it came with an additional wig cap! I love this wig! It&#x27;s really soft and long, it doesn&#x27;t have the light brown highlights like in the picture, but it had a little bit of high lights. I love this wig and it came 3 days before the beginning of the time it should&#x27;ve came! I ordered it like 5 days ago, and I already got it! (Maybe like 3-4 days actually..) This seller is really nice too! Thanks!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t look realistic, but it&#x27;s a wig, so hey. I dusted some baby powder on it to get rid of the plastic-y look, and that helped a lot once I got it all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color on the wig is pretty nice. It&#x27;s not a solid color, and has really subtle lowlights and highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only annoying thing is that it doesn&#x27;t sit very well on my head. It fits, but it sticks out a little at the sides, which makes my head look weird. I can pin it down, though, so it&#x27;s not the end of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, eh, sure, it&#x27;s worth $9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 11/02: Bumped the rating up. I wore this on Halloween with a purple extension clip, and people kept complimenting me on it all day. I was happy with that, but apparently no one had realized that the brown wig wasn&#x27;t my real hair, they were just talking about the purple clip. I had to lift the wig away at my hairline to prove to people it wasn&#x27;t real.</li>
            <li> The wig is very long, but then again the picture shows a very long wig :) it looks just as it is shown: side bangs, curly-ish, and brown. There are some undertone red and brown highlights, making it look even more natural. It looks and even feels very real! The cap that is in the wig is helpful, but the seller also provided an extra cap just in case. There was also a small gift ;) I have free two-day shipping and it arrived right on time! Great purchase, great seller. Will make more purchases if necessary. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Everything i wanted in a wig! I usually dont wear them but i looked amazing an it looked natural and it was perfect and i came few weeks early but thats perfectly fine! :D</li>
            <li> I should have figured that at a price like this I would be getting a crappy product. I hate it and i regret that I even bought it. Looks shine like plastic and nothing like the picture</li>
            <li> when i got this wig in the mail i was so exited and i goot it out of the box it was so soft and easy to style and it came with a wig cap it is beautiful i absolutley love i reccomend getting a wig brush i did not have one at the time but im gonna get one</li>
            <li> I like to wear different wigs for fashion. It&#x27;s nice to be able to change my haircut without getting it cut. The wig is very soft and shiny. It also is light and flows beautifully. I recommend this wig for anyone who&#x27;s looking it have fun with wigs and incorporate it into their fashion.</li>
            <li> This wig is simply soft and realistic looking. It fits snug on you&#x27;re head and frame&#x27;s any face beautifully. :) I was a bit scared it would be one solid color but man there&#x27;s low lights and high lights which makes it just that more realistic looking! I Love It!</li>
            <li> This was a really nice, inexpensive, synthetic wig! It was a little tangly when I got it (not frizzy though) and nothing a plastic paddle brush couldn&#x27;t fix. I just put it on, and brushed 2-3\\&quot; sections and it was shiny and has cute soft curls that don&#x27;t fall when brushed. Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the top of it has a circle weave so the part is weird but no one knowticed it and nothing a scarf or starter hat couldnt fix! :) very satisfied. Also got a wig cap and a pair of hello kitty socks as a gift! Will buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> it was okay as a temporary wig until i got my hair re-done. it looks great the first day, then tangles like crazy from there on out. i was disappointed.</li>
            <li> This wig is not so great.  Very shiny.  I would not wear in the day or out in the sunlight.  It will glow and you might look like a clown or worse.  Buy a good cap and wear at night.</li>
            <li> The seller shipped pretty fast and packaged okay. I&#x27;m happy with the colour, the length and style, plus it came with a hair net. It fit pretty good but as another reviewer stated I would only wear this out with a hat/ headband/ bandana since the seam is painstackingly obvious. Overall, would recommend the purchase if you don&#x27;t have very high expectations for the \\&quot;naturalness\\&quot; of a wig (especially at this price), otherwise I would keep looking.</li>
            <li> Its a nice wig for the price. Its not quite as full as the picture shows but it does look really nice. I would warn that if you have a small or medium size head this WILL NOT fit you. I have an average sized head maybe a little on the larger side if anything and i still have to wear it on the tightest setting to feel like its not going to slip off. It is very soft and looks decently realistic. Bit did fall out right after opening when I brushed trough it but so far not enough to worry about it.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect when the product came in.  It came in a timely manor, nicely packaged, the wig looked nice,  I wore it only twice and took great care of it and it started frizzing and losing its style.  I would NOR recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical because the price seemed too good to be true but I was completely amazed when my order arrived. It was soft, beautiful and looked quite real. I&#x27;d receive compliments daily about how beautiful it was and many couldn&#x27;t even guess that it was a wig. It didn&#x27;t start to wear out until around the month and a half mark. That was when it started to get a little tangled but I believe there are two factors that wore it out that quickly. First of all, I wore it almost every single day. Second, I had no reasonable way to store it properly (no wig stand or anything), so I&#x27;d just toss it next to my bed lol. It would have certainly kept its luster if I&#x27;d taken proper care of it. Even now, about 8 months later, after a bit of a haircut it still looks decent enough to wear in public and I still use it from time to time. Overall, I was very happy with this purchase and I may buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig hoping for a simple look. not only does this wig tangle a horrendous amount, but it also drops chunks of hair frequently. the hair comes right off the cap, as if it were not sewn in properly. and the wig itself is sewn in a circular pattern, leaving a part that looks extraordinarily doll like. while the style is pretty the wig itself is pretty poorly made, so buyer beware!</li>
            <li> This hair is truly cheap. The tats in it made it unbearable and it was so shiny it looked like it was greasy. I would NOT recommend wasting money on this item.</li>
            <li> I have had this wig since 2012, and I am still in love with it!&lt;br /&gt;Please understand that you will have to make some adjustments out of the bag such as changing the part and brushing it out, but it is nothing the average person can&#x27;t handle. It looks very realistic, and you can wear it daily if need be. You can change the style; bun, ponytail(s), etc.. but I don&#x27;t recommend using heat. I haven&#x27;t tried it, but it seems it would melt it straight through. There is zero fake wig shine, even in sunlight. A beautiful wig, for a steal of a price!</li>
            <li> i trimmed the excessively long bangs on this wig and it is gorgeous. very natural looking, i would suggest it for anyone who wants to change up their look without the commitment of extensions or growing their hair out (or just to cover up a bad hair day)</li>
            <li> It got tangled fast. Overal it was a good wig. Once I put it on my head it tangled up.</li>
            <li> this wig looks very pretty. but looks can be very deceiving. I found myself constantly brushing and untangling this wig. it may have worked out for others but this was an epic fail. i am a stylist by profession and i could do nothing with this particular wig.</li>
            <li> The wig was a different color and it was incredibly shiny. I would never be able to wear it in public unless I was truly going for the &amp;#34;fake hair&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> if you hava little to no hair it really good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but i a have hair that longer then this and it really bad for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to give it 3 stars because once I took it out of the package, it tangled up almost instantly. Now there&#x27;s a huge knot in the bottom and I can&#x27;t get it out... I have to buy a bunch of products now to detangle it. but all in all, not too bad. It looked cuter on the jap model on here xD</li>
            <li> It was okay, looks very good with a hat! The parting is a bit odd, but besides that it&#x27;s a good buy! Try not to get them as tangled, and don&#x27;t brush it! It falls out if you do :p.</li>
            <li> Great wig for the price. a couple pieces of the hair have started to come out but all in all a good wig to buy</li>
            <li> This is a very nice wig for the price. $8.99.  I bought a couple wigs from other places and they were very fake looking. I could wear this wig out, its not just one that you would have to wear for Halloween or cosplay. the only negative I can think of is that its a little shorter than I would have wanted and the very top is a tad thin..but still a awesome wig for the price. I would recommend pairing this wig with melodysusie wig since this wig is an add on. love love love</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has recently experienced hair loss due to illness.  It is so natural, the hair is pretty, soft and silky.  I can&#x27;t believe the price, this is a great wig for the money.  I am buying at least one more!</li>
            <li> Awful wig gave it to my daughter for dress up play! Wouldn&#x27;t even give it 1 star!</li>
            <li> I have bought alot of wigs that were either ok or ok looking. This one is by far my favorite. It&#x27;s a beautiful color, perfect length, and feels so real! worth the buy.</li>
            <li> You could never tell it was fake i was suprised. What a great buy and great quality! I did cut it a little bit too still very cute.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so pretty and soft! It does look like a wig but not a lot. Just not as natural looking as the model. U gotta mess with it for a little bit for it to look good.&lt;br /&gt;It came a day early which was awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Came with a wig cap and some really cool purple socks!</li>
            <li> the item is not at all as described. the color is more of a light aubern, not dark brown. It was a month late and looks cheap and verry fake. like walmart halloween.</li>
            <li> problem with this is the top. i dont know whats going on with it but its fake. I had to put a hat on it every time i wear it. a base ball cap., a beanie anything, but the tips still look too full to look real anyway, went to a sallys to shop one day and the lady who helped me with something told me, \\&quot;...the piece your wearing now...\\&quot; LOL so she knew I was wearing fake hair! Its not realistic looking! I don&#x27;t like that about it. I stopped wearing it after that day! It was my first and my last. Its a pretty color though. If you wear hat with it and can pull off full hair, get it! also not shiny like other wigs! so thats a plus. looked real, texture wise.</li>
            <li> Very adjustable. Its a little bit shiner then i excepted but its really nice. its nothing that a hat cant fix and after you wash it a bit the shine starts to go away making it look more realistic. Hair color is awesomely natural, I wear it all the time and people don&#x27;t notice its a wig * unless they can tell the difference because they know their wig knowledge*</li>
            <li> This worked well for the music video I shot where the young lady had to wear it. Looked crazy in person, but on camera was a beauty.</li>
            <li> I used to order these wigs and then suddenly the quality declined terribly. The wigs they send now are thin, extremely fake looking, and super fake shiny. They used to be thicker, not shiny, have nice color depth, and have a real look to them. Very disappointed that they changed :(</li>
            <li> Just bought my second wig. I love the first one so much that I&#x27;ve been wearing it every time I leave the house for the past 4 months. So it&#x27;s understandable that after a few months it&#x27;s starting to thin out from brushing, but I think that lasting 4 months (and probably good for a bit more) is a pretty good deal, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I wear the wig, my self esteem is so much higher. I feel so cute! Also, a lot of people have thought it was real. My natural hair has fallen out from over bleaching and straightening, and by wearing this wig my natural hair has healed so much and grown a lot! So if you want to heal your natural hair, wear a wig for a few months, and I recommend this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who say the bangs are too long were wearing it wrong. Just push the wig back farther on your head and the bangs are fine, and don&#x27;t have to be cut at all. When I first put it on they were in my face too, but i just slid it back and it was all good.</li>
            <li> This wig arrived in good time and was packaged well. It came with a hair net and is very cute, I would totally wear this in public as long as the top of the seam is covered up (otherwise anyone would tell it&#x27;s a wig).</li>
            <li> CUTE. Not as pictured. At all. Nice product though for any application. IT&#x27;s a wig so not much to say about a wig that comes in the wrong color.</li>
            <li> Looks a bit fake in person, has some shine to it.  Good for a more realistic better quality Halloween costume wig.  Better than the store bought one.</li>
            <li> This is the first one I ever bought,And I LOVE IT!Im 18 and already have natural nice long hair but I love this wig!Its already styled and looks real!GET IT!!!I even got a pair of socks with it and a hairnet,this deal can&#x27;t be beat ! ^-^</li>
            <li> absolutely stunning!! I love it so much! Beautiful sheen, awesome color, sexy length, and very soft and silky! Recommend for anybody!</li>
            <li> This is not a wig for just a casual wig to wear since I have a little amount of hair it&#x27;s more of a African American styled hair as one of my friends said and it seems like it has no hair at all!</li>
            <li> Received today and tried it on.  Very cute just like pic.  This is my first wig ever, so i was surprised at how soft it was, and it didnt have that weird synthetic feel to it.  Cap was a bit tight though.  Overall very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> GREAT WIG! I was very nervous about purchasing this wig for a Halloween costume, but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. It is fabulous! Everyone thought it was my real hair!</li>
            <li> it wasnt nice i didnt really like it thanks okay bye raddadadada rar ara ara r why does the description have to be so long</li>
            <li> i love this wig it is so soft and looks almost real. it looks completely real though when i put on a beanie. i would definitely recommend  this to people</li>
            <li> its okay,  it looks nice on but on the top it pokes up and then you can see how fake it looks.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality for the price.  I had to wash and brush the wig before wearing so it looked more natural, but definitely a great buy.  I&#x27;ve gotten numerous compliments with it on.</li>
            <li> I originally got this wig for a cosplay I was doing and I ended up falling in love. It gets tangled pretty easily if you don&#x27;t brush it. The curls didn&#x27;t stay in much either. All in all, however, the wig doesn&#x27;t have that icky wig-shine and it looks really natural. No regrets on this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this wig, people think it&#x27;s my legit hair haha :&#x27;D</li>
            <li> This wig was exactly how I imagined it would be. It feels so soft and it looks like real hair. It was a little long and kept getting tangled real easily so I cut an inch or so off but it still looks beautiful. I also had to trim the bangs a little bit to get them to sit right around my face. But you can easily change the wig so it fits you. I absolutely love it and would definitely recommend it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! It took 10 days when it was originally estimated about 30-40 days. The wig itself is very pretty. It&#x27;s soft and natural feeling, very realistic. It also tangles easily since it&#x27;s so long, but a gentle brush can take care of that. Also the bangs are really long and pretty but I&#x27;m having a hard time keeping them to one side without letting the wig show. I&#x27;ll need to play around with it a little more. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Easily falls off. Will not recommend to anyone. I will not be buying again. Waste of my money and can not use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30. I&#x27;ve been hit on more in the last couple days (since I got the wig) than in the last year. I had to trim it but it ended up looking alot like Zoe Dechanels hair when I was done. I feel so cute. This is a boon for me since my hair fell out about 10 years ago and I&#x27;ve felt pretty bad about myself for a while. I finally desided to start wearing wigs and wow people relate to me soooo differently. Strangers smile at me. Customer service people are more friendly. No wonder I felt so bad about myself. I never noticed how much people avoided me until they stopped. This wig is awesome.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful wig. It is absolutely gorgeous and full. I only gave it 4 stars because it took a while to get to my house and also it arrived frizzy. I am going to post a picture. It tangled easily but it is exactly as pictured after a little renovations of course. I got it took look pretty darn close to the picture. I would reccomend but it does get a little hot. No suspicious smells or anything. If you are thinking of buying this one and another one one but you can&#x27;t decide between the two, CHOOSE THIS ONE! anyway happy shopping!</li>
            <li> The hair on the wig is falling out. I ordered the wig for a confidence boost after losing my hair from chemo only to go thru the whole losing hair process again!!</li>
            <li> color is ok. length is too long&#x3D;too fake looking.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like how empty some places looks.&lt;br /&gt;if i wear hat, maybe ok.</li>
            <li> this is my first wig and I just got it today, it is sooo pretty and great quality for the price! Also the shipping was fast. I am already going to buy 2 more from them :) however, it kept slipping off my head cause I have long thick hair and didn&#x27;t put it up that well, so make sure you make your hair tight! And it also shed a little but that&#x27;s not a big deal. Overall, GREAT investment.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I was looking for and came just as described. It was a little long, so I cut a couple inches off. It arrived in a timely manner. I am very pleased with the purchase and recommend wigs from this seller.</li>
            <li> Nice length and texture, but the bangs were way too long and just kind of went all over. Nothing a quick trim couldn&#x27;t fix, though! The color seems a bit off to me, though. It&#x27;s so shiny that the undertone seems kind of gray. Besides that, I really like this wig. It&#x27;s fun to wear when going out sometimes</li>
