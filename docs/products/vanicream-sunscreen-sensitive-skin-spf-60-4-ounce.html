            <li>Even a mineral (non-chemical product) that does not contain some combination of both can be excellent, but not provide 100% coverage.</li>

            <li>It works great.  </li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s hypoallergenic, and that&#x27;s great, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I have eliminated sunburns and greatly reduced problems requiring my doctor&#x27;s involvement.</li>
            <li>Vanicream works great for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used the SPF 60 and have found it to be a great sunscreen for sun protection.  </li>
            <li>This provides great coverage, but we tend to look a bit gray when we use it.</li>
            <li>It works great, though.</li>
            <li>so happy.</li>
            <li>As every VaniCream product I have used has been great, I figured I would give their sunscreen a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lol.)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m definitely happy with it and don&#x27;t planning on switching brands any time soon.</li>
            <li>I have gotten about 5 people (friends &amp; family) using some of the products as well, and they seem as happy as me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked great.</li>
            <li>This was supposed to be SPF 60, but that&#x27;s not what they sent me, so I wasn&#x27;t happy.</li>
            <li>I was given a sample of this by my dermatologist and I feel it is great.  </li>
            <li>This is a really great product.</li>
            <li>What a great find.</li>
            <li>It is also great for a day at the beach.</li>
            <li>I have been told by a company rep that Vanicream coasts theirs very effectively.  </li>
            <li>I have been told by a company rep that Vanicream coasts theirs very effectively.  </li>
            <li>Unless you happen to be a marathon swimmer who is going to be soaked for hour and hours in the oceans&#x27; salty water without any shade, which Vaseline will act as the best sealer there is, then for a surfer like me, usually higher organic ingredients are the best.</li>
            <li>It works great and provides good sun protection.</li>
            <li>So be sure to speak with your doctor to know what will work best for you.</li>
            <li>Successfully excised, but now I wear sunscreen all winter, too, even on snowy days.</li>
            <li>My boy&#x27;s pediatrician recommended Vanicream moisturizer to help with his eczema, and we&#x27;ve had successful results.</li>
            <li>It took me many years to find the Vanicream line, and doing so has changed my life greatly!  </li>
            <li>This being said, it probably does a good job protecting.  </li>
            <li>but it is good to know that there are fewer chemicals in the sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It does fade to a deathly gray but that&#x27;s as good as it gets, and</li>
            <li>and I think it does a good job of keeping the sun  damage in check.  </li>
            <li>I like to use good sunscreen and wanted a recommendation for one without a lot of harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon Vanicream at a non-chain pharmacy and the pharmacist said it was good and let me try it on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to buy her a good quality product, no chemicals.</li>
            <li>I know the product is a superior product for sun protection</li>
            <li>This would definitely be a good sun screen for anyone with sebborehic dermatitis, eczema, or someone who has a lot of skin allergies/sensitivities if you don&#x27;t mind the greasiness of it.</li>
            <li>The good news:  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s GOOD.</li>
            <li>on days I don&#x27;t wear makeup over it, people always comment on how good my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>Gives good protection, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>It is also good value.</li>
            <li>I think it is good for people who plan a mountain climbing or camping.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff.  </li>
            <li>so I think it provides good protection.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to put on and does a great job of protecting my skin.</li>
            <li>Would strongly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my order.  </li>
            <li>I have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product....very protective and just the right moisturizing effect for my face.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>and I trust Dr. Mercola more than my dermatologist!</li>
            <li>We have bought many times now!</li>
            <li>if you need a sunscreen that is easy on skin, this is a great choice as it probably isn&#x27;t going to irritate your skin.</li>
            <li>AMAZING.</li>
            <li>That is why chemical screens are so popular.  </li>
            <li>You must research the product thoroughly or you may be doing more harm than good from some of these products.ise.  </li>
            <li>You must research the product thoroughly or you may be doing more harm than good from some of these products.</li>
            <li>I would never wear it for any kind of activity where I wanted to look nice.</li>
            <li>Aside from that I&#x27;m using it because I know I&#x27;m getting good, safe coverage.</li>
            <li>My mom liked it too.</li>
            <li>I have tried A LOT of sunscreens in my quest to find one that is effective, sweatproof</li>
            <li>so do your own research before listening to others comments.</li>
            <li>P.S.: I was using La Roche Posay Dermo-Peds (not cruelty free but very, very effective).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s high spot on the list of best sunscreens by EWG and because of all the rave reviews on this website.  </li>
            <li>It was the best hypoallergenic and high SPF sunscreen that I could find--my dermatologist recommended it.</li>
            <li>After a brief search on the internet, we found a good deal on Amazon where we could buy two jars of Vanicream with a pump dispenser, and get a tube of their sunscreen as well at an awesome price.  </li>
            <li>Im glad to be able to spend time in the sun again!</li>
            <li>So far very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>My doctor recommended this product to me and this is the most cost effective place I&#x27;ve found it.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best sunscreens to use if you have any type of skin issues like sensitive skin, freckled skin or melasma skin.  </li>
            <li>I love the texture and it also makes my skin look amazing, somehow,</li>
            <li>I purchased the vanicream sunscreen because it was touted to be excellent for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this sunscreen is the perfect fit!</li>
            <li>It was packaged well and arrived really quickly!!</li>
            <li>This product is unscented which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>It protects nicely and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found loose powder to do an excellent job of covering it up and creating a nice, longlasting, dewy and even look.</li>
            <li>If you find that certain sunscreens can clog your pores and flare acne, this is a great choice as it does not clog up pores.</li>
            <li>It offers very good blockage of the sun.</li>
            <li>I care more about protecting my very fair and sensitive skin than I do about vanity</li>
            <li>That is why Badger is better than most...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how they do it, because this product looks WAY better on my face than anything else I tried.    </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using Vanicream sunscreen as well as moisturizing cream for several years and have been very happy.</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really satisfied with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I think it may be better in winter.</li>
            <li>The Vanicream is a much better value, at about 1/2 the price of the Soleo.</li>
            <li>This is still my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Will repurchase after finishing my tube &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Most every product you will find in stores iss based on chemical screens.  </li>
            <li>This is another reason people think that chemical and even nano/micro screens can lead to even more cancers in sunscreen users.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, when the product itself has many anti-oxidents to offset the free-radicals themselves, the oxidation problem appears to be neutralized.  </li>
            <li>and i am more comforatble with this product than any I have seen or found.&lt;br</li>

            <li>and i am more comforatble with this product than any I have seen or found.  </li>
            <li>And it spreads better than the Sport version.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This is not to knock the product - it is outstanding.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>My dermatologist is pleased, and so am I.  </li>
            <li>If you are okay with the product that they send you</li>
            <li>Bought because of the great reputation but thought the 60 spf was really greasy.</li>
            <li>but i Love this sunscreen</li>
            <li>Now I should be able to get the rest of my face darker than those spots since they&#x27;ll be protected from the sun.  </li>
            <li>Like many others, I&#x27;m allergic to any sunscreen and makes me break out in a rash.</li>
            <li>Tried a sample from dermatologist and love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I received the most protection from Vanicream.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the fact that it was so greasy, but I found ways of making my shiny nose more matte....</li>
            <li>I  am allergic to most sunscreens and have been using this product for about 8 months.  </li>
            <li>I have been very happy with it and will continue to use it for my son and for myself, and will order more next summer.  </li>
            <li>I like burn out brand better but it costs more</li>
            <li>The has an allergy to most sun creams.  </li>
            <li>The price could be better though.</li>
            <li>We were looking for a safe, \\&quot;Os, PABA free\\&quot; sunscreen.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have any issues with the residue getting into my eyes and burning like most do.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen seems to work perfectly for the most sensitive of skin in our family, from light skinned Grandpa to tender infant.  </li>
            <li>It is most off-putting.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for seven years and still love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Rubs in very nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave the bright white telltale skin from many others.</li>
            <li>This came up as being pretty safe in comparison to thousands of others, seems like a good choice over all</li>
            <li>(it makes a great moisturizer when we are home in New York), and have had no problems with it at all.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and was happy to find no stinging sensation or reaction from this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I discovered that it is very easy to remove the shine by just blotting the surface with a clean Kleenex.</li>
            <li>I liked it a lot, was very gentle, unlike the better known national brand sunscreens for the face that I tried when I ran out of Vanicream.</li>
            <li>Dermatologist recommended product, great even for highly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Thru Amazon, we are able to save money and get free delivery.</li>
            <li>SPF 60 keeps my face from becoming wrinkled by the sun.</li>
            <li>This was the true test!</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and protects for hours.</li>
            <li>I will like cream with zinc oxide in it but easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Our daughters skin is much better after 6 months of regular use, and the sunscreen works just great as well as moisturizing her skin in the sun.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While I am not an expert on the active ingredients in sunscreen, I have to believe that whatever VaniCream is using is second-to-none when it comes to giving the best protection against both UV-A and UV-B damage.</li>
            <li>Like most VaniCream products, it&#x27;s by no means inexpensive, but overall, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Slightly oily after applied, which makes applying foundation easy.</li>
            <li>I used it first on my skin, and I really liked it.</li>
            <li>Just a quick fix until Vanicream comes up with a better formula.</li>
            <li>I suffer from mild rosacea and am a very fair skinned red head.</li>
            <li>also applies to tanning oils and lotions--which many of you may be using right now with summer in full swing--as well as the baby oil or lotion that many parents unwittingly slather on their babies.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have the most sensitive skin and am allergic to most anything!</li>
            <li>From what I understand, breathing in titanium dioxide dust into  your lungs in huge quantities would be a problem, but from a sunscreen,</li>
            <li>From what I understand, breathing in titanium dioxide dust into  your lungs in huge quantities would be a problem, but from a sunscreen, no.  </li>
            <li>FRAGRANCE FREE</li>
            <li>PABA free; It must spell out on the face of the container,&lt;br</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t available in any stores nearby.</li>
            <li>One important factor for me in deciding to use this product again is the fact that it DOES NOT carry any harmful chemicals and it is odor free.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a oily feel and is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Is product is FABULOUS, FABULOUS.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used this product for over 3 years, and the current price we paid was great.</li>
            <li>I would never have been able to enjoy an event like that in a bathing suit without worrying about getting burnt, and it&#x27;s a good thing because I was in a wedding 2 days later!</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommends it and has it available for purchase at her office</li>
            <li>but I decided to buy from Amazon, get free shipping and save 25% per tube.</li>
            <li>but, great for extra coverage.</li>
            <li>The individual packets are great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Polymorphic Light Eruption since I was about 4.</li>
            <li>It is no longer available, so this seller should change the picture.</li>
            <li>Blue Lizard 30 is not as good of ingredients as Badger but still better than Vanicream 60</li>
            <li>Having read about how good zinc oxide based sunscreens are for you, I bought more and decided to use it on my neck, arms and legs while playing golf last week.</li>
            <li>Vanicream is a reasonably-priced, good sunscreen for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>We travel frequently to tropical areas, so a good sunscreen is a must.  </li>
            <li>Some formulations use one or the other, but again, ideally you want both for full sprecturm coverage.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for about a year...got it originally for my nose after skin cancer surgery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Irradiated mice who were treated with the moisturizers exhibited a significant increase in their rate of tumor formation and increase in tumor size per mouse.</li>
            <li>Thanks! :)&lt;</li>
            <li>This sunblock does not have a sunblcok scent and is great at protecting my face all day long.</li>
            <li>It is particularly good if you use a stick foundation which I stopped using for awhile because it was a little too dry/matte, but over the SS, provides a nice \\&quot;tinted moisturizer\\&quot; type finish.  </li>
            <li>In the course of this project, I&#x27;ve also learned how to clean off a mineral sunblock.</li>
            <li>Zinc Oxide is the only non-chemical substance that can effectively block close to 100% of the UVA harmful rays, and blocks most of the UVB rays.  </li>
            <li>Titanium Dioxide is the only non-toxic substance that can effectively block 100% of UVB rays, and most of the UVA rays.  </li>
            <li>For people who have sensitive skin or just want a physical sunscreen instead of chemical, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>I hope Amazon and DermStore can fox this problem before others have to go through what I am having to clean up.</li>
            <li>It is powerful and yet not greasy or drying like most powerful sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>It washes really clean.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to most fragrances and a lot of chemicals, so I appreciate it, too!  </li>
            <li>This Badger is one of the best that I have ever used since it is 100% certified Natural, 87% certified organic and a whopping 12% zinc oxide that is easy toapply, rubs in quick, not greasy, offers me protection and is priced reasonably per ounce.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it is fairly pure without a lot of additives.  </li>
            <li>The texture, coverage  and performance of this cream makes it special.  </li>
            <li>I spent the week at the beach and my skin has been great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good to exfoliate regularly, because these products will tend to highlight any skin irregularities or blocked pores.</li>
            <li>I am also very allergic to many of the chemicals that are in store brand sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I am VERY dissapointed that my dermatologist recommended this cream as SAFE</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The first is the amazing skincare cream which was recommended by my dermatologist, and the second is the most important, sunscreen protection.  </li>
            <li>Our allergist gave us a sample and after using it for two weeks no bad reactions.  </li>
            <li>Many specultate that this fact, along with the fact that these products lose their effectiveness very quickly and produce free radicals in the skin, and that those folks using high SPF products without UVA protection tend to stay in the sun longer, may be why skin cancer rates are higher in those using suncsreens than not using them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>great coverage, not oily and does not make your face look like a \\&quot;ghost\\&quot; like some other suncreens.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, will buy again.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t deny them trips to the pool just because I had to choose between a rash or mild burn.</li>
            <li>and I have been loyal to it for years.</li>
            <li>No sunscreen can adequately protect anyone&#x27;s skin without a combination of these two.</li>
            <li>My complexion is lighter, more even-toned, and more porcelain-colored at 35 than it was at 27, because faithful &amp; proper use of Vanicream SPF 60 blocks my skin from darkening at all.  </li>
            <li>Vanicream Products are the best, so you can never go wrong with any of them :).</li>
            <li>I use my hands to do a quick wash, rinse, then</li>
            <li>This is the most highly protective and dermatologist-recommended sunscreen there is.</li>
            <li>Since this product has less chemicals, it doesn&#x27;t stain and does a great job on sun protection.</li>
            <li>Most of these chemicals have also--according to my research--but you must determine this for yourself-- been proven very clearly to cause cancer in lab animals.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of preservatives, scents, etc to irritate the skin.  </li>
            <li>I have even tried the ones that claim \\&quot;pure and free Baby\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The knock on these products is that they are said to have been proven to readily absorb into the deepest layers of the skin, where the toxins are released into the blood in large amounts, and need reapplication much more than chemical blockers.  </li>
            <li>I have never written a review on Amazon, but I have to say this product is amazing for me and hopefully for anyone with a similar issue.  </li>
            <li>I do think it is a great sunscreen, but just not for everyday wear for the oily woman.&lt;br</li>
            <li>one of my daughters has the most sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The name however, makes me laugh because it sounds like a [...] cream rather than a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Although it is on the pricey side, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen just NEVER seemed to be absorbed by my skin after \\&quot;Rubbing it in\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>love vanicream sunscreen spf 60 for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>dermatitis, and my head/face is extremely sensitive to most shampoos, soaps, sun screens, etc.</li>
            <li>(getting rashes aren&#x27;t fun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to the ingredients in most sunscreens, even those supposedly for sensitive skin, like Aveeno.  </li>
            <li>Hopes this is useful.</li>
            <li>well worth paying for this product.</li>
            <li>A dermatologist recommended that she try this cream, and it gives her good sun protection without the irritation caused by more common products.</li>
            <li>A success story.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter who has eczema and is sensitive to most sunblocks.</li>
            <li>Sunscreen is the most important product to use and this one has zinc oxide in it which is key to not get a sunburn.</li>
            <li>My child never complains of the burn like she has with other sunscreens and it is great at protecting her from the intense sun-</li>
            <li>I have a newborn on the way and my wife and I live in a very hot area and we both are light skinned, and I am anal and analytical to a fault.  </li>
            <li>&quot;  Check to confirm I am on the right track.  </li>
            <li>&quot;  Check to confirm I am on the right track.  </li>
            <li>He was right.  </li>
            <li>I live in South Florida and am constantly in search of a good sunblock.  </li>
            <li>The only good thing is that this works for my ultra sensitive skin, so I used it for my body, just not for my face.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin and Vanicream does not cause any skin reactions, which is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so all of these products are fabulous AND very gentle on the skin with out of the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; added.</li>
            <li>The next concern I have is that nano and micro particles, if uncoated, have higher \\&quot;photoreactivity\\&quot; which causes them to release free radicals in the skin when exposed to UV light, thereby being cancerous.  </li>

            <li>Scent is fairly pleasant, no strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>It seems to protect from sun and most likely stays on well when/after swimming.  </li>
            <li>, I always apply 30 minutes before the first exposure to the sun</li>
            <li>Most of them said the same thing that is too greasy.</li>
            <li>He even demonstrated how gentle it was by putting it in his eye!  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m asking too much - a lightweight, non-greasy, invisible hypoallergenic sunscreen!</li>
            <li>After searching more than 8 years for a sunscreen I am not allergic to, I finally found it!</li>
            <li>Vanicreme has it listed as the first ingredietnt.  </li>
            <li>more than the numerous products I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Vanicreme has it listed as the first ingredietnt.  </li>
            <li>more than the numerous products I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and its the only one</li>
            <li>The first thing my husband said was \\&quot;your face looks</li>
            <li>This, for me, seems to work pretty well</li>
            <li>the price you paid extra for the discontinued SPF 60 is a lot more than what the SPF 50 product is sold for.</li>
            <li>I applied it for the first time 5 hours ago this morning</li>
            <li>However, her price for the product (yes, she sells it...) is quite a bit higher.</li>
            <li>Also, I am pretty athletic and spend a lot of time on the water.  </li>
            <li>It is not the same product as the 60spf, and it is much more visible on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I LOVE this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I can see that it would most likely be problematic for people with oily or even combo skin.</li>
            <li>After mush research and talking with my doctor and many mis-steps in the correct sun protection, VaniCream Sunscreen SPF 60 is the only product that has helped.  </li>
            <li>I am ordering a large one right now and wanted to leave a comment first.</li>
            <li>It gives skin a purple cast when first applied which goes away as it warms and is rubbed in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, and effective (as long as I reapply as recommended) and it&#x27;s super moisturizing for my dry skin so that I can smoothly apply makeup on after.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite sunscreens--it doesn&#x27;t make me look like a kabuki doll like so many of the sensitive-skin types, but it is quite thick and greasy.</li>
            <li>But it worked well when I was outside because it is hot and the sunshine is strong here.</li>
            <li>This is the first sunscreen product I&#x27;ve used that was not irritating at all.  </li>
            <li>I was given samples of this sunscreen by my dermatologist to use before and after a laser-like procedure that caused my face to be super sensitive.</li>
            <li>Think its more for dry skin&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I recently had surgery on a scar and was told by my Doctor to use a strong sunscreen to protect it.</li>
            <li>It is a physical blocker as well as a chemical blocker and does a good job of stopping both UVA and UVB rays without many of the harmful chemicals that are in several other brands.</li>
            <li>When I put it on my face it looks like I put pure oil on it.  </li>
            <li>Bravo Badger.apply, rubs in quick, not greasy, offers me protection and is priced reasonably per ounce.</li>
            <li>Once I go back to the Vanicream, everything is fine.  </li>
            <li>I had read about it online at another website that tests the strength and trustworthiness of sunscreen and this was rated very high.</li>
            <li>My skin reacts to a lot of sunscreens by breaking out in a rash, but I am a redhead and need very high SPF protection when I am outdoors for extended periods of time.</li>
            <li>The zinc oxide makes it a little messier than most sunscreen products but it is worth putting up with that since she does not break out using it.</li>
            <li>Attemps by companies selling mineral blockers to reduce the \\&quot;ghost\\&quot; effect have led to the formulation of \\&quot;nanonized\\&quot; and \\&quot;micronized\\&quot; formulations, with very small particles that spread more easily that minimize dramatically the whiteness of the mineral blockers.  </li>
            <li>Producers write whatever they want and it really consumes time to read up and compare facts.</li>
            <li>Sunscreen needs to protect and needs to protect for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t turn you white.  </li>
            <li>This sunblock is very oily.  </li>
            <li>The works very well as described but it is way too greasy, so I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>it is greasy as much as I want to buy another</li>
            <li>It has a light scent and doesn&#x27;t leave white streaks on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>My research--again, ad nauseum--you must confirm this for yourself--shows me that there has never been any credible study to prove these particles absorb into the deep layers of the skin.  </li>
            <li>This product did not burn my skin but it is very greasy.  </li>
            <li>As another review noted, because it is gentle, it does not irritate my eyes</li>
            <li>I need this because I walk my dog four times a day, but it is very greasy.  </li>
            <li>and it works really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to buy it again.</li>
            <li>I have vascular rosecea and have to be very cafeful what I use on my face.  </li>
            <li>It has worked for very well for her.</li>
            <li>Since wearing Vanicream SPF 60, I&#x27;ve never had a burn despite intense sun.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it IS very greasy like everyone says.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I should have listened to the reviewers saying this sunscreen is really greasy.  </li>
            <li>This product was recommended by my dermatologist and has worked really well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really soak in, but that&#x27;s the point.</li>
            <li>What Zack said about a sunscreen needing to contain both zinc oxide and titanium dioxide is the absolute truth.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably  priced, I think.</li>
            <li>Your face will have a real shine after using it.</li>
            <li>Wanted something light to totally block all sun.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a very lightweight or very liquid/fluid sunscream for your face, this is not it.</li>
            <li>I just used a couple of 0.25 free samples of Vanicream 60 SPF from my dermatologist several weeks ago.</li>
            <li>I really slather it on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m comfortable using this every day and don&#x27;t notice a white cast.</li>
            <li>and I really wanted to discover it&#x27;s purpose.  </li>
            <li>I have to wear sunscreen everyday and have really fair, sensitive, skin cancer prone skin.</li>
            <li>In hot weather, most sunscreens leave stains on your clothes as they drip down your neck.  </li>
            <li>After reasearching and reading other reviews, I picked this one out, and I feel very comfortable doing outdoor activities now when I&#x27;m wearing Vanicream.  </li>
            <li>and my daughter burned for the first time this year because of the new formulation.</li>
            <li>I have combo skin and live in a humid place so this may be better for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly; mild scent; hasn&#x27;t caused any rash or redness; a little thick but still spreads kind of easily if patted all over face first.</li>
            <li>I guess due to the perspiration, it ran onto my clothes and I have not been able to get it out after 2 washings.</li>
            <li>I have not checked into the other ingredients in this product, many sound strange to me, so you might want to check those.  </li>
            <li>I have not checked into the other ingredients in this product, many sound strange to me, so you might want to check those.  </li>
            <li>I have a 7 month old with super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Nice suncreen for people who usually have eye reactions from suncreens.</li>
            <li>I used Vanicream 60 almost every day and found it very effective,  non irritating, and love it even if it is a little greasy.  </li>
            <li>The reason I believe this is because I have not had a single product from VaniCream that was not the best in its respective class, and so their reputation of quality and integrity gives me confidence in their products, and enough confidence to let other Amazon Users know about my positive experiences with their products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sunscreen has been EXTREMELY useful for the whole family (I think my husband, an avid hiker, is its #1 fan), considering the dry air and 100°F plus temperatures in our city.</li>
            <li>I live on Amazon!</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it is a little greasy - but it is still much better than many others we&#x27;ve tried and does absorb well for the most part.</li>
            <li>Zinc is the solution, more zinc for less money with organic ingredients that are not carcinogen or harmful to me...</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin and want a sunscreen that helps with the dryness, this is a great choice as it instantly treats dry skin upon application.</li>
            <li>To be more specific, we were looking for a sunscreen that was more a physical and less a chemical barrier.</li>
            <li>Soap and water works decently, but this is what I do</li>
            <li>It looks pretty white because of the zinc when you first start applying it, but it fades as you rub it in.  </li>
            <li>Main ingredient is ZINC OXIDE</li>
            <li>My skin has stayed fairly matte for up to four hours with one application of powder; it really clings to the film the sunscreen leaves behind.</li>
            <li>I am a blonde with fair skin and break out with red bumps when exposed to the sun too long, even when using sunsreen.  </li>
            <li>so it sinks in pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought this sunscreen because it was highly rated for being one of the healthiest sunscreens out there.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It is a little bit greasy feeling after you rub it in, but I like that because my makeup goes on better over it if it has some slip.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;greasiness\\&quot; that other reviews mentioned is what makes it spread so easily.  </li>
            <li>I just tried Vanicream Sunscreen for Sensitive Skin Spf 60 and found that it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen was recomended as being gentle to healing skin that is also tender and sensitive.</li>
            <li>It has worked very well and is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>What I put on my skin is the same as consuming it through my skin since it is absorbed by my skin.</li>
            <li>I have been able to use the product already a few times.</li>
            <li>It is greasy and does not last as long as others, so we reapply often, but overall I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>and I use it more heavily.</li>
            <li>We have tried various products and are pleased to confirm some of the positive reviews we actually used prior to purchasing this product from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen does the trick for me when I am hiking and biking, and the physical block absorbs easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a white film on my face.</li>
            <li>But honestly, considering the fact that it doesn&#x27;t break me out, the greasiness is a VERY small price to pay.</li>
            <li>; I never leave the sunscreen container in the sun, purchase new sunscreen all the time</li>
            <li>I think their new products coming out have no alumina.  </li>
            <li>I think their new products coming out have no alumina.  </li>
            <li>I just hope their new formulation SPF 50+ works as well.</li>
            <li>What I received was Vanicream&#x27;s new formulation 50spf.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the new product at all.</li>
            <li>it has been replaced by a completely new and reformulated product Vanicream 50+.  </li>
            <li>so I am hopeful that it will hold up in New England heat and humidity.</li>
            <li>The new stuff is SPF 55</li>
            <li>It does live up to that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;The results indicate that several commercially available moisturizing creams increase the rate of formation and number of tumors when applied topically to UVB-pretreated high-risk mice.</li>
            <li>allergies\\&quot; for about 10 years, through numerous tests and incorrect diagnosis, I have finally been correctly diagnosed with PMLE - Poly Morphous Light Eruption.  </li>
            <li>this really works and does not bother my sensitive skin and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin and have no reaction to this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have SLE and over the years my skin has become very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I use a variety of VaniCream products because I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>He has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little thick, but it spreads very well and is extremely effective yet mild.  </li>
            <li>I need more zinc baby not Titanium dioxide and Blue Lizard offers more zinc, less titanium for half the cost...</li>
            <li>Usually those SPFs will not be over 30 for any safe sunscreen ingredients and it will be for BABYs.</li>
            <li>Majority have fragrance but baby sunscreens usually do not.</li>
            <li>I never usually break out.  </li>
            <li>I find it to be a bit greasy, but overall after rubbing it in thoroughly, after a while it blends in pretty well</li>
            <li>I find it to be a bit greasy, but overall after rubbing it in thoroughly, after a while it blends in pretty well</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried vanicream and I will definitely be ordering it again.  </li>
            <li>I do wish they could offer an even higher degree of protection such as 100% SPF.</li>
            <li>You know, the white stuff lifeguards put on their noses to keep them from burning to a crisp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;A study has found that topical applications of moisturizers such as Dermabase, Dermovan, Eucerin Original Moisturizing Cream, or Vanicream could increase skin cancer risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live at a high altitude and have lupus, so I need serious sun protection that is suitable for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Majority have many different ingredients than zinc and titanium as ACTIVE</li>
            <li>But, JustOTC saw a post I&#x27;d penned on Amazon and they completely remedied the problem by sending out a new box without charge.</li>
            <li>I get used to the light lotion for sunscreen, so I felt the sunscreen was too thick first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Why do I need fragrance regardless, and this is from an athlete where I consume fresh garlic napping in vinegar every single day,&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>Only good thing was it did not leave the usual white cast.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it in the winter; less so in the summer but keep coming back to it</li>
            <li>I burn within 45 minutes but with Vanicream, I have been able to stay out longer with no burning and only a slight tanning.</li>
            <li>It applies well and does quickly absorb into the skin unlike other products with zinc oxide.  </li>
            <li>The Vanicream sunblock, however, goes on essentially clear, even before rubbing in.</li>
            <li>The vanicream SPF 60 used to go on clear and had no smell</li>
            <li>Natural sunscreens with FEWER chemicals.</li>
            <li>Manufacturers like to spin the facts and challenge our knowledge and intelligence by claiming it as WITHOUT any harsh chemical or chemical FREE or without chemical ABSORBERS.</li>
            <li>Vanicream 60+ offers Titanium Dioxide (7.5%), Zinc Oxide 7.5%...</li>
            <li>All Natural Baby Sunscreen Lotion 4oz]]</li>
            <li>My facial skin is really photosensitive.</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin (eczema) has not had any adverse reaction to its ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Even all the ones that say they are for sensitive skin, &amp; hypo allergenic etc.</li>
            <li>Since I am sensitive to smells in sunscreens I thought I would try it.  </li>
            <li>I am photoallergic to all kinds of sunscreens I tried so far, from Banana Boat to Neutrogena and Shiseido.</li>
            <li>Can be used on children or others with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>(shaving cream, soaps, basically anything scented natural or otherwise).</li>
            <li>I must mention to  those who do like scented products I suggest you don&#x27;t apply them to your face since products that contain a fragrance as even natural fragrances will age your skin.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin like me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what she uses on her 3yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and am a woman of color.  </li>
            <li>and my face feels soft and protected all day.  </li>
            <li>and I ordered S p f 60 for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but they sent me 50 plus not for Sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After having several skin cancers removed, I have become very hyper vigilant about wearing sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I also really like that it doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast.</li>
            <li>I have been allergic to sunscreen (and therefore haven&#x27;t worn any) since I was twelve years old.  </li>
            <li>I have tried almost all of the readily-available, over-the-counter sunscreens for sensitive skins.  </li>
            <li>I have PMLE, since I was about 13 yrs old</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to all my friends with children or if they have sensitive skin or eczema.  </li>
            <li>I have sun sensitive lupus.</li>
            <li>Vanicream Sunscreen, Sensitive Skin SPF 60 is now SPF 50</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this product after early detection of melanoma.</li>
            <li>None of us got sunburn and our skins remained soft and moist.</li>
            <li>It blends very well and doesn&#x27;t leave white residue at all.  </li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>A friend uses this suntan lotion for her toddler son, as per the pediatrician&#x27;s recommendation for his sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>For this reason, and the added benefit for sensitive skin, I ordered this suntan lotion from Amazon and used it all summer.  </li>
            <li>As far as sunblock/sunscreen is concerned, I&#x27;m done shopping around -</li>
            <li>It keeps me from burning, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, or my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>, (just as with any sunscreen) this sunscreen really stays put once it&#x27;s blended in properly.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen is working well for me so far.</li>
            <li>wow.  </li>
            <li>I was out in the direct sun on my friend&#x27;s boat all day (noon to five), and my skin had zero reaction to the sun.</li>
            <li>I actually think it blends in really well, and it has no odor at all.</li>
            <li>Works well with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much for sun protection because I only used it once and don&#x27;t plan to use it again.</li>
            <li>I got this for my daughter who has sensitive skin, her dermatologist recommended it.</li>
            <li>I purchased Vanicream Suncreen, Sensitive Skin, Spf60 for my husband.  </li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t get a sunburn and it didn&#x27;t bother his sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.[[ASIN:B000V1QLEM Vanicream Sunscreen, Sensitive Skin, Spf 60, 4 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>It is okay, not as thick as the 30</li>
            <li>Many probably mean well, but seem to be using incorrect information.  </li>
            <li>Many probably mean well, but seem to be using incorrect information.  </li>
            <li>There are just a couple of small areas on my face that are always slightly red because of the dermatitis problems (I have it mostly under control with an eczema cream and taking an antihistamine every day), but using this on those places while I&#x27;m outside really helped.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried high and low end sunscreens, even the ones that claim to be for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>but my main objective is the protection it gives me.</li>
            <li>I wish the protection (especially UVA protection/PPD) were higher, but that&#x27;s one of the tradeoffs of physical vs. chemical sunscreens.</li>
            <li>plus is that, like other reviewers mentioned, it doesn&#x27;t sting eyes, so I can rub it right up to my lower lashline and put it on my eyelids if I so desire.</li>
            <li>I have very pale skin and burn easily.  </li>
            <li>Our dermatologist highly recommended this product for use on your body (except facial area) as he uses it</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very reasonably priced compared to other products I&#x27;ve tried for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The only positive thing was it did not leave a white cast.</li>
            <li>This is such a great moisturizer and sunscreen that I can apply a thick layer of Retin-A before bed, and go out in the high-UV index sunlight 10 hours later without any sunburn, darkening of my skin, or any other sun damage.  </li>
            <li>Most of the hype seems to come from overzealous \\&quot;green\\&quot; sites who have not fully done their research or are mis-interpreting true studies, or citing non-peer-reviewed, double blind solid studies.</li>
            <li>Most of the hype seems to come from overzealous \\&quot;green\\&quot; sites who have not fully done their research or are mis-interpreting true studies, or citing non-peer-reviewed, double blind solid studies.</li>
            <li>It leaves a very shiny surface behind, that&#x27;s true, but shiny is much easier to cover than white!</li>
            <li>It is not very greasy like many other face sunblocks and it lasts for several hours.  </li>
            <li>I Look for ACTIVE INGREDIENTS of more zinc less titanium the best-rated mineral sun blocks.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it doesn&#x27;t contain fragrance which is irritating to many with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>(unless you are applying so much Zinc Oxide white layers \\&quot;like you see surfers wearing on their nose\\&quot; that the physical barrier alone will take care of almost all UVA and UVB.  </li>
            <li>This is THE only product I&#x27;ve found that does not irritate my sensitive skin and offers the protection I need because of photosensitivity.  </li>
            <li>Nearly 18 years later, a dermatologist gave me some samples of the Vanicream Sunscreen for Sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This product sinks into my skin within a few minutes and does not affect my makeup, if anything it makes it look better.</li>
            <li>Over the past three years I&#x27;ve gradually become sensitized not only to chemical sunscreens but also to creams containing only physical sunblocks as active ingredients (Neutrogena Baby Free and Clear, California Baby Super Sensitive, Eucerin for Sensitive Skin).</li>
            <li>So when you see \\&quot;SPF\\&quot; 60 or 100 or whatever, you may very well be receiving limited coverage and</li>
            <li>BROAD SPECTRUM</li>
            <li>I cover up pretty well, but use this on exposed areas other than my face.  </li>
            <li>Normally my face would start to itch and break out in hives the same day I put on sunscreen, but I&#x27;ve used this product for the last couple weeks and so far no reaction at all.</li>
            <li>I was sent vanicream broad spectrum 50</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive, finnicky skin and have had such a hard time finding a sunscreen for my face and neck that I really can wear on a daily basis under my makeup with no side effects.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m constantly on the search for a high SPF daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Baby Blue Lizard offers Titanium Dioxide 5% and Zinc Oxide 10%.</li>
            <li>It goes on well, doesn&#x27;t clog my poors and has provided me and my three young girls with ultimate sun protection!</li>
            <li>So far in her five years, we have found only two brands that don&#x27;t cause her a reaction.</li>
            <li>Summer meant a couple of burns early in the season before I was tanned enough to go out without harm.</li>
            <li>However if you are sensitive to sunscreen and/or have PMLE, looking greasy for a couple of hours would be your last concern.  </li>
            <li>Just a couple of weeks ago we tested it during a trip to the beach, and it worked very well, considering that we spent quite a bit of time under the sun and in the ocean and pool water.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, rosacea, or acne, this is the mildest safest sunscreen that you probably will find, I wear it on my face and neck daily.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive screen and are looking for a sunscreen that will actually work, this is the product for you.  </li>
            <li>Nano particles are 100 times smaller than micronized, which are much, much smaller than normal mineral blocker</li>
            <li>I will go back to my all time favorite Eucerin Everyday Protection SPF30 in the pink bottle but will save this Vanicream for body.</li>
            <li>We like this product-the greasiness gets absorbed after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>While not cheap, it is well worth buying if you want to stay away from the chemical sunscreens that bind to your skin.</li>
            <li>I use Coty Air Spun but probably any decent loose powder would do; swirl it on with a kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>My husband, who is in the sun daily, has very sensitive skin and virtually everything we tried further irritated his skin.  </li>
            <li>So far, it has protected me completely without any allergic reactions, and I appreciate that it does not leave a white cast to my skin or white smudges on my  clothes (which I did find with the sensitive-skin physical barrier sunscreen made by Neutrogena).  </li>
            <li>Although it is a little greasy, the terrific protection is worth it.</li>
            <li>I tried several formulations for sensitive skin, then finally gave up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little thicker than the average sunblock but rubs into the skin easily and well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little greasy at first, but that goes away as you work it into your skin and as it dries.    </li>
            <li>It is thick, white, and greasy at first, but I learned to put just a tiny amount on and my sin absorbs it in a few minutes just fine.</li>
            <li>I avoid OXYBENZONE which apparently disrupts human hormonal system,&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>
            <li>I developed an allergy to the product I&#x27;d used for a long time, and my dcotr recommended Vanicream to me.  </li>
            <li>The sun causes him to turn all splotchy red and itchy, and most sunscreens only made the situation worse.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty heavy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d had a problem initially with the company (JustOTC) from which I&#x27;d purchased this product most recently as they sent it to me in a flimsy envelope and the product arrived in poor condition.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit greasy when first applied, but after a few minutes it absorbs into your skin and is invisible.  </li>
            <li>Slightly greasy feeling at first, but does not leave any white residue once rubbed in thoroughly (may want to think about something different for the rest of your body if you&#x27;re hairy).  </li>
            <li>When you see \\&quot;full UVA and UVB spectrum coverage\\&quot; on any product tube it may well mean nothing.  </li>
            <li>Having had several small skin cnacers, I believe that any product that prevents them from occuring is worth buying.</li>
            <li>but you soon learn that a little goes a long way and the oiliness feels more like a cream in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>This is probably intended for people with very dry sensitive skin, and my skin is not dry.</li>
            <li>It may mean that 99% of UVB is covered, and only 1% of UVA, but they can still call it \\&quot;full spreturm.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li>It certainly does the job and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy like a lot of sun screen products.</li>
            <li>I drizzled some over a few cupcakes, and took a large bite.  </li>
            <li>it is a little heavy, but I like that moisture-sealing aspect, and it makes the makeup apply smoothly.  </li>

            <li> This provides great coverage, but we tend to look a bit gray when we use it.</li>
            <li> It works great, though.</li>
            <li> so happy.</li>
            <li> As every VaniCream product I have used has been great, I figured I would give their sunscreen a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lol.)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m definitely happy with it and don&#x27;t planning on switching brands any time soon.</li>
            <li> I have gotten about 5 people (friends &amp; family) using some of the products as well, and they seem as happy as me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked great.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be SPF 60, but that&#x27;s not what they sent me, so I wasn&#x27;t happy.</li>

            <li> I have been told by a company rep that Vanicream coasts theirs very effectively.  </li>
            <li> Unless you happen to be a marathon swimmer who is going to be soaked for hour and hours in the oceans&#x27; salty water without any shade, which Vaseline will act as the best sealer there is, then for a surfer like me, usually higher organic ingredients are the best.</li>
            <li> It works great and provides good sun protection.</li>
            <li> So be sure to speak with your doctor to know what will work best for you.</li>
            <li> Successfully excised, but now I wear sunscreen all winter, too, even on snowy days.</li>
            <li> My boy&#x27;s pediatrician recommended Vanicream moisturizer to help with his eczema, and we&#x27;ve had successful results.</li>
            <li> It took me many years to find the Vanicream line, and doing so has changed my life greatly!  </li>
            <li> This being said, it probably does a good job protecting.  </li>
            <li> but it is good to know that there are fewer chemicals in the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It does fade to a deathly gray but that&#x27;s as good as it gets, and</li>
            <li> and I think it does a good job of keeping the sun  damage in check.  </li>
            <li> I like to use good sunscreen and wanted a recommendation for one without a lot of harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon Vanicream at a non-chain pharmacy and the pharmacist said it was good and let me try it on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to buy her a good quality product, no chemicals.</li>
            <li> I know the product is a superior product for sun protection</li>
            <li> This would definitely be a good sun screen for anyone with sebborehic dermatitis, eczema, or someone who has a lot of skin allergies/sensitivities if you don&#x27;t mind the greasiness of it.</li>
            <li> The good news:  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s GOOD.</li>
            <li> on days I don&#x27;t wear makeup over it, people always comment on how good my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> Gives good protection, not greasy.  </li>
            <li> It is also good value.</li>
            <li> I think it is good for people who plan a mountain climbing or camping.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.  </li>
            <li> so I think it provides good protection.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to put on and does a great job of protecting my skin.</li>
            <li> Would strongly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my order.  </li>
            <li> I have been very pleased.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product....very protective and just the right moisturizing effect for my face.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> and I trust Dr. Mercola more than my dermatologist!</li>
            <li> We have bought many times now!</li>
            <li> if you need a sunscreen that is easy on skin, this is a great choice as it probably isn&#x27;t going to irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> AMAZING.</li>
            <li> That is why chemical screens are so popular.  </li>
            <li> You must research the product thoroughly or you may be doing more harm than good from some of these products.ise.  </li>
            <li> You must research the product thoroughly or you may be doing more harm than good from some of these products.</li>
            <li> I would never wear it for any kind of activity where I wanted to look nice.</li>
            <li> Aside from that I&#x27;m using it because I know I&#x27;m getting good, safe coverage.</li>
            <li> My mom liked it too.</li>
            <li> I have tried A LOT of sunscreens in my quest to find one that is effective, sweatproof</li>
            <li> so do your own research before listening to others comments.</li>
            <li> P.S.: I was using La Roche Posay Dermo-Peds (not cruelty free but very, very effective).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s high spot on the list of best sunscreens by EWG and because of all the rave reviews on this website.  </li>
            <li> It was the best hypoallergenic and high SPF sunscreen that I could find--my dermatologist recommended it.</li>
            <li> After a brief search on the internet, we found a good deal on Amazon where we could buy two jars of Vanicream with a pump dispenser, and get a tube of their sunscreen as well at an awesome price.  </li>
            <li> Im glad to be able to spend time in the sun again!</li>
            <li> So far very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this product to me and this is the most cost effective place I&#x27;ve found it.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the best sunscreens to use if you have any type of skin issues like sensitive skin, freckled skin or melasma skin.  </li>
            <li> I love the texture and it also makes my skin look amazing, somehow,</li>
            <li> I purchased the vanicream sunscreen because it was touted to be excellent for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this sunscreen is the perfect fit!</li>
            <li> It was packaged well and arrived really quickly!!</li>
            <li> This product is unscented which is very important to me.</li>
            <li> It protects nicely and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found loose powder to do an excellent job of covering it up and creating a nice, longlasting, dewy and even look.</li>
            <li> If you find that certain sunscreens can clog your pores and flare acne, this is a great choice as it does not clog up pores.</li>
            <li> It offers very good blockage of the sun.</li>
            <li> I care more about protecting my very fair and sensitive skin than I do about vanity</li>
            <li> That is why Badger is better than most...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they do it, because this product looks WAY better on my face than anything else I tried.    </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Vanicream sunscreen as well as moisturizing cream for several years and have been very happy.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really satisfied with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I think it may be better in winter.</li>
            <li> The Vanicream is a much better value, at about 1/2 the price of the Soleo.</li>
            <li> This is still my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Will repurchase after finishing my tube &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Most every product you will find in stores iss based on chemical screens.  </li>
            <li> This is another reason people think that chemical and even nano/micro screens can lead to even more cancers in sunscreen users.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, when the product itself has many anti-oxidents to offset the free-radicals themselves, the oxidation problem appears to be neutralized.  </li>
            <li> and i am more comforatble with this product than any I have seen or found.&lt;br</li>

            <li> and i am more comforatble with this product than any I have seen or found.  </li>
            <li> And it spreads better than the Sport version.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is not to knock the product - it is outstanding.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> My dermatologist is pleased, and so am I.  </li>
            <li> If you are okay with the product that they send you</li>
            <li> Bought because of the great reputation but thought the 60 spf was really greasy.</li>
            <li> but i Love this sunscreen</li>
            <li> Now I should be able to get the rest of my face darker than those spots since they&#x27;ll be protected from the sun.  </li>
            <li> Like many others, I&#x27;m allergic to any sunscreen and makes me break out in a rash.</li>
            <li> Tried a sample from dermatologist and love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I received the most protection from Vanicream.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the fact that it was so greasy, but I found ways of making my shiny nose more matte....</li>
            <li> I  am allergic to most sunscreens and have been using this product for about 8 months.  </li>
            <li> I have been very happy with it and will continue to use it for my son and for myself, and will order more next summer.  </li>
            <li> I like burn out brand better but it costs more</li>
            <li> The has an allergy to most sun creams.  </li>
            <li> The price could be better though.</li>
            <li> We were looking for a safe, \\&quot;Os, PABA free\\&quot; sunscreen.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have any issues with the residue getting into my eyes and burning like most do.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen seems to work perfectly for the most sensitive of skin in our family, from light skinned Grandpa to tender infant.  </li>
            <li> It is most off-putting.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for seven years and still love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Rubs in very nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave the bright white telltale skin from many others.</li>
            <li> This came up as being pretty safe in comparison to thousands of others, seems like a good choice over all</li>
            <li> (it makes a great moisturizer when we are home in New York), and have had no problems with it at all.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and was happy to find no stinging sensation or reaction from this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I discovered that it is very easy to remove the shine by just blotting the surface with a clean Kleenex.</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot, was very gentle, unlike the better known national brand sunscreens for the face that I tried when I ran out of Vanicream.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist recommended product, great even for highly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Thru Amazon, we are able to save money and get free delivery.</li>
            <li> SPF 60 keeps my face from becoming wrinkled by the sun.</li>
            <li> This was the true test!</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and protects for hours.</li>
            <li> I will like cream with zinc oxide in it but easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Our daughters skin is much better after 6 months of regular use, and the sunscreen works just great as well as moisturizing her skin in the sun.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I am not an expert on the active ingredients in sunscreen, I have to believe that whatever VaniCream is using is second-to-none when it comes to giving the best protection against both UV-A and UV-B damage.</li>
            <li> Like most VaniCream products, it&#x27;s by no means inexpensive, but overall, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Slightly oily after applied, which makes applying foundation easy.</li>
            <li> I used it first on my skin, and I really liked it.</li>
            <li> Just a quick fix until Vanicream comes up with a better formula.</li>
            <li> I suffer from mild rosacea and am a very fair skinned red head.</li>
            <li> also applies to tanning oils and lotions--which many of you may be using right now with summer in full swing--as well as the baby oil or lotion that many parents unwittingly slather on their babies.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive skin and am allergic to most anything!</li>
            <li> From what I understand, breathing in titanium dioxide dust into  your lungs in huge quantities would be a problem, but from a sunscreen,</li>
            <li> From what I understand, breathing in titanium dioxide dust into  your lungs in huge quantities would be a problem, but from a sunscreen, no.  </li>
            <li> FRAGRANCE FREE</li>
            <li> PABA free; It must spell out on the face of the container,&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t available in any stores nearby.</li>
            <li> One important factor for me in deciding to use this product again is the fact that it DOES NOT carry any harmful chemicals and it is odor free.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a oily feel and is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Is product is FABULOUS, FABULOUS.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used this product for over 3 years, and the current price we paid was great.</li>
            <li> I would never have been able to enjoy an event like that in a bathing suit without worrying about getting burnt, and it&#x27;s a good thing because I was in a wedding 2 days later!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommends it and has it available for purchase at her office</li>
            <li> but I decided to buy from Amazon, get free shipping and save 25% per tube.</li>
            <li> but, great for extra coverage.</li>
            <li> The individual packets are great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Polymorphic Light Eruption since I was about 4.</li>
            <li> It is no longer available, so this seller should change the picture.</li>
            <li> Blue Lizard 30 is not as good of ingredients as Badger but still better than Vanicream 60</li>
            <li> Having read about how good zinc oxide based sunscreens are for you, I bought more and decided to use it on my neck, arms and legs while playing golf last week.</li>
            <li> Vanicream is a reasonably-priced, good sunscreen for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> We travel frequently to tropical areas, so a good sunscreen is a must.  </li>
            <li> Some formulations use one or the other, but again, ideally you want both for full sprecturm coverage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for about a year...got it originally for my nose after skin cancer surgery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Irradiated mice who were treated with the moisturizers exhibited a significant increase in their rate of tumor formation and increase in tumor size per mouse.</li>
            <li> Thanks! :)&lt;</li>
            <li> This sunblock does not have a sunblcok scent and is great at protecting my face all day long.</li>
            <li> It is particularly good if you use a stick foundation which I stopped using for awhile because it was a little too dry/matte, but over the SS, provides a nice \\&quot;tinted moisturizer\\&quot; type finish.  </li>
            <li> In the course of this project, I&#x27;ve also learned how to clean off a mineral sunblock.</li>
            <li> Zinc Oxide is the only non-chemical substance that can effectively block close to 100% of the UVA harmful rays, and blocks most of the UVB rays.  </li>
            <li> Titanium Dioxide is the only non-toxic substance that can effectively block 100% of UVB rays, and most of the UVA rays.  </li>
            <li> For people who have sensitive skin or just want a physical sunscreen instead of chemical, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I hope Amazon and DermStore can fox this problem before others have to go through what I am having to clean up.</li>
            <li> It is powerful and yet not greasy or drying like most powerful sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> It washes really clean.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to most fragrances and a lot of chemicals, so I appreciate it, too!  </li>
            <li> This Badger is one of the best that I have ever used since it is 100% certified Natural, 87% certified organic and a whopping 12% zinc oxide that is easy toapply, rubs in quick, not greasy, offers me protection and is priced reasonably per ounce.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it is fairly pure without a lot of additives.  </li>
            <li> The texture, coverage  and performance of this cream makes it special.  </li>
            <li> I spent the week at the beach and my skin has been great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also good to exfoliate regularly, because these products will tend to highlight any skin irregularities or blocked pores.</li>
            <li> I am also very allergic to many of the chemicals that are in store brand sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I am VERY dissapointed that my dermatologist recommended this cream as SAFE</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The first is the amazing skincare cream which was recommended by my dermatologist, and the second is the most important, sunscreen protection.  </li>
            <li> Our allergist gave us a sample and after using it for two weeks no bad reactions.  </li>
            <li> Many specultate that this fact, along with the fact that these products lose their effectiveness very quickly and produce free radicals in the skin, and that those folks using high SPF products without UVA protection tend to stay in the sun longer, may be why skin cancer rates are higher in those using suncsreens than not using them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> great coverage, not oily and does not make your face look like a \\&quot;ghost\\&quot; like some other suncreens.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t deny them trips to the pool just because I had to choose between a rash or mild burn.</li>
            <li> and I have been loyal to it for years.</li>
            <li> No sunscreen can adequately protect anyone&#x27;s skin without a combination of these two.</li>
            <li> My complexion is lighter, more even-toned, and more porcelain-colored at 35 than it was at 27, because faithful &amp; proper use of Vanicream SPF 60 blocks my skin from darkening at all.  </li>
            <li> Vanicream Products are the best, so you can never go wrong with any of them :).</li>
            <li> I use my hands to do a quick wash, rinse, then</li>
            <li> This is the most highly protective and dermatologist-recommended sunscreen there is.</li>
            <li> Since this product has less chemicals, it doesn&#x27;t stain and does a great job on sun protection.</li>
            <li> Most of these chemicals have also--according to my research--but you must determine this for yourself-- been proven very clearly to cause cancer in lab animals.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of preservatives, scents, etc to irritate the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have even tried the ones that claim \\&quot;pure and free Baby\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The knock on these products is that they are said to have been proven to readily absorb into the deepest layers of the skin, where the toxins are released into the blood in large amounts, and need reapplication much more than chemical blockers.  </li>
            <li> I have never written a review on Amazon, but I have to say this product is amazing for me and hopefully for anyone with a similar issue.  </li>
            <li> I do think it is a great sunscreen, but just not for everyday wear for the oily woman.&lt;br</li>
            <li> one of my daughters has the most sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The name however, makes me laugh because it sounds like a [...] cream rather than a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Although it is on the pricey side, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen just NEVER seemed to be absorbed by my skin after \\&quot;Rubbing it in\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> love vanicream sunscreen spf 60 for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> dermatitis, and my head/face is extremely sensitive to most shampoos, soaps, sun screens, etc.</li>
            <li> (getting rashes aren&#x27;t fun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to the ingredients in most sunscreens, even those supposedly for sensitive skin, like Aveeno.  </li>
            <li> Hopes this is useful.</li>
            <li> well worth paying for this product.</li>
            <li> A dermatologist recommended that she try this cream, and it gives her good sun protection without the irritation caused by more common products.</li>
            <li> A success story.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has eczema and is sensitive to most sunblocks.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen is the most important product to use and this one has zinc oxide in it which is key to not get a sunburn.</li>
            <li> My child never complains of the burn like she has with other sunscreens and it is great at protecting her from the intense sun-</li>
            <li> I have a newborn on the way and my wife and I live in a very hot area and we both are light skinned, and I am anal and analytical to a fault.  </li>
            <li> &quot;  Check to confirm I am on the right track.  </li>
            <li> &quot;  Check to confirm I am on the right track.  </li>
            <li> He was right.  </li>
            <li> I live in South Florida and am constantly in search of a good sunblock.  </li>
            <li> The only good thing is that this works for my ultra sensitive skin, so I used it for my body, just not for my face.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin and Vanicream does not cause any skin reactions, which is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so all of these products are fabulous AND very gentle on the skin with out of the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; added.</li>
            <li> The next concern I have is that nano and micro particles, if uncoated, have higher \\&quot;photoreactivity\\&quot; which causes them to release free radicals in the skin when exposed to UV light, thereby being cancerous.  </li>

            <li> Scent is fairly pleasant, no strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> It seems to protect from sun and most likely stays on well when/after swimming.  </li>
            <li> , I always apply 30 minutes before the first exposure to the sun</li>
            <li> Most of them said the same thing that is too greasy.</li>
            <li> He even demonstrated how gentle it was by putting it in his eye!  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m asking too much - a lightweight, non-greasy, invisible hypoallergenic sunscreen!</li>
            <li> After searching more than 8 years for a sunscreen I am not allergic to, I finally found it!</li>
            <li> Vanicreme has it listed as the first ingredietnt.  </li>
            <li> more than the numerous products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Vanicreme has it listed as the first ingredietnt.  </li>
            <li> more than the numerous products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and its the only one</li>
            <li> The first thing my husband said was \\&quot;your face looks</li>
            <li> This, for me, seems to work pretty well</li>
            <li> the price you paid extra for the discontinued SPF 60 is a lot more than what the SPF 50 product is sold for.</li>
            <li> I applied it for the first time 5 hours ago this morning</li>
            <li> However, her price for the product (yes, she sells it...) is quite a bit higher.</li>
            <li> Also, I am pretty athletic and spend a lot of time on the water.  </li>
            <li> It is not the same product as the 60spf, and it is much more visible on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I LOVE this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I can see that it would most likely be problematic for people with oily or even combo skin.</li>
            <li> After mush research and talking with my doctor and many mis-steps in the correct sun protection, VaniCream Sunscreen SPF 60 is the only product that has helped.  </li>
            <li> I am ordering a large one right now and wanted to leave a comment first.</li>
            <li> It gives skin a purple cast when first applied which goes away as it warms and is rubbed in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, and effective (as long as I reapply as recommended) and it&#x27;s super moisturizing for my dry skin so that I can smoothly apply makeup on after.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite sunscreens--it doesn&#x27;t make me look like a kabuki doll like so many of the sensitive-skin types, but it is quite thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> But it worked well when I was outside because it is hot and the sunshine is strong here.</li>
            <li> This is the first sunscreen product I&#x27;ve used that was not irritating at all.  </li>
            <li> I was given samples of this sunscreen by my dermatologist to use before and after a laser-like procedure that caused my face to be super sensitive.</li>
            <li> Think its more for dry skin&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I recently had surgery on a scar and was told by my Doctor to use a strong sunscreen to protect it.</li>
            <li> It is a physical blocker as well as a chemical blocker and does a good job of stopping both UVA and UVB rays without many of the harmful chemicals that are in several other brands.</li>
            <li> When I put it on my face it looks like I put pure oil on it.  </li>
            <li> Bravo Badger.apply, rubs in quick, not greasy, offers me protection and is priced reasonably per ounce.</li>
            <li> Once I go back to the Vanicream, everything is fine.  </li>
            <li> I had read about it online at another website that tests the strength and trustworthiness of sunscreen and this was rated very high.</li>
            <li> My skin reacts to a lot of sunscreens by breaking out in a rash, but I am a redhead and need very high SPF protection when I am outdoors for extended periods of time.</li>
            <li> The zinc oxide makes it a little messier than most sunscreen products but it is worth putting up with that since she does not break out using it.</li>
            <li> Attemps by companies selling mineral blockers to reduce the \\&quot;ghost\\&quot; effect have led to the formulation of \\&quot;nanonized\\&quot; and \\&quot;micronized\\&quot; formulations, with very small particles that spread more easily that minimize dramatically the whiteness of the mineral blockers.  </li>
            <li> Producers write whatever they want and it really consumes time to read up and compare facts.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen needs to protect and needs to protect for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t turn you white.  </li>
            <li> This sunblock is very oily.  </li>
            <li> The works very well as described but it is way too greasy, so I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> it is greasy as much as I want to buy another</li>
            <li> It has a light scent and doesn&#x27;t leave white streaks on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> My research--again, ad nauseum--you must confirm this for yourself--shows me that there has never been any credible study to prove these particles absorb into the deep layers of the skin.  </li>
            <li> This product did not burn my skin but it is very greasy.  </li>
            <li> As another review noted, because it is gentle, it does not irritate my eyes</li>
            <li> I need this because I walk my dog four times a day, but it is very greasy.  </li>
            <li> and it works really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have vascular rosecea and have to be very cafeful what I use on my face.  </li>
            <li> It has worked for very well for her.</li>
            <li> Since wearing Vanicream SPF 60, I&#x27;ve never had a burn despite intense sun.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it IS very greasy like everyone says.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I should have listened to the reviewers saying this sunscreen is really greasy.  </li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist and has worked really well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really soak in, but that&#x27;s the point.</li>
            <li> What Zack said about a sunscreen needing to contain both zinc oxide and titanium dioxide is the absolute truth.  </li>
            <li> Reasonably  priced, I think.</li>
            <li> Your face will have a real shine after using it.</li>
            <li> Wanted something light to totally block all sun.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a very lightweight or very liquid/fluid sunscream for your face, this is not it.</li>
            <li> I just used a couple of 0.25 free samples of Vanicream 60 SPF from my dermatologist several weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I really slather it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m comfortable using this every day and don&#x27;t notice a white cast.</li>
            <li> and I really wanted to discover it&#x27;s purpose.  </li>
            <li> I have to wear sunscreen everyday and have really fair, sensitive, skin cancer prone skin.</li>
            <li> In hot weather, most sunscreens leave stains on your clothes as they drip down your neck.  </li>
            <li> After reasearching and reading other reviews, I picked this one out, and I feel very comfortable doing outdoor activities now when I&#x27;m wearing Vanicream.  </li>
            <li> and my daughter burned for the first time this year because of the new formulation.</li>
            <li> I have combo skin and live in a humid place so this may be better for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly; mild scent; hasn&#x27;t caused any rash or redness; a little thick but still spreads kind of easily if patted all over face first.</li>
            <li> I guess due to the perspiration, it ran onto my clothes and I have not been able to get it out after 2 washings.</li>
            <li> I have not checked into the other ingredients in this product, many sound strange to me, so you might want to check those.  </li>
            <li> I have not checked into the other ingredients in this product, many sound strange to me, so you might want to check those.  </li>
            <li> I have a 7 month old with super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Nice suncreen for people who usually have eye reactions from suncreens.</li>
            <li> I used Vanicream 60 almost every day and found it very effective,  non irritating, and love it even if it is a little greasy.  </li>
            <li> The reason I believe this is because I have not had a single product from VaniCream that was not the best in its respective class, and so their reputation of quality and integrity gives me confidence in their products, and enough confidence to let other Amazon Users know about my positive experiences with their products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sunscreen has been EXTREMELY useful for the whole family (I think my husband, an avid hiker, is its #1 fan), considering the dry air and 100°F plus temperatures in our city.</li>
            <li> I live on Amazon!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is a little greasy - but it is still much better than many others we&#x27;ve tried and does absorb well for the most part.</li>
            <li> Zinc is the solution, more zinc for less money with organic ingredients that are not carcinogen or harmful to me...</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin and want a sunscreen that helps with the dryness, this is a great choice as it instantly treats dry skin upon application.</li>
            <li> To be more specific, we were looking for a sunscreen that was more a physical and less a chemical barrier.</li>
            <li> Soap and water works decently, but this is what I do</li>
            <li> It looks pretty white because of the zinc when you first start applying it, but it fades as you rub it in.  </li>
            <li> Main ingredient is ZINC OXIDE</li>
            <li> My skin has stayed fairly matte for up to four hours with one application of powder; it really clings to the film the sunscreen leaves behind.</li>
            <li> I am a blonde with fair skin and break out with red bumps when exposed to the sun too long, even when using sunsreen.  </li>
            <li> so it sinks in pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen because it was highly rated for being one of the healthiest sunscreens out there.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It is a little bit greasy feeling after you rub it in, but I like that because my makeup goes on better over it if it has some slip.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;greasiness\\&quot; that other reviews mentioned is what makes it spread so easily.  </li>
            <li> I just tried Vanicream Sunscreen for Sensitive Skin Spf 60 and found that it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen was recomended as being gentle to healing skin that is also tender and sensitive.</li>
            <li> It has worked very well and is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> What I put on my skin is the same as consuming it through my skin since it is absorbed by my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been able to use the product already a few times.</li>
            <li> It is greasy and does not last as long as others, so we reapply often, but overall I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> and I use it more heavily.</li>
            <li> We have tried various products and are pleased to confirm some of the positive reviews we actually used prior to purchasing this product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen does the trick for me when I am hiking and biking, and the physical block absorbs easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a white film on my face.</li>
            <li> But honestly, considering the fact that it doesn&#x27;t break me out, the greasiness is a VERY small price to pay.</li>
            <li> ; I never leave the sunscreen container in the sun, purchase new sunscreen all the time</li>
            <li> I think their new products coming out have no alumina.  </li>
            <li> I think their new products coming out have no alumina.  </li>
            <li> I just hope their new formulation SPF 50+ works as well.</li>
            <li> What I received was Vanicream&#x27;s new formulation 50spf.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the new product at all.</li>
            <li> it has been replaced by a completely new and reformulated product Vanicream 50+.  </li>
            <li> so I am hopeful that it will hold up in New England heat and humidity.</li>
            <li> The new stuff is SPF 55</li>
            <li> It does live up to that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;The results indicate that several commercially available moisturizing creams increase the rate of formation and number of tumors when applied topically to UVB-pretreated high-risk mice.</li>
            <li> allergies\\&quot; for about 10 years, through numerous tests and incorrect diagnosis, I have finally been correctly diagnosed with PMLE - Poly Morphous Light Eruption.  </li>
            <li> this really works and does not bother my sensitive skin and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin and have no reaction to this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have SLE and over the years my skin has become very sensitive.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a little thick, but it spreads very well and is extremely effective yet mild.  </li>
            <li> I need more zinc baby not Titanium dioxide and Blue Lizard offers more zinc, less titanium for half the cost...</li>
            <li> Usually those SPFs will not be over 30 for any safe sunscreen ingredients and it will be for BABYs.</li>
            <li> Majority have fragrance but baby sunscreens usually do not.</li>
            <li> I never usually break out.  </li>
            <li> I find it to be a bit greasy, but overall after rubbing it in thoroughly, after a while it blends in pretty well</li>
            <li> I find it to be a bit greasy, but overall after rubbing it in thoroughly, after a while it blends in pretty well</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried vanicream and I will definitely be ordering it again.  </li>
            <li> I do wish they could offer an even higher degree of protection such as 100% SPF.</li>
            <li> You know, the white stuff lifeguards put on their noses to keep them from burning to a crisp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;A study has found that topical applications of moisturizers such as Dermabase, Dermovan, Eucerin Original Moisturizing Cream, or Vanicream could increase skin cancer risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live at a high altitude and have lupus, so I need serious sun protection that is suitable for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Majority have many different ingredients than zinc and titanium as ACTIVE</li>
            <li> But, JustOTC saw a post I&#x27;d penned on Amazon and they completely remedied the problem by sending out a new box without charge.</li>
            <li> I get used to the light lotion for sunscreen, so I felt the sunscreen was too thick first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Why do I need fragrance regardless, and this is from an athlete where I consume fresh garlic napping in vinegar every single day,&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Only good thing was it did not leave the usual white cast.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it in the winter; less so in the summer but keep coming back to it</li>
            <li> I burn within 45 minutes but with Vanicream, I have been able to stay out longer with no burning and only a slight tanning.</li>
            <li> It applies well and does quickly absorb into the skin unlike other products with zinc oxide.  </li>
            <li> The Vanicream sunblock, however, goes on essentially clear, even before rubbing in.</li>
            <li> The vanicream SPF 60 used to go on clear and had no smell</li>
            <li> Natural sunscreens with FEWER chemicals.</li>
            <li> Manufacturers like to spin the facts and challenge our knowledge and intelligence by claiming it as WITHOUT any harsh chemical or chemical FREE or without chemical ABSORBERS.</li>
            <li> Vanicream 60+ offers Titanium Dioxide (7.5%), Zinc Oxide 7.5%...</li>

            <li> My facial skin is really photosensitive.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin (eczema) has not had any adverse reaction to its ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Even all the ones that say they are for sensitive skin, &amp; hypo allergenic etc.</li>
            <li> Since I am sensitive to smells in sunscreens I thought I would try it.  </li>
            <li> I am photoallergic to all kinds of sunscreens I tried so far, from Banana Boat to Neutrogena and Shiseido.</li>
            <li> Can be used on children or others with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> (shaving cream, soaps, basically anything scented natural or otherwise).</li>
            <li> I must mention to  those who do like scented products I suggest you don&#x27;t apply them to your face since products that contain a fragrance as even natural fragrances will age your skin.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin like me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what she uses on her 3yr old daughter.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am a woman of color.  </li>
            <li> and my face feels soft and protected all day.  </li>
            <li> and I ordered S p f 60 for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but they sent me 50 plus not for Sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After having several skin cancers removed, I have become very hyper vigilant about wearing sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I also really like that it doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast.</li>
            <li> I have been allergic to sunscreen (and therefore haven&#x27;t worn any) since I was twelve years old.  </li>
            <li> I have tried almost all of the readily-available, over-the-counter sunscreens for sensitive skins.  </li>
            <li> I have PMLE, since I was about 13 yrs old</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to all my friends with children or if they have sensitive skin or eczema.  </li>
            <li> I have sun sensitive lupus.</li>
            <li> Vanicream Sunscreen, Sensitive Skin SPF 60 is now SPF 50</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product after early detection of melanoma.</li>
            <li> None of us got sunburn and our skins remained soft and moist.</li>
            <li> It blends very well and doesn&#x27;t leave white residue at all.  </li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> A friend uses this suntan lotion for her toddler son, as per the pediatrician&#x27;s recommendation for his sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> For this reason, and the added benefit for sensitive skin, I ordered this suntan lotion from Amazon and used it all summer.  </li>
            <li> As far as sunblock/sunscreen is concerned, I&#x27;m done shopping around -</li>
            <li> It keeps me from burning, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, or my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> , (just as with any sunscreen) this sunscreen really stays put once it&#x27;s blended in properly.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen is working well for me so far.</li>
            <li> wow.  </li>
            <li> I was out in the direct sun on my friend&#x27;s boat all day (noon to five), and my skin had zero reaction to the sun.</li>
            <li> I actually think it blends in really well, and it has no odor at all.</li>
            <li> Works well with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much for sun protection because I only used it once and don&#x27;t plan to use it again.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter who has sensitive skin, her dermatologist recommended it.</li>
            <li> I purchased Vanicream Suncreen, Sensitive Skin, Spf60 for my husband.  </li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t get a sunburn and it didn&#x27;t bother his sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.[[ASIN:B000V1QLEM Vanicream Sunscreen, Sensitive Skin, Spf 60, 4 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> It is okay, not as thick as the 30</li>
            <li> Many probably mean well, but seem to be using incorrect information.  </li>
            <li> Many probably mean well, but seem to be using incorrect information.  </li>
            <li> There are just a couple of small areas on my face that are always slightly red because of the dermatitis problems (I have it mostly under control with an eczema cream and taking an antihistamine every day), but using this on those places while I&#x27;m outside really helped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried high and low end sunscreens, even the ones that claim to be for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> but my main objective is the protection it gives me.</li>
            <li> I wish the protection (especially UVA protection/PPD) were higher, but that&#x27;s one of the tradeoffs of physical vs. chemical sunscreens.</li>
            <li> plus is that, like other reviewers mentioned, it doesn&#x27;t sting eyes, so I can rub it right up to my lower lashline and put it on my eyelids if I so desire.</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin and burn easily.  </li>
            <li> Our dermatologist highly recommended this product for use on your body (except facial area) as he uses it</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very reasonably priced compared to other products I&#x27;ve tried for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The only positive thing was it did not leave a white cast.</li>
            <li> This is such a great moisturizer and sunscreen that I can apply a thick layer of Retin-A before bed, and go out in the high-UV index sunlight 10 hours later without any sunburn, darkening of my skin, or any other sun damage.  </li>
            <li> Most of the hype seems to come from overzealous \\&quot;green\\&quot; sites who have not fully done their research or are mis-interpreting true studies, or citing non-peer-reviewed, double blind solid studies.</li>
            <li> Most of the hype seems to come from overzealous \\&quot;green\\&quot; sites who have not fully done their research or are mis-interpreting true studies, or citing non-peer-reviewed, double blind solid studies.</li>
            <li> It leaves a very shiny surface behind, that&#x27;s true, but shiny is much easier to cover than white!</li>
            <li> It is not very greasy like many other face sunblocks and it lasts for several hours.  </li>
            <li> I Look for ACTIVE INGREDIENTS of more zinc less titanium the best-rated mineral sun blocks.</li>
            <li> Additionally, it doesn&#x27;t contain fragrance which is irritating to many with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> (unless you are applying so much Zinc Oxide white layers \\&quot;like you see surfers wearing on their nose\\&quot; that the physical barrier alone will take care of almost all UVA and UVB.  </li>
            <li> This is THE only product I&#x27;ve found that does not irritate my sensitive skin and offers the protection I need because of photosensitivity.  </li>
            <li> Nearly 18 years later, a dermatologist gave me some samples of the Vanicream Sunscreen for Sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This product sinks into my skin within a few minutes and does not affect my makeup, if anything it makes it look better.</li>
            <li> Over the past three years I&#x27;ve gradually become sensitized not only to chemical sunscreens but also to creams containing only physical sunblocks as active ingredients (Neutrogena Baby Free and Clear, California Baby Super Sensitive, Eucerin for Sensitive Skin).</li>
            <li> So when you see \\&quot;SPF\\&quot; 60 or 100 or whatever, you may very well be receiving limited coverage and</li>
            <li> BROAD SPECTRUM</li>
            <li> I cover up pretty well, but use this on exposed areas other than my face.  </li>
            <li> Normally my face would start to itch and break out in hives the same day I put on sunscreen, but I&#x27;ve used this product for the last couple weeks and so far no reaction at all.</li>
            <li> I was sent vanicream broad spectrum 50</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive, finnicky skin and have had such a hard time finding a sunscreen for my face and neck that I really can wear on a daily basis under my makeup with no side effects.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m constantly on the search for a high SPF daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Baby Blue Lizard offers Titanium Dioxide 5% and Zinc Oxide 10%.</li>
            <li> It goes on well, doesn&#x27;t clog my poors and has provided me and my three young girls with ultimate sun protection!</li>
            <li> So far in her five years, we have found only two brands that don&#x27;t cause her a reaction.</li>
            <li> Summer meant a couple of burns early in the season before I was tanned enough to go out without harm.</li>
            <li> However if you are sensitive to sunscreen and/or have PMLE, looking greasy for a couple of hours would be your last concern.  </li>
            <li> Just a couple of weeks ago we tested it during a trip to the beach, and it worked very well, considering that we spent quite a bit of time under the sun and in the ocean and pool water.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, rosacea, or acne, this is the mildest safest sunscreen that you probably will find, I wear it on my face and neck daily.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive screen and are looking for a sunscreen that will actually work, this is the product for you.  </li>
            <li> Nano particles are 100 times smaller than micronized, which are much, much smaller than normal mineral blocker</li>
            <li> I will go back to my all time favorite Eucerin Everyday Protection SPF30 in the pink bottle but will save this Vanicream for body.</li>
            <li> We like this product-the greasiness gets absorbed after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> While not cheap, it is well worth buying if you want to stay away from the chemical sunscreens that bind to your skin.</li>
            <li> I use Coty Air Spun but probably any decent loose powder would do; swirl it on with a kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> My husband, who is in the sun daily, has very sensitive skin and virtually everything we tried further irritated his skin.  </li>
            <li> So far, it has protected me completely without any allergic reactions, and I appreciate that it does not leave a white cast to my skin or white smudges on my  clothes (which I did find with the sensitive-skin physical barrier sunscreen made by Neutrogena).  </li>
            <li> Although it is a little greasy, the terrific protection is worth it.</li>
            <li> I tried several formulations for sensitive skin, then finally gave up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thicker than the average sunblock but rubs into the skin easily and well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy at first, but that goes away as you work it into your skin and as it dries.    </li>
            <li> It is thick, white, and greasy at first, but I learned to put just a tiny amount on and my sin absorbs it in a few minutes just fine.</li>
            <li> I avoid OXYBENZONE which apparently disrupts human hormonal system,&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>
            <li> I developed an allergy to the product I&#x27;d used for a long time, and my dcotr recommended Vanicream to me.  </li>
            <li> The sun causes him to turn all splotchy red and itchy, and most sunscreens only made the situation worse.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty heavy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had a problem initially with the company (JustOTC) from which I&#x27;d purchased this product most recently as they sent it to me in a flimsy envelope and the product arrived in poor condition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit greasy when first applied, but after a few minutes it absorbs into your skin and is invisible.  </li>
            <li> Slightly greasy feeling at first, but does not leave any white residue once rubbed in thoroughly (may want to think about something different for the rest of your body if you&#x27;re hairy).  </li>
            <li> When you see \\&quot;full UVA and UVB spectrum coverage\\&quot; on any product tube it may well mean nothing.  </li>
            <li> Having had several small skin cnacers, I believe that any product that prevents them from occuring is worth buying.</li>
            <li> but you soon learn that a little goes a long way and the oiliness feels more like a cream in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> This is probably intended for people with very dry sensitive skin, and my skin is not dry.</li>
            <li> It may mean that 99% of UVB is covered, and only 1% of UVA, but they can still call it \\&quot;full spreturm.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li> It certainly does the job and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy like a lot of sun screen products.</li>
            <li> I drizzled some over a few cupcakes, and took a large bite.  </li>
            <li> it is a little heavy, but I like that moisture-sealing aspect, and it makes the makeup apply smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Not very good when it&#x27;s hot - especially if it&#x27;s humid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick or greasy, though it is slightly tacky to the touch.</li>
            <li> On the couple of occasions when I&#x27;ve run out of Vanicream and gone back to Neutrogena or some other sunscreen advertised as \\&quot;hypoallergenic\\&quot; or for \\&quot;sensitive skin,\\</li>
            <li> I suggest getting one with a lower spf or wearing this only in the summertime or when outside for long periods.</li>
            <li> Check with the company, but it is my understanding that the amount of alumina in this product is the least amount of any other ingredient, and on application is less than we probably get in our water or food--again--check to make sure yourself.  </li>

            <li> It is long lasting and stays on even after a dip in the pool after golf.  </li>
            <li> those that have PMLE, when on my cruise and vacationing in the Dominican Republic, I also took a short week long dose of prednisone.  </li>
            <li> It goes on well and the blocking effects last a long time.</li>
            <li> Both my children have dry skin issues and this was the only product that helped.</li>
            <li> (I have DRY facial skin, so</li>
            <li> Our 4-year old daughter was born with slight touch of asthma.</li>
            <li> you know, when you can&#x27;t jump in the shower after using the toilet.</li>
            <li> To be a physical barrier, your choices become somewhat restricted, and limited to Zinc and/or Titanium Oxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a must have product for year round use--it truly protects sensitive skin and prevents sunburn too!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, I am extremely fair</li>
            <li> So I was walking outside on my sidewalk the other day when I stumbled across a strange white tube of paste.  </li>
            <li> I ended up going back to it because other facial sunscreens left a white film on my black skin.</li>
            <li> so I never worry about few months old</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for this product, I&#x27;d probably still be wearing long sleeves and oversized hats in the summer time.</li>
            <li> I recently spent 4 hours on boat, applied the sunscreen only once (spf 60), and didn&#x27;t burn, nor did I have a reaction!  </li>
            <li> Along with this you will have to make calls to rectify this, and have to go through the process of returning the product with no offers to compensate you for your hassles associated with the transaction.</li>
            <li> I will be careful next time!</li>
            <li> But over the years I have found that some sunscreens really do not get along with my skin, and that some clog pores (leading to further skin irritation.)</li>
            <li> (Nutrogena has a new one called &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; that is supposed to be free of all dyes and perfumes and everything bad, but it made me and my son break out in a rash all over our faces and necks).  </li>
            <li> It is on the greasy side, so works better in the cold weather when my skin is dry.  </li>
            <li> have dry skin that&#x27;s not sensitive or acne-prone.</li>
            <li> Has a little white tint, but you can use regular foundation over it or color based powder.  </li>
            <li> He skin stayed white as a ghost (due to lack of tan, not just zinc)</li>
            <li> I had a problem of itching with other big brand name sunscreen, but with Vanicream I had no problems.</li>
            <li> Even the so called \\&quot;allergen free for sensitive skin\\&quot; would give me a painful hives.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> so it takes some getting used to, but I&#x27;ve been using only this brand sunscreen for the last few years</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had one single sunburn since 2005.  </li>
            <li> As long as you are careful not to get it in your hair</li>
            <li> it just makes worse in hot and humid weather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to use &#x27;less&#x27; of it and rub it in, but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m using enough now to protect me from the sun?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only need to use it on my face, and use typical sport type sunscreen elsewhere.</li>
            <li> and I have tried using several kinds previously.</li>
            <li> the U-zone is very dry and senstive.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Most physical sun blocks look horrible and do not completely disappear...even a slight white film is completely visible on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It was VERY hard to rub in to my skin and also really greasy.</li>
            <li> I have dark skin and the sunscreen rubs in without leaving obvious white/silver film like other sunscreens do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If there is a still a little shine left, I do NOT use powder but oil blotting paper.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that it goes on kinda greasy and leaves your skin a little shiny.</li>
            <li> The ONLY bonus is that I didn&#x27;t get the white cast that usually happens with all my other brands.</li>
            <li> I tried to wash off with soap and washcloth, yet it is hard to completely remove.  </li>
            <li> It goes on a little thick, so you have to rub it in very well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it on a daily basis, however (going to work in the city, when exposure is brief), because it does feel a little heavy for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Many of the worst melanomas and skim damage are caused by UVA, although both UVA and UVB are very harmful.  </li>
            <li> I just happen to be a baby who tries to read ingredients.</li>
            <li> I took this to the Caribbean and it helped protect me well as I spent hours on the beach and in the ocean.</li>
            <li> There really is no in between</li>
            <li> If you are suffering from what you think can be PMLE, see your doctor and get tested and research as much as possible to understand the effects the sun can cause without adding to the mix harsh chemicals that are in almost all sun blocks.</li>
            <li> Users should know that the product is greasy, so apply it carefully and rub it in well.</li>
            <li> Vanicream is very thick and feels a little greasy at first, but sinks in well.</li>
            <li> My research has led me to believe--you must check for yourself--that when coated with alumina, dimethicone or other  coatings, the photoreactivty problem is reduced to minimal levess.  </li>
            <li> My research has led me to believe--you must check for yourself--that when coated with alumina, dimethicone or other  coatings, the photoreactivty problem is reduced to minimal levess.  </li>
            <li> Vanicream will leave a minimal white residue that usually disappears and is quite protective.</li>
            <li> Apply lightly as a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of this product go a LONG way.</li>
            <li> For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc.</li>
            <li> Vanicream 60 is one of them, and Soleo is the other.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want aluminum from deodorant or any other source.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want aluminum from deodorant or any other source.  </li>
            <li> After that I let it sit while I do other things</li>
            <li> because I don&#x27;t like how other sunscreens make my face sting or the smell of them.</li>
            <li> : this makes your face extremely shiny.</li>
            <li> BUT, it&#x27;s extremely greasy.  </li>
            <li> The doctor gave us some samples of an Aveeno product, which was difficult to find consistently, and he gave us a list of some other products as well, which included Vanicream.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find this sunscreen that greasy unlike other reviewers.</li>
            <li> Was easier to apply versus other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, I applied this sunscreen about 2 hours ago</li>
            <li> And I feel like I still got a little color and have extremly limited sun exposure and faithful about using sunblock.</li>
            <li> The reason I tried other products was because Vanicream was too thick and heavy for my acne prone, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I feel dirty and &#x27;icky&#x27; all day now, until I am able to shower it off.</li>
            <li> This product lists both as active ingreditents.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But as for the active ingredients repsonsible for blocking the sun and protecting you, that is what I found out</li>
            <li> But as for the active ingredients repsonsible for blocking the sun and protecting you, that is what I found out</li>
            <li> I have been using Vanicream 60 for several years, after spending years before that trying to find a non irritating sunscreen that did not turn my face completely white..  </li>
            <li> A small line down your index finger will cover your entire face.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I am really pale and have really sensitive skin (I get really bad sunburns).</li>
            <li> It does absorb a little bit, but not much.  </li>
            <li> I have done a very extensive search for a mineral sunblock in the past few years, after learning about the dangers of chemical sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Doctor told me my skin, especially my face of late is quite susceptible to the beginnings of skin cancer.  </li>
            <li> but this is how I put in on, which is similar to how I was told to put on thick night creams:  </li>
            <li> My son has sensitive skin, and has broken out with rashes almost immediately after using any sun-screen.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, and its white, but it stays on a squirmy baby playing in tidepools.</li>
            <li> This product has also allowed me to go down a shade (from nc10 to nc5</li>
            <li> I think it did make me break out slightly, and I found it extremely greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> Vanicream 30 and 35 have less zinc</li>
            <li> It goes on smelling like nothing, though a bit later, the faint metallic smell creeps in; no big deal.    </li>
            <li> wish they could make it less greasy.  </li>
            <li> The 30 was less greasy.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, though it was slightly greasy.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s how I tested it: About a month ago I went up to my friend&#x27;s house by the river and was out in the sun for about one and a half hours.</li>
            <li> Vanicream has a slightly oily feel when applying</li>
            <li> My young daughters break out in a painful red rash from EVERY other sunscreen on the market.  </li>
            <li> I put mineral foundation power with a brush hoping that will get my face look less oily, and the brush got oily and messy.</li>
            <li> Because They sent me wrong order, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> He was a little out there, but he proved it caused no irritation.    </li>
            <li> It has been hyped that due to their small size they absorb in to the lower layers of the skin and enter the bloodstream in toxic leves just like the chemical</li>
            <li> and I use it every day on my face--but again, it is still a little greasy to me.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> and I use it every day on my face--but again, it is still a little greasy to me.  </li>
            <li> It is a little greasy when you put it on</li>
            <li> It is a little labor intensive to use because of the consistency</li>
            <li> After contact with the skin, it seems to melt a little, making it easier to spread.</li>
            <li> Broke out in little water blisters, and no one could figure it out....</li>
            <li> Not a fun choice!    </li>
            <li> When I put it in on face, I just dust a little face powder over it once it&#x27;s set.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the little stuff.  </li>
            <li> The sunscreen doesn&#x27;t feel heavy but makes your face look a little greasy.</li>
            <li> It does sit a little heavy on the skin and it beads.</li>
            <li> Even then, I was VERY hesitant to try this one because I was so afraid that I would get a rash again</li>
            <li> I had quite a few pimples on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> A dermatologist recommended Vanicream a few years ago.</li>
            <li> The lotion does feel heavy on the skin when applied.  </li>
            <li> I have HEAVILY researched sunscreens for about 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Not for everyday use or under makeup.</li>
            <li> My face just looked wet and shiney, and after adding summertime perspiration to that, my face was totally icky.  </li>
            <li> I have to put it on everyday under my makeup and have had no problems, even with greasiness.</li>
            <li> It can be used as a moisturizer under makeup (wait a few minutes for it to &#x27;set&#x27; before applying makeup).  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy, but you can tell you have it</li>
            <li> Way to heavy to use under makeup</li>
            <li> to the study, as reported by Green Med Info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you money on the SPF 50+.</li>
            <li> This is a really heavy duty sunscreen for sports or the beach.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Neutrogena, Aveno, and other hypo-allergenic sunscreens, but sadly I&#x27;d break out into rashes a few hours later.</li>
            <li> am looking for something else that is a bit less shiny!</li>
            <li> Additionally, it doesn&#x27;t have that nasty coconut fragrance that&#x27;s in most other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am one of those people who is either pale or burned.</li>
            <li> It does leave you feeling a little slick for a bit</li>
            <li> (he used to carry the bottle around in the office, but I prefer a little discretion!</li>
            <li> yes I am very pale) as I wear this everyday</li>
            <li> I found that it absorbs a little quicker and isn&#x27;t as thick.</li>
            <li> Christa&#x27;s eczema isn&#x27;t really bad, but her skin tends to be a little drier than normal.  </li>
            <li> BUT... if you think you&#x27;ll hate having very white looking skin or perspiring little white beads, then you might not like this.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin a tad whitish, but not overwhelmingly so.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it and it has been difficult to find this strength in local stores.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> I recommended this to a friend with dermological rosecea and although it does not seem greasy at all to me the small amount of grease in it caused her face to breakout, she had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I use it for my face, too and usually put in on and wait about 10 minutes before I put on a BB tinted cream.  </li>
            <li> I place a small amount on my eyes and rubbed it in.  </li>
            <li> It smells awful, it is extremely drying and it is very gritty and chalky, leaving a thick white residue that looks ridiculous, like white face paint.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very heavy and greasy to boot.</li>
            <li> All will have, immediately or a bit later, at least a faint metallic smell; you can&#x27;t get away from that.    </li>
            <li> There was a bit of whiteness that was left on the baby&#x27;s face in particular, but nothing terrible.   </li>
            <li> All are hard to get off.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s greasy and hard to put on b/c</li>
            <li> a bit hard to apply.</li>
            <li> says:&lt;br /&gt;Regarding how hard it is to wash this product off.</li>
            <li> I have seen some negative reviews about the product being oily.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this sunscreen from this vendor, but I wanted to at least put in my review.  </li>
            <li> We reapply at least 2-3 times a day when we are out in the sun and swimming for 7-8hours</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product off and on for at least 4 years.</li>
            <li> And, according to our pediatrician, eczema is common side-effect that comes along with it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so thick that it takes a bit to rub in.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and does go on greasy.  </li>
            <li> having the grease come through my base and powder is really saying something.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is just too thick.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so thick.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is thick and can feel greasy if you don&#x27;t rub it in well, but I use this on my face because of the consistency - does not melt and run into my eyes when I get hot/sweaty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li> Every summer I would always anticipate my skin to break out in hives from being out in the sun and using other sun products that were irritating and didn&#x27;t work and would wear a sun hat too!   </li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my granddaughter&#x27;s dermatologist for use on her skin instead of the usual sunscreen products that made her eczema much worse.</li>
            <li> It makes him very slick, though.</li>
            <li> Imagine having no stains on your black bathing suit!!!</li>
            <li> The sticker price is a bit shocking compared to buying other sunscreens, but a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> It was not a good look.  </li>
            <li> This is very thick and oily.  </li>
            <li> Sunscreens are worse than processed foods (which I never consume) since there is no nutritional guide for sunscreens.</li>
            <li> If it is an all over sunscreen it is not water resistance, so I am not happy with it.</li>
            <li> The replacement product makes my face whiter and is quite irritating to my face.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the new product, for both the manufacturer and me.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested this product for protection against the horrible sun in New Mexico.  </li>
            <li> so those are worthless, unless if you want to go by what Consumer Report recommends which rates protection without any consideration for ingredients in the sunscreen then in that case, I can get roofing tar for less money, so we might as well consider that...</li>
            <li> Cosmetically, mineral blockers leave horrible white coating on the skin.  </li>
            <li> (White t-shirts get an especially bad orange ring around the collar)  </li>
            <li> writing this review so that others can be informed -- it upsets me that my dermatologist recommended Vanicream and that I used if for a week on a vulnerable rash before I read about the danger of this product.</li>
            <li> Every time I go out in the sun, I break out in a terrible itchy red rash, and I&#x27;ve never found a sunscreen that helps at all...until now.</li>
            <li> Suddenly I remembered that it tasted terrible from the toothpaste incident.  </li>
            <li> if it will make any difference to my skin but applying it very irritating.</li>
            <li> No more annoying rashes from sunblock or sunscreen allergies!</li>
            <li> It is greasy, but not in an unpleasant way.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any annoying smells and doesn&#x27;t leave me looking ashen.</li>
            <li> The bad news:  not something you&#x27;d want to wear anywhere but gardening, exercising outdoors or maybe to the beach.</li>
            <li> Just about every one I tried looked completely dreadful once applied, and some smelled weird, too.</li>
            <li> However, I was quite disappointed with the product in that</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed with the sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could return it. :(</li>
            <li> Too greasy for my oily skin :(</li>
            <li> How stupid, I am going in the ocean, in salt water under the sun.</li>
            <li> So stupid since a chemical is a chemical regardless,&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> tried putting makeup base over what I applied on my face and then powdering my face, the oil came through almost immediately.  </li>

            <li> I am horribly allergic to sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Im allergic to the chemical/cosmetic sunscreens which caused a terrible reaction.</li>
            <li> What you get I vanicream SPF 50+ which is disgusting</li>
            <li> I have not thoroughly tested its sun-protection, but it just feels awful when it is on.</li>
            <li> No, I concluded; the taste was terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is very thick and oily.  It seems to protect from sun and most likely stays on well when/after swimming.  I tried to wash off with soap and washcloth, yet it is hard to completely remove.  I feel like I still have a film on my face after scrubbing.  This being said, it probably does a good job protecting.  I will continue using until gone, but may look for another lighter weight option.</li>
            <li> Sunscreens are worse than processed foods (which I never consume) since there is no nutritional guide for sunscreens. Producers write whatever they want and it really consumes time to read up and compare facts. Unless you happen to be a marathon swimmer who is going to be soaked for hour and hours in the oceans&#x27; salty water without any shade, which Vaseline will act as the best sealer there is, then for a surfer like me, usually higher organic ingredients are the best. What I put on my skin is the same as consuming it through my skin since it is absorbed by my skin. I don&#x27;t intend to have the sunscreen for snack but it is good to know that there are fewer chemicals in the sunscreen. Usually those SPFs will not be over 30 for any safe sunscreen ingredients and it will be for BABYs. I just happen to be a baby who tries to read ingredients. I wear a rash guard when surfing which covers my upper body so I am protected all the time. What worries me is my face. For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc. that come with exposure to the sun. I try different brands all the time and look for the following pointers;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I avoid water proof or water resistant. How stupid, I am going in the ocean, in salt water under the sun. Even if I put a deck coating or a roof on my skin, it will not last. Anyone looking for those wordings should avoid water,&lt;br /&gt;2. Natural sunscreens with FEWER chemicals. Manufacturers like to spin the facts and challenge our knowledge and intelligence by claiming it as WITHOUT any harsh chemical or chemical FREE or without chemical ABSORBERS. So stupid since a chemical is a chemical regardless,&lt;br /&gt;3. FRAGRANCE FREE; It must spell out on the face of the container. Majority have fragrance but baby sunscreens usually do not. After all, I am going in the ocean not on a date. Why do I need fragrance regardless, and this is from an athlete where I consume fresh garlic napping in vinegar every single day,&lt;br /&gt;4. EXPIRATION DATE; I never leave the sunscreen container in the sun, purchase new sunscreen all the time so I never worry about few months old, I always apply 30 minutes before the first exposure to the sun&lt;br /&gt;5. BROAD SPECTRUM; It must spell out on the face of the container,&lt;br /&gt;6. PABA free; It must spell out on the face of the container,&lt;br /&gt;7. I avoid OXYBENZONE which apparently disrupts human hormonal system,&lt;br /&gt;8. I avoid vitamin A (retinyl palmitate) which seems to boost skin cancer risk,&lt;br /&gt;9. I Look for ACTIVE INGREDIENTS of more zinc less titanium the best-rated mineral sun blocks. Majority have many different ingredients than zinc and titanium as ACTIVE INGREDIENTS,&lt;br /&gt;10. Unscented, Baby Formula, and must have the blessing of the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s annual Sunscreen Guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of chemicals... Not organic... Sunscreen needs to protect and needs to protect for a reasonable price. Vanicream 60+ offers Titanium Dioxide (7.5%), Zinc Oxide 7.5%... Baby Blue Lizard offers Titanium Dioxide 5% and Zinc Oxide 10%. I need more zinc baby not Titanium dioxide and Blue Lizard offers more zinc, less titanium for half the cost... Vanicream 30 and 35 have less zinc so those are worthless, unless if you want to go by what Consumer Report recommends which rates protection without any consideration for ingredients in the sunscreen then in that case, I can get roofing tar for less money, so we might as well consider that... Zinc is the solution, more zinc for less money with organic ingredients that are not carcinogen or harmful to me... That is why Badger is better than most... Blue Lizard 30 is not as good of ingredients as Badger but still better than Vanicream 60+. [[ASIN:B00BSIMBR8 Badger SPF 30 All Natural Baby Sunscreen Lotion 4oz]] This Badger is one of the best that I have ever used since it is 100% certified Natural, 87% certified organic and a whopping 12% zinc oxide that is easy toapply, rubs in quick, not greasy, offers me protection and is priced reasonably per ounce. The only draw back is that I see the whiteness on my skin. Regardless this is one of the best for my skin and surfing, one of the champs alright. Bravo Badger.apply, rubs in quick, not greasy, offers me protection and is priced reasonably per ounce. The only draw back is that I see the whiteness on my skin.

            <li> I still have two years left for melanoma.  This sunscreen gives me great protection.  It protected my skin even in South Carolina in June.  I also have very sensitive skin and have no reaction to this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t trigger my allergies, but I wish it didn&#x27;t make my face so white</li>
            <li> I have done a very extensive search for a mineral sunblock in the past few years, after learning about the dangers of chemical sunscreens. Just about every one I tried looked completely dreadful once applied, and some smelled weird, too. All are hard to get off. All will have, immediately or a bit later, at least a faint metallic smell; you can&#x27;t get away from that.    The Vanicream sunblock, however, goes on essentially clear, even before rubbing in. It&#x27;s not thick or greasy, though it is slightly tacky to the touch. It goes on smelling like nothing, though a bit later, the faint metallic smell creeps in; no big deal.    According to the Environmental Working Group, Vanicream does not use nano-scale ingredients. I don&#x27;t know how they do it, because this product looks WAY better on my face than anything else I tried.    The 30 SPF is my daily sunblock now, and I also have a tube of the SPF 60, for longer days in the sun. The 60 is just like the 30, except that it feels a tad firmer on the face.    In the course of this project, I&#x27;ve also learned how to clean off a mineral sunblock. The packages sometimes say to rinse with water to remove. This does nothing. Soap and water works decently, but this is what I do: slather my face with lotion, wipe it off with cotton balls, and repeat. (That is, do what you would do to remove makeup.) It&#x27;s also good to exfoliate regularly, because these products will tend to highlight any skin irregularities or blocked pores.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Vanicream sunscreen as well as moisturizing cream for several years and have been very happy. Both my children have dry skin issues and this was the only product that helped.</li>
            <li> Our dermatologist highly recommended this product for use on your body (except facial area) as he uses it himself.&lt;br /&gt;We have used it before several hikes and noticed that it works for several hours.  He also recommended that it be reapplied if you sweat profusely.  Having had several small skin cnacers, I believe that any product that prevents them from occuring is worth buying.</li>
            <li> I have a 7 month old with super sensitive skin. Ended up at the dermatologist because it was beyond the pediatrician&#x27;s knowledge. This was the sunscreen that she recommended to us. It wasn&#x27;t available in any stores nearby. The sticker price is a bit shocking compared to buying other sunscreens, but a little goes a very long way. The price on Amazon was actually cheaper than from the manufacturer. Additionally, it doesn&#x27;t contain fragrance which is irritating to many with sensitive skin.  I have been able to use the product already a few times. It went on well. There was a bit of whiteness that was left on the baby&#x27;s face in particular, but nothing terrible.   So far very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I just tried Vanicream Sunscreen for Sensitive Skin Spf 60 and found that it worked very well.  I have been struggling to find a sunscreen that I can use because I am allergic to almost every type of sunscreen. Since this sunscreen has zinc oxide and titanium dioxide rather than traditional sunscreen chemicals, I&#x27;m not allergic to it.  The sunscreen goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t turn you white.  Additionally, it doesn&#x27;t have that nasty coconut fragrance that&#x27;s in most other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> This sunblock is very oily.  When I put it on my face it looks like I put pure oil on it.  However, the sunblock works if you don&#x27;t mind the shine.  I only use it on the beach.  I use Elta MD oil-free when I am out in civilization.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my order.  Delivery was prompt; I will order again from this seller.</li>
            <li> The works very well as described but it is way too greasy, so I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  It goes on well, doesn&#x27;t clog my poors and has provided me and my three young girls with ultimate sun protection!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really satisfied with this sunscreen. My facial skin is really photosensitive. Every summer I would always anticipate my skin to break out in hives from being out in the sun and using other sun products that were irritating and didn&#x27;t work and would wear a sun hat too!   I spent the week at the beach and my skin has been great.  I don&#x27;t have to hide my face after being attacked by the sun.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin type that the T-zone is prone to be oily and sometimes breakout and the U-zone is very dry and senstive. Ordering this item, I tried finding reviews of it from several different websites. Most of them said the same thing that is too greasy. Well, I hegitated purchasing it for that reason. I got it anyway. \\&quot; Yes!!! it is greasy as much as I want to buy another one\\&quot; I can&#x27;t even imagine going out with applying on it. I think it may be better in winter. But I don&#x27;t recommend it in summer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of it&#x27;s high spot on the list of best sunscreens by EWG and because of all the rave reviews on this website.  However, I was quite disappointed with the product in that it&#x27;s so thick that it takes a bit to rub in.  Also, every time I use it I break out.  After about a week of using it daily (putting it on in the morning before applying make up) I had quite a few pimples on my face and neck.  I never usually break out.  So for that reason I will keep searching!</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen that I don&#x27;t have allergic reactions to.  I&#x27;ve tried Neutrogena, Aveno, and other hypo-allergenic sunscreens, but sadly I&#x27;d break out into rashes a few hours later. A dermatologist recommended Vanicream a few years ago. He even demonstrated how gentle it was by putting it in his eye!  He was a little out there, but he proved it caused no irritation.    It has a light scent and doesn&#x27;t leave white streaks on your skin.  It&#x27;s a little greasy at first, but that goes away as you work it into your skin and as it dries.    If it weren&#x27;t for this product, I&#x27;d probably still be wearing long sleeves and oversized hats in the summer time.</li>
            <li> This product provides the best protection I have ever gotten from a sunscreen.  It is long lasting and stays on even after a dip in the pool after golf.  My sensitive skin (eczema) has not had any adverse reaction to its ingredients.  Although it is a little greasy, the terrific protection is worth it.</li>
            <li> one of my daughters has the most sensitive skin. Breaks out in hives and rashes from all sunscreens. Even all the ones that say they are for sensitive skin, &amp; hypo allergenic etc. So far in her five years, we have found only two brands that don&#x27;t cause her a reaction. Vanicream 60 is one of them, and Soleo is the other. The Vanicream is a much better value, at about 1/2 the price of the Soleo. We are very happy to have found this product.</li>
            <li> I saw this name in a magazine that plastic surgeons use on chemical peel patients.  Since I am sensitive to smells in sunscreens I thought I would try it.  It works great.  Has a little white tint, but you can use regular foundation over it or color based powder.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful, but this product does not, in fact, vanish! It does fade to a deathly gray but that&#x27;s as good as it gets, and it&#x27;s very heavy and greasy to boot. Maybe I&#x27;m asking too much - a lightweight, non-greasy, invisible hypoallergenic sunscreen! This one&#x27;s hypoallergenic, and that&#x27;s great, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist.  I use it daily under my makeup-- it is a little heavy, but I like that moisture-sealing aspect, and it makes the makeup apply smoothly.  I use it only on my face and hands and I think it does a good job of keeping the sun  damage in check.  One tube lasts me about 4 months.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist recommended product, great even for highly sensitive skin.  Quick delivery, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Works well but tends to stain especially neck collar of shirts.  I&#x27;ve switched to NOAd Suncreen.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed with the sunscreen.  I am a blonde with fair skin and break out with red bumps when exposed to the sun too long, even when using sunsreen.  I was hoping that Vanicream sunscreen would solve the problem, but it did not; I broke out just as I always do.  The lotion does feel heavy on the skin when applied.  One important factor for me in deciding to use this product again is the fact that it DOES NOT carry any harmful chemicals and it is odor free.</li>
            <li> I live at a high altitude and have lupus, so I need serious sun protection that is suitable for sensitive skin.  I cover up pretty well, but use this on exposed areas other than my face.  So far, it has protected me completely without any allergic reactions, and I appreciate that it does not leave a white cast to my skin or white smudges on my  clothes (which I did find with the sensitive-skin physical barrier sunscreen made by Neutrogena).  It is greasy, but not in an unpleasant way. It is way too shiny and sticky for the face, however.  For face I recommend [[ASIN:B000TGUP7S Anthelios XL sunblock - SPF 60 - 3oz - with Mexoryl]] or [[ASIN:B000GG85NW Fallene - Total Block SPF 60 Tinted Oil-Free Cover-Up 2 Fl. oz. / 59 ml]].</li>
            <li> My young daughters break out in a painful red rash from EVERY other sunscreen on the market.  I have even tried the ones that claim \\&quot;pure and free Baby\\&quot;.  THIS PRODUCT is the only product I will use.  They never have a reaction from Vanicream and we used it in the pool and in 100 degree weather.  No sunburn and no rashes!  I have seen some negative reviews about the product being oily.  As long as you are careful not to get it in your hair it&#x27;s great.  I like it because it is not drying to the skin.  5 stars from me !</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen!  Dermatologist recommended this product and I could only find it on line.  Love the fact that it is fairly pure without a lot of additives.  It certainly does the job and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy like a lot of sun screen products.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  It applies well and does quickly absorb into the skin unlike other products with zinc oxide.  I wear this sunscreen all the time and have noticed not only the difference in my confidence about being out in the sun, but the way my skin looks and feels.  I am so happy to have discovered this product!  The name however, makes me laugh because it sounds like a [...] cream rather than a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin a tad whitish, but not overwhelmingly so. This is still my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> First of all, I am really pale and have really sensitive skin (I get really bad sunburns). After searching more than 8 years for a sunscreen I am not allergic to, I finally found it! I am photoallergic to all kinds of sunscreens I tried so far, from Banana Boat to Neutrogena and Shiseido. I really like this product. It doesn&#x27;t leave a oily feel and is fragrance free. As a matter of fact, it doesn&#x27;t feel like I am wearing sunscreen at all. Although it is on the pricey side, I think it&#x27;s worth it. Will repurchase after finishing my tube &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have HEAVILY researched sunscreens for about 6 months.  Here are my concerns and some some facts I have learned.  I have no affiliation with any company.  I am not a scientist.  I have a newborn on the way and my wife and I live in a very hot area and we both are light skinned, and I am anal and analytical to a fault.  take from this what you will.&lt;br /&gt;1.  Harmful cancer-causing sunlight consists of UVA and UVB rays.  But UVB are the rays that cause a tan.  If you are not burning, you can still be getting pelted by UVA rays and not even know it--  Ask any dermatologist--Many people get cancer on their hands and arms even though they think they are always covering up, but in fact when driving for decades, UVA is damanging their skin badly--UVA can penetrate glass--&lt;br /&gt;2.  \\&quot;SPF\\&quot; protection refers only to UVB protection.  Many of the worst melanomas and skim damage are caused by UVA, although both UVA and UVB are very harmful.  So when you see \\&quot;SPF\\&quot; 60 or 100 or whatever, you may very well be receiving limited coverage and protection.&lt;br /&gt;1.  Zinc Oxide is the only non-chemical substance that can effectively block close to 100% of the UVA harmful rays, and blocks most of the UVB rays.  Titanium Dioxide is the only non-toxic substance that can effectively block 100% of UVB rays, and most of the UVA rays.  These substances are referred to as \\&quot;mineral\\&quot; sunblockers.&lt;br /&gt;2. Even a mineral (non-chemical product) that does not contain some combination of both can be excellent, but not provide 100% coverage. (unless you are applying so much Zinc Oxide white layers \\&quot;like you see surfers wearing on their nose\\&quot; that the physical barrier alone will take care of almost all UVA and UVB.  Some formulations use one or the other, but again, ideally you want both for full sprecturm coverage.  This product lists both as active ingreditents.&lt;br /&gt;3.  When you see \\&quot;full UVA and UVB spectrum coverage\\&quot; on any product tube it may well mean nothing.  It may mean that 99% of UVB is covered, and only 1% of UVA, but they can still call it \\&quot;full spreturm.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Chemical-based sunscreens can also block 100% of UVA and UVB.  Most every product you will find in stores iss based on chemical screens.  The knock on these products is that they are said to have been proven to readily absorb into the deepest layers of the skin, where the toxins are released into the blood in large amounts, and need reapplication much more than chemical blockers.  Most of these chemicals have also--according to my research--but you must determine this for yourself-- been proven very clearly to cause cancer in lab animals.  Many specultate that this fact, along with the fact that these products lose their effectiveness very quickly and produce free radicals in the skin, and that those folks using high SPF products without UVA protection tend to stay in the sun longer, may be why skin cancer rates are higher in those using suncsreens than not using them.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Cosmetically, mineral blockers leave horrible white coating on the skin.  Chemical screens do not. That is why chemical screens are so popular.  Attemps by companies selling mineral blockers to reduce the \\&quot;ghost\\&quot; effect have led to the formulation of \\&quot;nanonized\\&quot; and \\&quot;micronized\\&quot; formulations, with very small particles that spread more easily that minimize dramatically the whiteness of the mineral blockers.  Nano particles are 100 times smaller than micronized, which are much, much smaller than normal mineral blocker particles.&lt;br /&gt;6.  There has been a lot of hpye over the danger of nano/micro particles in lotions and products. It has been hyped that due to their small size they absorb in to the lower layers of the skin and enter the bloodstream in toxic leves just like the chemical screens.&lt;br /&gt;7.  My research--again, ad nauseum--you must confirm this for yourself--shows me that there has never been any credible study to prove these particles absorb into the deep layers of the skin.  Recent studies, in my opinion,have proven conclusively otherwise.  As well, I believe the FDA has recently de-bunked the \\&quot;nano/micro myth.\\&quot;  Check to confirm I am on the right track.  Most of the hype seems to come from overzealous \\&quot;green\\&quot; sites who have not fully done their research or are mis-interpreting true studies, or citing non-peer-reviewed, double blind solid studies. Check with your dermatologist.  Many probably mean well, but seem to be using incorrect information.  From what I understand, breathing in titanium dioxide dust into  your lungs in huge quantities would be a problem, but from a sunscreen, no.&lt;br /&gt;8.  The next concern I have is that nano and micro particles, if uncoated, have higher \\&quot;photoreactivity\\&quot; which causes them to release free radicals in the skin when exposed to UV light, thereby being cancerous.  This is another reason people think that chemical and even nano/micro screens can lead to even more cancers in sunscreen users.&lt;br /&gt;9.  My research has led me to believe--you must check for yourself--that when coated with alumina, dimethicone or other  coatings, the photoreactivty problem is reduced to minimal levess.  Also, when the product itself has many anti-oxidents to offset the free-radicals themselves, the oxidation problem appears to be neutralized.  Again, do the research yourself.  Some products coat their screens, some do not.  I have been told by a company rep that Vanicream coasts theirs very effectively.  I would call them to confirm.&lt;br /&gt;10.  My next issue is with alumina.  I don&#x27;t want aluminum from deodorant or any other source.  Vanicreme has it listed as the first ingredietnt.  I have fouund out that somme sunscreens--including Vanicreme, are considered pharmaceuticals so they must list their ingredients in alphabetical order, not in descending order of concentration. Check with the company, but it is my understanding that the amount of alumina in this product is the least amount of any other ingredient, and on application is less than we probably get in our water or food--again--check to make sure yourself.  I think their new products coming out have no alumina.  Check with the company.&lt;br /&gt;11.  I have not checked into the other ingredients in this product, many sound strange to me, so you might want to check those.  But as for the active ingredients repsonsible for blocking the sun and protecting you, that is what I found out and i am more comforatble with this product than any I have seen or found.&lt;br /&gt;12.  I find it to be a bit greasy, but overall after rubbing it in thoroughly, after a while it blends in pretty well and I use it every day on my face--but again, it is still a little greasy to me.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, after checking numerous products, that vanicreme is the safest for me to use, and I like the cosmetic features of the product. more than the numerous products I have tried.  You must research the product thoroughly or you may be doing more harm than good from some of these products.ise.

            <li> I am horribly allergic to sunscreens. Even the so called \\&quot;allergen free for sensitive skin\\&quot; would give me a painful hives. I tried vanicream and it worked! No reaction! I love this product and its the only one I found that works. Im glad to be able to spend time in the sun again! If you are like me and break out in hives with regular products give this one a shot!</li>
            <li> I live in South Florida and am constantly in search of a good sunblock.  I think Vanicream is excellent.  It is a little greasy when you put it on but my main objective is the protection it gives me.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have very sensitive skin.  Eucerin burns my skin.  Cervae with sunscreen burns my face. This product did not burn my skin but it is very greasy.  Not for everyday use or under makeup. I put it on and walked into the kitchen. The first thing my husband said was \\&quot;your face looks greasy\\&quot;.  I tried to put makeup powder over it but my face looked oily with makeup.</li>
            <li> We like this product-the greasiness gets absorbed after a few minutes. And it spreads better than the Sport version.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen. Does not burn eyes or irritate skin, stays on while swimming, and it does the job all day. Can be used on children or others with sensitive skin. Goes on white but just rub it in and it becomes invisible. Goodbye, chemical sunscreens!</li>
            <li> I am the type of person who NEVER writes a review but for this product I must! I have the most sensitive skin and am allergic to most anything! (shaving cream, soaps, basically anything scented natural or otherwise). This product is unscented which is very important to me. I must mention to  those who do like scented products I suggest you don&#x27;t apply them to your face since products that contain a fragrance as even natural fragrances will age your skin. This product sinks into my skin within a few minutes and does not affect my makeup, if anything it makes it look better. This product has also allowed me to go down a shade (from nc10 to nc5 yes I am very pale) as I wear this everyday which some may not like however I do. If you don&#x27;t want to get lighter I suggest getting one with a lower spf or wearing this only in the summertime or when outside for long periods. If you have sensitive skin like me this is a must have!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and was happy to find no stinging sensation or reaction from this sunscreen. I think it did make me break out slightly, and I found it extremely greasy and heavy. I would never wear it for any kind of activity where I wanted to look nice.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen was recommended by a friend who lives in Hawaii. It&#x27;s what she uses on her 3yr old daughter. I like to use good sunscreen and wanted a recommendation for one without a lot of harmful ingredients. I took this to the Caribbean and it helped protect me well as I spent hours on the beach and in the ocean. I recommended it to a friend and she loves it too. Just remember to reapply every so often. It&#x27;s a little thicker than the average sunblock but rubs into the skin easily and well. It offers very good blockage of the sun.</li>
            <li> I had been buying the 30 Spf sunscreen but the price had increased quite a bit and the 60 was cheaper so I ordered it. It is okay, not as thick as the 30 but it is satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am a woman of color.  Most physical sun blocks look horrible and do not completely disappear...even a slight white film is completely visible on my skin.  I stumbled upon Vanicream at a non-chain pharmacy and the pharmacist said it was good and let me try it on my skin.  It did not leave a white film and so I got it.  Have been using it for about 2 years now.  It is thick and does go on greasy.  It is a little labor intensive to use because of the consistency but this is how I put in on, which is similar to how I was told to put on thick night creams:  I rub it between my hands and \\&quot;pat\\&quot; it all over my face.  After contact with the skin, it seems to melt a little, making it easier to spread. You do need to spread it so it rubs in and not just wait for it to absorb. As another review noted, because it is gentle, it does not irritate my eyes and so I can use it under my eyes for coverage, no problem. After that I let it sit while I do other things (brush my teeth, whatever) and then put on my makeup. It is particularly good if you use a stick foundation which I stopped using for awhile because it was a little too dry/matte, but over the SS, provides a nice \\&quot;tinted moisturizer\\&quot; type finish.  If there is a still a little shine left, I do NOT use powder but oil blotting paper.  This, for me, seems to work pretty well and my face feels soft and protected all day.  I LOVE it in the winter; less so in the summer but keep coming back to it year-round because I don&#x27;t like how other sunscreens make my face sting or the smell of them.</li>
            <li> For people who have sensitive skin or just want a physical sunscreen instead of chemical, this is perfect. Just beware: this makes your face extremely shiny. The sunscreen doesn&#x27;t feel heavy but makes your face look a little greasy. I have combo skin and live in a humid place so this may be better for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I recently had surgery on a scar and was told by my Doctor to use a strong sunscreen to protect it. This sunscreen was recomended as being gentle to healing skin that is also tender and sensitive. It works great and provides good sun protection.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen because it was highly rated for being one of the healthiest sunscreens out there. I care more about protecting my very fair and sensitive skin than I do about vanity so I will use it. BUT... if you think you&#x27;ll hate having very white looking skin or perspiring little white beads, then you might not like this. It does sit a little heavy on the skin and it beads. Aside from that I&#x27;m using it because I know I&#x27;m getting good, safe coverage. [...]</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested this product for protection against the horrible sun in New Mexico.  It has worked very well and is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I need this because I walk my dog four times a day, but it is very greasy.  I&#x27;m trying to use &#x27;less&#x27; of it and rub it in, but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m using enough now to protect me from the sun?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel greasy/tacky all day.  My husband doesn&#x27;t want to kiss my neck (9 hours after application!) because he says the stuff is gross.  So, it lasts, but it&#x27;s greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried putting makeup base over what I applied on my face and then powdering my face, the oil came through almost immediately.  It seemed like it got &#x27;greasier&#x27; as the minutes clicked by?!?  (I have DRY facial skin, so having the grease come through my base and powder is really saying something.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they could make it less greasy.  I feel dirty and &#x27;icky&#x27; all day now, until I am able to shower it off.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen. I had read about it online at another website that tests the strength and trustworthiness of sunscreen and this was rated very high.</li>
            <li> Because They sent me wrong order, I have very sensitive skin and I ordered S p f 60 for sensitive skin but they sent me 50 plus not for Sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Is product is FABULOUS, FABULOUS.  Vanicream, please bring it back to market.  The SPF 50 cannot hold a candle to this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was given samples of this sunscreen by my dermatologist to use before and after a laser-like procedure that caused my face to be super sensitive. I liked it a lot, was very gentle, unlike the better known national brand sunscreens for the face that I tried when I ran out of Vanicream. Having read about how good zinc oxide based sunscreens are for you, I bought more and decided to use it on my neck, arms and legs while playing golf last week. I guess due to the perspiration, it ran onto my clothes and I have not been able to get it out after 2 washings. You also have to wash well with soap and water to get it off your skin. This is not to knock the product - it is outstanding.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 4 years. It is wonderful for the face. Goes on easily and protects for hours. I notice no sun penetration when I use it. It does not cake or sting.</li>
            <li> After having several skin cancers removed, I have become very hyper vigilant about wearing sunscreen.  My dermatologist recommended this, and it works just as she said it would. I have been very pleased. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that it goes on kinda greasy and leaves your skin a little shiny.</li>
            <li> This is THE only product I&#x27;ve found that does not irritate my sensitive skin and offers the protection I need because of photosensitivity.  My dermatologist recommended it and it has been difficult to find this strength in local stores.  I am VERY happy and plan to order a tube every summer for me and my daughter.</li>
            <li> Sing hallelujah! Over the past three years I&#x27;ve gradually become sensitized not only to chemical sunscreens but also to creams containing only physical sunblocks as active ingredients (Neutrogena Baby Free and Clear, California Baby Super Sensitive, Eucerin for Sensitive Skin). I was at my wit&#x27;s end and Vanicream was the last thing I could think of to try. It doesn&#x27;t sting and burn my face! I am so relieved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An extra plus is that, like other reviewers mentioned, it doesn&#x27;t sting eyes, so I can rub it right up to my lower lashline and put it on my eyelids if I so desire. I also really like that it doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast. It leaves a very shiny surface behind, that&#x27;s true, but shiny is much easier to cover than white! I&#x27;ve found loose powder to do an excellent job of covering it up and creating a nice, longlasting, dewy and even look. I use Coty Air Spun but probably any decent loose powder would do; swirl it on with a kabuki brush. My skin has stayed fairly matte for up to four hours with one application of powder; it really clings to the film the sunscreen leaves behind.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen was recommended by my dermatologist. I use it on myself as well as my kids and it works really well. It is a physical blocker as well as a chemical blocker and does a good job of stopping both UVA and UVB rays without many of the harmful chemicals that are in several other brands. My only complaint is that it is a little greasy - but it is still much better than many others we&#x27;ve tried and does absorb well for the most part.</li>
            <li> My son has sensitive skin, and has broken out with rashes almost immediately after using any sun-screen.  We&#x27;ve used this product for over 3 years, and the current price we paid was great.</li>
            <li> I have been allergic to sunscreen (and therefore haven&#x27;t worn any) since I was twelve years old.  Can&#x27;t even use makeup, chapstick, etc with it in it.  Broke out in little water blisters, and no one could figure it out....so I&#x27;ve just gone without.  Nearly 18 years later, a dermatologist gave me some samples of the Vanicream Sunscreen for Sensitive skin.  Eureka!  I have never written a review on Amazon, but I have to say this product is amazing for me and hopefully for anyone with a similar issue.  I recently spent 4 hours on boat, applied the sunscreen only once (spf 60), and didn&#x27;t burn, nor did I have a reaction!  This was the true test! I would never have been able to enjoy an event like that in a bathing suit without worrying about getting burnt, and it&#x27;s a good thing because I was in a wedding 2 days later!</li>
            <li> My daughter has had allergic reactions to the numerous sunscreens I have tried from drugstores/Wal-Mart but this is one that she finally did not have an allergic reaction with.  What a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> Hi.  I guess that this sunscreen works well, but it is SO GREASY that I can&#x27;t use the stuff.  I read the reviews of this product and just figured \\&quot;Oh, how GREASY can it possibly be\\&quot;?  One person said, \\&quot;Oh, you can just put powder over it if you want a matt look\\&quot; in their reviews.  I tried that, and my face was now GREASY with powder stuck to it.  It was not a good look.  This sunscreen just NEVER seemed to be absorbed by my skin after \\&quot;Rubbing it in\\&quot;.  It never rubbed in.  My face just looked wet and shiney, and after adding summertime perspiration to that, my face was totally icky.  I guess that I can use it on my arms, but for my face, it just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and it works perfectly for my Rosacea!</li>
            <li> I bought two of sunscreen. The product is very good. My mother had skin cancer and she had radiation twice. I wanted to buy her a good quality product, no chemicals. I used it first on my skin, and I really liked it. My mom liked it too. I&#x27;m ready to buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried vanicream and I will definitely be ordering it again.  It is not very greasy like many other face sunblocks and it lasts for several hours.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost all of the readily-available, over-the-counter sunscreens for sensitive skins.  They seem to protect the skin okay but the chemicals in them cause my face to become embarrassingly red.  Vanicream protects without causing my face to flush. My dermatologist recommends it and has it available for purchase at her office but I decided to buy from Amazon, get free shipping and save 25% per tube.</li>
            <li> I suffer from melasma and this sunscreen was advised by my doctor. I don&#x27;t know yet if it will make any difference to my skin but applying it very irritating. This is just too thick. it just makes worse in hot and humid weather. I will like cream with zinc oxide in it but easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Works for me.  I am a person at risk for skin issues, plus the sunscreens I buy at the store always run into my eyes and sting.  This product does not do that.  Also it lasts for hours.  My dermatologist is pleased, and so am I.  I only need to use it on my face, and use typical sport type sunscreen elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Do not buy Vanicream SPF 60 from this seller through Amazon, or you will get Vanicream SPF 50. Along with this you will have to make calls to rectify this, and have to go through the process of returning the product with no offers to compensate you for your hassles associated with the transaction. If you are okay with the product that they send you (Vanicream SPF 50) the price you paid extra for the discontinued SPF 60 is a lot more than what the SPF 50 product is sold for. I hope Amazon and DermStore can fox this problem before others have to go through what I am having to clean up.</li>
            <li> About 4 years ago, I started breaking out in a rash after using sunscreen and going outside. I tried several formulations for sensitive skin, then finally gave up. Summer meant a couple of burns early in the season before I was tanned enough to go out without harm. Why go? Kids! I couldn&#x27;t deny them trips to the pool just because I had to choose between a rash or mild burn. Not a fun choice!    I just found this via  recommendation from a friend with a million food allergies. I tested it and expected the same old rash. But I didn&#x27;t break out. I&#x27;m now using it all over and am protected from burns. This means a lot to me and my kids!     Yes, it&#x27;s thick and greasy. It&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist following basal cell MOHs surgery.  I have very sensitive skin and this sunscreen is the perfect fit!</li>
            <li> Bought because of the great reputation but thought the 60 spf was really greasy. The 30 was less greasy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this sunscreen from this vendor, but I wanted to at least put in my review.  I have PMLE, since I was about 13 yrs old (I&#x27;m 35 now).  I never knew what the problem was, and by the time I got to the dermatologist, the rash healed.  But every summer, I knew that I would just have to suck it up, and deal with 4-7 days of itchy, burning, tiny bumps.  I forgot to mention, even some ingredients in sunscreen would irritate my skin the same way as if I was in the sun.  So just just didn&#x27;t wear anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally was diagnosed with PMLE last year.  The doctor suggested this sunscreen and it works!  Yes, it&#x27;s greasy and hard to put on b/c it&#x27;s so thick.  However if you are sensitive to sunscreen and/or have PMLE, looking greasy for a couple of hours would be your last concern.  I can finally vacation in the Caribbean with out having to be worried about being in the sun too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that have PMLE, when on my cruise and vacationing in the Dominican Republic, I also took a short week long dose of prednisone.  So be sure to speak with your doctor to know what will work best for you.</li>
            <li> I have to wear sunscreen everyday and have really fair, sensitive, skin cancer prone skin. So I&#x27;m constantly on the search for a high SPF daily moisturizer. I have been given trial sizes of Vanicream products at my Derm&#x27;s office but none this GREASY!! I know the product is a superior product for sun protection BUT it&#x27;s simply WAY too greasy. I have really dry skin and it literally goes on your face like Crisco. I applied it for the first time 5 hours ago this morning and my skin is still greasy feeling. The ONLY bonus is that I didn&#x27;t get the white cast that usually happens with all my other brands. I will go back to my all time favorite Eucerin Everyday Protection SPF30 in the pink bottle but will save this Vanicream for body.</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist has recommended this specific product for several years. However, her price for the product (yes, she sells it...) is quite a bit higher. Thru Amazon, we are able to save money and get free delivery. Oh yes, the sunscreen is terrific, too! It goes on well and the blocking effects last a long time. I have eliminated sunburns and greatly reduced problems requiring my doctor&#x27;s involvement.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this product to me and this is the most cost effective place I&#x27;ve found it.  Great deal!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to all my friends with children or if they have sensitive skin or eczema.  My child never complains of the burn like she has with other sunscreens and it is great at protecting her from the intense sun- no burns.  We reapply at least 2-3 times a day when we are out in the sun and swimming for 7-8hours but i Love this sunscreen</li>
            <li> I have sun sensitive lupus. I am also very allergic to many of the chemicals that are in store brand sunscreens. My dermatologist recommended me using Vanicream. I do not have skin reactions to the vanicream. I have to put it on everyday under my makeup and have had no problems, even with greasiness. I highly recommend this product. I do wish they could offer an even higher degree of protection such as 100% SPF.</li>
            <li> I use this in the sun for my face the same as Solbar Zinc SPF 38 for my body.  SPF 60 keeps my face from becoming wrinkled by the sun.</li>
            <li> I have vascular rosecea and have to be very cafeful what I use on my face.  Vanicream works great for me.  It&#x27;s not greasy, it provides extra protection from the sun and elements that my rosecea needs and it&#x27;s very reasonably priced compared to other products I&#x27;ve tried for sensitive skin.  FYI, if you have dermological rosecea this may not work for you.  I recommended this to a friend with dermological rosecea and although it does not seem greasy at all to me the small amount of grease in it caused her face to breakout, she had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my granddaughter&#x27;s dermatologist for use on her skin instead of the usual sunscreen products that made her eczema much worse. It has worked for very well for her. The zinc oxide makes it a little messier than most sunscreen products but it is worth putting up with that since she does not break out using it. Will by buying it again!</li>
            <li> Vanicream is a reasonably-priced, good sunscreen for sensitive skin.  It is on the greasy side, so works better in the cold weather when my skin is dry.  Not very good when it&#x27;s hot - especially if it&#x27;s humid.</li>
            <li> Vanicream Sunscreen, Sensitive Skin SPF 60 is now SPF 50+.  I&#x27;ve read some reviews that the formulation has changed with the change of SPF.  I&#x27;ve always used the SPF 60 and have found it to be a great sunscreen for sun protection.  Yes, it goes on white, but the whiteness absorbs and goes away and yes, you&#x27;ll look greasy.  When I put it in on face, I just dust a little face powder over it once it&#x27;s set.  I have very pale skin and burn easily.  Since wearing Vanicream SPF 60, I&#x27;ve never had a burn despite intense sun.  I also have very sensitive skin and Vanicream does not cause any skin reactions, which is a huge plus.  I just hope their new formulation SPF 50+ works as well.</li>
            <li> love vanicream sunscreen spf 60 for sensitive skin.  great coverage, not oily and does not make your face look like a \\&quot;ghost\\&quot; like some other suncreens.</li>
            <li> I used this on my infant all last summer in eastern massachusetts. He skin stayed white as a ghost (due to lack of tan, not just zinc) and it didn&#x27;t cause or irritate his eczema. It&#x27;s thick, and its white, but it stays on a squirmy baby playing in tidepools. It makes him very slick, though. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I have sebborehic (spelling?) dermatitis, and my head/face is extremely sensitive to most shampoos, soaps, sun screens, etc. There are just a couple of small areas on my face that are always slightly red because of the dermatitis problems (I have it mostly under control with an eczema cream and taking an antihistamine every day), but using this on those places while I&#x27;m outside really helped. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, though it was slightly greasy. Now I should be able to get the rest of my face darker than those spots since they&#x27;ll be protected from the sun.  Anyway, enough rambling... This would definitely be a good sun screen for anyone with sebborehic dermatitis, eczema, or someone who has a lot of skin allergies/sensitivities if you don&#x27;t mind the greasiness of it.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I&#x27;m allergic to any sunscreen and makes me break out in a rash. I&#x27;ve tried high and low end sunscreens, even the ones that claim to be for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot;. I was at my wits end and did a lot of research until I found this sunscreen. Even then, I was VERY hesitant to try this one because I was so afraid that I would get a rash again (getting rashes aren&#x27;t fun. Especially on your face). I actually went to Walgreens and picked this up at the pharmacy (I had to wait one day since they had to order it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I have to say is that this thing works!!! It didn&#x27;t break me out!! Normally my face would start to itch and break out in hives the same day I put on sunscreen, but I&#x27;ve used this product for the last couple weeks and so far no reaction at all. AMAZING. I am SO SO happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it IS very greasy like everyone says. The moment you put it on, your face looks like a grease-ball. I would say my skin absorbs about 50-70% of the greasiness after awhile (a couple hours for me) and if it&#x27;s still too greasy I just blot with blotting sheets. But honestly, considering the fact that it doesn&#x27;t break me out, the greasiness is a VERY small price to pay. I don&#x27;t mind it at all.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  In hot weather, most sunscreens leave stains on your clothes as they drip down your neck.  (White t-shirts get an especially bad orange ring around the collar)  Since this product has less chemicals, it doesn&#x27;t stain and does a great job on sun protection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to the ingredients in most sunscreens, even those supposedly for sensitive skin, like Aveeno.  This product did not produce any allergy symptoms - no redness or hives or itching.  BUT, it&#x27;s extremely greasy.  When you put it on your face, it looks like you&#x27;ve smeared Crisco on your face.  The good news:  it protects well against the sun and it definitely works in terms of skin allergies.  The bad news:  not something you&#x27;d want to wear anywhere but gardening, exercising outdoors or maybe to the beach.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product after early detection of melanoma. Successfully excised, but now I wear sunscreen all winter, too, even on snowy days.</li>
            <li> My boy&#x27;s pediatrician recommended Vanicream moisturizer to help with his eczema, and we&#x27;ve had successful results. The sunscreen has been EXTREMELY useful for the whole family (I think my husband, an avid hiker, is its #1 fan), considering the dry air and 100°F plus temperatures in our city. The moment you apply it, you can really feel the quality of the sunscreen, which by the way does not feel heavy on the skin at all. Just a couple of weeks ago we tested it during a trip to the beach, and it worked very well, considering that we spent quite a bit of time under the sun and in the ocean and pool water. None of us got sunburn and our skins remained soft and moist.</li>
            <li> Tried a sample from dermatologist and love this sunscreen.  I have very sensitive skin and love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of preservatives, scents, etc to irritate the skin.  Also, I am pretty athletic and spend a lot of time on the water.  The consistency is thick and can feel greasy if you don&#x27;t rub it in well, but I use this on my face because of the consistency - does not melt and run into my eyes when I get hot/sweaty.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It blends very well and doesn&#x27;t leave white residue at all.  The \\&quot;greasiness\\&quot; that other reviews mentioned is what makes it spread so easily.  It does leave you feeling a little slick for a bit but it does go away.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking I&#x27;d found a supply of the recently discontinued Vanicream 60spf.  What I received was Vanicream&#x27;s new formulation 50spf.  It is not the same product as the 60spf, and it is much more visible on the skin.  I&#x27;ve corresponded with the vendor and arranged to return my purchase.  Vendor claims Amazon is holding up the correction of this listing...hmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vanicream says the 50 spf is a &amp;#34;replacement&amp;#34; for the 60, to comply with FDA guidelines.  The problem is they changed the formula entirely.  I don&#x27;t like the new product at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product off and on for at least 4 years. I ended up going back to it because other facial sunscreens left a white film on my black skin. The reason I tried other products was because Vanicream was too thick and heavy for my acne prone, sensitive skin. Nevertheless, I received the most protection from Vanicream. Then I came up with the idea to dilute the sunscreen by wetting my hands, shaking off the excess water, and mixing a pea-size amount of the sunscreen with the water on my hands. I found that it absorbs a little quicker and isn&#x27;t as thick. I allow about 5-10 minutes before applying my makeup (using a fan helps). Just a quick fix until Vanicream comes up with a better formula. Hopes this is useful.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, easy application, non-greasy and affords very good protection against the harmful rays of the sun!  Would strongly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for about a year...got it originally for my nose after skin cancer surgery. It was the best hypoallergenic and high SPF sunscreen that I could find--my dermatologist recommended it. I didn&#x27;t like the fact that it was so greasy, but I found ways of making my shiny nose more matte....like putting DHC Velvet Skin Coat over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I discovered that it is very easy to remove the shine by just blotting the surface with a clean Kleenex. Now I use it all over my face and on my arms and shoulders if they are going to be exposed to the sun. Wonderful product....very protective and just the right moisturizing effect for my face. I used it under my eyes, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my sun-phobia is subsiding!</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the reviewers saying this sunscreen is really greasy.  It IS greasy, the greasiest sunscreen that I have ever used.  I put it on my face as thinly as possible and waited for a while until it absorbs.  It does absorb a little bit, but not much.  I put mineral foundation power with a brush hoping that will get my face look less oily, and the brush got oily and messy. I wish I could return it. :(</li>
            <li> I  am allergic to most sunscreens and have been using this product for about 8 months.  I will admit that I do not seem to get the irritation or rash from this product, but it does NOT wash off. I have used dove, cetaphil, even dishwashing soap, and make up remover.  It remains on your skin for days.  It is truly a repulsive sensation to touch your face hours later and have your fingers become sticky and shiny from the residue.  I have never used a product as tenacious as this one.  I would not recommend this at all as a daily sunscreen, or if you are going anywhere in public that is not an outdoor event (it looks like you have smothered butter on your face).</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking it was a facial sunscreen.  It does not appear to be that, or if it is, it is way to greasy.  If it is an all over sunscreen it is not water resistance, so I am not happy with it.</li>
            <li> I ordered vanicream spf 60. I was sent vanicream broad spectrum 50+ NDC 45334-356-04. The spf 60 NDC 45334-336-04 is what I wanted. It is thicker and does not leave a visible film like the 50+. very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vanicream 60 for several years, after spending years before that trying to find a non irritating sunscreen that did not turn my face completely white..  I used Vanicream 60 almost every day and found it very effective,  non irritating, and love it even if it is a little greasy.  it has been replaced by a completely new and reformulated product Vanicream 50+.  The replacement product makes my face whiter and is quite irritating to my face.  I cannot use it.  I am very disappointed with the new product, for both the manufacturer and me.  Now I will have to find another product that does not irritate my face.</li>
            <li> Splendid produce and hypoallergic. I have used it on recommendation of a dermatologist for some years. The only issue was the exhorbitant shipping fee. I will be careful next time!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best sunscreens to use if you have any type of skin issues like sensitive skin, freckled skin or melasma skin.  It has zinc oxide and titanium dioxide which totally block all solar UV rays. It can be used as a moisturizer under makeup (wait a few minutes for it to &#x27;set&#x27; before applying makeup).  Apply lightly as a little goes a long way.  There are no dyes, preservatives or chemicals in this sunscreen.  This is a must have product for year round use--it truly protects sensitive skin and prevents sunburn too!</li>
            <li> The sunscreen is hypoallergenic as claimed.  It protects nicely and goes on easily.  It was delivered as stated.</li>
            <li> I have SLE and over the years my skin has become very sensitive. This product was recommended by my dermatologist and has worked really well. My only problem is the cost. I found that I can get it cheaper through Coolibar.com.</li>
            <li> Our 4-year old daughter was born with slight touch of asthma. And, according to our pediatrician, eczema is common side-effect that comes along with it.  Christa&#x27;s eczema isn&#x27;t really bad, but her skin tends to be a little drier than normal.  The doctor gave us some samples of an Aveeno product, which was difficult to find consistently, and he gave us a list of some other products as well, which included Vanicream.  After a brief search on the internet, we found a good deal on Amazon where we could buy two jars of Vanicream with a pump dispenser, and get a tube of their sunscreen as well at an awesome price.  Our daughters skin is much better after 6 months of regular use, and the sunscreen works just great as well as moisturizing her skin in the sun.  We couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> My husband, who is in the sun daily, has very sensitive skin and virtually everything we tried further irritated his skin.  The sun causes him to turn all splotchy red and itchy, and most sunscreens only made the situation worse.  After trying almost everything, I ordered this based on the reviews posted on Amazon.  Wow.  Problem solved.  I can&#x27;t believe his dermatologist didn&#x27;t tell him about this stuff!  It&#x27;s a little thick, but it spreads very well and is extremely effective yet mild.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Im allergic to the chemical/cosmetic sunscreens which caused a terrible reaction. My dermatologist recommended this and I have been loyal to it for years. A little bit of this product go a LONG way. Bottle lasts forever before having to repurchase.</li>
            <li> This is the most highly protective and dermatologist-recommended sunscreen there is., It is a sun block rather than a sunscreen, having zinc oxide. You know, the white stuff lifeguards put on their noses to keep them from burning to a crisp. This is the same, only in nanoparticles that are NOT white after applied. It doesn&#x27;t really soak in, but that&#x27;s the point. It isn&#x27;t heavy, but you can tell you have it on if you touch where you put it. That&#x27;s GOOD. Use it if you want to prevent sun damage and cancer. That&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> This provides great coverage, but we tend to look a bit gray when we use it. We prefer the spf 35 over the 60.</li>
            <li> A friend uses this suntan lotion for her toddler son, as per the pediatrician&#x27;s recommendation for his sensitive skin.  While in her backyard on a sunny day I borrowed this lotion.  I was amazed that it did not leave stains on my son&#x27;s clothes.  For this reason, and the added benefit for sensitive skin, I ordered this suntan lotion from Amazon and used it all summer.  I have been very happy with it and will continue to use it for my son and for myself, and will order more next summer.  Imagine having no stains on your black bathing suit!!!</li>
            <li> A small line down your index finger will cover your entire face.  Slightly greasy feeling at first, but does not leave any white residue once rubbed in thoroughly (may want to think about something different for the rest of your body if you&#x27;re hairy).  That&#x27;s the little stuff.  As far as sunblock/sunscreen is concerned, I&#x27;m done shopping around - this is the stuff for me.  Doctor told me my skin, especially my face of late is quite susceptible to the beginnings of skin cancer.  After reasearching and reading other reviews, I picked this one out, and I feel very comfortable doing outdoor activities now when I&#x27;m wearing Vanicream.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t sting but is pasty...I like burn out brand better but it costs more</li>
            <li> Vanicream sunscreen is the only product I use on my face.  It keeps me from burning, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, or my sensitive skin.  It doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.  It goes on a little thick, so you have to rub it in very well.  If I want to wear it under makeup, sometimes I have to blot my face after applying the sunscreen, before I put my makeup on. It works great, though.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I can use on my face and neck which doesn&#x27;t burn my skin.  It took me many years to find the Vanicream line, and doing so has changed my life greatly!  What Zack said about a sunscreen needing to contain both zinc oxide and titanium dioxide is the absolute truth.  No sunscreen can adequately protect anyone&#x27;s skin without a combination of these two. And the proof is in the pudding: I haven&#x27;t had one single sunburn since 2005.  My forearms don&#x27;t darken at all in the summer any longer.  My complexion is lighter, more even-toned, and more porcelain-colored at 35 than it was at 27, because faithful &amp; proper use of Vanicream SPF 60 blocks my skin from darkening at all.  While it is mandatory to reapply every 45-90 mins., (just as with any sunscreen) this sunscreen really stays put once it&#x27;s blended in properly.  It does make one&#x27;s skin look shiny, but that&#x27;s a price well worth paying for this product. Finally, this sunscreen continually moisturizes the skin the entire time it&#x27;s on.  This is such a great moisturizer and sunscreen that I can apply a thick layer of Retin-A before bed, and go out in the high-UV index sunlight 10 hours later without any sunburn, darkening of my skin, or any other sun damage.  If you want flawless skin, start using this sunscreen and keep with it the rest of your life!!</li>
            <li> I had a problem of itching with other big brand name sunscreen, but with Vanicream I had no problems.</li>
            <li> No more annoying rashes from sunblock or sunscreen allergies! Although it doesn&#x27;t seem water proof but still protects your skin. You just have to keep applying it every 2 hours or so. Also, it turns white for some reason sometimes. Overall, I LOVE this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The texture, coverage  and performance of this cream makes it special.  There is no problem with eye-contact or burning.  Yet, it works beautifully.  Reasonably  priced, I think.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite sunscreens--it doesn&#x27;t make me look like a kabuki doll like so many of the sensitive-skin types, but it is quite thick and greasy. Your face will have a real shine after using it. But for SPF 60? I&#x27;ll take it.</li>
            <li> Nice suncreen for people who usually have eye reactions from suncreens. It is pretty heavy but, great for extra coverage.</li>
            <li> The has an allergy to most sun creams.  A dermatologist recommended that she try this cream, and it gives her good sun protection without the irritation caused by more common products.</li>
            <li> The only positive thing was it did not leave a white cast. It is very greasy &amp; heavy. And I feel like I still got a little color and have extremly limited sun exposure and faithful about using sunblock. Wanted something light to totally block all sun. This is not it. Only good thing was it did not leave the usual white cast. Way to heavy to use under makeup</li>
            <li> I am VERY dissapointed that my dermatologist recommended this cream as SAFE and I trusted him -- and then I decided to research it and I trust Dr. Mercola more than my dermatologist! This is from Dr. Mercola&#x27;s website:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;A study has found that topical applications of moisturizers such as Dermabase, Dermovan, Eucerin Original Moisturizing Cream, or Vanicream could increase skin cancer risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irradiated mice who were treated with the moisturizers exhibited a significant increase in their rate of tumor formation and increase in tumor size per mouse. Treatment of the mice with Dermabase, Dermovan, Eucerin, or Vanicream for 17 weeks increased the total number of histologically characterized tumors by 69 percent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the study, as reported by Green Med Info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The results indicate that several commercially available moisturizing creams increase the rate of formation and number of tumors when applied topically to UVB-pretreated high-risk mice. Further studies are needed to determine the effects of topical applications of moisturizing creams ... in humans.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also applies to tanning oils and lotions--which many of you may be using right now with summer in full swing--as well as the baby oil or lotion that many parents unwittingly slather on their babies.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m writing this review so that others can be informed -- it upsets me that my dermatologist recommended Vanicream and that I used if for a week on a vulnerable rash before I read about the danger of this product.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is working well for me so far. I have very dry skin so it sinks in pretty quickly. I can see that it would most likely be problematic for people with oily or even combo skin. I have tried A LOT of sunscreens in my quest to find one that is effective, sweatproof (I ride my bike to work - summer sun is brutal of course) and cruelty-free. The Vanicream seems to stick like glue so I am hopeful that it will hold up in New England heat and humidity. P.S.: I was using La Roche Posay Dermo-Peds (not cruelty free but very, very effective). However, it seems to have been reformulated and now drips off in the heat whereas before it didn&#x27;t budge. Very disappointing, I am extremely fair and I didn&#x27;t even freckle with that stuff on.</li>
            <li> no fragrance. a bit hard to apply. It is protective and does not cause outbreaks. fully recommend it. Wonder if I can apply over moisturizing cream</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive, finnicky skin and have had such a hard time finding a sunscreen for my face and neck that I really can wear on a daily basis under my makeup with no side effects.  I&#x27;ve tried Elta, Murad, MD Formulations, Yonka, and tons of non-professional brands too (Nutrogena has a new one called &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; that is supposed to be free of all dyes and perfumes and everything bad, but it made me and my son break out in a rash all over our faces and necks).  I&#x27;m so happy to find Vanicream!  Our allergist gave us a sample and after using it for two weeks no bad reactions.  No stingy, runny, watery eyes.  No rash.  It looks pretty white because of the zinc when you first start applying it, but it fades as you rub it in.  It is a little bit greasy feeling after you rub it in, but I like that because my makeup goes on better over it if it has some slip.  (I apply it over my moisturizer and under my makeup.)  I love the texture and it also makes my skin look amazing, somehow, on days I don&#x27;t wear makeup over it, people always comment on how good my skin looks.  wow.  so happy.</li>
            <li> Rubs in very nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave the bright white telltale skin from many others. Walgreens has it for $18 and if it is not in stock they will have it within 2 days.</li>
            <li> My son is allergic to sunscreen and this is the only one he can wear. It is greasy and does not last as long as others, so we reapply often, but overall I am very satisfied. The price could be better though.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a very lightweight or very liquid/fluid sunscream for your face, this is not it. The only good thing is that this works for my ultra sensitive skin, so I used it for my body, just not for my face.</li>
            <li> I use a variety of VaniCream products because I have very sensitive skin. I use their soap, facial cleaner, shaving cream, cream moisturizer, and Lite Lotion. As every VaniCream product I have used has been great, I figured I would give their sunscreen a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am one of those people who is either pale or burned. There really is no in between and so I need to wear sunscreen when in the sun for any outdoor activity. But over the years I have found that some sunscreens really do not get along with my skin, and that some clog pores (leading to further skin irritation.) VaniCream&#x27;s sunscreen moisturizes, does NOT clog pores, and does not irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I am not an expert on the active ingredients in sunscreen, I have to believe that whatever VaniCream is using is second-to-none when it comes to giving the best protection against both UV-A and UV-B damage. The reason I believe this is because I have not had a single product from VaniCream that was not the best in its respective class, and so their reputation of quality and integrity gives me confidence in their products, and enough confidence to let other Amazon Users know about my positive experiences with their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you need a sunscreen that is easy on skin, this is a great choice as it probably isn&#x27;t going to irritate your skin. If you find that certain sunscreens can clog your pores and flare acne, this is a great choice as it does not clog up pores. If you have dry skin and want a sunscreen that helps with the dryness, this is a great choice as it instantly treats dry skin upon application. Like most VaniCream products, it&#x27;s by no means inexpensive, but overall, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this and I have gone through 4-tubes of &#x27;trying&#x27;.  I have an oily T and this is just a bit of an oily product no matter how you slice it.  I do think it is a great sunscreen, but just not for everyday wear for the oily woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking for something else that is a bit less shiny!</li>
            <li> I have dark skin and the sunscreen rubs in without leaving obvious white/silver film like other sunscreens do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I bought it hoping to avoid tanning while in the Caribbean, and I tanned anyway.  So, this will not help you prevent tan (maybe nothing will).</li>
            <li> We were looking for a safe, \\&quot;Os, PABA free\\&quot; sunscreen. To be more specific, we were looking for a sunscreen that was more a physical and less a chemical barrier. To be a physical barrier, your choices become somewhat restricted, and limited to Zinc and/or Titanium Oxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with Titanium and Zinc containing sunscreen is that they leave a ghostly white residue which appears somewhat unseemly. We have tried various products and are pleased to confirm some of the positive reviews we actually used prior to purchasing this product from Amazon. Vanicream will leave a minimal white residue that usually disappears and is quite protective. We did not get sun burnt  at all. While not cheap, it is well worth buying if you want to stay away from the chemical sunscreens that bind to your skin. We will be looking to repurchase Vanicream SPF 60 sunscreen in the future.</li>
            <li> My former boss recommended this product a number of years ago for cleansing away from home...you know, when you can&#x27;t jump in the shower after using the toilet. The individual packets are great (he used to carry the bottle around in the office, but I prefer a little discretion! Lol.) I&#x27;d had a problem initially with the company (JustOTC) from which I&#x27;d purchased this product most recently as they sent it to me in a flimsy envelope and the product arrived in poor condition. But, JustOTC saw a post I&#x27;d penned on Amazon and they completely remedied the problem by sending out a new box without charge. I would definitely order from that vendor again thru Amazon. I live on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have been suffering with \\&quot;sun allergies\\&quot; for about 10 years, through numerous tests and incorrect diagnosis, I have finally been correctly diagnosed with PMLE - Poly Morphous Light Eruption.  After mush research and talking with my doctor and many mis-steps in the correct sun protection, VaniCream Sunscreen SPF 60 is the only product that has helped.  I still take necessary precautions in the sun, such as avoiding going outside between 11 - 2 and wearing protective clothing when necessary, but adding to this the Vanicream and I have not had an outbreak in almost 2 years.  If you are suffering from what you think can be PMLE, see your doctor and get tested and research as much as possible to understand the effects the sun can cause without adding to the mix harsh chemicals that are in almost all sun blocks. - Good Luck!</li>
            <li> As an Arizona resident, I never go outdoors without sun screen.  I developed an allergy to the product I&#x27;d used for a long time, and my dcotr recommended Vanicream to me.  He was right.  I&#x27;ve had no skin problems, and I don&#x27;t tan while I&#x27;m wearing it.  A success story. Users should know that the product is greasy, so apply it carefully and rub it in well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Polymorphic Light Eruption since I was about 4. Every time I go out in the sun, I break out in a terrible itchy red rash, and I&#x27;ve never found a sunscreen that helps at all...until now. Here&#x27;s how I tested it: About a month ago I went up to my friend&#x27;s house by the river and was out in the sun for about one and a half hours. Even though it was later in the day I still got a rash on my arms and neck. This week I went back to the river armed with this sunscreen. I was out in the direct sun on my friend&#x27;s boat all day (noon to five), and my skin had zero reaction to the sun. I was seriously impressed. I don&#x27;t find this sunscreen that greasy unlike other reviewers. I actually think it blends in really well, and it has no odor at all. I&#x27;m so happy I found something that works!</li>
            <li> Used it whenever I do outdoor activities such as hiking or road cycling.  Was easier to apply versus other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used before.  Scent is fairly pleasant, no strong fragrance. Works well with sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m on to my second tube.</li>
            <li> I used to swear by the vanicream SPF 60. It is no longer available, so this seller should change the picture. What you get I vanicream SPF 50+ which is disgusting and I can&#x27;t stand to use it in myself or my daughters. The SPF 50+ also does not work as well and my daughter burned for the first time this year because of the new formulation. It smells awful, it is extremely drying and it is very gritty and chalky, leaving a thick white residue that looks ridiculous, like white face paint. We look like ghosts with this stuff on. The vanicream SPF 60 used to go on clear and had no smell and we NEVER burned. Don&#x27;t waste you money on the SPF 50+.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much for sun protection because I only used it once and don&#x27;t plan to use it again. It was VERY hard to rub in to my skin and also really greasy.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly; mild scent; hasn&#x27;t caused any rash or redness; a little thick but still spreads kind of easily if patted all over face first. It didn&#x27;t make me look lighter than my foundation shade of 20-25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slightly oily after applied, which makes applying foundation easy. But might be too oily for people with oily faces, unless you use a liquid foundation afterward.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter who has sensitive skin, her dermatologist recommended it. It works great, no burning, or no rash afterwards!  We have bought many times now!</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite sunscreen. It&#x27;s gentle, and effective (as long as I reapply as recommended) and it&#x27;s super moisturizing for my dry skin so that I can smoothly apply makeup on after. It&#x27;s thick so it takes some getting used to, but I&#x27;ve been using only this brand sunscreen for the last few years and I&#x27;m definitely happy with it and don&#x27;t planning on switching brands any time soon. It doesn&#x27;t have any annoying smells and doesn&#x27;t leave me looking ashen.</li>
            <li> My skin reacts to a lot of sunscreens by breaking out in a rash, but I am a redhead and need very high SPF protection when I am outdoors for extended periods of time. This sunscreen does the trick for me when I am hiking and biking, and the physical block absorbs easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a white film on my face. I don&#x27;t use it on a daily basis, however (going to work in the city, when exposure is brief), because it does feel a little heavy for that purpose.</li>
            <li> This product blocks the sun but is very greasy or heavy. I use it daily because I have to. Does the job</li>
            <li> This is the BEST stuff ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL Vanicream Products are the best, so you can never go wrong with any of them :). I use all of the products and they do wonders for my skin. I have very sensitive skin, so all of these products are fabulous AND very gentle on the skin with out of the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; added. I have gotten about 5 people (friends &amp; family) using some of the products as well, and they seem as happy as me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ENJOY! Thanks! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Main ingredient is ZINC OXIDE</li>
            <li> I just used a couple of 0.25 free samples of Vanicream 60 SPF from my dermatologist several weeks ago. I suffer from mild rosacea and am a very fair skinned red head. This didnt make me break out and I have tried using several kinds previously. A posting here concerned me so I looked this up on the EWG&#x27;s website (Environmental Working Group) to see its studies on safety. This came up as being pretty safe in comparison to thousands of others, seems like a good choice over all so do your own research before listening to others comments. It is thick, white, and greasy at first, but I learned to put just a tiny amount on and my sin absorbs it in a few minutes just fine. If you have sensitive skin, rosacea, or acne, this is the mildest safest sunscreen that you probably will find, I wear it on my face and neck daily. I am ordering a large one right now and wanted to leave a comment first. Hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now. I&#x27;ve been wearing sunscreen daily for years, but wanted to switch to an all physical sunscreen. Vanicream is very thick and feels a little greasy at first, but sinks in well. No noticeable fragrance/scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin that&#x27;s not sensitive or acne-prone. I really slather it on. I wish the protection (especially UVA protection/PPD) were higher, but that&#x27;s one of the tradeoffs of physical vs. chemical sunscreens. I&#x27;m comfortable using this every day and don&#x27;t notice a white cast. I&#x27;ll continue to repurchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has eczema and is sensitive to most sunblocks. It worked great. I used it on my face and I didn&#x27;t have any issues with the residue getting into my eyes and burning like most do. Would definitely use again.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product since I&#x27;ve had issues with skin cancer.  Gives good protection, not greasy.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be SPF 60, but that&#x27;s not what they sent me, so I wasn&#x27;t happy. I know that the SPF 60 has been discontinued, but I was hoping that there were still some tubes of it out there, and that&#x27;s what I thought I was ordering. (That&#x27;s why I ordered THREE tubes!) The new stuff is SPF 55 (I think) and the formula is different. It gave me a rash all over my neck, so I hated it.</li>
            <li> This is a really heavy duty sunscreen for sports or the beach.  It is greasy, so I don&#x27;t use it on my face.  It stands up to perspiration.  It is also good value.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this sunscreen.  It is powerful and yet not greasy or drying like most powerful sunscreens.  It was packaged well and arrived really quickly!!</li>
            <li> I get used to the light lotion for sunscreen, so I felt the sunscreen was too thick first time I used it. But it worked well when I was outside because it is hot and the sunshine is strong here. I think it is good for people who plan a mountain climbing or camping. I won&#x27;t use it daily though.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this by my dermatologist and I feel it is great.  It&#x27;s very easy to put on and does a great job of protecting my skin.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen is the most important product to use and this one has zinc oxide in it which is key to not get a sunburn.</li>
            <li> We travel frequently to tropical areas, so a good sunscreen is a must.  Chemical sunscreens cause my skin to burn, crack and peel.  I have been using Vanicream daily for about two years now (it makes a great moisturizer when we are home in New York), and have had no problems with it at all.  On the couple of occasions when I&#x27;ve run out of Vanicream and gone back to Neutrogena or some other sunscreen advertised as \\&quot;hypoallergenic\\&quot; or for \\&quot;sensitive skin,\\&quot; my skin has immediately cracked and peeled.  Once I go back to the Vanicream, everything is fine.  It&#x27;s a bit greasy when first applied, but after a few minutes it absorbs into your skin and is invisible.  This is a really great product.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen seems to work perfectly for the most sensitive of skin in our family, from light skinned Grandpa to tender infant.  I am sensitive to most fragrances and a lot of chemicals, so I appreciate it, too!  It is all we use now.  Would like to get at a discounted price, if possible.</li>
            <li> This cream with Spf60 combines 2 essentials for skincare.  The first is the amazing skincare cream which was recommended by my dermatologist, and the second is the most important, sunscreen protection.  I use it for my face, too and usually put in on and wait about 10 minutes before I put on a BB tinted cream.  Then I feel presentable and well protected.</li>
            <li> Too greasy for my oily skin :( i use it on my face  and it darken me .I Think its more for dry skin&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommande this sunscreen for oily skin</li>
            <li> I purchased the vanicream sunscreen because it was touted to be excellent for sensitive skin. It does live up to that. I can wear it without any itching or rashes. On the other hand, I applied this sunscreen about 2 hours ago and I am still covered in a layer of grease that will not absorb into the skin. It is most off-putting. I have not thoroughly tested its sun-protection, but it just feels awful when it is on. This is probably intended for people with very dry sensitive skin, and my skin is not dry.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.  it does not run in my eyes and sting.  It has the two metals in it so I think it provides good protection.  It gives skin a purple cast when first applied which goes away as it warms and is rubbed in.</li>
            <li> So I was walking outside on my sidewalk the other day when I stumbled across a strange white tube of paste.  It was called Vanicream.  I immediately went inside and I really wanted to discover it&#x27;s purpose.  I tried some as toothpaste. No, I concluded; the taste was terrible.  I place a small amount on my eyes and rubbed it in.  The burned told me it was for something else besides eye glue.  I drizzled some over a few cupcakes, and took a large bite.  Suddenly I remembered that it tasted terrible from the toothpaste incident.  My stomach turned.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for seven years and still love it.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive screen and are looking for a sunscreen that will actually work, this is the product for you.  Vanicream has a slightly oily feel when applying but you soon learn that a little goes a long way and the oiliness feels more like a cream in just a few minutes.  I burn within 45 minutes but with Vanicream, I have been able to stay out longer with no burning and only a slight tanning.</li>
            <li> I purchased Vanicream Suncreen, Sensitive Skin, Spf60 for my husband.  He has very sensitive skin. This product is perfect! He didn&#x27;t get a sunburn and it didn&#x27;t bother his sensitive skin.  What a great find. Thanks.[[ASIN:B000V1QLEM Vanicream Sunscreen, Sensitive Skin, Spf 60, 4 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> this really works and does not bother my sensitive skin and leaves skin soft. use it daily and you will be amazed.</li>
            <li> This is the first sunscreen product I&#x27;ve used that was not irritating at all.  I didn&#x27;t notice a change in the amount of acne that I had either.  I&#x27;ll try to update this review when we get into the summer sun season and I use it more heavily.</li>
            <li> Your initial post: Mar 16, 2013 6:53:12 PM PDT&lt;br /&gt;sky234 says:&lt;br /&gt;Regarding how hard it is to wash this product off. I&#x27;m a gardener so use sunscreen every day on my face (when I&#x27;m out). Neutrogena soap washes off greasy sunscreen well. I use my hands to do a quick wash, rinse, then wash again with a washclothe and Neutrogena soap. It washes really clean. Love it. Wouldn&#x27;t use this sunscreen though.</li>
            <li> This sunblock does not have a sunblcok scent and is great at protecting my face all day long. It is also great for a day at the beach.</li>
