            <li>Nice Smells</li>
            <li>very nice special aroma</li>
            <li>very strong scent.  </li>
            <li>arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very light and doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>Amazon and as a Prime member SHIPPING WAS FREE!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this scent.</li>
            <li>Not the perfume but the lotion is outstanding.</li>
            <li>thats okay.</li>
            <li>This my favorite Clinique (or &#x27;any&#x27;)</li>
            <li>She admitted that it was her most favorite perfume lotion that no one knows</li>
            <li>this has been my fav smoother, perfume for many years along with opium and L&#x27;Air duTemps.  </li>
            <li>bought this for a friend love the aroma</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Earthy but sophisticated.</li>
            <li>I have been using Clinique Elixer for many years, and I particularly love the body cream.  </li>
            <li>Many people think it&#x27;s a soap I&#x27;m using because it has a very &#x27;clean&#x27; scent on me.</li>
            <li>She was very happy to have one and will of course use most often than other of her perfume.</li>
            <li>This body cream compliments the Elixir cologne nicely and is worth having in your fragrance wardrobe.</li>
            <li>It is much nicer than the perfume, which doesn&#x27;t smell all that good to me.  </li>
            <li>Shame you can&#x27;t get it easily in NZ,</li>
            <li>too strong for me.</li>
            <li>(ci 14700).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Most of these ingredients are fairly benevolent - as far as cosmetics go!</li>
            <li>prices from Amazon are pretty much always good, and I&#x27;ll surely buy this again.</li>
            <li>well where I tried it wasn&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li>I love this scent, but it can be overwhelming to me if too much is used.</li>
            <li>the aromatics cologne all the time, (usually from perfect strangers!)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty sure everyone would like this smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to be drenched in perfume, so a little of this body smoother after shower is ideal for me.</li>
            <li>(but those are in the bottom of the ingredient list, so minute amounts, but most general regarded as safe by EWG, triethanolamine can be an allergen for some people.</li>
            <li>but this is the genuine product not a stale out of date item.  </li>
            <li>not only is it my &#x27;favorite&#x27; scent (and my husbands who loves to smell it on me at night!)</li>
            <li>The moisture lasts and the fragrance stays fresh.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it to try it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fresh and unusual.</li>
            <li>but the price was right</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance and the creamy lotion like texture, use iy daily and don&#x27;t feel finished without it.  </li>
            <li>no wrinkled noses, ever. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I find that the lotion smells exactly the same, lasts longer, and you don&#x27;t risk smelling too strongly of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>
            <li>The scent seems to linger for may hours, and I&#x27;ve had a lot of positive comments....</li>
            <li>It is subtle and yet lingers and compliments her better than most perfumes.</li>
            <li>I would certainly buy it again</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>One of my absolute  must haves.  </li>
            <li>She really loves the texture and the aroma.  </li>
            <li>I think any scent depends on the individual&#x27;s body chemistry, and this one is the only one I&#x27;ve ever used that elicits comments about how &#x27;nice&#x27; I smell.  </li>
            <li>The size is a great deal for the price since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The perfume-version is a little strong - when it first came out, the fashion magazines suggested not spraying it directly on oneself, but to spray it in the air and walk into it.</li>
            <li>grandchildren who live in another state say they can smell me from Montana and they miss that smell...</li>
            <li>the product was fine but the tube had black marks on it and it was a gift</li>
            <li>Love this product although it is getting hard to find.</li>
            <li>but I can tell her mind of wanting one that surprised her.</li>
            <li>It seems to be more subtle and natural.  </li>
            <li>This has such a classy, sensual, intoxicating scent.  </li>
            <li>I have used this cream for a long time, it&#x27;s long lasting and keeps you fresh all day, especially when used with the perfurme.  </li>

            <li> Exactly what I wanted, and only took a few days to get to me! Happy, happy, joy, joy!The service was just fine. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Every Christmas I get gift cards and want to buy the Aromatics Elixir, but can never find it in stock.  This Spring, I decided not to wait for Chrismas and I ordered it.  The scent is so unique and long lasting that this sized container last a very long time - at least with me.  I adore the scent.</li>
            <li> the product was fine but the tube had black marks on it and it was a gift</li>
            <li> I have been using Aromatics Elixir for 20 years it is the only scent that people complement me on.&lt;br /&gt;My grandchildren who live in another state say they can smell me from Montana and they miss that smell...soo cute!</li>
            <li> My go-to body cr&amp;egrave;me.  Have purchased before but this is the genuine product not a stale out of date item.  Packaging was done correctly.  I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  The moisture lasts and the fragrance stays fresh.  Don&#x27;t know what took me so long to discover it.</li>
            <li> This body cream compliments the Elixir cologne nicely and is worth having in your fragrance wardrobe.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 15 years, and get compliments every time I use it; best when used with the Aromatics Elixer EDP.</li>
            <li> Wear the perfume and the lotion.  The lotion is actually very good, not drying or over powering.  The size is a great deal for the price since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> not only is it my &#x27;favorite&#x27; scent (and my husbands who loves to smell it on me at night!) but the price was right&lt;br /&gt;on Amazon and as a Prime member SHIPPING WAS FREE!  love my aromatics !</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent. Not the perfume but the lotion is outstanding. I almost always have comments on it.</li>
            <li> very strong scent.  it does not fade.  the scent transferred to my jeans, my sheets, etc and it remained until things were washed.  too strong for me.</li>
            <li> When my wife wears it, it sends me to heaven. It is subtle and yet lingers and compliments her better than most perfumes. A must...</li>
            <li> Not quite as nice as the parfume. Something about it is wrong, but thats okay. I will get a bath or shower product and I&#x27;ll bet that&#x27;ll be spot on.</li>
            <li> I have worn this body smoother for years and won&#x27;t wear anything else. It doesn&#x27;t take much and lasts all day. The fragrance is very light and doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies.</li>
            <li> Ingredients: Water-stearic acid-perfume-caprylic/capric triglyceride-peg-coconut oil-triethanolamine-cetyl alcohol-tocopheryl acetate-ppg-26 oleate-peg 100 stearate-sorbitan stearate-glyceryl stearate-caprylyl glycol-coco-caprylate/caprate-ethylhexylglycerin-dimethicone-butylene glycol-hexylene glycol-carbomer-disodium edta-phenoxyethanol-benzyl alcohol-inalool-geraniol-benzyl benzoate-citronella-eugenol-hexyl cinnamal-butylphenyl methylpropional-alpha isomethyl ionine-cinnamyl alcohol-limonene-isoeugenol-coumarin-benzyl cinnamate-hydroxycitronellal-farnesol-citral-benzyl salicylate-yellow 5 (ci 19140)-yellow 10 (ci47005)-red 4 (ci 14700).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Most of these ingredients are fairly benevolent - as far as cosmetics go! Some petroleum byproducts and synthetic dyes (but those are in the bottom of the ingredient list, so minute amounts, but most general regarded as safe by EWG, triethanolamine can be an allergen for some people. No parabens, a good thing.!)</li>
            <li> This is the only scent I wear, and I prefer using the body cream.  It seems to be more subtle and natural.  I think any scent depends on the individual&#x27;s body chemistry, and this one is the only one I&#x27;ve ever used that elicits comments about how &#x27;nice&#x27; I smell.  Many people think it&#x27;s a soap I&#x27;m using because it has a very &#x27;clean&#x27; scent on me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to be drenched in perfume, so a little of this body smoother after shower is ideal for me. I love this scent, but it can be overwhelming to me if too much is used. Just my opinion!</li>
            <li> This my favorite Clinique (or &#x27;any&#x27;) scent!&lt;br /&gt;my husband loves it, and has to &#x27;smell my hand &amp; arm after i climb into bed after I shower&lt;br /&gt; and use the Aromatics body wash,then the smoother, he says&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;over and over that it is &#x27;intoxicating&#x27;!  so although i get comments&lt;br /&gt;on the aromatics cologne all the time, (usually from perfect strangers!)&lt;br /&gt;my husband&#x27;s opinion is the reason i keep buying it!</li>
            <li> Thank you for such prompt delivery as this was a gift for someone.  Did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> The best scent ever!!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my mother&#x27;s birthday. She admitted that it was her most favorite perfume lotion that no one knows but I can tell her mind of wanting one that surprised her. She was very happy to have one and will of course use most often than other of her perfume.</li>
            <li> this has been my fav smoother, perfume for many years along with opium and L&#x27;Air duTemps.  This has such a classy, sensual, intoxicating scent.  Is not strong and offensive.  Only a little bit in pressure points will last ALL day and into evening.  Also try the Cologne &amp; bath/shower gel.  All all amazing!</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for a long time, it&#x27;s long lasting and keeps you fresh all day, especially when used with the perfurme.  Others have ordered it.</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful scent. It&#x27;s been around for at least 20 yrs, yet, it&#x27;s timeless. It&#x27;s worth it to try it.</li>
            <li> This is a clean wonderful smelling lotion.  It is much nicer than the perfume, which doesn&#x27;t smell all that good to me.  I just paid $70+ for a perfume that Kelly Ripa said smelled good.  Wish I had gotten this instead.  Pretty sure everyone would like this smell.</li>
            <li> Have been using for years and always get compliments on it.  Price at Amazon is a lot cheaper than the department store.  I feel great and refreshed every time I put it on.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> very nice special aroma</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother for Christmas this year and it was a wise purchase.  She has worn this fragrance for over 25 years and she loves it in the body cream form as it is not too overpowering and she can carry it with her when she travels without worrying about it breaking in her bag. It is always a big hit for her birthday, Mother&#x27;s Day, or Christmas and she uses it regularly, so she always needs some!  Great product!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances!!! I always get compliments....</li>
            <li> The only disappointment was that this is manufactured in Belgium.  That last tubes I got were made in USA.  Oh well.  Still smells good.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it</li>
            <li> Love it, always have, always will! Shame you can&#x27;t get it easily in NZ, well where I tried it wasn&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li> bought this for a friend love the aroma</li>
            <li> Love this product although it is getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> Product as described. Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Works so well with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> MMMMM Nice Smells Good, Spicy,Just like I Like</li>
            <li> One of my absolute  must haves.  Proud consumer 20 + years.  I get compliments every time I wear this.  Can go from the office to after work affairs and the smell lingers throughout the day.  Must Have!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this lotion for at least 15 years now....I love it and I hope they never retire it.  I only like the lotion the perfume spray dose not work on me.  Earthy but sophisticated.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance and the creamy lotion like texture, use iy daily and don&#x27;t feel finished without it.  It&#x27;s terrific</li>
            <li> I have been using Clinique Elixer for many years, and I particularly love the body cream.  The scent seems to linger for may hours, and I&#x27;ve had a lot of positive comments....no wrinkled noses, ever. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prices from Amazon are pretty much always good, and I&#x27;ll surely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this fragrance since it came out in the 1980s. It&#x27;s very fresh and unusual. I actually prefer the lotion, and use it on my hands, arms, neck instead of perfume. The perfume-version is a little strong - when it first came out, the fashion magazines suggested not spraying it directly on oneself, but to spray it in the air and walk into it. But I find that the lotion smells exactly the same, lasts longer, and you don&#x27;t risk smelling too strongly of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li> Xmas gift for my sister.  She really loves the texture and the aroma.  Good stuff and smells like perfume.  I would certainly buy it again</li>
