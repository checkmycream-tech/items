            <li>Nice fragrance (</li>
            <li>Very nice light flavor too.  </li>
            <li>Very strong chemical taste, smells</li>
            <li>Quite honestly, I feel that the Burt&#x27;s Bees coconut hydrating lip balm worked better and soothing my lips.</li>
            <li>Hawaiian Tropic Lip Balm is the most effective stick sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used besides one by Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The SPF works great, however it is pretty on-par for chapstick-style lip balm.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the smell and love the fact that it&#x27;s 45</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and works very well for fair skinned people.  </li>
            <li>Favorite flavor</li>
            <li>If you like Hawaiian Tropic sun tan lotion you will love this lip balm.  </li>
            <li>With the added protection you won&#x27;t have sun burnt lips again. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i found one that is SPF 45.</li>
            <li>Recently went on a trip to Mexico and it worked perfectly!</li>
            <li>I would love to purchase it in bulk and put it in every purse and car.</li>
            <li>It does not taste like sunblock and actually smells delicious!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it contains an spf 45 sunscreen to protect my lips from harmful rays and I love the cocnut flavor.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better then the eos or the Burt&#x27;s bees</li>
            <li>I Love it...</li>
            <li>taste, smell and feel :-)</li>
            <li>My girl stole it from me..had to buy more..</li>
            <li>Love scent, taste, texture, price</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and just love it.  </li>
            <li>I often look for a great smelling, soft lip balm for the summer.</li>
            <li>And even better, the lip balm is moist and glides easily and smoothly across my lips.</li>
            <li>Smells great, glides on smooth, and keeps my lips soft.</li>
            <li>My lips sunburn really easily</li>
            <li>y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this because it was the highest SPF lip balm I could find, and I wanted something strong for our upcoming vacation to Mexico.  </li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>The one positive is that the scent is really nice.</li>
            <li>Very tropical and very smooth I love it</li>
            <li>lol recommend it highly...;-)</li>
            <li>Fabulous lip balm, lasts on the lips despite snorkeling in the ocean and drinking water.</li>
            <li>Has a unique flavor that isnt overwhelming, and keeps your lips moist for hours without having to reapply, and it has 45 SPF and for someone like me that is prone to fever blisters from the sun, this has been really helpful in avoiding them!</li>
            <li>Many sunscreen products are sticky/tacky feeling and don&#x27;t glide on or rub in very well.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could get over the taste, but it&#x27;s like a metallic bitterness on the back of my tongue that doesn&#x27;t go away for a good 4 hours.  </li>
            <li>It is just the right consistency that is spreads on easily and still doesn&#x27;t get too runny in hot weather.  </li>
            <li>Great little tube .  </li>
            <li>I admit I like the old brown better</li>
            <li>I was excited to use this chap-stick, given that the SPF was so high.  </li>
            <li>Hard to find a lip balm that has a spf of this rating as well as the great smell (pina colada?)</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and was excited to use this product as my lips have a tendency to burn.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like this!</li>
            <li>My wife uses and has tried many different lip balms.  </li>
            <li>I prefer this lip balm as it tastes sweet, is not pasty white and is smooth and silky on my lips.</li>
            <li>Many balms will work temporarily, or moisturize if you keep constantly applying, but this stuff got me through a week in the desert at Burning Man with no problem.</li>
            <li>and she seems to really like it!</li>
            <li>Luckily I bought it specifically for the SPF, which is why I am giving it as high of a review as I am.</li>
            <li>My favorite lip balm and sunscreen...looked for several years to find the original and finally realized they changed the packaging.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like that scent, I&#x27;d suggest getting the vanilla scent, but the Tropical one really smells divine and summer-</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a tacky feel to it, is very moisturizing, and is also water resistant for up to 80 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida where the sun shines hot 365 days a year except when it is raining.</li>
            <li>I also use Blistex Medicated Lip Ointment which is amazing for healing really bad chapping and cracked lips, but I found that addictive (one of the ingredients is known to contribute to long-term drying even if it&#x27;s great in short-term).</li>
            <li>Since my diagnosis I&#x27;ve tried numerous products with added \\&quot;sunscreen\\&quot; trying to incorporate more protection into my daily life -</li>
            <li>The initial taste is great, but after about an hour you have to drink something to get the chemical taste out of your mouth (or at least make it tolerable).</li>
            <li>and I have been looking at all chopsticks with high SPF from a $18 Chapstick to $3</li>
            <li>I needed something with high SPF for my lips while golfing and this does the trick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra effort!</li>
            <li>This feels very moisturizing, and a few swipes of it back and forth across each lip creates a nice layer that will stay in place.  </li>
            <li>but I think it would be too much sunscreen and sweet flavor combo for everyday.</li>
            <li>The SPF 4-15 varieties of Chapstick are good, the SPF 15 in Blistex is good, the SPF 30 Chapstick (Ultra) is so disgusting I won&#x27;t use it unless I have no other option.  </li>
            <li>It also has an awful chemical flavor once their added flavor/fragrance (which is lovely btw) wears off, but that is something I am used to with lip balms that have any SPF over 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR:&lt;br /&gt;Not Moisturizing; SPF works great; Chemical aftertaste;</li>
            <li>okay but not nice when applied to your lips.</li>
            <li>This product is with me at all times so I can frequently reapply the protection I need for my lips.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t feel like it kept my lips from getting burnt, even though I put it on religiously.</li>
            <li>B0000537HB Natural Ice Lip Protectant/sunscreen sport SPF 30,</li>
            <li>you are sensitive to smells/flavors, skip</li>
            <li>you want something to torture your flavor/fragrance sensitive friends, buy it.</li>
            <li>The bitter chemical after taste is really off-putting.</li>
            <li>Last year after being diagnosed with skin cancer, SPF became a conscious concern for all my skin care products.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this twice a week for a year and the tube still is not empty.</li>
            <li>but apparently it is water resistant for up to 80 minutes.</li>
            <li>I first bought this brand in Hawaii, but have trouble finding it on the mainland.  </li>

            <li> you are sensitive to smells/flavors, skip</li>
            <li> you want something to torture your flavor/fragrance sensitive friends, buy it.</li>
            <li> The bitter chemical after taste is really off-putting.</li>
            <li> Last year after being diagnosed with skin cancer, SPF became a conscious concern for all my skin care products.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this twice a week for a year and the tube still is not empty.</li>
            <li> but apparently it is water resistant for up to 80 minutes.</li>
            <li> I first bought this brand in Hawaii, but have trouble finding it on the mainland.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t attribute it right away to the product, but the next day it suddenly dawned on me (duh!).  </li>
            <li> I have tried to find this for approx 9 years, last bought it in The British Virgin Islands, kept the empty container</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s important to note my friend has not experienced this, though she only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> This stuff on the other hand doesn&#x27;t leave your lips dry the next day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Natural Ice SPF 30 Sport is every bit as good as this but without the horrible aftertaste.</li>
            <li> Not really moisturizing, just leaves a waxy feeling on your lips and keeps them from feeling dry and flakey-</li>
            <li> I am a regular user (4+ times per day) of lip-balm - usually ChapStick, Blistex, or Carmex.  </li>
            <li> Next time will buy lip balm with SPF no more than 15</li>

            <li> This product works as far as keeping your lips free of burn, however it tastes very, very bad.  </li>
            <li> In my experience as a lip balm junkie, I&#x27;ve found that lip balms with SPF tend to have a slightly bad taste to them, but this one is fine.  </li>
            <li> Works just as good and doesn&#x27;t taste awful.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest licking your lips with it on, but the accidental, slight taste you get from it is nothing too</li>
            <li> This one goes on smoother than other lip sunscreens I have tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t wear off in a few minutes leaving me reapplying.</li>
            <li> Whether make-up, lip-balm, or moisturizer, one thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that sunscreen often makes the texture, consistency, and smell of a product a little hard to tolerate.</li>
            <li> I used it repeatedly (applied at least once every 30 minutes) while on the water and my lips still burned pretty badly.  </li>

            <li> With all the gardening I have to do I need something that will protect me from the sun and SPF 45 seems to work well for at least two hours before it needs to be applied again.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t have a bad &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; atleast, like some do, but I also feel like it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nasty though that I can only tolerate it when my lips are really bad, instead of as an everyday protectant.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say</li>
            <li> Definitely kept from getting my lips sunburned but the taste is awful.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this didn&#x27;t function as sunblock at all for me.</li>
            <li> After using it, I started getting this awful taste in the back of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> the unfortunate problem is the aftertaste people have mentioned.</li>

            <li> The bitter chemical after taste is really off-putting. Yuck. I don&#x27;t mind the smell and love the fact that it&#x27;s 45+ SPF but the after taste alone will prevent me from buying this product again.</li>
            <li> This is the best chapstick ever!  It smells amazing and works very well for fair skinned people.  I am the type that can get blisters on my lips if they get sunburned.  I use this product every day and never have to worry about sunburn.  It is just the right consistency that is spreads on easily and still doesn&#x27;t get too runny in hot weather.  We kayak and hike a lot, so I need a product that can go with me without melting.  I first bought this brand in Hawaii, but have trouble finding it on the mainland.  That&#x27;s why I started ordering it online.  It&#x27;s worth the extra effort!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and great coverage for lips!!!</li>
            <li> I am a regular user (4+ times per day) of lip-balm - usually ChapStick, Blistex, or Carmex.  Last year after being diagnosed with skin cancer, SPF became a conscious concern for all my skin care products.  Whether make-up, lip-balm, or moisturizer, one thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that sunscreen often makes the texture, consistency, and smell of a product a little hard to tolerate. Since my diagnosis I&#x27;ve tried numerous products with added \\&quot;sunscreen\\&quot; trying to incorporate more protection into my daily life - not just days I plan to be staying out in the sun.  The SPF 4-15 varieties of Chapstick are good, the SPF 15 in Blistex is good, the SPF 30 Chapstick (Ultra) is so disgusting I won&#x27;t use it unless I have no other option.  I was concerned that SPF 45 would be nasty, since I can always taste smell and feel sunscreen in health/beauty products.  I love this Hawaiian Tropic SPF 45!  The taste and smell are \\&quot;tropical\\&quot; as advertised...reminiscent of a pina colada.  I don&#x27;t taste or smell the sunscreen at all.  And even better, the lip balm is moist and glides easily and smoothly across my lips. Many sunscreen products are sticky/tacky feeling and don&#x27;t glide on or rub in very well.  I will definitely be stocking up on this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this in the Tropical scent, and, as another reviewer notes, it smells just like a pina colada.  If you don&#x27;t like that scent, I&#x27;d suggest getting the vanilla scent, but the Tropical one really smells divine and summer-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this because it was the highest SPF lip balm I could find, and I wanted something strong for our upcoming vacation to Mexico.  This feels very moisturizing, and a few swipes of it back and forth across each lip creates a nice layer that will stay in place.  It doesn&#x27;t have a tacky feel to it, is very moisturizing, and is also water resistant for up to 80 minutes.  It also doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue on the lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer commented that this has a bad taste, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too awful. In my experience as a lip balm junkie, I&#x27;ve found that lip balms with SPF tend to have a slightly bad taste to them, but this one is fine.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest licking your lips with it on, but the accidental, slight taste you get from it is nothing too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this!</li>
            <li> Very strong chemical taste, smells okay but not nice when applied to your lips. I have stopped using this and have purchased another spf lip balm that does not have the bad taste. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> It has a nice fragrance and moisturizes. It has prevented my lips from getting sunburnt.</li>
            <li> This product is with me at all times so I can frequently reapply the protection I need for my lips.  Favorite flavor</li>
            <li> If you like Hawaiian Tropic sun tan lotion you will love this lip balm.  It smells so good!  The Vanilla Mint is also wonderful!  With the added protection you won&#x27;t have sun burnt lips again. :)</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say but I hate to use this lip balm :( It feels so terrible and heavy on my lips so I think  I will just throw it away. Next time will buy lip balm with SPF no more than 15</li>
            <li> I have tried to find this for approx 9 years, last bought it in The British Virgin Islands, kept the empty container and now I have found it again. One very happy lady with her favourite product.</li>
            <li> This product works as far as keeping your lips free of burn, however it tastes very, very bad.  I can&#x27;t even use it due to the taste.  Three stars because it works only.</li>
            <li> Love it! The sun does a number on my lips even with SPF 25. I&#x27;m glad i found one that is SPF 45. Recently went on a trip to Mexico and it worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time, and was just as described and pictured. Item protects lips against the sun well and has a great scent.</li>
            <li> My wife uses and has tried many different lip balms.  She said best yet. And I like the taste of her kisses, too.</li>
            <li> Smells WONDERFUL, keeps my lips hydrated and protected from the sun! Doesn&#x27;t wear off in a few minutes leaving me reapplying.</li>
            <li> Fabulous lip balm, lasts on the lips despite snorkeling in the ocean and drinking water. I would love to purchase it in bulk and put it in every purse and car.</li>
            <li> This chap stick leaves a terrible after taste in your mouth after using it. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Definitely kept from getting my lips sunburned but the taste is awful. Once the taste is in your mouth its hard to get out. I just use regular sunscreen on my lips. Works just as good and doesn&#x27;t taste awful.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my honeymoon to SoCal. I really don&#x27;t feel like it kept my lips from getting burnt, even though I put it on religiously. Quite honestly, I feel that the Burt&#x27;s Bees coconut hydrating lip balm worked better and soothing my lips. This didn&#x27;t have a bad &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; atleast, like some do, but I also feel like it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> The best chopstick with spf I have ever tried. Has a pleasant summer-like smell :)</li>
            <li> It does not taste like sunblock and actually smells delicious! Very tropical and very smooth I love it and I have been looking at all chopsticks with high SPF from a $18 Chapstick to $3 and this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I often look for a great smelling, soft lip balm for the summer. This product is just that! Perfect in every way!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it contains an spf 45 sunscreen to protect my lips from harmful rays and I love the cocnut flavor. It keeps my lips moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> Great service and item!</li>
            <li> This one goes on smoother than other lip sunscreens I have tried in the past.  Very nice light flavor too.  My lips sunburn really easily so I have used lots of different products. Definitely this one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go out in the sun without it. I&#x27;ve sunburned my lips in the past and this lipgloss is the way to go</li>
            <li> I live in Florida where the sun shines hot 365 days a year except when it is raining. We are sun burn capitol of the Universe and people often forget about protecting their lips until it is too late like I did. Well I bought this because you cannot put regular sun protection lotion on your lips.&lt;br /&gt;This balm is made just for the lips and goes on like lip balm. It is a waxy like base with SPF 45 and I have only gotten burned once while using it because I was on the lake all day and should have applied it a second time after 4 hours. I have been using this twice a week for a year and the tube still is not empty.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this didn&#x27;t function as sunblock at all for me. I have very sensitive skin and was excited to use this product as my lips have a tendency to burn. I used it repeatedly (applied at least once every 30 minutes) while on the water and my lips still burned pretty badly.  The one positive is that the scent is really nice. I&#x27;m crossing my fingers that another product I just purchased containing Zinc and Titanium will actually work.</li>
            <li> I needed something with high SPF for my lips while golfing and this does the trick. Good price and good quality.</li>
            <li> Did not arrive in a sealed package as shown.&lt;br /&gt;Over priced .</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever tried it is super moisturizing and has SPF it smells great  it&#x27;s better then the eos or the Burt&#x27;s bees I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s not that popualaur</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this chap-stick, given that the SPF was so high.  After using it, I started getting this awful taste in the back of my mouth.  I didn&#x27;t attribute it right away to the product, but the next day it suddenly dawned on me (duh!).  I wish I could get over the taste, but it&#x27;s like a metallic bitterness on the back of my tongue that doesn&#x27;t go away for a good 4 hours.  Blech!</li>
            <li> Favorite!! I Love it...taste, smell and feel :-) My girl stole it from me..had to buy more..lol recommend it highly...;-)</li>
            <li> Hawaiian Tropic Lip Balm is the most effective stick sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used besides one by Burt&#x27;s Bees. I prefer this lip balm as it tastes sweet, is not pasty white and is smooth and silky on my lips. With all the gardening I have to do I need something that will protect me from the sun and SPF 45 seems to work well for at least two hours before it needs to be applied again. This will probably vary from person to person. I haven&#x27;t tried this at a pool but apparently it is water resistant for up to 80 minutes. I&#x27;m happy with this product and will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> Love scent, taste, texture, price</li>
            <li> Bought for Hawaii, worked great. Tastes good too.</li>
            <li> Finally lip balm to protect my ginger lips in the sun!  Quite unbeatable!</li>
            <li> This has a tropical fragrance and flavor which works when you are on a tropical island vacation as I was but I think it would be too much sunscreen and sweet flavor combo for everyday. Good protection and lasts while in the sea!</li>
            <li> It is ok but makes your mouth taste so weird.</li>
            <li> Smells great, glides on smooth, and keeps my lips soft. Trusting that it is protecting my lips from the sun too!</li>
            <li> Great little tube .  Perfect for at the beach.</li>
            <li> Works fine.  Does not pull your skin.  Handy size.  I tool off one star because of price.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best balm I&#x27;ve ever used. Many balms will work temporarily, or moisturize if you keep constantly applying, but this stuff got me through a week in the desert at Burning Man with no problem. I also use Blistex Medicated Lip Ointment which is amazing for healing really bad chapping and cracked lips, but I found that addictive (one of the ingredients is known to contribute to long-term drying even if it&#x27;s great in short-term). This stuff on the other hand doesn&#x27;t leave your lips dry the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;BUT\\&quot;...the unfortunate problem is the aftertaste people have mentioned. The initial taste is great, but after about an hour you have to drink something to get the chemical taste out of your mouth (or at least make it tolerable). I think it might be the sunscreen, so I will have to see if they have any non-sunscreen versions because otherwise this stuff is perfect! It&#x27;s so nasty though that I can only tolerate it when my lips are really bad, instead of as an everyday protectant. So disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to note my friend has not experienced this, though she only used it a few times. It might be one of those chemicals that some people can taste and others cannot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;~UPDATE~&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve finally found it! The Natural Ice SPF 30 Sport is every bit as good as this but without the horrible aftertaste. (Go for the Sport version, it&#x27;s lighter and doesn&#x27;t have that gross sticky wax feel.) -&gt; [[ASIN:B0000537HB Natural Ice Lip Protectant/sunscreen sport SPF 30, 0.16-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 12)]]</li>
            <li> This would be a terrible lip balm if it wasn&#x27;t for the SPF in it. Luckily I bought it specifically for the SPF, which is why I am giving it as high of a review as I am. The SPF works great, however it is pretty on-par for chapstick-style lip balm. Not really moisturizing, just leaves a waxy feeling on your lips and keeps them from feeling dry and flakey- doesn&#x27;t actually &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; the problem. It also has an awful chemical flavor once their added flavor/fragrance (which is lovely btw) wears off, but that is something I am used to with lip balms that have any SPF over 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR:&lt;br /&gt;Not Moisturizing; SPF works great; Chemical aftertaste; Nice fragrance (before it fades)&lt;br /&gt;Rank as Lip Balm: 4.5/10&lt;br /&gt;Rank as SPF: 9.5/10&lt;br /&gt;Rank on Fragrance/Flavor: Before Fade- 7/10, After Fade - 4/10&lt;br /&gt;Rank on Packaging: 10/10&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 7.1/10&lt;br /&gt;If you are buying this for the lip balm aspect, skip it.&lt;br /&gt;If you are buying this for the SPF, buy it.&lt;br /&gt;If you are sensitive to smells/flavors, skip it.&lt;br /&gt;If you want something to torture your flavor/fragrance sensitive friends, buy it.</li>
            <li> My favorite lip balm and sunscreen...looked for several years to find the original and finally realized they changed the packaging. I admit I like the old brown better but the product does what it always has...works!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and just love it.  If I want to say it is just great why do I need to say it in 20 words and why do I need a headline.</li>
            <li> Smells great and protected my lips while out in the ocean.  I don&#x27;t know about the weird taste people were referring to,  as I applied every hour.  Hard to find a lip balm that has a spf of this rating as well as the great smell (pina colada?)</li>
            <li> bought this for my niece and she seems to really like it!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff!  Has a unique flavor that isnt overwhelming, and keeps your lips moist for hours without having to reapply, and it has 45 SPF and for someone like me that is prone to fever blisters from the sun, this has been really helpful in avoiding them!</li>
