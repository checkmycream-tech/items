            <li>For this on a lighting deal.. Love the box and how it package...</li>
            <li>My husband love when I put this on...</li>
            <li>Everything smells great, is high quality, and this set in particular has a very nice assortment of items.  </li>
            <li>The smell is sweet and nice..</li>
            <li>My sister absolutely loves Philosophy Amazing Grace, and the box it came in is so elegant.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t strong but lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>I was blessed with getting this at a special price during the holidays which helped me be able to purchase it for myself.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love the soft scent.  </li>
            <li>Huge, fabulous presentation box.</li>
            <li>A great gift- especially for yourself.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous set.  </li>
            <li>I appreciated getting all of these products at such a great price!</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite scent since the first time I smelled it on someone.  </li>
            <li>The spray fragrance alone was worth more than I paid for this whole set!!</li>
            <li>By far this was the best purchase I made during the entire holiday season.</li>
            <li>Love Philosphy in general, so this is Fabulous!</li>
            <li>The sizes of the items inside are full size.  </li>
            <li>While the body wash smells great, and the body butter is actually pretty good, the spray fragrance doesn&#x27;t last more than half an hour.  </li>
            <li>It is so fresh and clean smelling.  </li>
            <li>Typical great Philosophy quality</li>
            <li>and I figured it was worth what I paid for it for the sprays.</li>
            <li>Got it on the Gold box special for $42 - never would be able to get it that cheaply any other time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a super classy gift that says &amp;#34;I&#x27;m thoughtful, and I care about you!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>She loves the scent (a bit powdery for me) and was excited about the new products in the scent she had not tried.</li>
            <li>My mom also liked that the set was with full sizes rather than little samples.</li>
            <li>The box was so pretty</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>If you love the Philosophy brand, this set is definitely for you.  </li>
            <li>My only regret is not buying a couple more for gifts.</li>
            <li>The box is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>And the hand lotion is really greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, subtle stuff.  </li>
            <li>Delicate clean light scent.</li>
            <li>I split the box which was large and made several gifts out of them.</li>
            <li>However, when I used the body butter and the hand cream, both seem to be old.</li>

            <li> Bought the set for my mom at the lighting deal. My mom loves the set. The box is very sturdy. My mom also liked that the set was with full sizes rather than little samples. She also likes the scent. The scent is not very strong.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a lightning deal.  I am usually sensitive to any fragrance due to asthma/allergy but this one doesn&#x27;t affect me negatively. I love, love, love the soft scent.  The sizes of the items inside are full size.  The hand cream is like shea butter cream in thickness.  The scent isn&#x27;t strong but lasts all day.  It&#x27;s not the kind where if you put it up to your face it stings!  It&#x27;s good, subtle stuff.  The box was so pretty I hesitated to put it out in the trash.  It&#x27;s a a BEAUTIFUL gift set.  I almost (almost!) feel guilty keeping it to myself.  Wish I could have bought more than one on the lightning sale.</li>
            <li> Perfect Christmas present for my mother-in-law! She  totally loved it! And even better that it was a lightning deal for 50% off!</li>
            <li> I smelled this in a store and thought it was nice...soft and feminine. When a &amp;#34;deal&amp;#34; came up I thought I&#x27;d get this set. Not sure why, but it didn&#x27;t smell the same as I remembered from the store.</li>
            <li> I appreciated getting all of these products at such a great price! I would do it again if offered. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I gave this set as a gift to my mother and she was thrilled. She loves the scent (a bit powdery for me) and was excited about the new products in the scent she had not tried. Great value and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> This set was a steal during Amazon&#x27;s lightning sale over the holidays.  If you love the Philosophy brand, this set is definitely for you.  Everything smells great, is high quality, and this set in particular has a very nice assortment of items.  My only regret is not buying a couple more for gifts.</li>
            <li> Huge, fabulous presentation box. Unbeatable Lightning Deal price. Perfect variety of products in my favorite scent. A great gift- especially for yourself.</li>
            <li> Purchased this a gift for my best girlfriend. It&#x27;s wrapped and under the tree waiting! I know that she will love it, who wouldn&#x27;t!! The box is sturdy and lined with velvet! It&#x27;s a super classy gift that says &amp;#34;I&#x27;m thoughtful, and I care about you!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I LOVE the scent of this!  I was extremely pleased with the sprays. However, when I used the body butter and the hand cream, both seem to be old. They are very thick and have that strange odor that a product sometimes gets when you&#x27;ve had it for too long. I would have returned it but I wanted to keep the sprays.  I got it on the lightning deal and I figured it was worth what I paid for it for the sprays.</li>
            <li> Great product, wonderful assortment, incredibly packaged in a ready to give gift box. Sickest price imaginable. So happy I grabbed one. This is going to make one fantastic gift!</li>
            <li> Got it on the Gold box special for $42 - never would be able to get it that cheaply any other time. Love Philosphy in general, so this is Fabulous!</li>

My sister absolutely loves Philosophy Amazing Grace, and the box it came in is so elegant. By far this was the best purchase I made during the entire holiday season.</li>
            <li> Typical great Philosophy quality however I am just not fond of the scent.  I split the box which was large and made several gifts out of them.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Amazing Grace by Philosophy.  This is a fabulous set.  I was blessed with getting this at a special price during the holidays which helped me be able to purchase it for myself.  Delicate clean light scent.</li>
            <li> For this on a lighting deal.. Love the box and how it package... The smell is sweet and nice.. My husband love when I put this on...</li>
            <li> I got an awesome price on this set of Amazing Grace items.  The spray fragrance alone was worth more than I paid for this whole set!!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! This has been my favorite scent since the first time I smelled it on someone.  I had to have it.  It is so fresh and clean smelling.  Most perfumes overwhelm me, but this one has the perfect light fresh smell.</li>
            <li> I bought the body wash alone for someone else, and loved the scent.  When this was a gold box deal, I snapped it up.  While the body wash smells great, and the body butter is actually pretty good, the spray fragrance doesn&#x27;t last more than half an hour.  And the hand lotion is really greasy.</li>
            <li> I always buy my gift sets from Amazon as they offer the best prices.  I bought this for my mom, as Philosophy Amazing Grace is her favorite scent.  She loves this stuff, and I loved the price.  It makes for a really great gift for that special lady in your life.  Will definitely buy it again.</li>
