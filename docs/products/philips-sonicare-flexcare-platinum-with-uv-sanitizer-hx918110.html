            <li>Great to know when you are in a hurry for work or bed..</li>
            <li>This Philips Sonicare is a great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The UV sanitizer works great, I guess.</li>
            <li>which is what makes this technology so great...  </li>
            <li>Love this!!  </li>
            <li>A three week life is what is claimed which makes it very nice to travel with, and a travel charger and case are included.  </li>

            <li>Your teeth will feel amazing after using it!</li>
            <li>I also am LOVING the extended battery life with this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>designed, well made, highly effective and attractive as well.</li>
            <li>a superior clean&lt;br</li>
            <li>My advice: a good choice</li>
            <li>Anyway, the units need to be replaced periodically and when this came available on Vine the timing was perfect.</li>
            <li>After you get used to the feel of this, you will find yourself brushing longer with it for it just works so good.  </li>
            <li>Also, you can find a good deal on replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; The Good Stuff &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;</li>
            <li>The good news is that it is rated for 120-240v.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The good news is that it is rated for 120-240v.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since this model has a &amp;#34;GUM&amp;#34; setting this fit my needs perfectly.  </li>
            <li>This is a sleek, attractive unit which should look good in any bathroom and also stay looking good for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>If I get brave, I may get another head and experiment more, because I</li>
            <li>If I get brave, I may get another head and experiment more, because I</li>
            <li>Glad she didn&#x27;t want it, works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and best of all, it works!</li>
            <li>and we have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Great product for keeping teeth/gums healthy.</li>
            <li>I suggest you try it at all levels and find what&#x27;s best and most comfortable for you...</li>
            <li>Love the UV sanitizer too!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I have been a Sonicare fan for many years; using them has helped me avoid additional gum surgery - a procedure which I would not wish on anyone!</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is really easy to handle and lighter to hold, does a great job in cleaning/gum check/</li>
            <li>I honestly don’t know if there’s any way to prove it’s truly working, but I’m taking its word on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I honestly don’t know if there’s any way to prove it’s truly working, but I’m taking its word on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Reminder bristles ensure you are getting an effective clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so i like to post an honest review .</li>
            <li>To be honest, after trying all modes I think this is a bit of a gimmick</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just nice to know that it will do the job of killing bacteria and viruses.</li>
            <li>Flexcare Platinum toothbrush with the UV Sanitizer from Amazon for an honest review.</li>
            <li>, it does a nice job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s quite nice to have everything in one tidy port.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So this upgrade is kind of like going from a 1991 Ford to a 2015</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just turn that off and wing it on my own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and</li>
            <li>(I’ll note here that I am *extremely* sensitive to sounds and textures, so if you connect with that, this might not be the best toothbrush for you.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that I will be able to switch to these modes if I choose or increase the intensity as I desire.  </li>
            <li>The brush does a good job cleaning, and it is comfortable.</li>
            <li>The heads are more effective and I notice my teeth are whiter.</li>
            <li>I will say that, so far, this toothbrush is the best toothbrush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>We have been very impressed with the Philips Sonicare toothbrush system so far.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is well worth the money and leaves your teeth feeling great.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode has been determined to be the most effective in clinical studies and is the default setting.  </li>
            <li>I love how this works and my teeth looking super great.</li>
            <li>I am very happy so far, &amp; I hope the units hold up for many years to come.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush and it is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first Sonicare and I am beyond happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re both very light and portable.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Philips</li>
            <li>I was worried that my teeth/mouth wouldn&#x27;t get as clean, but I am very satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>I kept hoping I would just get used to it, and I tried the different settings, but after realizing I was dreading using the thing, I decided this might not be the best toothbrush for me.</li>
            <li>so I set it lower and have been able to use it without discomfort since.  </li>
            <li>store my toothbrush on the charger as it&#x27;s most convenient</li>
            <li>I had to order them, which would include postage charges for many.  </li>
            <li>I still love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Very happy I finally listened to my dentist and got this product.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gentler on the gums than what I remember from many years ago.  </li>
            <li>This is so much better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that this one comes with the UV sanitizer.</li>
            <li>seems to be a lot better than a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Removes up to 100% more plaque than a manual</li>
            <li>&gt;  44% more bristles for a more thorough clean&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this one...</li>
            <li>best of all...feel like such came out of dentist cleaning.  </li>
            <li>It has more of a metal look.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a huge deal, wasn&#x27;t worth taking a star away as it is still a great product.</li>
            <li>you get a better understanding.</li>
            <li>now I&#x27;m so so vey pleased.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using for four months and we love this tooth brush</li>
            <li>latest</li>
            <li>(Top Shelf ...)&lt;</li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t figured out how to make them all work, I love that this toothbrush has three cleaning modes and three intensity settings.</li>
            <li>Smartimer makes sure you don&#x27;t rush to brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love, love, love the UV sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>I may use that feature perhaps weekly at most just because it is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We also love that it has a UV sanitizer built-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get more used to it</li>
            <li>but I almost feel that the oral b does a better job of cleaning around the gum line.</li>
            <li>Be sure to register online for a 2 1/2 year warranty.</li>
            <li>The Flexcare Platinum is an upgrade of the excellent HX6950 that I have been using for several years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am glad to have the UV sanitizer, I did not get that model when I bougt the HX6950.  </li>
            <li>Love the 3 added features for speed</li>
            <li>I love the travel kit.</li>
            <li>Still, it seems to work well, and for most trips I don&#x27;t take a charger anyway.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to upgrade to the Platinum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>and they did not indicate that my teeth or gums are any better.</li>
            <li>most who are vigilant about their teeth, flossing and water irrigation is still mandatory....</li>
            <li>Love the sanitizer as well</li>
            <li>i&#x27;d love to, it&#x27;s outstanding, gorgeous, wonderful, terrific, particular, amazing, &amp; fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;it couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
            <li>I loved my old brushes but these new improvements are perfect!</li>
            <li>Recommended for the most discerning of brushes who want the best, despite its cost and minor flaws...</li>
            <li>Recommended for the most discerning of brushes who want the best, despite its cost and minor flaws...</li>
            <li>My teeth are very important to me and, since I&#x27;ve had some dental problems through the years, I&#x27;m very particular about a good dental hygiene regimen.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s charge for a long time and does an excellent job cleaning my teeth!  </li>
            <li>things considered, I am happy with the new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>things considered, I am happy with the new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>But the intercare brush heads work much better at giving a strong cleaning.</li>
            <li>Heretofore I’d been pleased with the way my Braun worked, however, when I fired up the Philips Flexcare Platinum, I was in for a huge surprise.</li>
            <li>I like using the timer because it&#x27;s a reminder to brush longer, rather than harder, to best care for your teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More importantly, it is comforting.</li>
            <li>It looked cooler than this brush, but a lot of the studies found that while they both did an amazing job of cleaning, Sonicares were consistently rated (just slightly) better than their Oral-B counterparts.</li>
            <li>Makes sure Im brushing for the recommended amount of time and the sanitizer makes sure that my toothbrush is secure and not being exposed and is clean.  </li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt so clean and wonderful, but using this particular toothbrush was pure torture for me.</li>
            <li>It was easy to adjust to and leaves my teeth feeling cleaner than with an old-fashioned toothbrush.</li>
            <li>so it is easy to change settings by accident.</li>
            <li>comes with a helpful, easy to understand manual.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and comes with a compact travel stand.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and is always charged.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels clean and refreshing after I brush.</li>
            <li>That being said, it&#x27;s something that you get used to very quickly, and, fall easily for when you start to see the results.  </li>
            <li>all of its features, the toothbrush is still relatively easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>My checkups and cleanings have been good, with minimal plaque needing removed and my gums are in good shape as well.  </li>
            <li>The whole design is beautiful and very practical</li>
            <li>easy to use, easy to clean and now sanitize.</li>
            <li>still had some leftover old Pro Results brushheads, and fortunately they are perfectly compatible with this new brush.</li>
            <li>It’s compact and attractive, and has a low battery indicator light.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I think that it&#x27;s best to buy from reliable sources, even if it costs a few dollars more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one has a slim handle that feels like  a manual toothbrush and its light.</li>
            <li>Fantastic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have a tendency to brush a tad overzealously, so the feature was important to me.</li>
            <li>It comes fit for one person&#x27;s use and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>Really cheap in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>it is downright cheap...</li>
            <li>It comes fit for one person&#x27;s use and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>Really cheap in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>it is downright cheap...</li>
            <li>Great price, cheaper than buying at your dental office or local stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m inclined to have bacterial infections, so anything I can do to reduce that is important to</li>
            <li>yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The added bonus with this brush is the UV light.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great step into the future with Sonicare!  </li>
            <li>After using only 3 months my dentist noticed a great improvement.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li>The timer and different modes are very effective for what they are designed for.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel really smooth and clean after use.</li>
            <li>It tends to do a good job but has 1 major flaw.  </li>
            <li>By the way, our dentist recommended the Philips system over the Oral-B because the Philips heads are larger in size, so they cover more teeth surface thus removing more plaque easier and more efficiently.</li>
            <li>He also commented that his teeth have never felt so clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel almost hygenist-visit clean after using it</li>
            <li>It gets my teeth squeaky clean and even whitens them.</li>
            <li>There are a variety of intensities and settings (whitening, gum care, and clean) to choose from.</li>
            <li>Otherwise 5 stars for clean teeth and working gums.</li>
            <li>I like the beeps at four intervals which reminds me to clean all four portions  of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>a 3 pack of the Diamond Clean brush heads is $38.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the Diamond Clean brush heads highlights list the following:&lt;br</li>
            <li>brush also feels easy to hold - better than my older model.</li>
            <li>stick with this brand because I like the way they clean my teeth</li>
            <li>In the end, I went with this one because it had the &amp;#34;brushing too hard&amp;#34; warning, which is not something the Diamond Clean had.</li>
            <li>so my toothbrush is always clean.</li>
            <li>Sonicare has 3 brushing modes to clean, remove plaque, and massage gums.</li>
            <li>The built-in timer on the clean setting automatically turns off the machine at 2 minutes, the recommended brushing time, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes that Pilips recommends are Diamond Clean, InterCare, ProResults and Sonicare</li>
            <li>I find myself cleaning it out like once a week because I&#x27;m a clean freak.</li>
            <li>husband’s experience with it has been much more positive.</li>
            <li>As for between the teeth cleaning...floss is always the best, but a toothbrush should do a good job of cleaning those harder to reach areas, again Philips seems to lack in that area unless I press down which it hates.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use right out of the box and charging for 24 hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a great product and it doesnt make deafning sound which i read some of the other electric toothbrushes make.</li>
            <li>There are several buttons on the body, and it is all too easy to change the speed setting when you are using the brush, especially since I am not at my best just before or after bed.</li>
            <li>There are several buttons on the body, and it is all too easy to change the speed setting when you are using the brush, especially since I am not at my best just before or after bed.</li>
            <li>I always know I&#x27;m brushing the right amount of time and my tooth brush is always clean and secure with the sanitizer.</li>
            <li>really* wish I could get comfortable with this brush!</li>
            <li>really* wish I could get comfortable with this brush!</li>
            <li>On my box it states that it comes with a 90 day, 100% satisfaction guarantee (full refund) and a two year warranty.  </li>
            <li>Sonicare recommends placing it on the charger for a full 24 hrs.</li>
            <li>10% full power.  </li>
            <li>Basically, for more money you get a more indicators, a higher vibration speed,  more “modes” and sometimes some gizmos (an external timer, travel case, UV sanitizer).  </li>
            <li>(It holds a charge for a full three weeks.)</li>
            <li>According to Philips, the toothbrush provides up to 31,000 strokes per minute, to provide exceptionally deep cleaning, plaque removal, and to promote good gum health.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really compare specs, but the brush speed and frequency sure seem faster.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not bad at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would be able to continue as my teeth seemed too sensitive</li>
            <li>I truly love that new feeling on my teeth after brushing with Philips Sonicare Flexcare PLATINUM!</li>
            <li>Warranty signup with Phillips went well and quickly.  </li>
            <li>You probably don&#x27;t need this much toothbrush, but it sure is fun.</li>
            <li>would \\&quot;go beyond traditional cleaning to deliver exceptional plaque</li>
            <li>I accepted their challenge and decided to test their bold claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall this is an excellent brushing system that I can&#x27;t even imagine it being on a match with anything, except another similar ultrasonic system.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is an excellent brushing system that I can&#x27;t even imagine it being on a match with anything, except another similar ultrasonic system.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, a Quick Start guide is included, along with the users’ manual and a warranty card.</li>
            <li>Super Cleaning Machine.</li>
            <li>My dentist just laughed when I asked him about it, and told me if I was really worried about infecting myself with my own germs to just use a little alcohol on the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>overall very satisfied.</li>
            <li>This model is very powerful and your teeth really do feel super clean after you use it.</li>
            <li>I love the new design and the container you put to brush head inside to sanitize the brush head.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another favorite with the new brush is the separate travel charger and travel case supplied with the Platinum model.  </li>
            <li>so the change in vibration (and sound) which I am doing so has trained me quickly to stop applying so much</li>
            <li>so the change in vibration (and sound) which I am doing so has trained me quickly to stop applying so much</li>
            <li>The pressure sensor that prevents brushing too hard is a very good feature.</li>
            <li>The brush provides audio alert when each quadrant of the mouth should be sufficiently brushed, a nice feature, as its easy to go too fast..  </li>
            <li>I just ordered an extra pack of brushes to go with this amazing</li>
            <li>I really do buy into the the value of ultra sonic, as the the sound waves hit areas between the teeth where mechanical brushing could never reach...</li>
            <li>I had been using a battery powered toothbrush for several years that I liked but there is just no comparison after using this one.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if they came in different colors to make it easier to tell them apart</li>
            <li>hope this review is useful.</li>
            <li>The jury is out as to which shape I prefer; both offer their distinct advantages.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one cleans so much better than the old pro-results.</li>
            <li>All I can say is, wow, it really is an improvement, even over their own budget line.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this powerful, multi-speed toothbrush for two weeks now and my teeth feel cleaner and look brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a nicely designed unit which is an evolutionary change from prior Sonicare products and is recommended.</li>
            <li>The last one of its kind I ever used was just a cheap vibrating one that perhaps did a better job than regular brushing, but it was nothing like this baby.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember a time when I have felt my mouth so fresh.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth switching.</li>
            <li>It does come with a smaller portable charger and a travel case so you can take this with you when you&#x27;re not at home in your own bathroom.</li>
            <li>it was worth obtaining.  </li>
            <li>This is a replacement for my old Philips Sonicare, and they do seem to get better every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its made of a totally smooth shiny finish that easily slips out of your hand, even when they are not wet.  </li>
            <li>Its made of a totally smooth shiny finish that easily slips out of your hand, even when they are not wet.  </li>
            <li>Right now I have a couple of 2mm pockets, plus some bone loss around one tooth that they will keep an eye on.  </li>
            <li>A full charge will last more than five days.</li>
            <li>The UV light to disinfect the brushes is a brilliant idea, long over due IMO....</li>
            <li>UV cleaner is a big plus for oral products like this as it helps to keep the bacteria minimum and good for all new replacement brush to go through the UV cleaning before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The toothbrush has more settings and it seems built better than the previous models I used from Philips.</li>
            <li>Just be aware of the high level of vibrating, in case you’re sensitive to that kind of thing.spots for two brush heads.</li>
            <li>Just be aware of the high level of vibrating, in case you’re sensitive to that kind of thing.</li>
            <li>promised I would be able to \\&quot;Enjoy three weeks of brushing on a single charge.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Be warned that the battery takes 24 hours to charge the first time it’s used, but once charged is good for around 30x brushing sessions, so if you’re going on a trip for several days you shouldn’t need to pack the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: very stylish, very effective, lots of nice features but at the current price, rather expensive when compared to earlier Sonicare models.</li>
            <li>It does a great job for the past 2 months.</li>
            <li>A matte finish, or even better, a nice rubber grip on it would be a big plus, especially for what you are paying for this thing.  </li>

            <li>Comes with a travel case, a travel charger, and a normal charger that has a UV light.</li>
            <li>I like the fit and finish better than any previous Philips brush, and it seems easier to keep clean.</li>
            <li>the most intense brushing the unit can apply and I am finding that even though the brush head is smaller than the one on the older model, it does a much better job.  </li>
            <li>I have been more than pleased with this little investment.</li>
            <li>I do also wonder if the UV light might cause the bristles to break down more quickly.</li>
            <li>I certainly do, damn it!</li>
            <li>far as the sanitizer, it’s easy to use.</li>
            <li>far as the sanitizer, it’s easy to use.</li>
            <li>find the brush easy to use - easier than my old one.</li>
            <li>I bought one for myself to try out, loved it so much, bought one each for my older son and husband, and bought the Kids Sonicare for my younger ones.</li>
            <li>In short, I am one happy camper and will never go back to my Braun.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a powerful rechargeable toothbrush, and I think my dental hygienist will be pleased during my next cleaning and dental examination.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, took a little getting used to the different spin rate, much higher than the Oral B it replaced.</li>
            <li>After getting the news a month and a half ago, I researched the best and narrowed it down to this on of the Diamond Clean.</li>
            <li>But with only three cleaning modes, and three speed/intensity modes, it&#x27;s more user friendly than older sonicare brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this platinum flexcare very much.</li>
            <li>The work the dentist must do to remove plaque from my teeth since I started using this brush has been very significantly reduced, so I feel quite comfortable using the same brush with both toothbrushes since I already have a supply on hand.nificantly reduced, so I feel quite comfortable using the same brush with both toothbrushes since I already have a supply on hand.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd toothbrush in their lineup and so far I&#x27;ve been quite impressed with every single one.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush and highly recommend it even for people with sensitive teeth and/or gums.</li>
            <li>This one seems to be a higher power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first Sonicare toothbrush and I have been using it for about a year.</li>
            <li>Then there is the automatic pressure sensor that bothered me at first too, but this has also been overcome with the lowered intensity and repeated use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first unit was &amp;#34;retired&amp;#34; after years of dependable use.</li>
            <li>First up is one that is mentioned often here in others reviews.  </li>
            <li>First things first</li>
            <li>This is my second Phillips Sonicare toothbrush and this one work much better than the Sonicare elite.</li>
            <li>This is my first sonic toothbrush</li>
            <li>/&gt;According to the writeup, the Sonicare Platinum comes with a newly designed InterCare brush head to remove 7 times more plaque between teeth than a manual brush thanks to new tufting technology and longer bristles.</li>
            <li>only issue I had with it was that it&#x27;s hard to find the perfect way to hold the brush handle without inadvertently changing the mode or shutting the power off.</li>
            <li>I have an old sonicare that I thought worked well, but this thing cleans my mouth like it&#x27;s never been clean before.</li>
            <li>your current Flexcare or Flexcare+ is on its last leg, this is a good purchase.  </li>
            <li>I find that I can get them at my local ware house store for a much more reasonable price.ys</li>
            <li>I find that I can get them at my local ware house store for a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Recently had a visit to my dentist to have my teeth cleaned and the hygienist asked if I was using a sonic toothbrush because my teeth were so clean!  </li>
            <li>And my first experience with it was that it takes some real getting used too.  </li>
            <li>The buttons are clearly identified, and one full 24-hour charge should give about three weeks of power.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another new feature is the pressure sensor that tell you by a change in vibration and a slight sound if you are exerting more pressure on teeth and gums than you specified when you adjusted the intensity level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy snap-on brush head fits multiple handles</li>
            <li>Would certainly recommend for anyone with gum problems.</li>
            <li>All the features of that brush have been retained and several new features have been added which give you more control of your brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>This version has a new kind of brush head, but I did not find it significantly different than my current “Healthy White” version.  </li>
            <li>but two more \\&quot;intensity cycles\\&quot;.  Makes little difference to me because I have only used the longest and most intense settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All around a very effective brushing system that would be very hard to beat...</li>
            <li>It comes straight out of the box ready to use, but it does recommend charging for 24 hours before use.</li>
            <li>It is MUCH quitter, the brush much MUCH faster</li>
            <li>and it feels really gentle on my teeth and gums.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the UV sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>I can see the light and get a visual confirmation that it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li>model I purchased also comes with a travel charger and travel case - very helpful.</li>
            <li>since my use i really feel My gums are stronger</li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums and have found that some single-setting electric toothbrushes are too powerful.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&gt;The travel case and travel charger doesn&#x27;t take up too much room in my carry-on suitcase.  </li>
            <li>There are 3 levels of power available and alternate cleaning modes which are supposed to enhance tooth whiteness and gum health.</li>
            <li>I find that having a zillion modes does not matter much, one tends to pick one and use that all the time anyway.  </li>
            <li>I find that having a zillion modes does not matter much, one tends to pick one and use that all the time anyway.  </li>
            <li>really like the sanitizer that comes with</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a month of using it as directed, I have noticed my gums really are healing.</li>
            <li>While the FlexCare Platinum has lots of bells and whistles, it still does very well what it&#x27;s designed to do, which is brush</li>
            <li>Charging takes a long time [around 8 hours], but a full charge will last you a couple of weeks or more.</li>
            <li>This brush doesn&#x27;t really let you scrape away at your tongue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping my dentist will comment on how much cleaner my teeth are.  </li>
            <li>I really like about this newest version</li>
            <li>really like the choices of brushing intensity and the UV Sanitizer a lot.  </li>
            <li>And all I can say is that this is most certainly not your fathers electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I opened the new toothbrush, charged it, and then was won over the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>As long as you bought more toothbrush heads and charged a little more often, up to 3 people could use this set with ease.</li>
            <li>As long as you bought more toothbrush heads and charged a little more often, up to 3 people could use this set with ease.</li>
            <li>various rechargeable Sonicares all clean very well.  </li>
            <li>The cycle takes something like 20 minutes to complete and afterward, your brush heads have benefited from whatever benefit exposure to a major source of UV light confers.</li>
            <li>It looks more modern than some of the other, older brushes.</li>
            <li>Really like my new Sonicare!  </li>
            <li>In addition to the physical vibration of the bristles on the teeth, ‘Sonicare’ electric toothbrushes utilize ultrasonic cleaning, as used in hospital sterile service units to clean the gunk off surgical instruments.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can even use straight hydrogen peroxide with the sonicare without it being too agressive and removing to much skin from my gums like a normal toothbrush wold.</li>
            <li>with the HX6950 there are 3 brushing modes:  clean, white  and gum care.  </li>
            <li>I would have loved if Philips would have at least brought over the USB Charging Case from the DiamondClean model to this new</li>
            <li>First, the supplier shipped an old Flexcare brush, like the one I am replacing.  </li>
            <li>If you set it to the highest setting, a full charge will last you about two weeks.</li>
            <li>The different intensities is nice for those with sensitive teeth or different brushing habits.  </li>
            <li>but if you’re on a budget, wait for the price to come down – which it surely will.</li>
            <li>in all, I love this thing, and I&#x27;m not going to mark it down because of the timer system.  </li>
            <li>The real difference of this brush over the conventional ones is it actually &amp;#34;vibrate&amp;#34; at very high frequency which essentially it&#x27;s like very fine brushing on the teeth giving them the squeaking clean effect over and over.</li>
            <li>This combo was too rough on my mouth, and my dentist easily identified this by the receding gum line over my front teeth, so she suggested the sonicare</li>
            <li>I will say, it takes a decent amount of force to make the pressure sensor go off.</li>
            <li>the handle is a very simple and quick process.  </li>
            <li>I apparently have super sensitive teeth, because this thing hurt me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>I do think the price is high, but the product works well.  </li>
            <li>5 stars highly recommended product with no hesitations.</li>
            <li>I suspect I will have to use it for a few months and see if my dentist notices any difference, but it sure &amp;#34;seems&amp;#34; better, which is probably half the battle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the advances are starting to follow the smart phone formula, of every 1.5 years  ;)</li>
            <li>It moves a lot faster than the old brush did, and it really does leave the teeth feeling well cleaned and cared for.</li>
            <li>This thing vibrates so fast with a back and forth motion that you can&#x27;t really observe it doing much of anything just running.  </li>
            <li>The action of this brush is gentle yet thorough, and my mouth felt as though I’d just come from the dentist’s office.</li>
            <li>feels like concrete stuck on your teeth...</li>
            <li>He’s normal, unlike me, so he’s had no issue with pain/discomfort while using it.</li>
            <li>I have had this Sonicare toothbrush for a few weeks now and really do love it.  </li>
            <li>It would also be nice if at least one &amp;#34;spare&amp;#34; brush was included.</li>
            <li>Unlike many reviewers, I am not upgrading from an earlier model Philips Sonicare but from a Braun (still working, but old enough that I have to buy replacement brush heads on eBay!)</li>
            <li>These settings can be changed while you are brushing, so if you are using medium or high, you can quickly change to the low setting for a sensitive area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you have a good product, don&#x27;t completely change it, just add minor tweaks and or fix any concerns people had with the previous version.  </li>
            <li>Entirely too easy to knock it off, especially with all the stuff on my bathroom</li>
            <li>and just ended up buying the new brush</li>
            <li>With the Flexcare Platinum Philips introduced the new Intercare brush head.  </li>
            <li>Reminder bristles let you know when to use a new InterCare&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advanced</li>
            <li>I have owned a couple Sonicare toothbrushes so when I needed a new one I decided to stick with the brand.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel cleaner and appear whiter since moving to this new brush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on this information it seems like the DiamondClean brush which is cheaper is better at cleaning, but really this may come down to personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush which i purchased after reading all the reviews in amazon.com, have to say the reviews are really helpful as certain times you are keen on something but due to the review</li>
            <li>I looked up reviews for all the Philips Sonicare toothbrushes and a few Oral B ones, I choose this one and so far I am really enjoying it.</li>
            <li>There is an internal timer that keeps the toothbrush running for 2 minutes in the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode, the minimum time that studies have shown should be spent on the brushing in order to do the most good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This thing has a small degree of very fast movement and leaves your mouth extraordinarily clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really obvious that this device is doing a better job than manual or some other electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>but I think we&#x27;ll try to mark the brush heads with our first initial or something using a permanent ink marker.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a big difference in the cleanliness and whiteness of my teeth even in the first week of use.</li>
            <li>Wow!.  </li>
            <li>Meaning its functions are pretty basic for a $200 toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have to confess, I&#x27;m a pretty big fan of Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>If you are thinking of buying this for your whole family, you better order the extra brush attachments along with it, and they are not cheap.  </li>
            <li>If you are thinking of buying this for your whole family, you better order the extra brush attachments along with it, and they are not cheap.  </li>
            <li>Though you can&#x27;t seem to change the type of cleaning (clean, white or gum care) while you are actually cleaning.</li>
            <li>Long lasting battery on this new model, the ad above claims 3 weeks on a single charge, good to know if you travel and bring it along...  </li>
            <li>addition, the unit you hold is small, thin and light making it easy to manipulate and much easier to use for those who may have an issue with grip or small hands or both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, and I think this important, the fit and finish of the unit, how well it manages the gaps in its assembly</li>
            <li>I switched to this one a week ago and so far they seem pretty similar.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The unit is more slim than my prior one and with head attached is slightly longer.</li>
            <li>The either unique or at least unusual features are the UV sanitizing chamber and the extremely high frequency</li>
            <li>have not noticed any discomfort when using the Sonicare FlexCare, but I have noticed that when the toothbrush is fully charged, it definitely emits a certain amount of pressure.</li>
            <li>The new buttons on the toothbrush are raised with a very small gap around them, I&#x27;m concerned if water will be able to get into the brush if I rinse the handle.  </li>
            <li>But it is nice having it especially if you&#x27;re concerned you may be brushing too hard.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear as day, as the saying goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the sanitizer as much as you&#x27;d expect so don&#x27;t go too far over board with extra accessories</li>
            <li>Trying them side by side, you can tell a clear difference in that the intercare has the advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is much better for each person to have their own base if you want any peace in your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Flexcare Platinum with UV Sanitizer is as complete a toothbrush set as one can imagine.</li>
            <li>far as I can tell all the brush head replacements look identical.  </li>
            <li>I caution you to watch where you buy them as I&#x27;ve found reports that some of the really &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; deals have resulted in receiving inferior brushes, probably Chinese knock-offs.  </li>
            <li>In my experience this made teeth feel clearing by an order of magnitude and showcases manual brushing is inferior for most common usage.</li>
            <li>When I was deciding on a replacement for my old sonicare, I chose this model for the modes and sanitizer.</li>
            <li>I had  been using the old system (I think it was E) for about three years.</li>
            <li>I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes since you had to buy them directly from the dentist.  </li>
            <li>They all work on the same principle, fast vibration.  </li>
            <li>Its rather big and very slippery when using it.  </li>
            <li>r big and very slippery when using it.  </li>
            <li>You still need to replace the brush head every 3 months just like our old oral-b system.</li>
            <li>In addition, the set includes a UV sanitizer to make sure that your brush is thoroughly disinfected and the manufacturer recommends that you put your brush in at least weekly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be interested to see how long the UV bulb lasts, time will tell.</li>
            <li>three intensities levels and three brushing modes, one of which is a “gums-soft” for sensitive gums</li>
            <li>The InterCare brush head comes with the FlexCare Platinum, but ProResults has worked very well for me during the several years I have used it.  </li>
            <li>The brush still has some rubbery material on it, and attracts toothpaste buildup, but nothing like the old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve had one visit the dentist</li>
            <li>is the varying modes that it offers.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to toss away the old heads</li>
            <li>I have a separate one for my old brush</li>
            <li>Carrying the old unit around proved to be quite cumbersome and</li>
            <li>They went from round to oblong with dimpled back for better grip</li>
            <li>new feature allows you to adjust the intensity setting, choice are low, medium and high.</li>
            <li>The part number for these &amp;#34;Inter Care Replacement Brush Heads&amp;#34; is HX9002/64, and you can find them here, on Amazon, or at many other local department/big box stores if they aren&#x27;t sold out, as my local stores were.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a home microbiology lab, so no way to tell if the blue light does anything other than amuse the cat.</li>
            <li>Price is a little high but worth it.</li>
            <li>Good quality batteries in the spinbrush do last a long time but as you get closer &amp; closer to dead batteries, it is only running at approx.</li>
            <li>other feature which marks this apart from other electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used is the energetic action of the head.</li>
            <li>The UV Sanitizer is pretty cool, but I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s necessary.</li>
            <li>Worth each and every penny that I spent on it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t go to the dentist too often because I am pretty good with my oral hygiene and don&#x27;t eat foods that are bad for my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>UV sanitizer is a great idea - but I can only assume that it works as advertised because it is impossible to really know one way or the</li>
            <li>We are particularly concerned with fighting germs, so I especially like the cleansing features.</li>
            <li>After using it the first time, I can feel the difference from using regular toothbrush that I use sometimes when I travel or the oral-b system that we had prior to this one.</li>
            <li>A timer is incorporated which issues an audible signal every 30 seconds, repeated four times to ensure upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right areas are cleaned properly.</li>
            <li>The first one broke after 6-7 years and it was partially my fault.</li>
            <li>You don’t need to move or agitate the brush: just hold it to the teeth upper, lower, left, right, inside, outside then rinse when finished.</li>
            <li>That would be a major plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have gotten about a week or so out of a full charge, at least while it is new.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels truly clean after brushing, my gums don’t hurt, and the little pockets between the back molars are cleaned out without having to use a water pik.</li>
            <li>The only complaints I have about this product is the premium price you pay for a toothbrush and that it only does a decent job cleaning your tongue.</li>
            <li>The UV sanitizer is an interesting addition but likely not worth using it except perhaps for someone with an active gum infection.</li>
            <li>You can also adjust the brushing intensity to three different levels from low to high if desired.</li>
            <li>For a while now, I have been suspecting that the old system was slowing down and not doing quite the job that it did when new - as verified by how quickly the brush heads were wearing down</li>
            <li>the more I use it, but it was awkward for me at first.</li>
            <li>; point is that it uses the same heads that my old brush did so</li>
            <li>The only option to the timer is to turn it off completely because there is no way to make it run through longer</li>
            <li>The Sanitizer has been returned, the extra buttons have been returned, the handle (while using the new material of the DiamondClean brush has had a grip added to it) and the battery indicator is back to 3 lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>for the technical specs of the handle, they are pretty much all the same except for a few different modes.  </li>
            <li>The entire body is a hard, smooth plastic, which resists crud buildup.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the sanitizing blue light was burnt out after a month.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, but users with sensitive teeth may need a little while to get used to the intensity of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>We’ve used other electric toothbrushes which are promoted as ‘sonic’ in the product description, but few of them actually deploy genuine ultrasonic cleaning technology like these from Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I mean by that, is perhaps manual brushing could get your teeth the same level of clean, but it would take maybe 5 to 10 minutes to do what the Sonicare can do in 2 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;First few times I used it felt weird because it tickled my tongue, but I guess now I am getting more accustomed to the vibrating sensation and don&#x27;t notice it as much.  </li>

            <li> Your teeth will feel amazing after using it!</li>
            <li> I also am LOVING the extended battery life with this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> designed, well made, highly effective and attractive as well.</li>
            <li> a superior clean&lt;br</li>
            <li> My advice: a good choice</li>
            <li> Anyway, the units need to be replaced periodically and when this came available on Vine the timing was perfect.</li>
            <li> After you get used to the feel of this, you will find yourself brushing longer with it for it just works so good.  </li>
            <li> Also, you can find a good deal on replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; The Good Stuff &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;</li>
            <li> The good news is that it is rated for 120-240v.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The good news is that it is rated for 120-240v.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since this model has a &amp;#34;GUM&amp;#34; setting this fit my needs perfectly.  </li>
            <li> This is a sleek, attractive unit which should look good in any bathroom and also stay looking good for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> If I get brave, I may get another head and experiment more, because I</li>

            <li> Glad she didn&#x27;t want it, works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and best of all, it works!</li>
            <li> and we have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li> Great product for keeping teeth/gums healthy.</li>
            <li> I suggest you try it at all levels and find what&#x27;s best and most comfortable for you...</li>
            <li> Love the UV sanitizer too!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been a Sonicare fan for many years; using them has helped me avoid additional gum surgery - a procedure which I would not wish on anyone!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is really easy to handle and lighter to hold, does a great job in cleaning/gum check/</li>
            <li> I honestly don’t know if there’s any way to prove it’s truly working, but I’m taking its word on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I honestly don’t know if there’s any way to prove it’s truly working, but I’m taking its word on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Reminder bristles ensure you are getting an effective clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so i like to post an honest review .</li>
            <li> To be honest, after trying all modes I think this is a bit of a gimmick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just nice to know that it will do the job of killing bacteria and viruses.</li>
            <li> Flexcare Platinum toothbrush with the UV Sanitizer from Amazon for an honest review.</li>
            <li> , it does a nice job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s quite nice to have everything in one tidy port.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So this upgrade is kind of like going from a 1991 Ford to a 2015</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just turn that off and wing it on my own.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and</li>
            <li> (I’ll note here that I am *extremely* sensitive to sounds and textures, so if you connect with that, this might not be the best toothbrush for you.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that I will be able to switch to these modes if I choose or increase the intensity as I desire.  </li>
            <li> The brush does a good job cleaning, and it is comfortable.</li>
            <li> The heads are more effective and I notice my teeth are whiter.</li>
            <li> I will say that, so far, this toothbrush is the best toothbrush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> We have been very impressed with the Philips Sonicare toothbrush system so far.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is well worth the money and leaves your teeth feeling great.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode has been determined to be the most effective in clinical studies and is the default setting.  </li>
            <li> I love how this works and my teeth looking super great.</li>
            <li> I am very happy so far, &amp; I hope the units hold up for many years to come.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and it is great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first Sonicare and I am beyond happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re both very light and portable.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Philips</li>
            <li> I was worried that my teeth/mouth wouldn&#x27;t get as clean, but I am very satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I kept hoping I would just get used to it, and I tried the different settings, but after realizing I was dreading using the thing, I decided this might not be the best toothbrush for me.</li>
            <li> so I set it lower and have been able to use it without discomfort since.  </li>
            <li> store my toothbrush on the charger as it&#x27;s most convenient</li>
            <li> I had to order them, which would include postage charges for many.  </li>
            <li> I still love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Very happy I finally listened to my dentist and got this product.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gentler on the gums than what I remember from many years ago.  </li>
            <li> This is so much better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that this one comes with the UV sanitizer.</li>
            <li> seems to be a lot better than a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Removes up to 100% more plaque than a manual</li>
            <li> &gt;  44% more bristles for a more thorough clean&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this one...</li>
            <li> best of all...feel like such came out of dentist cleaning.  </li>
            <li> It has more of a metal look.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a huge deal, wasn&#x27;t worth taking a star away as it is still a great product.</li>
            <li> you get a better understanding.</li>
            <li> now I&#x27;m so so vey pleased.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using for four months and we love this tooth brush</li>
            <li> latest</li>
            <li> (Top Shelf ...)&lt;</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t figured out how to make them all work, I love that this toothbrush has three cleaning modes and three intensity settings.</li>
            <li> Smartimer makes sure you don&#x27;t rush to brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> love, love, love the UV sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> I may use that feature perhaps weekly at most just because it is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We also love that it has a UV sanitizer built-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get more used to it</li>
            <li> but I almost feel that the oral b does a better job of cleaning around the gum line.</li>
            <li> Be sure to register online for a 2 1/2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> The Flexcare Platinum is an upgrade of the excellent HX6950 that I have been using for several years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am glad to have the UV sanitizer, I did not get that model when I bougt the HX6950.  </li>
            <li> Love the 3 added features for speed</li>
            <li> I love the travel kit.</li>
            <li> Still, it seems to work well, and for most trips I don&#x27;t take a charger anyway.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m more than pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> and they did not indicate that my teeth or gums are any better.</li>
            <li> most who are vigilant about their teeth, flossing and water irrigation is still mandatory....</li>
            <li> Love the sanitizer as well</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d love to, it&#x27;s outstanding, gorgeous, wonderful, terrific, particular, amazing, &amp; fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;it couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>

            <li> My teeth are very important to me and, since I&#x27;ve had some dental problems through the years, I&#x27;m very particular about a good dental hygiene regimen.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s charge for a long time and does an excellent job cleaning my teeth!  </li>
            <li> things considered, I am happy with the new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> things considered, I am happy with the new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> But the intercare brush heads work much better at giving a strong cleaning.</li>
            <li> Heretofore I’d been pleased with the way my Braun worked, however, when I fired up the Philips Flexcare Platinum, I was in for a huge surprise.</li>
            <li> I like using the timer because it&#x27;s a reminder to brush longer, rather than harder, to best care for your teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More importantly, it is comforting.</li>
            <li> It looked cooler than this brush, but a lot of the studies found that while they both did an amazing job of cleaning, Sonicares were consistently rated (just slightly) better than their Oral-B counterparts.</li>
            <li> Makes sure Im brushing for the recommended amount of time and the sanitizer makes sure that my toothbrush is secure and not being exposed and is clean.  </li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean and wonderful, but using this particular toothbrush was pure torture for me.</li>
            <li> It was easy to adjust to and leaves my teeth feeling cleaner than with an old-fashioned toothbrush.</li>
            <li> so it is easy to change settings by accident.</li>
            <li> comes with a helpful, easy to understand manual.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and comes with a compact travel stand.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and is always charged.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels clean and refreshing after I brush.</li>
            <li> That being said, it&#x27;s something that you get used to very quickly, and, fall easily for when you start to see the results.  </li>
            <li> all of its features, the toothbrush is still relatively easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> My checkups and cleanings have been good, with minimal plaque needing removed and my gums are in good shape as well.  </li>
            <li> The whole design is beautiful and very practical</li>
            <li> easy to use, easy to clean and now sanitize.</li>
            <li> still had some leftover old Pro Results brushheads, and fortunately they are perfectly compatible with this new brush.</li>
            <li> It’s compact and attractive, and has a low battery indicator light.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I think that it&#x27;s best to buy from reliable sources, even if it costs a few dollars more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one has a slim handle that feels like  a manual toothbrush and its light.</li>
            <li> Fantastic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to brush a tad overzealously, so the feature was important to me.</li>
            <li> It comes fit for one person&#x27;s use and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Really cheap in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> it is downright cheap...</li>
            <li> It comes fit for one person&#x27;s use and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Really cheap in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> it is downright cheap...</li>
            <li> Great price, cheaper than buying at your dental office or local stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m inclined to have bacterial infections, so anything I can do to reduce that is important to</li>
            <li> yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The added bonus with this brush is the UV light.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great step into the future with Sonicare!  </li>
            <li> After using only 3 months my dentist noticed a great improvement.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li> The timer and different modes are very effective for what they are designed for.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really smooth and clean after use.</li>
            <li> It tends to do a good job but has 1 major flaw.  </li>
            <li> By the way, our dentist recommended the Philips system over the Oral-B because the Philips heads are larger in size, so they cover more teeth surface thus removing more plaque easier and more efficiently.</li>
            <li> He also commented that his teeth have never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel almost hygenist-visit clean after using it</li>
            <li> It gets my teeth squeaky clean and even whitens them.</li>
            <li> There are a variety of intensities and settings (whitening, gum care, and clean) to choose from.</li>
            <li> Otherwise 5 stars for clean teeth and working gums.</li>
            <li> I like the beeps at four intervals which reminds me to clean all four portions  of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> a 3 pack of the Diamond Clean brush heads is $38.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the Diamond Clean brush heads highlights list the following:&lt;br</li>
            <li> brush also feels easy to hold - better than my older model.</li>
            <li> stick with this brand because I like the way they clean my teeth</li>
            <li> In the end, I went with this one because it had the &amp;#34;brushing too hard&amp;#34; warning, which is not something the Diamond Clean had.</li>
            <li> so my toothbrush is always clean.</li>
            <li> Sonicare has 3 brushing modes to clean, remove plaque, and massage gums.</li>
            <li> The built-in timer on the clean setting automatically turns off the machine at 2 minutes, the recommended brushing time, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes that Pilips recommends are Diamond Clean, InterCare, ProResults and Sonicare</li>
            <li> I find myself cleaning it out like once a week because I&#x27;m a clean freak.</li>
            <li> husband’s experience with it has been much more positive.</li>
            <li> As for between the teeth cleaning...floss is always the best, but a toothbrush should do a good job of cleaning those harder to reach areas, again Philips seems to lack in that area unless I press down which it hates.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use right out of the box and charging for 24 hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a great product and it doesnt make deafning sound which i read some of the other electric toothbrushes make.</li>
            <li> There are several buttons on the body, and it is all too easy to change the speed setting when you are using the brush, especially since I am not at my best just before or after bed.</li>
            <li> There are several buttons on the body, and it is all too easy to change the speed setting when you are using the brush, especially since I am not at my best just before or after bed.</li>
            <li> I always know I&#x27;m brushing the right amount of time and my tooth brush is always clean and secure with the sanitizer.</li>
            <li> really* wish I could get comfortable with this brush!</li>
            <li> really* wish I could get comfortable with this brush!</li>
            <li> On my box it states that it comes with a 90 day, 100% satisfaction guarantee (full refund) and a two year warranty.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare recommends placing it on the charger for a full 24 hrs.</li>
            <li> 10% full power.  </li>
            <li> Basically, for more money you get a more indicators, a higher vibration speed,  more “modes” and sometimes some gizmos (an external timer, travel case, UV sanitizer).  </li>
            <li> (It holds a charge for a full three weeks.)</li>
            <li> According to Philips, the toothbrush provides up to 31,000 strokes per minute, to provide exceptionally deep cleaning, plaque removal, and to promote good gum health.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really compare specs, but the brush speed and frequency sure seem faster.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not bad at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would be able to continue as my teeth seemed too sensitive</li>
            <li> I truly love that new feeling on my teeth after brushing with Philips Sonicare Flexcare PLATINUM!</li>
            <li> Warranty signup with Phillips went well and quickly.  </li>
            <li> You probably don&#x27;t need this much toothbrush, but it sure is fun.</li>
            <li> would \\&quot;go beyond traditional cleaning to deliver exceptional plaque</li>
            <li> I accepted their challenge and decided to test their bold claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall this is an excellent brushing system that I can&#x27;t even imagine it being on a match with anything, except another similar ultrasonic system.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is an excellent brushing system that I can&#x27;t even imagine it being on a match with anything, except another similar ultrasonic system.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, a Quick Start guide is included, along with the users’ manual and a warranty card.</li>
            <li> Super Cleaning Machine.</li>
            <li> My dentist just laughed when I asked him about it, and told me if I was really worried about infecting myself with my own germs to just use a little alcohol on the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> overall very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This model is very powerful and your teeth really do feel super clean after you use it.</li>
            <li> I love the new design and the container you put to brush head inside to sanitize the brush head.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another favorite with the new brush is the separate travel charger and travel case supplied with the Platinum model.  </li>
            <li> so the change in vibration (and sound) which I am doing so has trained me quickly to stop applying so much</li>
            <li> so the change in vibration (and sound) which I am doing so has trained me quickly to stop applying so much</li>
            <li> The pressure sensor that prevents brushing too hard is a very good feature.</li>
            <li> The brush provides audio alert when each quadrant of the mouth should be sufficiently brushed, a nice feature, as its easy to go too fast..  </li>
            <li> I just ordered an extra pack of brushes to go with this amazing</li>
            <li> I really do buy into the the value of ultra sonic, as the the sound waves hit areas between the teeth where mechanical brushing could never reach...</li>
            <li> I had been using a battery powered toothbrush for several years that I liked but there is just no comparison after using this one.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if they came in different colors to make it easier to tell them apart</li>
            <li> hope this review is useful.</li>
            <li> The jury is out as to which shape I prefer; both offer their distinct advantages.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one cleans so much better than the old pro-results.</li>
            <li> All I can say is, wow, it really is an improvement, even over their own budget line.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this powerful, multi-speed toothbrush for two weeks now and my teeth feel cleaner and look brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a nicely designed unit which is an evolutionary change from prior Sonicare products and is recommended.</li>
            <li> The last one of its kind I ever used was just a cheap vibrating one that perhaps did a better job than regular brushing, but it was nothing like this baby.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember a time when I have felt my mouth so fresh.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth switching.</li>
            <li> It does come with a smaller portable charger and a travel case so you can take this with you when you&#x27;re not at home in your own bathroom.</li>
            <li> it was worth obtaining.  </li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my old Philips Sonicare, and they do seem to get better every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its made of a totally smooth shiny finish that easily slips out of your hand, even when they are not wet.  </li>
            <li> Its made of a totally smooth shiny finish that easily slips out of your hand, even when they are not wet.  </li>
            <li> Right now I have a couple of 2mm pockets, plus some bone loss around one tooth that they will keep an eye on.  </li>
            <li> A full charge will last more than five days.</li>
            <li> The UV light to disinfect the brushes is a brilliant idea, long over due IMO....</li>
            <li> UV cleaner is a big plus for oral products like this as it helps to keep the bacteria minimum and good for all new replacement brush to go through the UV cleaning before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The toothbrush has more settings and it seems built better than the previous models I used from Philips.</li>
            <li> Just be aware of the high level of vibrating, in case you’re sensitive to that kind of thing.spots for two brush heads.</li>
            <li> Just be aware of the high level of vibrating, in case you’re sensitive to that kind of thing.</li>
            <li> promised I would be able to \\&quot;Enjoy three weeks of brushing on a single charge.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Be warned that the battery takes 24 hours to charge the first time it’s used, but once charged is good for around 30x brushing sessions, so if you’re going on a trip for several days you shouldn’t need to pack the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: very stylish, very effective, lots of nice features but at the current price, rather expensive when compared to earlier Sonicare models.</li>
            <li> It does a great job for the past 2 months.</li>
            <li> A matte finish, or even better, a nice rubber grip on it would be a big plus, especially for what you are paying for this thing.  </li>

            <li> Comes with a travel case, a travel charger, and a normal charger that has a UV light.</li>
            <li> I like the fit and finish better than any previous Philips brush, and it seems easier to keep clean.</li>
            <li> the most intense brushing the unit can apply and I am finding that even though the brush head is smaller than the one on the older model, it does a much better job.  </li>
            <li> I have been more than pleased with this little investment.</li>
            <li> I do also wonder if the UV light might cause the bristles to break down more quickly.</li>
            <li> I certainly do, damn it!</li>
            <li> far as the sanitizer, it’s easy to use.</li>
            <li> far as the sanitizer, it’s easy to use.</li>
            <li> find the brush easy to use - easier than my old one.</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself to try out, loved it so much, bought one each for my older son and husband, and bought the Kids Sonicare for my younger ones.</li>
            <li> In short, I am one happy camper and will never go back to my Braun.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a powerful rechargeable toothbrush, and I think my dental hygienist will be pleased during my next cleaning and dental examination.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, took a little getting used to the different spin rate, much higher than the Oral B it replaced.</li>
            <li> After getting the news a month and a half ago, I researched the best and narrowed it down to this on of the Diamond Clean.</li>
            <li> But with only three cleaning modes, and three speed/intensity modes, it&#x27;s more user friendly than older sonicare brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this platinum flexcare very much.</li>
            <li> The work the dentist must do to remove plaque from my teeth since I started using this brush has been very significantly reduced, so I feel quite comfortable using the same brush with both toothbrushes since I already have a supply on hand.nificantly reduced, so I feel quite comfortable using the same brush with both toothbrushes since I already have a supply on hand.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd toothbrush in their lineup and so far I&#x27;ve been quite impressed with every single one.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and highly recommend it even for people with sensitive teeth and/or gums.</li>
            <li> This one seems to be a higher power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first Sonicare toothbrush and I have been using it for about a year.</li>
            <li> Then there is the automatic pressure sensor that bothered me at first too, but this has also been overcome with the lowered intensity and repeated use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first unit was &amp;#34;retired&amp;#34; after years of dependable use.</li>
            <li> First up is one that is mentioned often here in others reviews.  </li>
            <li> First things first</li>
            <li> This is my second Phillips Sonicare toothbrush and this one work much better than the Sonicare elite.</li>
            <li> This is my first sonic toothbrush</li>
            <li> /&gt;According to the writeup, the Sonicare Platinum comes with a newly designed InterCare brush head to remove 7 times more plaque between teeth than a manual brush thanks to new tufting technology and longer bristles.</li>
            <li> only issue I had with it was that it&#x27;s hard to find the perfect way to hold the brush handle without inadvertently changing the mode or shutting the power off.</li>
            <li> I have an old sonicare that I thought worked well, but this thing cleans my mouth like it&#x27;s never been clean before.</li>
            <li> your current Flexcare or Flexcare+ is on its last leg, this is a good purchase.  </li>
            <li> I find that I can get them at my local ware house store for a much more reasonable price.ys</li>
            <li> I find that I can get them at my local ware house store for a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Recently had a visit to my dentist to have my teeth cleaned and the hygienist asked if I was using a sonic toothbrush because my teeth were so clean!  </li>
            <li> And my first experience with it was that it takes some real getting used too.  </li>
            <li> The buttons are clearly identified, and one full 24-hour charge should give about three weeks of power.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another new feature is the pressure sensor that tell you by a change in vibration and a slight sound if you are exerting more pressure on teeth and gums than you specified when you adjusted the intensity level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy snap-on brush head fits multiple handles</li>
            <li> Would certainly recommend for anyone with gum problems.</li>
            <li> All the features of that brush have been retained and several new features have been added which give you more control of your brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> This version has a new kind of brush head, but I did not find it significantly different than my current “Healthy White” version.  </li>
            <li> but two more \\&quot;intensity cycles\\&quot;.  Makes little difference to me because I have only used the longest and most intense settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All around a very effective brushing system that would be very hard to beat...</li>
            <li> It comes straight out of the box ready to use, but it does recommend charging for 24 hours before use.</li>
            <li> It is MUCH quitter, the brush much MUCH faster</li>
            <li> and it feels really gentle on my teeth and gums.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the UV sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> I can see the light and get a visual confirmation that it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li> model I purchased also comes with a travel charger and travel case - very helpful.</li>
            <li> since my use i really feel My gums are stronger</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums and have found that some single-setting electric toothbrushes are too powerful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&gt;The travel case and travel charger doesn&#x27;t take up too much room in my carry-on suitcase.  </li>
            <li> There are 3 levels of power available and alternate cleaning modes which are supposed to enhance tooth whiteness and gum health.</li>
            <li> I find that having a zillion modes does not matter much, one tends to pick one and use that all the time anyway.  </li>
            <li> I find that having a zillion modes does not matter much, one tends to pick one and use that all the time anyway.  </li>
            <li> really like the sanitizer that comes with</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a month of using it as directed, I have noticed my gums really are healing.</li>
            <li> While the FlexCare Platinum has lots of bells and whistles, it still does very well what it&#x27;s designed to do, which is brush</li>
            <li> Charging takes a long time [around 8 hours], but a full charge will last you a couple of weeks or more.</li>
            <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t really let you scrape away at your tongue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping my dentist will comment on how much cleaner my teeth are.  </li>
            <li> I really like about this newest version</li>
            <li> really like the choices of brushing intensity and the UV Sanitizer a lot.  </li>
            <li> And all I can say is that this is most certainly not your fathers electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I opened the new toothbrush, charged it, and then was won over the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> As long as you bought more toothbrush heads and charged a little more often, up to 3 people could use this set with ease.</li>
            <li> As long as you bought more toothbrush heads and charged a little more often, up to 3 people could use this set with ease.</li>
            <li> various rechargeable Sonicares all clean very well.  </li>
            <li> The cycle takes something like 20 minutes to complete and afterward, your brush heads have benefited from whatever benefit exposure to a major source of UV light confers.</li>
            <li> It looks more modern than some of the other, older brushes.</li>
            <li> Really like my new Sonicare!  </li>
            <li> In addition to the physical vibration of the bristles on the teeth, ‘Sonicare’ electric toothbrushes utilize ultrasonic cleaning, as used in hospital sterile service units to clean the gunk off surgical instruments.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can even use straight hydrogen peroxide with the sonicare without it being too agressive and removing to much skin from my gums like a normal toothbrush wold.</li>
            <li> with the HX6950 there are 3 brushing modes:  clean, white  and gum care.  </li>
            <li> I would have loved if Philips would have at least brought over the USB Charging Case from the DiamondClean model to this new</li>
            <li> First, the supplier shipped an old Flexcare brush, like the one I am replacing.  </li>
            <li> If you set it to the highest setting, a full charge will last you about two weeks.</li>
            <li> The different intensities is nice for those with sensitive teeth or different brushing habits.  </li>
            <li> but if you’re on a budget, wait for the price to come down – which it surely will.</li>
            <li> in all, I love this thing, and I&#x27;m not going to mark it down because of the timer system.  </li>
            <li> The real difference of this brush over the conventional ones is it actually &amp;#34;vibrate&amp;#34; at very high frequency which essentially it&#x27;s like very fine brushing on the teeth giving them the squeaking clean effect over and over.</li>
            <li> This combo was too rough on my mouth, and my dentist easily identified this by the receding gum line over my front teeth, so she suggested the sonicare</li>
            <li> I will say, it takes a decent amount of force to make the pressure sensor go off.</li>
            <li> the handle is a very simple and quick process.  </li>
            <li> I apparently have super sensitive teeth, because this thing hurt me.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> I do think the price is high, but the product works well.  </li>
            <li> 5 stars highly recommended product with no hesitations.</li>
            <li> I suspect I will have to use it for a few months and see if my dentist notices any difference, but it sure &amp;#34;seems&amp;#34; better, which is probably half the battle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the advances are starting to follow the smart phone formula, of every 1.5 years  ;)</li>
            <li> It moves a lot faster than the old brush did, and it really does leave the teeth feeling well cleaned and cared for.</li>
            <li> This thing vibrates so fast with a back and forth motion that you can&#x27;t really observe it doing much of anything just running.  </li>
            <li> The action of this brush is gentle yet thorough, and my mouth felt as though I’d just come from the dentist’s office.</li>
            <li> feels like concrete stuck on your teeth...</li>
            <li> He’s normal, unlike me, so he’s had no issue with pain/discomfort while using it.</li>
            <li> I have had this Sonicare toothbrush for a few weeks now and really do love it.  </li>
            <li> It would also be nice if at least one &amp;#34;spare&amp;#34; brush was included.</li>
            <li> Unlike many reviewers, I am not upgrading from an earlier model Philips Sonicare but from a Braun (still working, but old enough that I have to buy replacement brush heads on eBay!)</li>
            <li> These settings can be changed while you are brushing, so if you are using medium or high, you can quickly change to the low setting for a sensitive area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you have a good product, don&#x27;t completely change it, just add minor tweaks and or fix any concerns people had with the previous version.  </li>
            <li> Entirely too easy to knock it off, especially with all the stuff on my bathroom</li>
            <li> and just ended up buying the new brush</li>
            <li> With the Flexcare Platinum Philips introduced the new Intercare brush head.  </li>
            <li> Reminder bristles let you know when to use a new InterCare&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advanced</li>
            <li> I have owned a couple Sonicare toothbrushes so when I needed a new one I decided to stick with the brand.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner and appear whiter since moving to this new brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on this information it seems like the DiamondClean brush which is cheaper is better at cleaning, but really this may come down to personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush which i purchased after reading all the reviews in amazon.com, have to say the reviews are really helpful as certain times you are keen on something but due to the review</li>
            <li> I looked up reviews for all the Philips Sonicare toothbrushes and a few Oral B ones, I choose this one and so far I am really enjoying it.</li>
            <li> There is an internal timer that keeps the toothbrush running for 2 minutes in the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode, the minimum time that studies have shown should be spent on the brushing in order to do the most good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This thing has a small degree of very fast movement and leaves your mouth extraordinarily clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really obvious that this device is doing a better job than manual or some other electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> but I think we&#x27;ll try to mark the brush heads with our first initial or something using a permanent ink marker.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a big difference in the cleanliness and whiteness of my teeth even in the first week of use.</li>
            <li> Wow!.  </li>
            <li> Meaning its functions are pretty basic for a $200 toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have to confess, I&#x27;m a pretty big fan of Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> If you are thinking of buying this for your whole family, you better order the extra brush attachments along with it, and they are not cheap.  </li>
            <li> If you are thinking of buying this for your whole family, you better order the extra brush attachments along with it, and they are not cheap.  </li>
            <li> Though you can&#x27;t seem to change the type of cleaning (clean, white or gum care) while you are actually cleaning.</li>
            <li> Long lasting battery on this new model, the ad above claims 3 weeks on a single charge, good to know if you travel and bring it along...  </li>
            <li> addition, the unit you hold is small, thin and light making it easy to manipulate and much easier to use for those who may have an issue with grip or small hands or both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, and I think this important, the fit and finish of the unit, how well it manages the gaps in its assembly</li>
            <li> I switched to this one a week ago and so far they seem pretty similar.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit is more slim than my prior one and with head attached is slightly longer.</li>
            <li> The either unique or at least unusual features are the UV sanitizing chamber and the extremely high frequency</li>
            <li> have not noticed any discomfort when using the Sonicare FlexCare, but I have noticed that when the toothbrush is fully charged, it definitely emits a certain amount of pressure.</li>
            <li> The new buttons on the toothbrush are raised with a very small gap around them, I&#x27;m concerned if water will be able to get into the brush if I rinse the handle.  </li>
            <li> But it is nice having it especially if you&#x27;re concerned you may be brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear as day, as the saying goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the sanitizer as much as you&#x27;d expect so don&#x27;t go too far over board with extra accessories</li>
            <li> Trying them side by side, you can tell a clear difference in that the intercare has the advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is much better for each person to have their own base if you want any peace in your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Flexcare Platinum with UV Sanitizer is as complete a toothbrush set as one can imagine.</li>
            <li> far as I can tell all the brush head replacements look identical.  </li>
            <li> I caution you to watch where you buy them as I&#x27;ve found reports that some of the really &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; deals have resulted in receiving inferior brushes, probably Chinese knock-offs.  </li>
            <li> In my experience this made teeth feel clearing by an order of magnitude and showcases manual brushing is inferior for most common usage.</li>
            <li> When I was deciding on a replacement for my old sonicare, I chose this model for the modes and sanitizer.</li>
            <li> I had  been using the old system (I think it was E) for about three years.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes since you had to buy them directly from the dentist.  </li>
            <li> They all work on the same principle, fast vibration.  </li>
            <li> Its rather big and very slippery when using it.  </li>
            <li> r big and very slippery when using it.  </li>
            <li> You still need to replace the brush head every 3 months just like our old oral-b system.</li>
            <li> In addition, the set includes a UV sanitizer to make sure that your brush is thoroughly disinfected and the manufacturer recommends that you put your brush in at least weekly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be interested to see how long the UV bulb lasts, time will tell.</li>
            <li> three intensities levels and three brushing modes, one of which is a “gums-soft” for sensitive gums</li>
            <li> The InterCare brush head comes with the FlexCare Platinum, but ProResults has worked very well for me during the several years I have used it.  </li>
            <li> The brush still has some rubbery material on it, and attracts toothpaste buildup, but nothing like the old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve had one visit the dentist</li>
            <li> is the varying modes that it offers.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to toss away the old heads</li>
            <li> I have a separate one for my old brush</li>
            <li> Carrying the old unit around proved to be quite cumbersome and</li>
            <li> They went from round to oblong with dimpled back for better grip</li>
            <li> new feature allows you to adjust the intensity setting, choice are low, medium and high.</li>
            <li> The part number for these &amp;#34;Inter Care Replacement Brush Heads&amp;#34; is HX9002/64, and you can find them here, on Amazon, or at many other local department/big box stores if they aren&#x27;t sold out, as my local stores were.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a home microbiology lab, so no way to tell if the blue light does anything other than amuse the cat.</li>
            <li> Price is a little high but worth it.</li>
            <li> Good quality batteries in the spinbrush do last a long time but as you get closer &amp; closer to dead batteries, it is only running at approx.</li>
            <li> other feature which marks this apart from other electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used is the energetic action of the head.</li>
            <li> The UV Sanitizer is pretty cool, but I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s necessary.</li>
            <li> Worth each and every penny that I spent on it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go to the dentist too often because I am pretty good with my oral hygiene and don&#x27;t eat foods that are bad for my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> UV sanitizer is a great idea - but I can only assume that it works as advertised because it is impossible to really know one way or the</li>
            <li> We are particularly concerned with fighting germs, so I especially like the cleansing features.</li>
            <li> After using it the first time, I can feel the difference from using regular toothbrush that I use sometimes when I travel or the oral-b system that we had prior to this one.</li>
            <li> A timer is incorporated which issues an audible signal every 30 seconds, repeated four times to ensure upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right areas are cleaned properly.</li>
            <li> The first one broke after 6-7 years and it was partially my fault.</li>
            <li> You don’t need to move or agitate the brush: just hold it to the teeth upper, lower, left, right, inside, outside then rinse when finished.</li>
            <li> That would be a major plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have gotten about a week or so out of a full charge, at least while it is new.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels truly clean after brushing, my gums don’t hurt, and the little pockets between the back molars are cleaned out without having to use a water pik.</li>
            <li> The only complaints I have about this product is the premium price you pay for a toothbrush and that it only does a decent job cleaning your tongue.</li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer is an interesting addition but likely not worth using it except perhaps for someone with an active gum infection.</li>
            <li> You can also adjust the brushing intensity to three different levels from low to high if desired.</li>
            <li> For a while now, I have been suspecting that the old system was slowing down and not doing quite the job that it did when new - as verified by how quickly the brush heads were wearing down</li>
            <li> the more I use it, but it was awkward for me at first.</li>
            <li> ; point is that it uses the same heads that my old brush did so</li>
            <li> The only option to the timer is to turn it off completely because there is no way to make it run through longer</li>
            <li> The Sanitizer has been returned, the extra buttons have been returned, the handle (while using the new material of the DiamondClean brush has had a grip added to it) and the battery indicator is back to 3 lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> for the technical specs of the handle, they are pretty much all the same except for a few different modes.  </li>
            <li> The entire body is a hard, smooth plastic, which resists crud buildup.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the sanitizing blue light was burnt out after a month.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, but users with sensitive teeth may need a little while to get used to the intensity of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> We’ve used other electric toothbrushes which are promoted as ‘sonic’ in the product description, but few of them actually deploy genuine ultrasonic cleaning technology like these from Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I mean by that, is perhaps manual brushing could get your teeth the same level of clean, but it would take maybe 5 to 10 minutes to do what the Sonicare can do in 2 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;First few times I used it felt weird because it tickled my tongue, but I guess now I am getting more accustomed to the vibrating sensation and don&#x27;t notice it as much.  </li>
            <li> I like the different modes, but I typically use the modes for gum care, and high intensity.</li>
            <li> My only complaint, which others have also mentioned, is the placement of the buttons - they are right in the front where you hold the brush</li>
            <li> Philips wasn&#x27;t just talking a big game - they delivered with an electric toothbrush that makes me excited to brush my teeth each day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Philips Sonicare Flexcare + brush with this brush because the Flexcare was degrading due to wear and tear over the years.</li>
            <li> The product comes with a single head which is different than the prior types I have used and appear to be more expensive to replace.</li>
            <li> I find the &amp;#34;warning&amp;#34; that I&#x27;m pushing a little too hard with the brush to be useful, too, because I suspect this is part of the reason my old unit was on its last legs...</li>
            <li> (I don’t know how long the initial charge will hold, but after charging 24 hours, it’s supposed to last for about 3 weeks.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , i&#x27;ll still pick sonic cleaning over any conventional ones for my sensitive gum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other electric toothbrushes in the past and have had mixed reactions, but this device, with all its built-in features seems to have gotten everything right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the &amp;#34;too hard&amp;#34; sensor is really much of a thing as I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how long the battery will last yet.  </li>
            <li> It also has the quadrapacer, so you know how long you&#x27;ve brushed each area and you can set it to do gums and whitening too.</li>
            <li> but the units do not last as long as they should</li>
            <li> Loved this brush before it got lost :(  </li>
            <li> Enough to the point where I probably don&#x27;t need that feature going forward since I don&#x27;t really press that hard.</li>
            <li> I do feel it is getting my teeth much cleaner than a manual toothbrush, I only have one complaint</li>
            <li> I also notice less tartar build up between professional cleanings.</li>
            <li> There are a lot less soft surfaces on this brush to capture toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The pressure sensor is awesome because the brush lets me know when I&#x27;m pushing down to hard, which is a bad habit of mine.</li>
            <li> Two brush heads are supplied (which incidentally do not fit earlier Sonicare models) and the brush has three speed settings and three modes, which might be too much choice for the average user to think about.</li>
            <li> I wish that the bottom of the brush heads would have interchangeable colors with little rubber bands like the pro results brush heads do; this would let me clearly distinguish which toothbrush is mine vs.</li>
            <li> I like the fit and finish better than any previous Philips brush, and it seems easier to keep clean.cut down version of the sanitizer base.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint about it is that the body is very slippery.</li>
            <li> I’ve used battery operated toothbrushes in the past similar to this one with no trouble.</li>
            <li> If you like your current brush there is really no need to switch to this model.</li>
            <li> It also has a quadrant timer that lets you know when you&#x27;ve spent enough time on one area using another tone signal.</li>
            <li> So no need to drag a charger along on short trips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The travel charger is still a long way from &amp;#34;portable&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Also, the vibrations, while not exactly painful, gave me such an uncomfortable feeling, it was unbearable.</li>
            <li> If you bought the DiamondClean and hate all the features they removed, this is a good purchase.  </li>
            <li> Different versions do use different brush heads, so be aware if you switch to a new base that your old ones may or may not fit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using the unit is the same as previous Sonicare units I have had, one button operation but with multiple modes now.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re probably getting the same results with this during one brushing as you would a half hour of scrubbing with a regular brush.  </li>
            <li> Like other rechargeable toothbrushes, the battery on the toothbrush is not replaceable, and Philips only provides one toothbrush in the package, so when the battery reaches the point where it can no longer hold a charge, the unit will either have to be replaced or I will have to leave it in the charger at all times.  </li>
            <li> It is worth every penny as I have seen dramatic improvements in the health of my Gums and my teeth.</li>
            <li> They said  that they do not actually make softer bristles for the Platinum because it has 3 brushing intensity modes and due to that, a softer bristle is not normally required.  </li>
            <li> Scrubbing, whitening, gum massage, slow, medium, high, ...etc.</li>
            <li> Medium stiff bristles provide a firm, but gentle experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush system comes with on single brush head.  </li>
            <li> This brush system comes with on single brush head.  </li>
            <li> Also the head of the brush is a little narrower, and allows me to get at those molars in the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li> So far after using this sonic are brush, my mouth is noticably cleaner feeling, and I was having a dull discomfort around my 4 front teeth, but after using this it went away.  </li>
            <li> I am not a real fan of the way the brush sits on the charger.</li>
            <li> not sure if my last one was the previous generation or the one prior.  </li>
            <li> But just remember that a little usage of this goes a long ways...</li>
            <li> There are two other modes as well, &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;, that are timed processes to accomplish these outcomes.  </li>
            <li> A simple workaround that I found is to use my wife&#x27;s small pony tail band to keep around mine to distinguish it from my wife&#x27;s</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t because it hurt or anything it was just a weird feeling at first.</li>
            <li> There are two charger stations - one a charger pad alone the other a charger pad attached to the UV</li>
            <li> I thought about docking a star for the gimmicky stuff and increased cost of replacement heads but the inclusion of a non-UV charge station (which saves space on the counter!) won the star back for me.</li>
            <li> brush will be weird to use at first, but you&#x27;ll get use to it and notice that your mouth feels a lot cleaner and your teeth are whiter.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare to anything other than my manual brushes.  </li>
            <li> Even being very careful I have had it slip twice already.  </li>
            <li> Even being very careful I have had it slip twice already.  </li>
            <li> Phillips has mastered ultra sonic consumer teeth cleaning...  as other reviewers have mentioned, this product is an improvement over previous models...</li>
            <li> problem I do have is that I often brush too hard with regular toothbrushes, and swich with peroxide.</li>
            <li> The downside of the hard plastic handle is that it is a bit slippery, especially when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The downside of the hard plastic handle is that it is a bit slippery, especially when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical of whether a UV sanitizer actually works merely by transmitting light.</li>
            <li> A charge should last at least a couple of weeks once its been charged to maximum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> will mean it will be much less likely to collect post brushing paste scuz as some other devices do.</li>
            <li> Phillips threw down the gauntlet with their promise that the Sonicare HX9181/10</li>
            <li> And less chance of a mistake of hitting a button while cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have less plaque build</li>
            <li> You can charge the handle using either one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two less \\&quot;cleaning</li>
            <li> A slight change in pitch can be detected, alerting you to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I typically stick to the whitening mode but have played with the others a bit.  </li>
            <li> just one less thing to worry about.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey for a toothbrush if you think about it, but this product makes brushing your teeth less tedious than a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> minor complaint</li>
            <li> Another reason I gave this product 4 stars is because there is a small gap between the center part and the body that toothpaste gets Into and dries.</li>
            <li> do wish the Quadpacer (timer) was set for 45 seconds per section of the mouth rather than its 30-second cycle because I prefer to brush at least that long in each section.  </li>
            <li> I have found that it helps to apply a little less pressure until the battery starts to wear down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It comes with a small second charger (no cleaning station) and a hard plastic case that holds the toothbrush bae and two brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> minutes of the brush is a little annoying but after the first or second time using it</li>
            <li> There’s also a little warning letting you know if you’re brushing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it was slippery to hold, and the UV sanitizer was removed to name a few.  </li>
            <li> A few reasons:  1.</li>
            <li> It took a few days for me to get used to the highest intensity</li>
            <li> I have had this for a few months</li>
            <li> If you have never used a sonicare toothbrush then you don&#x27;t know what you are missing.</li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer is really nice, because I always hesitate to throw out the head (because they are expensive) after being sick, even though the doctor always tells us to change toothbrush heads after an illness.  </li>
            <li> Brushing too hard can cause a receding gum line which can cause other issues.  </li>
            <li> Eventually, the thing quits working due to dead batteries, &amp; this loss of cleaning power drops so slowly, that you don&#x27;t realize it.  </li>
            <li> Not sure the sanitizer is all that valuable, and the travel charger would be a little easier to pack.</li>
            <li> Not sure the sanitizer is all that valuable, and the travel charger would be a little easier to pack.</li>
            <li> It will let you know if you&#x27;re pressing too hard by stopping or slowing down until you take the pressure off.</li>
            <li> I would really prefer some little USB thing that takes up almost no space in a gadget bag rather than a cut down version of the sanitizer base.</li>
            <li> They are expensive to purchase, around ten to fifteen dollars each, which seems way overpriced for what you get, and the directions recommend that you replace them every three months.  </li>
            <li> No more bleeding.</li>
            <li> However, its not much more than a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> There is a small pin that the brush sits on along with a magnet.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with my other brand</li>
            <li> have also found that after less than two years, the battery in these Sonicares runs out (it begins with the brush feeling like it is not working as well as it used to, and then the power decreases every few uses till it is very weak).</li>
            <li> version which I received comes not only with the UV cleaning base, but a normal smaller base which is easier to take with you than the UV version.  </li>
            <li> (Oral-B has this rubber coat all over the toothbrush which makes hard to keep it hygienic).</li>
            <li> Since I tend to brush too hard, this brush will alert me if I&#x27;m doing that.  </li>
            <li> I do like the fact that it warns you if you brush too hard.  </li>
            <li> I do like the fact that it warns you if you brush too hard.  </li>
            <li> With its pressure sensing signal, a tone is emitted when I&#x27;m brushing too hard or hitting the brush head on the side of teeth rather than the bristles.</li>
            <li> Also, there’s a sensor that lets you know if you’re brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> It also tells you when you are brushing too hard and even includes a sanitizer that is advertised to kill up to 99 percent of bacteria and viruses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this brush eliminates the sticky plaque which eventually turns into hard plaque, which is what your dental hygienist scraps off....</li>
            <li> I tend to push too hard on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have dropped it while using it at least six times.</li>
            <li> I found the constant literal vibrations to be irritating and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> We found 6 replacement brush heads for $40, which is average, not more expensive.</li>
            <li> Phillips recommends that you sanitize the brush at least weekly.  </li>
            <li> I mean I have been amazed at the looks of my teeth and gums with just using it for one week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dental assistant for a very small practice.</li>
            <li> Remarkably, not everyone forms plaque...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really a big deal, just annoying.</li>
            <li> the pain from my recessed gums has decreased.</li>
            <li> However, I do not see that smaller base in the photograph, so I am unsure as to if it is always included.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Not using the sanitizer often but the brush cleans well.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare HX9181/10 Flexcare Platinum with UV Sanitizer is as complete a toothbrush set as one can imagine. The either unique or at least unusual features are the UV sanitizing chamber and the extremely high frequency the brushing head reciprocates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The UV chamber has two posts each of which can accommodate a brush head. Open the door, mount one or two brush heads, close the door and push the cycle start button. The cycle takes something like 20 minutes to complete and afterward, your brush heads have benefited from whatever benefit exposure to a major source of UV light confers. The literature implies this is anti-bacterial and my Web research backs that up. I have no idea what harm bacteria living on your toothbrush might bring, but I prefer they aren&#x27;t there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other feature which marks this apart from other electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used is the energetic action of the head. This thing has a small degree of very fast movement and leaves your mouth extraordinarily clean. It&#x27;s really obvious that this device is doing a better job than manual or some other electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used. I am 100% sold on this product&#x27;s efficacy. It&#x27;s clear as day, as the saying goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the unit you hold is small, thin and light making it easy to manipulate and much easier to use for those who may have an issue with grip or small hands or both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, and I think this important, the fit and finish of the unit, how well it manages the gaps in its assembly will mean it will be much less likely to collect post brushing paste scuz as some other devices do. This is a sleek, attractive unit which should look good in any bathroom and also stay looking good for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well designed, well made, highly effective and attractive as well. One can&#x27;t ask for more. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This set comes with a toothbrush base(with one replaceable head…no extras, to clarify) and a toothbrush head cover, along with the charging/UV sanitizer base. It also comes with a travel holder, and travel charger. It comes straight out of the box ready to use, but it does recommend charging for 24 hours before use. (I don’t know how long the initial charge will hold, but after charging 24 hours, it’s supposed to last for about 3 weeks.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this toothbrush out for a couple of days before I had to pass it on to my husband. My teeth have never felt so clean and wonderful, but using this particular toothbrush was pure torture for me. I kept hoping I would just get used to it, and I tried the different settings, but after realizing I was dreading using the thing, I decided this might not be the best toothbrush for me. I apparently have super sensitive teeth, because this thing hurt me. Also, the vibrations, while not exactly painful, gave me such an uncomfortable feeling, it was unbearable. (I’ll note here that I am *extremely* sensitive to sounds and textures, so if you connect with that, this might not be the best toothbrush for you.) It will basically vibrate your teeth. I’ve used battery operated toothbrushes in the past similar to this one with no trouble. This one seems to be a higher power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband’s experience with it has been much more positive. He loves this toothbrush.  He also commented that his teeth have never felt so clean. He’s normal, unlike me, so he’s had no issue with pain/discomfort while using it. (My rating is based on his experience with it, by the way.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 3 different settings on the toothbrush, along with 3 levels of brushing power, which you have to select before starting to brush. Once you turn it on, you can’t change the setting unless you turn it off. There’s also a little warning letting you know if you’re brushing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the UV sanitizer, there are spots for two brush heads. As long as you bought more toothbrush heads and charged a little more often, up to 3 people could use this set with ease. (Just put a colored sticker or label to make it known which head belongs to each person. If I get brave, I may get another head and experiment more, because I *really* wish I could get comfortable with this brush! The benefits are awesome. Removing 7X the plaque of a regular toothbrush? Who doesn’t want that?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the sanitizer, it’s easy to use. Just put your toothbrush head(s) in the designated spot(s), and close the door. Press the “on” button, and let it do its job. Each sanitizing cycle is supposed to take 10 minutes. I honestly don’t know if there’s any way to prove it’s truly working, but I’m taking its word on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a wonderful toothbrush. Your teeth will feel amazing after using it! Just be aware of the high level of vibrating, in case you’re sensitive to that kind of thing.spots for two brush heads.

            <li> This is a fabulous toothbrush.  My teeth feel really smooth and clean after use. I had been using a battery powered toothbrush for several years that I liked but there is just no comparison after using this one.  It is MUCH quitter, the brush much MUCH faster and it feels really gentle on my teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First few times I used it felt weird because it tickled my tongue, but I guess now I am getting more accustomed to the vibrating sensation and don&#x27;t notice it as much.  I like that it lets me know when I have brushed 30 seconds in each quadrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the UV sanitizer.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and I like that I can see the light and get a visual confirmation that it&#x27;s working.  I will be adding the brush head replaces to my monthly subscribe and Save.  two brushes can be sanitized at the same time, so I will be getting a brush head for my husband, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I can tell all the brush head replacements look identical.  It would be nice if they came in different colors to make it easier to tell them apart but I think we&#x27;ll try to mark the brush heads with our first initial or something using a permanent ink marker.  I love this toothbrush and highly recommend it even for people with sensitive teeth and/or gums.</li>
            <li> This is my first Sonicare toothbrush and I have been using it for about a year. I like it a lot. It was easy to adjust to and leaves my teeth feeling cleaner than with an old-fashioned toothbrush. The ability to sanitize the brush head with a push of a button after each use is a big plus too. My only complaint, which others have also mentioned, is the placement of the buttons - they are right in the front where you hold the brush so it is easy to change settings by accident. I just keep the owner&#x27;s manual close by so I can fix it when that happens. It&#x27;s not really a big deal, just annoying. I would definitely buy this toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> Loved this brush before it got lost :(  I didn&#x27;t use the sanitizer as much as you&#x27;d expect so don&#x27;t go too far over board with extra accessories</li>
            <li> I have had this Sonicare toothbrush for a few weeks now and really do love it.  My teeth feel almost hygenist-visit clean after using it and we&#x27;ll see if the dentist notices any improvement on my next cleaning visit in a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would be able to continue as my teeth seemed too sensitive and it actually hurt.  It arrives set on the middle intensity setting (of three) so I set it lower and have been able to use it without discomfort since.  I suggest those of you that aren&#x27;t used to an electric toothbrush, especially a sonic, to begin this way as well.  Then there is the automatic pressure sensor that bothered me at first too, but this has also been overcome with the lowered intensity and repeated use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have it on the &amp;#34;Gum Care&amp;#34; mode which brushes for two minutes and then includes one minute of gentler gum massage.  There are two other modes as well, &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;, that are timed processes to accomplish these outcomes.  It&#x27;s nice that I will be able to switch to these modes if I choose or increase the intensity as I desire.  It&#x27;s also convenient for those who share the brush with others desiring different settings.  I like using the timer because it&#x27;s a reminder to brush longer, rather than harder, to best care for your teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I store my toothbrush on the charger as it&#x27;s most convenient so I don&#x27;t know how long the battery will last yet.  A three week life is what is claimed which makes it very nice to travel with, and a travel charger and case are included.  I have also used the UV brush head sanitizer, a comforting idea though I have no way of testing how well it works.  The claim is that it kills up to 99% of bacteria and viruses on the brush head.  There is room for two brushes in the UV Sanitizer, also a convenience if you share the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I found lacking in this set was a second toothbrush head, as I wanted to share it with my husband.  They are expensive to purchase, around ten to fifteen dollars each, which seems way overpriced for what you get, and the directions recommend that you replace them every three months.  It sounds like a great deal for Phillips, $40 to $60 a year in replacement brush sales for each user!  The part number for these &amp;#34;Inter Care Replacement Brush Heads&amp;#34; is HX9002/64, and you can find them here, on Amazon, or at many other local department/big box stores if they aren&#x27;t sold out, as my local stores were.  I had to order them, which would include postage charges for many.  I caution you to watch where you buy them as I&#x27;ve found reports that some of the really &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; deals have resulted in receiving inferior brushes, probably Chinese knock-offs.  I think that it&#x27;s best to buy from reliable sources, even if it costs a few dollars more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with a helpful, easy to understand manual.  On my box it states that it comes with a 90 day, 100% satisfaction guarantee (full refund) and a two year warranty.  Impressive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12-31-16-  I still love this toothbrush.  It keeps it&#x27;s charge for a long time and does an excellent job cleaning my teeth!  My checkups and cleanings have been good, with minimal plaque needing removed and my gums are in good shape as well.  Love the UV sanitizer too!</li>
            <li> Very happy I finally listened to my dentist and got this product.  My teeth feel cleaner and it&#x27;s gentler on the gums than what I remember from many years ago.  I, also, ordered the additional pack of brushes.  Easy to use and comes with a compact travel stand.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than a manual toothbrush. It gets my teeth squeaky clean and even whitens them. I&#x27;ve seen a big difference in the cleanliness and whiteness of my teeth even in the first week of use. There are a variety of intensities and settings (whitening, gum care, and clean) to choose from. The pressure sensor is awesome because the brush lets me know when I&#x27;m pushing down to hard, which is a bad habit of mine. The UV Sanitizer is pretty cool, but I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s necessary. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> SonicarePlatinum FLex HX9140 Handle Purchased Jan 14, 2014 with Philips Sonicare HX9181/10 Flexcare&lt;br /&gt;Platinum with UV Sanitizer system lasted 16 MONTHS THEN FAILED.  Otherwise 5 stars for clean teeth and working gums.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years.  This one has a slim handle that feels like  a manual toothbrush and its light. It also has the quadrapacer, so you know how long you&#x27;ve brushed each area and you can set it to do gums and whitening too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush based on a recommendation by my dentist. I have been waging war on peridontial disease for years, I recently switched dentist and they recommended this to try to help keep things at bay. Right now I have a couple of 2mm pockets, plus some bone loss around one tooth that they will keep an eye on.  So far after using this sonic are brush, my mouth is noticably cleaner feeling, and I was having a dull discomfort around my 4 front teeth, but after using this it went away.  I have added this brush plus the waterpik to my dental routine.</li>
            <li> Another gift for the wife, she wanted a scanner, I ended up with it. Glad she didn&#x27;t want it, works great.</li>
            <li> Best ultrasonic toothbrush on the market. In my experience this made teeth feel clearing by an order of magnitude and showcases manual brushing is inferior for most common usage. What I mean by that, is perhaps manual brushing could get your teeth the same level of clean, but it would take maybe 5 to 10 minutes to do what the Sonicare can do in 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two downsides are:&lt;br /&gt;1) the replacement brushes are expensive, more than they need to be&lt;br /&gt;2) the rubber tends to be susceptible to mold and once it is infected, bleach only temporarily suppresses the mold but it always comes back.</li>
            <li> I truly love that new feeling on my teeth after brushing with Philips Sonicare Flexcare PLATINUM! I used to use Oral-B Whitening for almost 4 years. Sonicare products are completely different. The whole design is beautiful and very practical (Oral-B has this rubber coat all over the toothbrush which makes hard to keep it hygienic). I also love the fact that this one comes with the UV sanitizer.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, took a little getting used to the different spin rate, much higher than the Oral B it replaced. Works as advertised, and I can tell a difference already. Great product. Would highly recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Really like my new Sonicare!  I like the beeps at four intervals which reminds me to clean all four portions  of my mouth.  seems to be a lot better than a manual toothbrush.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have an old sonicare that I thought worked well, but this thing cleans my mouth like it&#x27;s never been clean before. It&#x27;s powerful and best of all, it works!</li>
            <li> When you have a good product, don&#x27;t completely change it, just add minor tweaks and or fix any concerns people had with the previous version.  This is technically the 5th Sonicare I&#x27;ve owned (or the 4th) if you consider I only owned the DiamondClean for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the DiamondClean was released I had a laundry list of complaints including: changing the battery level icon, removing all buttons but 1, it was slippery to hold, and the UV sanitizer was removed to name a few.  I ended up returning it and sticking with my trusty Flexcare+ and just ended up buying the new brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips obviously listened to users complaints and enter the Flexcare Platinum.  The Sanitizer has been returned, the extra buttons have been returned, the handle (while using the new material of the DiamondClean brush has had a grip added to it) and the battery indicator is back to 3 lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the technical specs of the handle, they are pretty much all the same except for a few different modes.  The Flexcare+, Flexcare Platinum and DiamondClean are all rated at up to 31,000 brush strokes per minute and they all are rated at a 3 week battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto the one part of the brush that actually makes the difference, the brush head.  With the Flexcare Platinum Philips introduced the new Intercare brush head.  Currently their website list a 2 pack for $29.99 (in comparison) a 3 pack of the Diamond Clean brush heads is $38.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the Diamond Clean brush heads highlights list the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare&#x27;s best plaque removal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Removes up to 100% more plaque than a manual toothbrush*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Provides a superior clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  44% more bristles for a more thorough clean&lt;br /&gt;  Diamond Shaped bristles sweep plaque away&lt;br /&gt;  Medium stiff bristles provide a firm, but gentle experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Designed to optimize performance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Reminder bristles ensure you are getting an effective clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the InterCare brush the highlights list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Designed to optimize performance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Reminder bristles let you know when to use a new InterCare&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advanced InterCare brush head technology&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Anchor-free tufting allows for a denser bristle pack&lt;br /&gt;  Designed for interdental cleaning, gum care and polishing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fits multiple handles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Easy snap-on brush head fits multiple handles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on this information it seems like the DiamondClean brush which is cheaper is better at cleaning, but really this may come down to personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why did I only give this brush 4 out of 5 stars?  A few reasons:  1. The new buttons on the toothbrush are raised with a very small gap around them, I&#x27;m concerned if water will be able to get into the brush if I rinse the handle.  2.  The new brush heads are insanely overpriced.  3.  I would have loved if Philips would have at least brought over the USB Charging Case from the DiamondClean model to this new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your current Flexcare or Flexcare+ is on its last leg, this is a good purchase.  If you bought the DiamondClean and hate all the features they removed, this is a good purchase.  If you like your current brush there is really no need to switch to this model.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a toothbrush that wasn&#x27;t a sonicare for years, i bought this one for my wife and she loves it. She says her teeth are cleaner after one time using this brush than after brushing her teeth twice a day. Easy to use and is always charged. The timer and different modes are very effective for what they are designed for.</li>
            <li> I have recessed gums so my dentist has been recommending I try out a quality electric toothbrush. I ended up going with this one since it has a pressure sensor. I didn&#x27;t tell my dentist I bought it.  I just used it for 6 months before my next checkup. My checkup went great and I let him know that I started using an electric toothbrush. He said it definitely shows. My teeth are cleaner and the pain from my recessed gums has decreased. I will say, it takes a decent amount of force to make the pressure sensor go off. Enough to the point where I probably don&#x27;t need that feature going forward since I don&#x27;t really press that hard. But it is nice having it especially if you&#x27;re concerned you may be brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Sonicare.  Love this one...best of all...feel like such came out of dentist cleaning.  Sanitzer works wonderful...overall very satisfied.</li>
            <li> My last one died and I hated to have to go out and start reviewing all the products and start over, but after I did, I found this one and we have been very pleased.  It does a great job for the past 2 months.</li>
            <li> Excellent product which was delivered 3 days after I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For charging, the brush simply sets on one of the 2 included chargers.  One smaller charger is for the brush  only.  The second larger charger will charge the battery and also sanitize the brush head which has to be removed from the handle to sanitize.  Removing  &amp; reinstalling the brush head from  the handle is a very simple and quick process.  Sonicare recommends placing it on the charger for a full 24 hrs. before using it the 1st time.  I highly recommend this.  From what I know about these batteries, following those instructions will result in a longer battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Since I tend to brush too hard, this brush will alert me if I&#x27;m doing that.  Brushing too hard can cause a receding gum line which can cause other issues.  Before ordering, I called sonicare regarding info on softer bristles for this toothbrush.  They said  that they do not actually make softer bristles for the Platinum because it has 3 brushing intensity modes and due to that, a softer bristle is not normally required.  But, If  after using the standard brush, If I still had issues, I could order  the pro results head which they said fits the Platinum. Sonicare part # HX6053/66, pack of 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you have been using a brush of this caliper, I recommend that you set  it up to do what the manual calls  &amp;#34;easy start&amp;#34; mode.  This will gradually increase power over 14 brushing to ease you into using the brush.  Otherwise, you may get an itchy tingly feeling as your mouth gets use to the vibrations of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a spin brush for several yrs.  It tends to do a good job but has 1 major flaw.  You don&#x27;t  realize that with each use, the spin brush with regular batteries, is actually losing power with each brush.  Eventually, the thing quits working due to dead batteries, &amp; this loss of cleaning power drops so slowly, that you don&#x27;t realize it.  Good quality batteries in the spinbrush do last a long time but as you get closer &amp; closer to dead batteries, it is only running at approx. 10% full power.  With the sonicare, you have a battery indicator to alert you to when it is time to place it on the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several uses, I can definitely say that this brush is leaving my teeth cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By registering your product within the time frame mentioned on the enclosed card, you pick up an extra 6 months of warranty for a total of 2 &amp; 1/2 years.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Philips Sonicare Flexcare + brush with this brush because the Flexcare was degrading due to wear and tear over the years. I like this platinum flexcare very much. It&#x27;s quite similar to the flexcare +.  But it&#x27;s meant to work with the newer intercare brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still had some leftover old Pro Results brushheads, and fortunately they are perfectly compatible with this new brush. But the intercare brush heads work much better at giving a strong cleaning. Trying them side by side, you can tell a clear difference in that the intercare has the advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model I purchased also comes with a travel charger and travel case - very helpful. And it has a built in UV santizer for the brush heads - holds two brush heads. I was a bit skeptical of whether a UV sanitizer actually works merely by transmitting light. But in doing some research, I found that it is helpful in santizing (though not necessarily sterilizing) the brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor complaint I have is about the intercare brush heads themselves. I wish that the bottom of the brush heads would have interchangeable colors with little rubber bands like the pro results brush heads do; this would let me clearly distinguish which toothbrush is mine vs. which is my wife&#x27;s. A simple workaround that I found is to use my wife&#x27;s small pony tail band to keep around mine to distinguish it from my wife&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the look of this brush. It looks more modern than some of the other, older brushes. It has more of a metal look. Even the power button looks cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the brush easy to use - easier than my old one. Though you can&#x27;t seem to change the type of cleaning (clean, white or gum care) while you are actually cleaning. But with only three cleaning modes, and three speed/intensity modes, it&#x27;s more user friendly than older sonicare brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush also feels easy to hold - better than my older model. And less chance of a mistake of hitting a button while cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review is useful.ing a button while cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review is useful.</li>
            <li> Dentist and hygenist recommended electric toothbrush for me.  The hygenist recommended the Sonicare.  I purchased the Platinum model from reviews and pricing.  I do think the price is high, but the product works well.  The order was handled as described and timely.  Warranty signup with Phillips went well and quickly.  Would purchase again.l</li>
            <li> My entire family, from three to thirty three, is using the Sonicare.We are particularly concerned with fighting germs, so I especially like the cleansing features. My mouth feels clean and refreshing after I brush. This is my second Sonicare. The first unit was &amp;#34;retired&amp;#34; after years of dependable use.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Bought it for my son and he loves it.  Price is a little high but worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush after having had a deep cleaning and having my dental hygienist recommend I buy an electric toothbrush. I looked up reviews for all the Philips Sonicare toothbrushes and a few Oral B ones, I choose this one and so far I am really enjoying it. It took a few days for me to get used to the highest intensity but it wasn&#x27;t because it hurt or anything it was just a weird feeling at first. I do feel it is getting my teeth much cleaner than a manual toothbrush, I only have one complaint, I wish there was a pause button, sometimes I find I need to spit mid-cycle, I use the gum care setting which is believe is the longest and if you take the toothbrush out while it is still on it splatters everywhere and if you turn it off to spit you lose the convenience of the timer. This isn&#x27;t a huge deal, wasn&#x27;t worth taking a star away as it is still a great product.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush which i purchased after reading all the reviews in amazon.com, have to say the reviews are really helpful as certain times you are keen on something but due to the review you get a better understanding. so i like to post an honest review . The toothbrush is really easy to handle and lighter to hold, does a great job in cleaning/gum check/whitening -3 options i have i can set my brush on. since my use i really feel My gums are stronger and I have less plaque build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product and it doesnt make deafning sound which i read some of the other electric toothbrushes make.I am very happy so far, &amp; I hope the units hold up for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, and feels great. If you are looking for a toothbrush, this is a great one to get</li>
            <li> The toothbrush has more settings and it seems built better than the previous models I used from Philips. Would recommend to others!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d love to, it&#x27;s outstanding, gorgeous, wonderful, terrific, particular, amazing, &amp; fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;it couldn&#x27;t be better. this is always stick together with me...^^</li>
            <li> Fantastic toothbrush. My only complaint is that the sanitizing blue light was burnt out after a month. Have to call for a replacement bulb. My teeth have never felt cleaner.</li>
            <li> I have been more than pleased with this little investment. It is worth every penny as I have seen dramatic improvements in the health of my Gums and my teeth.</li>
            <li> I love how this works and my teeth looking super great. I was not happy with my other brand now I&#x27;m so so vey pleased.</li>
            <li> Best purchase ever!!! Cheapest price I&#x27;ve found for this series of the Philips Sonicare toothbrush. Love it! Never going back to a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using for four months and we love this tooth brush even my dentist mentioned that he saw a difference.</li>
            <li> In addition to the physical vibration of the bristles on the teeth, ‘Sonicare’ electric toothbrushes utilize ultrasonic cleaning, as used in hospital sterile service units to clean the gunk off surgical instruments. You don’t need to move or agitate the brush: just hold it to the teeth upper, lower, left, right, inside, outside then rinse when finished. A timer is incorporated which issues an audible signal every 30 seconds, repeated four times to ensure upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right areas are cleaned properly. We’ve used other electric toothbrushes which are promoted as ‘sonic’ in the product description, but few of them actually deploy genuine ultrasonic cleaning technology like these from Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This latest ‘FlexCare Platinum’ variant has an attractive contemporary-aesthetic design and looks like a work of art. Two brush heads are supplied (which incidentally do not fit earlier Sonicare models) and the brush has three speed settings and three modes, which might be too much choice for the average user to think about. It comes with carrying case and travel charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned that the battery takes 24 hours to charge the first time it’s used, but once charged is good for around 30x brushing sessions, so if you’re going on a trip for several days you shouldn’t need to pack the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: very stylish, very effective, lots of nice features but at the current price, rather expensive when compared to earlier Sonicare models. My advice: a good choice but if you’re on a budget, wait for the price to come down – which it surely will.</li>
            <li> First, the supplier shipped an old Flexcare brush, like the one I am replacing.  Can&#x27;t prove it was intentional or not.  After one week they sent the correct Platinum model and included a return label for the Flexcare.  (Top Shelf ...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush is similar to Flexcare with change in shape.  They went from round to oblong with dimpled back for better grip I suppose.  The jury is out as to which shape I prefer; both offer their distinct advantages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears there maybe an increased battery life.  The handle \\&quot;shuts down\\&quot;, after use, quicker then the Flexcare.  That would be a major plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also include a separate \\&quot;stand\\&quot; for the brush besides the sanitizer stand.  You can charge the handle using either one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two less \\&quot;cleaning cycles\\&quot; on the handle but two more \\&quot;intensity cycles\\&quot;.  Makes little difference to me because I have only used the longest and most intense settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside of that the units are very similar.  Great product for keeping teeth/gums healthy.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush. I like the different modes, but I typically use the modes for gum care, and high intensity. The pressure sensor that prevents brushing too hard is a very good feature. The UV sanitizer is a plus. I can only assume it works. The brush never smell unpleasant, so it is probably working. The travel case and charger are convenient. A full charge will last more than five days. The brush does a good job cleaning, and it is comfortable. It does not eliminate the need to floss, nor does it make that claim.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Sonicare. The first one broke after 6-7 years and it was partially my fault. This one cleans so much better than the old pro-results. The heads are more effective and I notice my teeth are whiter. My gums used to be puffy and bleed a lot but since using the sonicare I actually get compliments from my dental hygienist. No more bleeding. I also notice less tartar build up between professional cleanings. When I was deciding on a replacement for my old sonicare, I chose this model for the modes and sanitizer. Best investment I ever made for my dental health.</li>
            <li> The real difference of this brush over the conventional ones is it actually &amp;#34;vibrate&amp;#34; at very high frequency which essentially it&#x27;s like very fine brushing on the teeth giving them the squeaking clean effect over and over. The best part is that you just need to place the brush to the surface of the teeth and it&#x27;ll do the cleaning for you. Just cant fault the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The UV cleaner is a big plus for oral products like this as it helps to keep the bacteria minimum and good for all new replacement brush to go through the UV cleaning before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the choice again, i&#x27;ll still pick sonic cleaning over any conventional ones for my sensitive gum.</li>
            <li> I have owned a couple Sonicare toothbrushes so when I needed a new one I decided to stick with the brand. This model is very powerful and your teeth really do feel super clean after you use it. My biggest complaint about it is that the body is very slippery. I have had this for a few months and I have dropped it while using it at least six times. If your thumb is not wrapped around the unit while using it, it will fall out of your hand. You know the gloves football receivers use? Well, sometimes they put a sticky substance on them to make it easier to hold onto the football -- sometimes I feel like I need a pair of those gloves when I use this Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also found that after less than two years, the battery in these Sonicares runs out (it begins with the brush feeling like it is not working as well as it used to, and then the power decreases every few uses till it is very weak). Since you cannot replace the battery you need to buy another toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing about these is that the brush heads are very expensive -- almost $10 each and that&#x27;s only if you purchase a 6-pack of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stick with this brand because I like the way they clean my teeth but the units do not last as long as they should and it is expensive to purchase replacement brush heads. Also, I wish they would do something about the slippery body.</li>
            <li> All I can say is, wow, it really is an improvement, even over their own budget line. I had  been using the old system (I think it was E) for about three years. Anyway, I opened the new toothbrush, charged it, and then was won over the first time I used it. It moves a lot faster than the old brush did, and it really does leave the teeth feeling well cleaned and cared for. You probably don&#x27;t need this much toothbrush, but it sure is fun. More importantly, it is comforting. I was told that I had pockets where my gums were receding and, as such, I had to be diligent with my oral care. After getting the news a month and a half ago, I researched the best and narrowed it down to this on of the Diamond Clean. In the end, I went with this one because it had the &amp;#34;brushing too hard&amp;#34; warning, which is not something the Diamond Clean had. I have a tendency to brush a tad overzealously, so the feature was important to me. Enough commenters have explained all the different modes and power settings, so I don&#x27;t feel the need to. I will say that, so far, this toothbrush is the best toothbrush I have ever owned. I also looked into the OralB Black7000. It looked cooler than this brush, but a lot of the studies found that while they both did an amazing job of cleaning, Sonicares were consistently rated (just slightly) better than their Oral-B counterparts. If you are considering this brush, I can tell you that my experience has been very pleasant. I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> Phillips threw down the gauntlet with their promise that the Sonicare HX9181/10 Flexcare Platinum with UV Sanitizer would \\&quot;go beyond traditional cleaning to deliver exceptional plaque removal\\&quot; and I picked that gauntlet up!  I accepted their challenge and decided to test their bold claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you know what?  Philips wasn&#x27;t just talking a big game - they delivered with an electric toothbrush that makes me excited to brush my teeth each day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this powerful, multi-speed toothbrush for two weeks now and my teeth feel cleaner and look brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I LIKE:&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Although I haven&#x27;t figured out how to make them all work, I love that this toothbrush has three cleaning modes and three intensity settings. I have sensitive gums and have found that some single-setting electric toothbrushes are too powerful.  There&#x27;s even a pressure sensor that alerts you when you&#x27;re brushing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;The Smartimer makes sure you don&#x27;t rush to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;I love, love, love the UV sanitizer.  I store my brush inside the sanitizer when I&#x27;m not using it so I know I&#x27;m getting the cleanest brush possible.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;The travel case and travel charger doesn&#x27;t take up too much room in my carry-on suitcase.  They&#x27;re both very light and portable.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Philips promised I would be able to \\&quot;Enjoy three weeks of brushing on a single charge.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s been two weeks and it&#x27;s still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I DON&#x27;T LIKE:&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Replacement brushes cost $30.  That seems a bit steep to me.</li>
            <li> I have been a Sonicare fan for many years; using them has helped me avoid additional gum surgery - a procedure which I would not wish on anyone! Anyway, the units need to be replaced periodically and when this came available on Vine the timing was perfect. The product comes with a single head which is different than the prior types I have used and appear to be more expensive to replace. No surprise there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is more slim than my prior one and with head attached is slightly longer. It comes with a nice case which looks like it will be perfect for travel. There are two charger stations - one a charger pad alone the other a charger pad attached to the UV Sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the unit is the same as previous Sonicare units I have had, one button operation but with multiple modes now. There are 3 levels of power available and alternate cleaning modes which are supposed to enhance tooth whiteness and gum health. To be honest, after trying all modes I think this is a bit of a gimmick and I plan to leave it on the default mode. The UV sanitizer is an interesting addition but likely not worth using it except perhaps for someone with an active gum infection. I do also wonder if the UV light might cause the bristles to break down more quickly. I may use that feature perhaps weekly at most just because it is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a nicely designed unit which is an evolutionary change from prior Sonicare products and is recommended. I thought about docking a star for the gimmicky stuff and increased cost of replacement heads but the inclusion of a non-UV charge station (which saves space on the counter!) won the star back for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes since you had to buy them directly from the dentist.  We also have Oral B toothbrushes in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you travel overseas, pick a Sonicare with 240 volt capability.  This one works up to 240V (all you need is the physical plug to transform the double bladed American plug into whatever the country you need uses (a lot of Europe is two posts).  The Oral B we have in the house NOT compatible with 240, so I find we are always taking a Sonicare with us on trips.  We find they last about 2.5 weeks on one charge, brushing 3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You DO have to get used to using a Sonicare, and the Oral B do not seem to have the same length of learning curve, so keep that in mind if you are just starting out with an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The version which I received comes not only with the UV cleaning base, but a normal smaller base which is easier to take with you than the UV version.  However, I do not see that smaller base in the photograph, so I am unsure as to if it is always included.&lt;br /&gt;Although the implication is that you can switch out brush heads, in practicality it is much better for each person to have their own base if you want any peace in your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The various rechargeable Sonicares all clean very well.  They all work on the same principle, fast vibration.  Basically, for more money you get a more indicators, a higher vibration speed,  more “modes” and sometimes some gizmos (an external timer, travel case, UV sanitizer).  You can google a comparison chart.  Different versions do use different brush heads, so be aware if you switch to a new base that your old ones may or may not fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This version has a new kind of brush head, but I did not find it significantly different than my current “Healthy White” version.  Toothbrush heads are a personal preference, some people like smaller ones, others a larger surface area.  The UV sanitizer is really nice, because I always hesitate to throw out the head (because they are expensive) after being sick, even though the doctor always tells us to change toothbrush heads after an illness.  With the UV I can keep using the same head until it wears out. I do like the fact that it warns you if you brush too hard.  I have been berated by my dentist for this habit so the change in vibration (and sound) which I am doing so has trained me quickly to stop applying so much pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Choose which one you want based on cost and which gizmos you want.  I find that having a zillion modes does not matter much, one tends to pick one and use that all the time anyway.  Also check the brush head cost before investing,  I find that I can get them at my local ware house store for a much more reasonable price.ys hesitate to throw out the head (because they are expensive) after being sick, even though the doctor always tells us to change toothbrush heads after an illness.

            <li> I have never used one of these before...And all I can say is that this is most certainly not your fathers electric toothbrush.  The last one of its kind I ever used was just a cheap vibrating one that perhaps did a better job than regular brushing, but it was nothing like this baby.  This thing vibrates so fast with a back and forth motion that you can&#x27;t really observe it doing much of anything just running.  And my first experience with it was that it takes some real getting used too.  I found the constant literal vibrations to be irritating and uncomfortable.  Especially when it touched your lips or side of your cheek, than it was like...Wow!.  That being said, it&#x27;s something that you get used to very quickly, and, fall easily for when you start to see the results.  I mean I have been amazed at the looks of my teeth and gums with just using it for one week.  You&#x27;re probably getting the same results with this during one brushing as you would a half hour of scrubbing with a regular brush.  It just has to be with the results I am seeing, and feeling.  I can&#x27;t remember a time when I have felt my mouth so fresh.  As for controls, it has just about any preference you could want...Scrubbing, whitening, gum massage, slow, medium, high, ...etc. I suggest you try it at all levels and find what&#x27;s best and most comfortable for you...After you get used to the feel of this, you will find yourself brushing longer with it for it just works so good.  But just remember that a little usage of this goes a long ways...Even an abbreviated session with this accomplishes a lot.  Great to know when you are in a hurry for work or bed..And it even comes with two charging stands.  One with the cleaner attached, and another smaller one that just holds the brush for traveling.. All around a very effective brushing system that would be very hard to beat...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That all being said, this thing is not without flaws.  First up is one that is mentioned often here in others reviews.  Its rather big and very slippery when using it.  Its made of a totally smooth shiny finish that easily slips out of your hand, even when they are not wet.  Even being very careful I have had it slip twice already.  A matte finish, or even better, a nice rubber grip on it would be a big plus, especially for what you are paying for this thing.  Which brings me to the second thing I don&#x27;t like.  This brush system comes with on single brush head.  Yes, just one.  If you are thinking of buying this for your whole family, you better order the extra brush attachments along with it, and they are not cheap.  Personally I feel this system coming with just the one brush is rather outrageous.  Especially for the hefty price of it.  It comes fit for one person&#x27;s use and that&#x27;s it. Really cheap in my opinion.  I feel that, along with it being so slippery when using it is enough to take one star off.  Overall this is an excellent brushing system that I can&#x27;t even imagine it being on a match with anything, except another similar ultrasonic system.  Just remember that the lack of a non slip surface on the handle is a big miss in my opinion.  And the system only including one brush head along with it is downright cheap...Recommended for the most discerning of brushes who want the best, despite its cost and minor flaws...r big and very slippery when using it.

            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and it is great. I especially like the sanitizer so my toothbrush is always clean.</li>
            <li> We have been very impressed with the Philips Sonicare toothbrush system so far. After using it the first time, I can feel the difference from using regular toothbrush that I use sometimes when I travel or the oral-b system that we had prior to this one. We also love that it has a UV sanitizer built-in even though we won&#x27;t get to see the bacteria on our toothbrushes. It&#x27;s just nice to know that it will do the job of killing bacteria and viruses. It reminds me of the bottle sanitizer for babies. You still need to replace the brush head every 3 months just like our old oral-b system. By the way, our dentist recommended the Philips system over the Oral-B because the Philips heads are larger in size, so they cover more teeth surface thus removing more plaque easier and more efficiently. It&#x27;s definitely worth switching. Also, you can find a good deal on replacement brush heads. We found 6 replacement brush heads for $40, which is average, not more expensive. 5 stars highly recommended product with no hesitations. A winner!</li>
            <li> My teeth are very important to me and, since I&#x27;ve had some dental problems through the years, I&#x27;m very particular about a good dental hygiene regimen. I have been using this for over a week now and am very happy with the system. I&#x27;ve used other electric toothbrushes in the past and have had mixed reactions, but this device, with all its built-in features seems to have gotten everything right. It&#x27;s easy to use right out of the box and charging for 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare has 3 brushing modes to clean, remove plaque, and massage gums. You can also adjust the brushing intensity to three different levels from low to high if desired. With its pressure sensing signal, a tone is emitted when I&#x27;m brushing too hard or hitting the brush head on the side of teeth rather than the bristles. The built-in timer on the clean setting automatically turns off the machine at 2 minutes, the recommended brushing time, so there&#x27;s no guessing. It also has a quadrant timer that lets you know when you&#x27;ve spent enough time on one area using another tone signal. In addition, the set includes a UV sanitizer to make sure that your brush is thoroughly disinfected and the manufacturer recommends that you put your brush in at least weekly. The cycle takes 10 minutes and it automatically shuts off when done. A charge should last at least a couple of weeks once its been charged to maximum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had with it was that it&#x27;s hard to find the perfect way to hold the brush handle without inadvertently changing the mode or shutting the power off. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get more used to it the more I use it, but it was awkward for me at first. It would also be nice if at least one &amp;#34;spare&amp;#34; brush was included. It does come with a smaller portable charger and a travel case so you can take this with you when you&#x27;re not at home in your own bathroom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dental assistant for a very small practice. I had wanted a sonicare for quite some time and finally ordered one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hygienist/co-worker recommended this one as it&#x27;s the one she uses and the intercare brush heads will work well for when I get my braces put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting used to the 2+ minutes of the brush is a little annoying but after the first or second time using it it&#x27;s not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the sanitizer that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first Sonicare and I am beyond happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to do the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; setting at night and the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; in the morning.</li>
            <li> Recently had a visit to my dentist to have my teeth cleaned and the hygienist asked if I was using a sonic toothbrush because my teeth were so clean!  It works.  Nuff said!</li>
            <li> I have had both an oral b and one of these now...it cleans but I almost feel that the oral b does a better job of cleaning around the gum line. As for between the teeth cleaning...floss is always the best, but a toothbrush should do a good job of cleaning those harder to reach areas, again Philips seems to lack in that area unless I press down which it hates.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go to the dentist too often because I am pretty good with my oral hygiene and don&#x27;t eat foods that are bad for my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem I do have is that I often brush too hard with regular toothbrushes, and swich with peroxide. This combo was too rough on my mouth, and my dentist easily identified this by the receding gum line over my front teeth, so she suggested the sonicare platinum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of using it as directed, I have noticed my gums really are healing. I was worried that my teeth/mouth wouldn&#x27;t get as clean, but I am very satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can even use straight hydrogen peroxide with the sonicare without it being too agressive and removing to much skin from my gums like a normal toothbrush wold. I am sonicare for life now.</li>
            <li> my wife has severe gum issues and this brush has been a relief from day one.i would recommend this product to anyone with gum problems.</li>
            <li> If you have never used a sonicare toothbrush then you don&#x27;t know what you are missing. This toothbrush is well worth the money and leaves your teeth feeling great. I&#x27;ll be interested to see how long the UV bulb lasts, time will tell.</li>
            <li> I am a CDA, and I recommend this toothbrush to everyone. I bought one for myself to try out, loved it so much, bought one each for my older son and husband, and bought the Kids Sonicare for my younger ones. The best ever, will never use another manual toothbrush again. Great price, cheaper than buying at your dental office or local stores.</li>
            <li> I received this Philips Sonicare HX9181/10 Flexcare Platinum toothbrush with the UV Sanitizer from Amazon for an honest review. Unlike many reviewers, I am not upgrading from an earlier model Philips Sonicare but from a Braun (still working, but old enough that I have to buy replacement brush heads on eBay!) Heretofore I’d been pleased with the way my Braun worked, however, when I fired up the Philips Flexcare Platinum, I was in for a huge surprise. The action of this brush is gentle yet thorough, and my mouth felt as though I’d just come from the dentist’s office. Talk about clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With three intensities levels and three brushing modes, one of which is a “gums-soft” for sensitive gums, you have nine different combinations. Also, there’s a sensor that lets you know if you’re brushing too hard. A slight change in pitch can be detected, alerting you to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the writeup, the Sonicare Platinum comes with a newly designed InterCare brush head to remove 7 times more plaque between teeth than a manual brush thanks to new tufting technology and longer bristles. My mouth feels truly clean after brushing, my gums don’t hurt, and the little pockets between the back molars are cleaned out without having to use a water pik. In short, I am one happy camper and will never go back to my Braun. I just ordered an extra pack of brushes to go with this amazing machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What comes in the box? The toothbrush head, one brush with a plastic protective cover, a travel case, a travel charger and the regular base with a UV sanitizer. It’s compact and attractive, and has a low battery indicator light. (It holds a charge for a full three weeks.) Additionally, a Quick Start guide is included, along with the users’ manual and a warranty card. Be sure to register online for a 2 1/2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> The Flexcare Platinum is an upgrade of the excellent HX6950 that I have been using for several years.  All the features of that brush have been retained and several new features have been added which give you more control of your brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One new feature allows you to adjust the intensity setting, choice are low, medium and high. The +/- button is pressed to make adjustments. These settings can be changed while you are brushing, so if you are using medium or high, you can quickly change to the low setting for a sensitive area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another new feature is the pressure sensor that tell you by a change in vibration and a slight sound if you are exerting more pressure on teeth and gums than you specified when you adjusted the intensity level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with the HX6950 there are 3 brushing modes:  clean, white  and gum care.  The \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode has been determined to be the most effective in clinical studies and is the default setting.  It is the one I use.  There is an internal timer that keeps the toothbrush running for 2 minutes in the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode, the minimum time that studies have shown should be spent on the brushing in order to do the most good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad to have the UV sanitizer, I did not get that model when I bougt the HX6950.  Phillips recommends that you sanitize the brush at least weekly.  This is done by removing the brush from the handle, putting it in the sanitizer then turning the sanitizer on.  It shuts itself off after 10 minutes.  I&#x27;m inclined to have bacterial infections, so anything I can do to reduce that is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes that Pilips recommends are Diamond Clean, InterCare, ProResults and Sonicare For Kids.I am using the same ProResults brush that I&#x27;ve been using with the HX6950.  The InterCare brush head comes with the FlexCare Platinum, but ProResults has worked very well for me during the several years I have used it.  The work the dentist must do to remove plaque from my teeth since I started using this brush has been very significantly reduced, so I feel quite comfortable using the same brush with both toothbrushes since I already have a supply on hand.nificantly reduced, so I feel quite comfortable using the same brush with both toothbrushes since I already have a supply on hand.</li>
            <li> this is a replacement for an earlier version of sonicare toothbrush.  it was worth obtaining.  easy to use, easy to clean and now sanitize.</li>
            <li> Philips packed lots of features into the Sonicare FlexCare Platinum Rechargeable Toothbrush. While the FlexCare Platinum has lots of bells and whistles, it still does very well what it&#x27;s designed to do, which is brush teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare emits a sonic-type hum when turned on that sounds futuristic. According to Philips, the toothbrush provides up to 31,000 strokes per minute, to provide exceptionally deep cleaning, plaque removal, and to promote good gum health. The toothbrush has three different intensity modes and three different brushing modes to offer a total of nine different brushing options. It also tells you when you are brushing too hard and even includes a sanitizer that is advertised to kill up to 99 percent of bacteria and viruses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all of its features, the toothbrush is still relatively easy to use. The buttons are clearly identified, and one full 24-hour charge should give about three weeks of power. The Sonicare FlexCare provides a very deep cleaning, and using the additional \\&quot;White\\&quot; and \\&quot;Gum Care\\&quot; modes provides additional cleaning time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush also alerts the user to change brushing location every 30 seconds, to ensure that each quarter part of your mouth is cleaned.  The FlexCare even comes with a UV sanitizer that removes bacteria and viruses in 10 minutes. Just pop the brush head into the sanitizer and turn it on. The sanitizer also doubles as a charger, and Philips includes a travel charger as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed any discomfort when using the Sonicare FlexCare, but I have noticed that when the toothbrush is fully charged, it definitely emits a certain amount of pressure. I have found that it helps to apply a little less pressure until the battery starts to wear down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this is a very nice electric toothbrush system. Like other rechargeable toothbrushes, the battery on the toothbrush is not replaceable, and Philips only provides one toothbrush in the package, so when the battery reaches the point where it can no longer hold a charge, the unit will either have to be replaced or I will have to leave it in the charger at all times.  I like the fact that the toothbrush alerts you to switch brushing locations every 30 seconds, and the \\&quot;White\\&quot; and \\&quot;Gum Care\\&quot; features are additional bonuses. It&#x27;s definitely a powerful rechargeable toothbrush, and I think my dental hygienist will be pleased during my next cleaning and dental examination. Highly recommended, but users with sensitive teeth may need a little while to get used to the intensity of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my dental hygiene has improved a lot after getting this product. It&#x27;s a bit pricey for a toothbrush if you think about it, but this product makes brushing your teeth less tedious than a normal toothbrush. You just glide it along your teeth. It will let you know if you&#x27;re pressing too hard by stopping or slowing down until you take the pressure off. It also has a counter [about 30 seconds] to let you know when to move onto the next area of your mouth. Comes with a travel case, a travel charger, and a normal charger that has a UV light. Charging takes a long time [around 8 hours], but a full charge will last you a couple of weeks or more. If you set it to the highest setting, a full charge will last you about two weeks. Medium settings will last you over two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush will be weird to use at first, but you&#x27;ll get use to it and notice that your mouth feels a lot cleaner and your teeth are whiter. The only complaints I have about this product is the premium price you pay for a toothbrush and that it only does a decent job cleaning your tongue. This brush doesn&#x27;t really let you scrape away at your tongue.</li>
            <li> All I can say is Whoa!  I should have purchased one of these years ago. My teeth are very happy and so am I.  I was shocked at the power of this device.</li>
            <li> I love the new design and the container you put to brush head inside to sanitize the brush head.  Love the 3 added features for speed</li>
            <li> This Philips Sonicare is a great toothbrush.  It cleans your teeth, polishes them and massages your gums on different settings.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Cleans well and I can deffinitly tell there is an improvement in my gum health. However, its not much more than a toothbrush. Meaning its functions are pretty basic for a $200 toothbrush. Another reason I gave this product 4 stars is because there is a small gap between the center part and the body that toothpaste gets Into and dries. I find myself cleaning it out like once a week because I&#x27;m a clean freak.</li>
            <li> I seem to go through an electric toothbrush every couple of years. This is a replacement for my old Philips Sonicare, and they do seem to get better every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; The Good Stuff &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* First things first, it does a nice job of cleaning my teeth. I didn&#x27;t really compare specs, but the brush speed and frequency sure seem faster. Also the head of the brush is a little narrower, and allows me to get at those molars in the back of my mouth. I suspect I will have to use it for a few months and see if my dentist notices any difference, but it sure &amp;#34;seems&amp;#34; better, which is probably half the battle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* There are a lot less soft surfaces on this brush to capture toothpaste. The entire body is a hard, smooth plastic, which resists crud buildup. The brush still has some rubbery material on it, and attracts toothpaste buildup, but nothing like the old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I love the travel kit. It comes with a small second charger (no cleaning station) and a hard plastic case that holds the toothbrush bae and two brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I have gotten about a week or so out of a full charge, at least while it is new. So no need to drag a charger along on short trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The UV sanitizer works great, I guess. I don&#x27;t have a home microbiology lab, so no way to tell if the blue light does anything other than amuse the cat. My dentist just laughed when I asked him about it, and told me if I was really worried about infecting myself with my own germs to just use a little alcohol on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; The Not-So-Good Stuff &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I am not a real fan of the way the brush sits on the charger. There is a small pin that the brush sits on along with a magnet. Entirely too easy to knock it off, especially with all the stuff on my bathroom countertop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The travel charger is still a long way from &amp;#34;portable&amp;#34;. I would really prefer some little USB thing that takes up almost no space in a gadget bag rather than a cut down version of the sanitizer base. The good news is that it is rated for 120-240v.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* There are several buttons on the body, and it is all too easy to change the speed setting when you are using the brush, especially since I am not at my best just before or after bed. The downside of the hard plastic handle is that it is a bit slippery, especially when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Summary &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I am happy with the new toothbrush. Not sure the sanitizer is all that valuable, and the travel charger would be a little easier to pack. Still, it seems to work well, and for most trips I don&#x27;t take a charger anyway. I like the fit and finish better than any previous Philips brush, and it seems easier to keep clean.cut down version of the sanitizer base.

            <li> I took quite a bit of time reading reviews and comparing features.  I had a Oral-B Sonic and it lasted for years but it became increasing difficult to find brush heads.  I switched to this one a week ago and so far they seem pretty similar.  I&#x27;ll let my hygienist be the judge.</li>
            <li> This is my second Phillips Sonicare toothbrush and this one work much better than the Sonicare elite. I&#x27;m glad I decided to upgrade to the Platinum. My teeth feel cleaner like when I leave the dentist office. I always know I&#x27;m brushing the right amount of time and my tooth brush is always clean and secure with the sanitizer. I&#x27;m more than pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this!!  Makes sure Im brushing for the recommended amount of time and the sanitizer makes sure that my toothbrush is secure and not being exposed and is clean.  Worth each and every penny that I spent on it!</li>
            <li> This is my first sonic toothbrush so I can&#x27;t compare to anything other than my manual brushes.  It is easy to use.  I&#x27;m hoping my dentist will comment on how much cleaner my teeth are.  So far I&#x27;ve had one visit the dentist and they did not indicate that my teeth or gums are any better.</li>
            <li> I have to confess, I&#x27;m a pretty big fan of Sonicare.  This is my 3rd toothbrush in their lineup and so far I&#x27;ve been quite impressed with every single one.  This newest addition is the best yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like about this newest version is the varying modes that it offers.  I typically stick to the whitening mode but have played with the others a bit.  The different intensities is nice for those with sensitive teeth or different brushing habits.  I&#x27;m not sure if the &amp;#34;too hard&amp;#34; sensor is really much of a thing as I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.  I haven&#x27;t messed around with the gum care feature yet.  My teeth feel cleaner and appear whiter since moving to this new brush.  I also am LOVING the extended battery life with this toothbrush!  The final &amp;#34;yay&amp;#34; point is that it uses the same heads that my old brush did so I don&#x27;t have to toss away the old heads I didn&#x27;t get to use yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The added bonus with this brush is the UV light.  I have a separate one for my old brush but it&#x27;s quite nice to have everything in one tidy port.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great step into the future with Sonicare!  I loved my old brushes but these new improvements are perfect!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this toothbrush as I have paridontal (sp) disease.  Since this model has a &amp;#34;GUM&amp;#34; setting this fit my needs perfectly.  After using only 3 months my dentist noticed a great improvement.  Would certainly recommend for anyone with gum problems.</li>
            <li> Phillips has mastered ultra sonic consumer teeth cleaning...  as other reviewers have mentioned, this product is an improvement over previous models...not sure if my last one was the previous generation or the one prior.  Regardless, the speed or intensity of the ultrasonic is noticeably stronger, and my teeth feel cleaner.  I really do buy into the the value of ultra sonic, as the the sound waves hit areas between the teeth where mechanical brushing could never reach...which is what makes this technology so great...  The UV light to disinfect the brushes is a brilliant idea, long over due IMO.... as all these brushes are prone to picking up airborne bacteria....just one less thing to worry about.  The brush provides audio alert when each quadrant of the mouth should be sufficiently brushed, a nice feature, as its easy to go too fast..  Long lasting battery on this new model, the ad above claims 3 weeks on a single charge, good to know if you travel and bring it along...  Kudos to Phillips for continuing to advance this technology.... the advances are starting to follow the smart phone formula, of every 1.5 years  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As most who are vigilant about their teeth, flossing and water irrigation is still mandatory.... this brush eliminates the sticky plaque which eventually turns into hard plaque, which is what your dental hygienist scraps off.... feels like concrete stuck on your teeth... Remarkably, not everyone forms plaque...I certainly do, damn it!</li>
            <li> Super Cleaning Machine. Love the sanitizer as well</li>
            <li> First off, please note that this Flexcare Platinum is an upgrade for me from the basic Sonicare model that I have been using for the past five or six years.  For a while now, I have been suspecting that the old system was slowing down and not doing quite the job that it did when new - as verified by how quickly the brush heads were wearing down and some feedback I got at my dentist office.  So this upgrade is kind of like going from a 1991 Ford to a 2015 Lexus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the choices of brushing intensity and the UV Sanitizer a lot.  I like the most intense brushing the unit can apply and I am finding that even though the brush head is smaller than the one on the older model, it does a much better job.  I find the &amp;#34;warning&amp;#34; that I&#x27;m pushing a little too hard with the brush to be useful, too, because I suspect this is part of the reason my old unit was on its last legs...I tend to push too hard on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish the Quadpacer (timer) was set for 45 seconds per section of the mouth rather than its 30-second cycle because I prefer to brush at least that long in each section.  The only option to the timer is to turn it off completely because there is no way to make it run through longer intervals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The UV sanitizer is a great idea - but I can only assume that it works as advertised because it is impossible to really know one way or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another favorite with the new brush is the separate travel charger and travel case supplied with the Platinum model.  Carrying the old unit around proved to be quite cumbersome and this smaller and lighter kit is a big improvement in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love this thing, and I&#x27;m not going to mark it down because of the timer system.  I&#x27;ll just turn that off and wing it on my own.</li>
