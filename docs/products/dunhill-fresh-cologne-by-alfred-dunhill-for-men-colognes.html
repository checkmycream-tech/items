            <li>his wife liked it also.</li>
            <li>but this one is nice.</li>
            <li>Very nice, light aroma.</li>
            <li>The end result is pleasant fragrance that is easy on the nose.  </li>
            <li>/sillage is modest at best, settling close to skin level follow two (2) hours of wear.  </li>
            <li>This Dunhill is very good, and is so nice and smell very soft</li>
            <li>Strongly advise looking elsewhere!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite fragrance for a man.</li>
            <li>Women really love the smell when you walk by them.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite colognes for my husband.</li>
            <li>This is my all-time favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had someone say they don&#x27;t love it on me.  </li>
            <li>and I really enjoy it!</li>
            <li>Great cologn and absolutely my favourite since 2005.</li>
            <li>I get the most compliments with this Cologne.</li>
            <li>edition - many similarities to this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Got to love it my all time favorite smell.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d do better with a supermarket cologne.</li>
            <li>Not bad but Its not my taste, Friend of mine liked It</li>
            <li>The smell is good.. but very fain and disappears within minutes..</li>
            <li>it smells very fresh and refreshing</li>
            <li>I can easily see myself wearing this a lot in the spring time.</li>
            <li>the scent is too strong for me.</li>
            <li>But for under $30.00, this is fantastic and i can easily see myself wearing this a lot during the Spring and Summer.</li>
            <li>If you are a seasoned collector, take a pass on Dunhill&#x27;s Fresh - it is good, but keep searching for your signature fragrance...</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite ones when it comes to fresh.  </li>
            <li>Every time I smell it, I instantly just feel happy and relaxed.</li>
            <li>(Swiss Army lasts much longer and has garnered many more compliments..</li>
            <li>Its a very fresh scent.</li>
            <li>could see someone with a strong nose not liking this cologne and finding it a bit too much, but I feel most will find it a nice peaceful fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Great crisp clean water notes, with warm notes in the dry down... just a great fragrance.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>The smell is good but does not last !!!!</li>
            <li>The perfume is excellent and but not very long lasting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and clean smelling and lingers all day.</li>
            <li>The scent is lost quickly</li>
            <li>You wouldn&#x27;t think you can buy a nice scent for such a cheap price</li>
            <li>Better for daytime than evening and most definitely a spring/summer cologne.  </li>
            <li>This cologne would be GREAT if you are going to an outdoor event, and you will want to apply lightly if you wear this in a small office environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but on me I instantly smell the lavender and makes me feel like I&#x27;ve shoved my face in a bouquet of flowers (Who doesn&#x27;t love the smell of flowers?!).</li>
            <li>I like it, very fresh, no too strong, no too soft.</li>
            <li>While I am comfortable wearing any fragrance, I think Fresh is more suited for a younger crowd.  </li>
            <li>I have smelled a number of niche fragrances deemed unisex that are more masculine than Fresh.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line - my tally for Fresh is 4.0 stars out of 5.0 stars.  </li>
            <li>It smells similar to many fragrances available.  </li>
            <li>Classic, fresh and clean</li>
            <li>Additionally, I will make a more bold statement that this fragrance nears middle of road at being a unisex fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Obviously, geared more toward day wear in Spring and Summer seasons.  </li>
            <li>The name alone tells you that this is a clean, fresh smelling and very pleasant cologne that is subtle enough to wear anytime, particularly at the office/work.  </li>
            <li>If you like clean, fresh showered fragrances, I definitely recommend adding to your collection.  </li>
            <li>The service was fast and got mine on time.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell much like Chrome</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>the other dunhill  eau de toilette the one with the brown bottle is better.</li>
            <li>I get more compliments on this than any other cologne</li>
            <li>Fresh is no different - first class design and the bottle represents high quality and confidence.  </li>
            <li>While I like it, I am not sure I love it.  </li>
            <li>This cologne is guaranteed to take your complete breath away!  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what I wanted and expected in a decent amount of coat and amount of time!</li>
            <li>I just checked current on-line pricing and a large bottle can be purchased for under $30 USD.  </li>
            <li>This hard to find fragrance is one of my favorites, that I stumbled upon about 2 years ago and have not been able to find it since.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fresh provides modest longevity, lasting about 6 hours and even longer on my clothing.  </li>
            <li>not a fresh scent to perk you up but one that is just very relaxing.</li>
            <li>But luckily Amazon (as per usual) had it!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Thanks for carrying this product -- my husband loves this fragrance and it is NOT easy to find.  </li>
            <li> Shortly after the green notes start picking up with the lavender.</li>
            <li> Out of the bottle, you instantly get the green notes - yes, there are other notes in this fragrance, i.e. amber, floral, vetiver, etc., but it is the green notes that overtake those minor notes are signature for this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Found a bottle of this once in a rental car that someone left behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it smells on others</li>
            <li> The smell is very bad, I dont know whether it is a genuine one or not.</li>
            <li> Shockingly poor cologne.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this.  </li>
            <li> Unlikely.</li>
            <li> This is a very disappointing scent.</li>

            <li> The smell is good but does not last !!!!</li>
            <li> Smell great..that millonaire man</li>
            <li> This hard to find fragrance is one of my favorites, that I stumbled upon about 2 years ago and have not been able to find it since. But luckily Amazon (as per usual) had it! Great crisp clean water notes, with warm notes in the dry down... just a great fragrance. Gets them every time!</li>
            <li> Great value for Dunhill anything.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance for a man. I have purchased several as gifts and will continue to do so. Very nice, light aroma.</li>
            <li> Thanks for carrying this product -- my husband loves this fragrance and it is NOT easy to find.  We both will be enjoying the scent!</li>
            <li> Classic, fresh and clean</li>
            <li> Not bad but Its not my taste, Friend of mine liked It I hand it to him his wife liked it also.</li>
            <li> Another great product from Dunhill for men. Women really love the smell when you walk by them. And sometimes in the stores you notice that they will follow you and then they will ask what are you wearing, smells great.</li>
            <li> the scent is too strong for me. the other dunhill  eau de toilette the one with the brown bottle is better.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted and expected in a decent amount of coat and amount of time! Thank you!</li>
            <li> The smell is very bad, I dont know whether it is a genuine one or not. I dont recommend it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colognes for my husband. Smells soooo good!!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite ones when it comes to fresh.  The service was fast and got mine on time.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, thanks for that...!!! This Dunhill is very good, and is so nice and smell very soft</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite cologne.  You cannot go wrong with this.  I&#x27;ve never had someone say they don&#x27;t love it on me.  I get more compliments on this than any other cologne and I&#x27;ve had over 10 of the big name ones before.</li>
            <li> The scent is lost quickly</li>
            <li> I managed to receive a sample of this cologne and I really enjoy it! You wouldn&#x27;t think you can buy a nice scent for such a cheap price but this one is nice. This would go great in Summer and Spring. I can easily see myself wearing this a lot in the spring time. Its a very fresh scent. not a fresh scent to perk you up but one that is just very relaxing. Every time I smell it, I instantly just feel happy and relaxed. I&#x27;m not sure how it smells on others but on me I instantly smell the lavender and makes me feel like I&#x27;ve shoved my face in a bouquet of flowers (Who doesn&#x27;t love the smell of flowers?!). Shortly after the green notes start picking up with the lavender. I see a lot of people say it smells a bit like the Fahrenheit summer fragrance in case you&#x27;ve smelled that, you can get an idea. I haven&#x27;t smelled the Fahrenheit Summer Fragrance but one cologne this reminds me of that I have in my arsenal is Azzaro Chrome. It doesn&#x27;t smell much like Chrome but it reminds me of the fragrance, and I prefer this over Chrome any day. Smells like a good Age: 18-35 cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could see someone with a strong nose not liking this cologne and finding it a bit too much, but I feel most will find it a nice peaceful fresh scent. This cologne would be GREAT if you are going to an outdoor event, and you will want to apply lightly if you wear this in a small office environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this cologne for $80.00? Unlikely. But for under $30.00, this is fantastic and i can easily see myself wearing this a lot during the Spring and Summer.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Excellent delivery. Thanks</li>
            <li> The smell is good.. but very fain and disappears within minutes.. Its like its mixed with water !!</li>
            <li> I like it, very fresh, no too strong, no too soft.</li>
            <li> Great cologn and absolutely my favourite since 2005.</li>
            <li> The cologne fragrance is very nice. I like the bottle as well. I will re-order in the future if the price does not go up.</li>
            <li> one of the best package that I ever seen before, and I just can say,  that was what I want,  great,</li>
            <li> I get the most compliments with this Cologne. it smells very fresh and refreshing you can wear it anytime of the day.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Out of the bottle, you instantly get the green notes - yes, there are other notes in this fragrance, i.e. amber, floral, vetiver, etc., but it is the green notes that overtake those minor notes are signature for this fragrance.  The end result is pleasant fragrance that is easy on the nose.  Perhaps you have smelled Swiss Army&#x27;s &amp;#34;Unlimited&amp;#34; edition - many similarities to this fragrance.  (Swiss Army lasts much longer and has garnered many more compliments..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh provides modest longevity, lasting about 6 hours and even longer on my clothing.  Projection/sillage is modest at best, settling close to skin level follow two (2) hours of wear.  Obviously, geared more toward day wear in Spring and Summer seasons.  While I am comfortable wearing any fragrance, I think Fresh is more suited for a younger crowd.  Additionally, I will make a more bold statement that this fragrance nears middle of road at being a unisex fragrance.  I have smelled a number of niche fragrances deemed unisex that are more masculine than Fresh.  Dare to be different - go for it..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have about seven (7) Dunhill fragrances in my current collection and I admire the bottling design in each one.  Fresh is no different - first class design and the bottle represents high quality and confidence.  The price/value is awesome.  I just checked current on-line pricing and a large bottle can be purchased for under $30 USD.  A great deal...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - my tally for Fresh is 4.0 stars out of 5.0 stars.  While I like it, I am not sure I love it.  It smells similar to many fragrances available.  If you like clean, fresh showered fragrances, I definitely recommend adding to your collection.  If you are a seasoned collector, take a pass on Dunhill&#x27;s Fresh - it is good, but keep searching for your signature fragrance...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your day and make it count... Invest your time rather than wasting it...</li>
            <li> Got to love it my all time favorite smell. 😊</li>
            <li> This cologne is guaranteed to take your complete breath away!  I am going to wear this cologne out like some deodorant!</li>
            <li> The name alone tells you that this is a clean, fresh smelling and very pleasant cologne that is subtle enough to wear anytime, particularly at the office/work.  Better for daytime than evening and most definitely a spring/summer cologne.  Will stay with you the entire day.  This is a \\&quot;super-fine\\&quot; fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a very disappointing scent. It could have made by anyone - but by Dunhill!? Shockingly poor cologne. Strongly advise looking elsewhere! You&#x27;d do better with a supermarket cologne.</li>
            <li> Found a bottle of this once in a rental car that someone left behind. Ever since this has been my go to scent. It&#x27;s fresh and clean smelling and lingers all day.</li>
            <li> Had to change the review. The perfume is excellent and but not very long lasting.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. Smells woody.</li>
            <li> Timely delivery. ..great</li>
            <li> is great came in good time no problems</li>
    </ol>
