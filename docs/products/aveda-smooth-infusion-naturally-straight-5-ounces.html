            <li>Glad I listened to the Aveda manager :)</li>
            <li>This product has changed my hair but not for the better.  </li>
            <li>I used this for more than a month.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, this stuff is okay.  </li>
            <li>Really love this -</li>
            <li>So glad I discovered this product</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>the results looks like I have a relaxer love this stuff</li>
            <li>INCREDULOUSLY MUCH MORE CURLY.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>its more like panten or dove oil replacement products</li>
            <li>for.i love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Does an ok job straightening.</li>
            <li>Works ok.</li>
            <li>Ok, fine.</li>
            <li>I love Aveda Smooth Infusion.</li>
            <li>I have also been using a very small amount on my 3 year olds extremely fine &amp; easily tangled hair, surprisingly this has been the best detangle product  I have used on her hair</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It worked perfectly fine</li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase again in the future to use it as a frizz aid (rather than a straightening aid), because that&#x27;s how it worked best for me.</li>
            <li>Did not even smooth or control as a finishing product.</li>
            <li>Used daily with great results.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li>Aveda smooth infusion works wonders for houston humidity.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel &amp;#34;coated,&amp;#34; but it does seem to smooth it out.  </li>
            <li>but this product really helped my hair stay nice.</li>
            <li>I woke up this morning to a still smooth and bouncy head if hair.</li>
            <li>prefer to apply the product in my hands and then smooth out roots and edges.</li>
            <li>This product keeps my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>this stuff- smooths nicely &amp; I don&#x27;t have to use dryer as long to get it nice.</li>
            <li>First, I love the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li>I have long, fine, wavy hair and haven&#x27;t had good results with any of the Smooth Infusion line.</li>
            <li>i have tried, i think hundreds of products hoping for the same effect and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Naturally curly, frizzy hair all my life, and this stuff works magic!  </li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this product.</li>
            <li>Just be sure not to use too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>It was pretty good, but after sleeping on it, some of my curl would return the next day.</li>
            <li>non greasy, nice smell(not strong like other aveda products), and does the job.</li>
            <li>Amazing product and definitely lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>but this really makes my hair smooth after blow drying.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but I expected more for the price.</li>
            <li>This is a nice cream that is non greasy, however I cannot see it did anything to assist with straightening my hair, even after multiple uses.</li>
            <li>make the hair greasy doesnt worth the 30 dollars</li>
            <li>The first time I switched out the Glossing Straightener for the Naturally Straight, I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>worked fantastic with first use, then did absolutely nothing for my hair</li>
            <li>I recommend to purchase this product from an Aveda store the first time in case you want to return it.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it it seemed to work well.</li>
            <li>it keeps my hair smooth and soft</li>
            <li>I only hope they keep making this magical serum.</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary full-size bottle of Aveda Naturally Straight courtesy of Aveda and SheSpeaks.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it said it would do</li>
            <li>This product is tremendous at straightening, smoothing hair while making it soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>I was able to skip the flat iron and have straight hair even after washes for up to five days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Holds straightening from first use: I have used the entire Aveda Smooth Infusion line, including the Glossing Straightener, from the beginning.</li>
            <li>While it didn&#x27;t work miracles to straighten my hair, it certainly worked wonders on &amp;#34;gluing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I just blow dried my hair, and it looks better than if a Pro did it!  </li>
            <li>did follow up with a flat iron after first application and noticed my hair was still smooth and straight three days after using Aveda Naturally Straight.</li>
            <li>If I want to seal the ends, I run a flat iron through the ends very quickly.</li>
            <li>But for a $30 hair product, I expected better.</li>
            <li>&amp; straight.</li>
            <li>This product did NOTHING for my very curly hair.</li>
            <li>Well...I&#x27;ve been using SINS and it is really making a change in my hair.</li>
            <li>Straight hair without heat</li>
            <li>After using Naturally Straight for about 5 weeks, my hair dries almost straight.</li>
            <li>The whole process would take anywhere from 40 minutes to an hour.</li>
            <li>After that, not so well - my hair really doesn&#x27;t stay straight.</li>
            <li>Removes the pesky waves in my hair and make it straight and silky.</li>
            <li>Maybe this wasn&#x27;t the real stuff.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work as expected, thought we would get more for the price</li>
            <li>Time will tell if this product is the real deal or if it will tend to lose it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair so much straighter for days, and also looking fuller and shinier.  </li>
            <li>, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Keeps my bleached, frizzy hair straight.</li>
            <li>used Aveda Naturally Straight with and without a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Thankfully I wasn&#x27;t using as much as they recommend.</li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference; it wasn&#x27;t flatter, heavier, straighter than without this product.</li>
            <li>It makes the job of smoothing so much easier.  </li>
            <li>I have used it twice already and it really has made my hear hair smother and silker.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually pretty effective after a few uses!</li>
            <li>I hope that it gets better with some other product, but I am still looking for an antidote.  </li>
            <li>I’ve been trying to come up with all sorts of other reasons as to why my hair is in this state, because I love Aveda products .</li>
            <li>Many days, I just don&#x27;t have the time; so, I put in some product, tousle it and let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ll ever live without it!</li>
            <li>Works ok on my curly hair but not worth the high price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll like it over the long haul, but after using &amp;#34;Glossing Straightener,&amp;#34; I can say that this is a great improvement.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>makes my hair soft and it really does have a cumulative straightening affect on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I normally have frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I have used this product on my hair which is baby fine, limp and very unruly.  </li>
            <li>It WILL smooth your hair, fight the frizz and make it extremely easier to straighten.</li>
            <li>I am natural I received this product today I washed and conditioned with tresemme keratin smooth and applyed aveda to wet hair straightened</li>
            <li>The people working in my Aveda store raved about this product and were very surprised when I returned it because it wasn&#x27;t making a difference for me.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I will ever need to get my professionally straightened again!</li>
            <li>Your hairdresser will be the first to tell you that it takes times using it daily.</li>
            <li>Really at this point I don’t know what to do, my hair is super frizzy, super dry, and uneven from breakage.</li>
            <li>The next day, I just run a brush through it, and it is almost completely straight -- no heat-styling required!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have natural 4a curls</li>
            <li>it makes my hair soft</li>
            <li>Or it was old??  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it multiple times on rainy days and my hair stays perfectly straight.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair already with the occasional wave</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d gone natural for 3 or so years and</li>
            <li>Overall, I noticed a difference and my hair remained straight days after application.</li>
            <li>Garbage,  straightens only naturally straight hair they forgot to mention this.&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this product..</li>
            <li>I prefer this over a BKT since it doesn&#x27;t damage the hair but still gets it extremely straight and silky (after blow drying and flat ironing).</li>
            <li>But it dulls the surface, reducing shine, and - if you have long hair - produces knots so huge I had to put conditioner on it just to get a brush through.</li>
            <li>i normally blow dry and then use giant hot rollers to get some lift and style.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry, flyaway hair and have to use extra moisturizing shampoos and conditioners, as well as flat irons to smooth out my hair.  </li>
            <li>the smooth resukts were almost unbelievable.  </li>
            <li>I have wavy fuzzy hair especially when it&#x27;s humid- live</li>
            <li>However, in order for it to loosen your curls, you have to use it at least 5 times in a row, which is fine if thats</li>
            <li>For as pricey as it is, I guess I may have expected too much.</li>
            <li>Prior to that as a child my hair was straightened the old fashioned way.</li>
            <li>It might work for other hair types, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t work for mine.  </li>
            <li>First of all, let me point out that you can buy this stuff from the Aveda website for half the price.  </li>
            <li>At first, the curls were a little cute, but it just gets worse.  </li>
            <li>If you have frizzy, thin hair like me, you may have tried several products hoping one would work the magic.</li>
            <li>Nothing has ever made my hair look straighter and less frizzy, even in high humidity than this!  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft, and cuts down on my flat iron ritual as well, not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>The product has a cream consistency and I can use as little or as much as I would prefer.</li>

            <li> Time will tell if this product is the real deal or if it will tend to lose it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair so much straighter for days, and also looking fuller and shinier.  </li>
            <li> , I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Keeps my bleached, frizzy hair straight.</li>
            <li> used Aveda Naturally Straight with and without a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Thankfully I wasn&#x27;t using as much as they recommend.</li>
            <li> Not so much.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference; it wasn&#x27;t flatter, heavier, straighter than without this product.</li>
            <li> It makes the job of smoothing so much easier.  </li>
            <li> I have used it twice already and it really has made my hear hair smother and silker.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually pretty effective after a few uses!</li>
            <li> I hope that it gets better with some other product, but I am still looking for an antidote.  </li>
            <li> I’ve been trying to come up with all sorts of other reasons as to why my hair is in this state, because I love Aveda products .</li>
            <li> Many days, I just don&#x27;t have the time; so, I put in some product, tousle it and let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ll ever live without it!</li>
            <li> Works ok on my curly hair but not worth the high price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll like it over the long haul, but after using &amp;#34;Glossing Straightener,&amp;#34; I can say that this is a great improvement.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> makes my hair soft and it really does have a cumulative straightening affect on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I normally have frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product on my hair which is baby fine, limp and very unruly.  </li>
            <li> It WILL smooth your hair, fight the frizz and make it extremely easier to straighten.</li>
            <li> I am natural I received this product today I washed and conditioned with tresemme keratin smooth and applyed aveda to wet hair straightened</li>
            <li> The people working in my Aveda store raved about this product and were very surprised when I returned it because it wasn&#x27;t making a difference for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I will ever need to get my professionally straightened again!</li>
            <li> Your hairdresser will be the first to tell you that it takes times using it daily.</li>
            <li> Really at this point I don’t know what to do, my hair is super frizzy, super dry, and uneven from breakage.</li>
            <li> The next day, I just run a brush through it, and it is almost completely straight -- no heat-styling required!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have natural 4a curls</li>
            <li> it makes my hair soft</li>
            <li> Or it was old??  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it multiple times on rainy days and my hair stays perfectly straight.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair already with the occasional wave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d gone natural for 3 or so years and</li>
            <li> Overall, I noticed a difference and my hair remained straight days after application.</li>
            <li> Garbage,  straightens only naturally straight hair they forgot to mention this.&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product..</li>
            <li> I prefer this over a BKT since it doesn&#x27;t damage the hair but still gets it extremely straight and silky (after blow drying and flat ironing).</li>
            <li> But it dulls the surface, reducing shine, and - if you have long hair - produces knots so huge I had to put conditioner on it just to get a brush through.</li>
            <li> i normally blow dry and then use giant hot rollers to get some lift and style.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, flyaway hair and have to use extra moisturizing shampoos and conditioners, as well as flat irons to smooth out my hair.  </li>
            <li> the smooth resukts were almost unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> I have wavy fuzzy hair especially when it&#x27;s humid- live</li>
            <li> However, in order for it to loosen your curls, you have to use it at least 5 times in a row, which is fine if thats</li>
            <li> For as pricey as it is, I guess I may have expected too much.</li>
            <li> Prior to that as a child my hair was straightened the old fashioned way.</li>
            <li> It might work for other hair types, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t work for mine.  </li>
            <li> First of all, let me point out that you can buy this stuff from the Aveda website for half the price.  </li>
            <li> At first, the curls were a little cute, but it just gets worse.  </li>
            <li> If you have frizzy, thin hair like me, you may have tried several products hoping one would work the magic.</li>
            <li> Nothing has ever made my hair look straighter and less frizzy, even in high humidity than this!  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very soft, and cuts down on my flat iron ritual as well, not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> The product has a cream consistency and I can use as little or as much as I would prefer.</li>
            <li> I usually do not blow dry my hair because it leaves my hair brittle and dry.</li>
            <li> Styling time cut into a quarter of the time: Before, I would dry my roots and then take a round brush, drying my hair straight in sections.</li>
            <li> used this as directed - continuously for 6 days, used the proper amount each time prior to blowing it dry.</li>
            <li> Then, I would use the flat iron and straighten in sections.</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t have to use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Keeping the flat iron off my hair helps minimize damage, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> but I dry using a blower brush and then later I use an iron.  </li>
            <li> Next time I straighten, I am going to add a dollop to my finished hair and see if I garner the same result as I did with wet</li>
            <li> I was expecting a gradual improvement while still having to use a little flat ironing to complete the process.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Aveda Naturally Straight did help minimize frizz but on a humid day a little assistance from other products may be needed.</li>
            <li> However, you have to be reasonable about the expected results: this product WILL NOT magically straighten curly hair over night..</li>
            <li> Leaves it soft without a heavy film.</li>
            <li> I have super-thick, long curly hair.</li>
            <li> mostly grey hair which has become thicker, curlier and coarser as I age.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it!</li>
            <li> I have very long, curly (type 2c) hair that gets oily at the roots with dry, brittle ends.</li>
            <li> I find this product leaves my hair dry and crunchy after blow drying and not any straighter than non use.</li>
            <li> Now, I dry my hair without a brush.</li>
            <li> Just add some to damp hair, then blow dry.  </li>
            <li> After this step I would either blow dry or allow my hair to air dry, depending on my mood or temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, wavy (sometimes tends to curl) dry hair.</li>
            <li> Made my hair dry and frizzy, will not buy again</li>
            <li> Did not work in my hair like a previous bottle that I bought from an actual Aveda salon did.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as expected, overpriced.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product reacts to other color products.  </li>
            <li> And due to the beastly nature of my mane, skipping a straightening iron is a no-go.</li>
            <li> prior to pulling my hair in a top-knot on a lazy day, I worked this product through my hair.</li>
            <li> A little expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I use a demi color on my hair which usually makes my hair feel softer and straighter, but that only lasts a few days now.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the $30 price tag.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick, coarse and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Thumbs down...</li>
            <li> My options are pulled up, or straightened and down because my hair is a beast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I usually air dry).</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with my hair during this extreme humidity we have had this summer</li>
            <li> You can use up to half a bottle to see if you like it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any less curls with any use.  </li>
            <li> Dried out my hair and damaged it.</li>
            <li> waste your money</li>
            <li> As my hair dried, there were no frizzy flyaways that make my &#x27;do look undone.</li>
            <li> What I had hoped was after blow-drying, my hair would be a bit straighter and therefore easier to tame with the iron.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long curly hair and a ton of it.</li>
            <li> My hair is so badly damaged that it is the first thing my friends mention when they see me.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say anything bad because I don&#x27;t know if it really worked or if just straightening/flat</li>
            <li> Needless to say, both my hairdresser and I were totally amazed that all she had to do was blowout my hair and</li>
            <li> Easier than ever to blow dry - such a crazy product!</li>
            <li> IT MADE MY HAIR LOOK &amp;#34;SICK&amp;#34; , DULL, PUFFY AND</li>
            <li> Speeds up drying time for my thick frizzy/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Which has never been the case in the past!  </li>
            <li> This product seriously annihilated my hair.</li>
            <li> seriously I just don’t understand.</li>
            <li> It does make your hair soft, but all the blow drying got annoying</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Turns my thin hair greasy.</li>
            <li> i start to flat iron, which i hate because of the damage.</li>
            <li> hate it it dried out my hair</li>
            <li> I was so desperate I almost considered one of those expensive keratin treatments</li>
            <li> Try it, you cannot go wrong!</li>
            <li> Another one(hair product) bites the dust:(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very disappointing.</li>
            <li> A real disappointment.</li>
            <li> It has been a terrifying thing to watch.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I recommend to purchase this product from an Aveda store the first time in case you want to return it. You can use up to half a bottle to see if you like it. The people working in my Aveda store raved about this product and were very surprised when I returned it because it wasn&#x27;t making a difference for me. I have long, fine, wavy hair and haven&#x27;t had good results with any of the Smooth Infusion line. I used this every day for about a month before I gave up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad. But for a $30 hair product, I expected better. It does make your hair soft, but all the blow drying got annoying (I usually air dry). I ended up giving it to my mom who blow dries her hair regularly. She also thinks it&#x27;s just okay. Nothing special.</li>
            <li> I have wavy fuzzy hair especially when it&#x27;s humid- live this stuff- smooths nicely &amp; I don&#x27;t have to use dryer as long to get it nice. &amp; straight.</li>
            <li> This product did NOTHING for my very curly hair. Did not even smooth or control as a finishing product.</li>
            <li> I find this product leaves my hair dry and crunchy after blow drying and not any straighter than non use.</li>
            <li> This product is tremendous at straightening, smoothing hair while making it soft and shiny! Love it.</li>
            <li> This product truly works! I never write reviews, but this time I felt I had to do it. If you have frizzy, thin hair like me, you may have tried several products hoping one would work the magic. Well...I&#x27;ve been using SINS and it is really making a change in my hair. It looks healthier, silkier, and more manageable. Glad I listened to the Aveda manager :)</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long curly hair and a ton of it. Here&#x27;s what this product has done for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Holds straightening from first use: I have used the entire Aveda Smooth Infusion line, including the Glossing Straightener, from the beginning. It was pretty good, but after sleeping on it, some of my curl would return the next day. The first time I switched out the Glossing Straightener for the Naturally Straight, I noticed a huge difference. My hair now holds for DAYS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Straight hair without heat: Because I have a ton of hair, it takes forever to style (details in #3). Many days, I just don&#x27;t have the time; so, I put in some product, tousle it and let it dry naturally. After using Naturally Straight for about 5 weeks, my hair dries almost straight. The next day, I just run a brush through it, and it is almost completely straight -- no heat-styling required!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Styling time cut into a quarter of the time: Before, I would dry my roots and then take a round brush, drying my hair straight in sections. Then, I would use the flat iron and straighten in sections. The whole process would take anywhere from 40 minutes to an hour. Now, I dry my hair without a brush. If I want to seal the ends, I run a flat iron through the ends very quickly. This process takes 10-15 minutes!</li>
            <li> I have natural 4a curls and I love this product! However, in order for it to loosen your curls, you have to use it at least 5 times in a row, which is fine if thats what you wanna do. I prefer this over a BKT since it doesn&#x27;t damage the hair but still gets it extremely straight and silky (after blow drying and flat ironing).</li>
            <li> My hair is more manageable!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it it seemed to work well. After that, not so well - my hair really doesn&#x27;t stay straight.</li>
            <li> Removes the pesky waves in my hair and make it straight and silky.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Used daily with great results.</li>
            <li> it keeps my hair smooth and soft</li>
            <li> Works ok on my curly hair but not worth the high price</li>
            <li> I love Aveda Smooth Infusion. It leaves my hair so smooth and frizz free. I could not style my hair without it. This is truly one of my favorite Aveda product! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product on my hair which is baby fine, limp and very unruly.  In the humid weather here in the Northeast this product has done almost nothing to control the frizz in my hair.  I will not purchase this product again.  It might work for other hair types, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t work for mine.  It&#x27;s very disappointing.</li>
            <li> i am using this on my keratin treated hair to make the length between treatments longer. as i get to the end of a treatment cycle for keratin. my hair will start to get kinks and patches of curls in the regrowth, esp on the back of my head. i start to flat iron, which i hate because of the damage. i bought this and by the second time i used it, i noticed that the curly sections on the back of my head were smoother.  it makes my hair soft, my ends don&#x27;t look fried and i don&#x27;t have to use a flat iron. i normally blow dry and then use giant hot rollers to get some lift and style. i have tried, i think hundreds of products hoping for the same effect and this is by far the best. non greasy, nice smell(not strong like other aveda products), and does the job. in love!</li>
            <li> This product has changed my hair but not for the better.  At first, the curls were a little cute, but it just gets worse.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any less curls with any use.  Just the opposite.  I used this for more than a month.  Now that it is summer, my hair just gets bigger and looks like I had a perm instead.  I have stopped using it.  I hope that it gets better with some other product, but I am still looking for an antidote.  I came to the comments for suggestions.  I use a demi color on my hair which usually makes my hair feel softer and straighter, but that only lasts a few days now.  It used to last longer.  I don&#x27;t know if this product reacts to other color products.  My hair hasn&#x27;t fallen out, so I give it two stars, but it didn&#x27;t work as advertised.  I only hope that I can return it, but I don&#x27;t know if I still have the receipt.</li>
            <li> Did not work in my hair like a previous bottle that I bought from an actual Aveda salon did.  This bottle that I got off of Amazon did... nothing.  Maybe this wasn&#x27;t the real stuff.  Or it was old??  Thumbs down...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I expected more for the price.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected, thought we would get more for the price</li>
            <li> Perfect straightening cream for fine hair. Leaves it soft without a heavy film. I&#x27;ve tried them all!  Plus it has very pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> worked fantastic with first use, then did absolutely nothing for my hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually pretty effective after a few uses!</li>
            <li> It did not make my hair any straighter and I used it according to directions.  Another one(hair product) bites the dust:(</li>
            <li> I guess it helps as a setting lotion, but have noticed no improvement in hair straightening. For as pricey as it is, I guess I may have expected too much. I&#x27;m almost out of the tube, and haven&#x27;t noticed difference.</li>
            <li> works just like they said</li>
            <li> Aveda smooth infusion works wonders for houston humidity. I&#x27;ve used it multiple times on rainy days and my hair stays perfectly straight.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me point out that you can buy this stuff from the Aveda website for half the price.  I have no idea who is selling it here, but if you buy it here, you are wasting your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, this stuff is okay.  It makes my hair feel &amp;#34;coated,&amp;#34; but it does seem to smooth it out.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll like it over the long haul, but after using &amp;#34;Glossing Straightener,&amp;#34; I can say that this is a great improvement.  Still....kind of stiffens my hair.  Use with caution.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with my hair during this extreme humidity we have had this summer but this product really helped my hair stay nice.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing... I don&#x27;t think I will get a brazilian blowout again!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  Naturally curly, frizzy hair all my life, and this stuff works magic!  Nothing has ever made my hair look straighter and less frizzy, even in high humidity than this!  Try it, you cannot go wrong!</li>
            <li> Still waiting for results</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product &amp;#34;Smooth Infusion-Naturally Strsight&amp;#34; by my hairdresser.  I have extremely dry, flyaway hair and have to use extra moisturizing shampoos and conditioners, as well as flat irons to smooth out my hair.  I was expecting a gradual improvement while still having to use a little flat ironing to complete the process.  Needless to say, both my hairdresser and I were totally amazed that all she had to do was blowout my hair and the smooth resukts were almost unbelievable.  I woke up this morning to a still smooth and bouncy head if hair. I almost cried for joy. Time will tell if this product is the real deal or if it will tend to lose it&#x27;s effectiveness. Will keep you posted!</li>
            <li> Amazing product and definitely lived up to my expectations. Don&#x27;t think I will ever need to get my professionally straightened again! I only hope they keep making this magical serum.</li>
            <li> hate it it dried out my hair</li>
            <li> great product; works great to smooth hair</li>
            <li> Really love this - I have straight hair already with the occasional wave but this really makes my hair smooth after blow drying.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I have very thick, wavy, frizzy hair. Summertime is a challenge. I was so desperate I almost considered one of those expensive keratin treatments (but I don&#x27;t like the idea of putting all those chemicals on my head and spending all that money!) I am so glad I tried this product instead! It greatly reduces my frizz and just smoothes out my hair so wonderfully. I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ll ever live without it!</li>
            <li> This product seriously annihilated my hair. My hair is so badly damaged that it is the first thing my friends mention when they see me. I went from my hair being to the middle of my back to just above my shoulders. I’ve watched tons of ringlets from my curly hair fill the sink and the shower when I’m combing it out. It has been a terrifying thing to watch. I haven’t cried yet, because I’m trying to sell myself the “it’s just hair, and it will grow back” bull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously I just don’t understand. I’ve been trying to come up with all sorts of other reasons as to why my hair is in this state, because I love Aveda products . But the reality is that I stopped perming my hair years ago, I deep condition after every shampoo, I always wear a swim cap at the pool, etc., so all signs point to this product. Really at this point I don’t know what to do, my hair is super frizzy, super dry, and uneven from breakage. Not even gel and a bun/ponytail can help me,</li>
            <li> OMG! Cannot believe how much I love this stuff!  I just blow dried my hair, and it looks better than if a Pro did it!  Which has never been the case in the past!  I have used this now 3times, and already my hair is straighter, fuller, shinier.  First, I love the smell of this product.  It is easy to use.  Just add some to damp hair, then blow dry.  It keeps my hair so much straighter for days, and also looking fuller and shinier.  So glad I discovered this product, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly fine I guess. I used it about 3 times but the 4th time I did not. I&#x27;d gone natural for 3 or so years and prior to that using perm. Prior to that as a child my hair was straightened the old fashioned way. So now I&#x27;m wondering if WITHOUT this product, if I would have had the same results ANYWAY?  Can&#x27;t say anything bad because I don&#x27;t know if it really worked or if just straightening/flat ironing my hair would have had same results as when I was a kid.</li>
            <li> Works great. Just be sure not to use too much. Keeps my bleached, frizzy hair straight.</li>
            <li> Best straight into produt Ive ever used</li>
            <li> I have very long, curly (type 2c) hair that gets oily at the roots with dry, brittle ends. This cream was AMAZING on my hair. However, you have to be reasonable about the expected results: this product WILL NOT magically straighten curly hair over night.. Your hairdresser will be the first to tell you that it takes times using it daily. It WILL smooth your hair, fight the frizz and make it extremely easier to straighten. It keeps my hair from curling up throughout the day, too. LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary full-size bottle of Aveda Naturally Straight courtesy of Aveda and SheSpeaks. I have naturally thick, coarse and frizzy hair. I have to straighten my hair daily to keep frizz and waves in checks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Aveda Naturally Straight with and without a hair dryer. I usually do not blow dry my hair because it leaves my hair brittle and dry. The product has a cream consistency and I can use as little or as much as I would prefer. I apply the product to my roots only and keep away from my scalp as straightening products can make my hair appear greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to apply the product in my hands and then smooth out roots and edges. Then I comb my hair well while still trying to keep from scalp. After this step I would either blow dry or allow my hair to air dry, depending on my mood or temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did follow up with a flat iron after first application and noticed my hair was still smooth and straight three days after using Aveda Naturally Straight. The second week of use I was able to skip the flat iron and have straight hair even after washes for up to five days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveda Naturally Straight did help minimize frizz but on a humid day a little assistance from other products may be needed. Overall, I noticed a difference and my hair remained straight days after application. Keeping the flat iron off my hair helps minimize damage, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Dried out my hair and damaged it. Thankfully I wasn&#x27;t using as much as they recommend. Works great for some people, wish it would have for me.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. Nothing special about this product. Don&#x27;t fall for the hype like I did.</li>
            <li> I am natural I received this product today I washed and conditioned with tresemme keratin smooth and applyed aveda to wet hair straightened and I love the results looks like I have a relaxer love this stuff</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER PUT ON MY HAIR - I JUST CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE IT&#x27;S SUPPOSED TO SLEEK THE HAIR BECAUSE WHAT IT DID IS JUST THE OPPOSITE: IT MADE MY HAIR LOOK &amp;#34;SICK&amp;#34; , DULL, PUFFY AND INCREDULOUSLY MUCH MORE CURLY.&lt;br /&gt;I AM GOING TO THROW IT AWAY.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it said it would do</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, wavy (sometimes tends to curl) dry hair. This is a nice cream that is non greasy, however I cannot see it did anything to assist with straightening my hair, even after multiple uses. I saw no change and I can&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I normally have frizzy hair. This product keeps my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Garbage,  straightens only naturally straight hair they forgot to mention this.&lt;br /&gt;Dont waste your money its more like panten or dove oil replacement products but it doeant make the hair greasy doesnt worth the 30 dollars</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product.. This prodct delivered what it promised.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as expected, overpriced. Turns my thin hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Made my hair dry and frizzy, will not buy again</li>
            <li> I had high-hopes for this product. Anything that promises to lessen curls with continued use is a must-buy for me. I have super-thick, long curly hair. Air-drying is not an option, nor is the mousse/gel curly look (personal preference, I don&#x27;t like it on me.). My options are pulled up, or straightened and down because my hair is a beast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this as directed - continuously for 6 days, used the proper amount each time prior to blowing it dry. The drying time was maybe lessened by a fraction. Maybe. And due to the beastly nature of my mane, skipping a straightening iron is a no-go. What I had hoped was after blow-drying, my hair would be a bit straighter and therefore easier to tame with the iron. Not so much. I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference; it wasn&#x27;t flatter, heavier, straighter than without this product. Ok, fine. So I tried it another way: prior to pulling my hair in a top-knot on a lazy day, I worked this product through my hair. As my hair dried, there were no frizzy flyaways that make my &#x27;do look undone. None at all. That is the reason I will purchase this again in the future. While it didn&#x27;t work miracles to straighten my hair, it certainly worked wonders on &amp;#34;gluing&amp;#34; those pesky flyaways when I didn&#x27;t straighten. Next time I straighten, I am going to add a dollop to my finished hair and see if I garner the same result as I did with wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - everyone&#x27;s hair is different. While this didn&#x27;t work miracles for my hair (nothing has, yet), it may work for yours. I will certainly purchase again in the future to use it as a frizz aid (rather than a straightening aid), because that&#x27;s how it worked best for me.</li>
            <li> makes my hair soft and it really does have a cumulative straightening affect on my hair.  I can&#x27;t blow out my hair (don&#x27;t have the skills) but I dry using a blower brush and then later I use an iron.  It makes the job of smoothing so much easier.  I have longish. mostly grey hair which has become thicker, curlier and coarser as I age. The product maintains smoothness until my next shampoo which, in my case, is six days.  Expensive but worth it!</li>
            <li> I have used it twice already and it really has made my hear hair smother and silker.  A little expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> This  gives me the salon look iv been looking for.i love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb!! Speeds up drying time for my thick frizzy/wavy hair. It leaves my hair very soft, and cuts down on my flat iron ritual as well, not heavy at all. I have also been using a very small amount on my 3 year olds extremely fine &amp; easily tangled hair, surprisingly this has been the best detangle product  I have used on her hair, I can brush her hair with no fuss even after she has played all day and slept.</li>
            <li> Does an ok job straightening. Definetely doesn&#x27;t straighten progressively. Nice scent. Not worth the $30 price tag.</li>
            <li> Easier than ever to blow dry - such a crazy product!</li>
            <li> A real disappointment. If I&#x27;d read the product description, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought it. It works by coating the hair with tiny fibers, thus eliminating curls and frizz ... But it dulls the surface, reducing shine, and - if you have long hair - produces knots so huge I had to put conditioner on it just to get a brush through.</li>
            <li> Works ok. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be good but it&#x27;s not for my hair.</li>
