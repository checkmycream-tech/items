            <li>love &#x27;em!</li>
            <li>I was very surprised by the thickness of the plastic handles and the excellent grit on them.  </li>
            <li>Sturdy, great value, long-lasting, colorful foot files.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find a suitable foot file for years.  </li>
            <li>i WILL BE ORDERING MORE TO SHARE</li>
            <li>glad I gave a chance to this</li>
            <li>them I do :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bargain for how many come in a pack.</li>
            <li>so glad they came in 5 pack.</li>
            <li>These are ok, but I might give them away as stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li>in all, an OK product</li>
            <li>i was able to give a couple to my family to use</li>
            <li>I love these things, they work better than any foot file I have every had.  </li>
            <li>Saw this offer and am so pleased with them and the price.</li>
            <li>glad I got them</li>
            <li>, they work fantastic and there are 5 of them!  </li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>Winter had done my foot heals in and this helped tremendously along with a nice moisture cream.</li>
            <li>Product works well but would be better if there was a finer grit surface on on side to allow more detailed filing.</li>
            <li>I have tried many many products to keep my dry heels in check -- these puppies really work great -- takes some elbow grease but work best when heels are soft from the shower..</li>
            <li>Amazing how well these work and such a good deal.</li>
            <li>Durable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I like these because the plastic is strong.</li>
            <li>Strong, yet flexible.  </li>
            <li>what I got,  They work fine, just don&#x27;t put too</li>
            <li>Files have the sandpaper I was looking for rather than something synthetic, but it&#x27;s ultra fine.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Great value for the price, double sided.</li>
            <li>These fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;old one I had wasn&#x27;t near as good as this set.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good strong quality and easy to use with coarse and fine file texture.&lt;br /&gt;GC.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I still use my Clover red foot file which is more effective.</li>
            <li>these are cheap yet work great on your feet, heels, even rough elbows.  </li>
            <li>These files are inexpensive, surprisingly good quality &amp; sturdy, come in a pleasing array of colors &amp; are individually wrapped.</li>
            <li>The size is good and I had enough for the shower, my travel bag, gave one to my husband and another to my son.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, really sturdy, not cheap, great for my feet that I let get rough from flip flops.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m rinsing off, I use them super quick</li>
            <li>Good at smoothing out rough areas quickly.</li>
            <li>These are more durable than the single ones you can buy in a store and a better value.  </li>
            <li>(I have one of those foot things with 3 or 4 different stages of pumice plus a buffer with the rotating electronic head) but for a busy mom, these work great.</li>
            <li>The price is right.  </li>
            <li>so I use these very very often</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted thanks if you have any rougher ones I would be interested !</li>
            <li>Still on my first one</li>
            <li>I may purchase more of them in the future for maybe some gifts.</li>
            <li>since I got 5 of them, I think they&#x27;ll probably last for many years.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to have to think about exactly when to stop, etc.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure: they are not as good as sitting down and doing things properly  </li>
            <li>However, that said, it actually works pretty well to smooth my feet.  </li>
            <li>These are pretty well made and do a good job of removing the thick cracked skin on the bottom of the foot.</li>
            <li>and they are large.</li>
            <li>Really like these.</li>
            <li>Very generous handle to get the job done.</li>
            <li>and I am very</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>These gems work really well.</li>
            <li>These work very well.</li>
            <li>Does not work very well for me.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li>OH so handy and long lasting files for feet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;during the first big snow right after Christmas.</li>
            <li>These have taken a fair bit of pressure and the plastic doesn&#x27;t feel weak.</li>
            <li>Was hoping for a little bit more coarseness.  </li>
            <li>Files are fine but not rough enough for me</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to have in the shower to quickly take off dry skin on my foot without too much work.</li>
            <li>Most files wear out after a couple of uses, these last a really long time.  </li>
            <li>If it comes off at some point, I figure I can glue on some new wet-dry sandpaper of my choice.</li>
            <li>Strong and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>and when I first used the new file, it made the skin on my heel a bit more ouch-y thin than I&#x27;d planned.  </li>
            <li>These will certainly get me through the summer and maybe even into next summer...</li>
            <li>Makes my feet soft will purchase again.</li>
            <li>Made my feet soft with one trial use</li>
            <li>These files get the job done on some really hard callouses, yet leave skin satiny smooth.  </li>
            <li>The files remove calluses in seconds, be careful not to remove too much ...</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t very course and didn&#x27;t last long at all!</li>
            <li>My only caution is to be careful not to file off TOO much of the callouses.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used 1 so far and the plastic seems sturdy enough.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re heavy duty and have large working areas.</li>

            <li> I always rinse my files and the sandpaper on these tends to bubble up a bit like it won&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using a tired, old file that never had as much muscle as these do</li>
            <li> The old one had a smoothing side and rough side, these are about half way between and the same on both sides.</li>
            <li> They are as I expected, except a bit flimsy.  </li>
            <li> Gee, don&#x27;t need that level of roughage; they tear my foot up.</li>
            <li> File isn&#x27;t too rough on my feet.  </li>
            <li> Ordinarily I would be suspicious of the quality of anything priced this low, but after reading some of the favorable reviews, I decided to take a chance.</li>
            <li> Used to get them there all the time but could only find serious scraper types.</li>
            <li> Dead skin will be flying off your feet with these things.</li>
            <li> I hate seeing people in sandals that don&#x27;t smooth their heels, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving them as small Christmas gifts along with travel-size bottles of Bath &amp; Body Works lotion.</li>
            <li> They are very heavy duty and don&#x27;t bend or buckle under pressure.</li>
            <li> The plastic on them is really thick, also, so they haven&#x27;t been bent or broken.</li>
            <li> Very thick plastic</li>
            <li> I was wary of the PedEggs because of what some people said about scraping off your skin if you rub too hard.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how you could go wrong.</li>
            <li> I have horrible feet (battling rough skin and calluses)</li>
            <li> pleased.can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase!</li>

            <li> OH so handy and long lasting files for feet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;old one I had wasn&#x27;t near as good as this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so glad I gave a chance to this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it has the power to do what these promise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recommend them I do :)</li>
            <li> For the price and how well they&#x27;re made,worth it.Makes my feet soft will purchase again.It&#x27;s a bargain for how many come in a pack.Still on my first one and it&#x27;s October so its been 4 months.I use it about 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> These are more durable than the single ones you can buy in a store and a better value.  The plastic on them is really thick, also, so they haven&#x27;t been bent or broken.</li>
            <li> works great on my wifes feet</li>
            <li> Best foot file I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Files are fine but not rough enough for me</li>
            <li> I have tried many many products to keep my dry heels in check -- these puppies really work great -- takes some elbow grease but work best when heels are soft from the shower..</li>
            <li> work well. I tend to keep loosing mine all the time so glad they came in 5 pack.</li>
            <li> These are ok, but I might give them away as stocking stuffers. I still use my Clover red foot file which is more effective.</li>
            <li> Great item and price.</li>
            <li> Very nice ,,remove calf from feet in 5 mins</li>
            <li> Good strong quality and easy to use with coarse and fine file texture.&lt;br /&gt;GC.</li>
            <li> These files are inexpensive, surprisingly good quality &amp; sturdy, come in a pleasing array of colors &amp; are individually wrapped. I&#x27;m giving them as small Christmas gifts along with travel-size bottles of Bath &amp; Body Works lotion.</li>
            <li> I like these.  The size is good and I had enough for the shower, my travel bag, gave one to my husband and another to my son.  And one left over!</li>
            <li> Works well! Made my feet soft with one trial use</li>
            <li> Awsome file.great price and I am very pleased.can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase!</li>
            <li> great product. shipping was prompt.&lt;br /&gt;would recomend</li>
            <li> Works great and lasts.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t very course and didn&#x27;t last long at all!</li>
            <li> These files get the job done on some really hard callouses, yet leave skin satiny smooth.  My only caution is to be careful not to file off TOO much of the callouses.  I&#x27;d been using a tired, old file that never had as much muscle as these do and when I first used the new file, it made the skin on my heel a bit more ouch-y thin than I&#x27;d planned.  With that caveat, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> Amazing how well these work and such a good deal.</li>
            <li> The price is right.  I gave one to a friend.  I think five of them will last for years.  Good at smoothing out rough areas quickly.</li>
            <li> Strong and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted thanks if you have any rougher ones I would be interested ! Thank you so much</li>
            <li> These are larger than the impression you get from the picture. You&#x27;ll be set for awhille; great buy for the money and arrived on time&lt;br /&gt;during the first big snow right after Christmas.</li>
            <li> This are about the best I have ever used!  (And I have used plenty!</li>
            <li> Sturdy and it does the job.</li>
            <li> They are as I expected, except a bit flimsy.  I paid&lt;br /&gt;for what I got,  They work fine, just don&#x27;t put too&lt;br /&gt;much pressure on the handle or they may snap.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, an OK product</li>
            <li> These gems work really well. Great value for the price, double sided. My feet feel like satin now. Very pleased and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I tend to have issues with my feet so when i saw and purchased these foot files i was hoping that it would work well. I was very pleased when i recieved my foot files with the quality and the size of them. They work great and bc i got 5 i was able to give a couple to my family to use and we all are happy with them. I may purchase more of them in the future for maybe some gifts.</li>
            <li> I like these because the plastic is strong. I have had things like these before and you apply pressure and they snap. These have taken a fair bit of pressure and the plastic doesn&#x27;t feel weak. The file part works well. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Product works well but would be better if there was a finer grit surface on on side to allow more detailed filing.</li>
            <li> I had a similar item that lasted about 4 years, so these should do me for awhile.  I would not use them in the shower, but they do best when your feet are still damp.  The old one had a smoothing side and rough side, these are about half way between and the same on both sides.</li>
            <li> Dead skin will be flying off your feet with these things. They are very heavy duty and don&#x27;t bend or buckle under pressure. Very thick plastic and they are large. Out of all of the foot filing contraptions I have purchased, these are the ones I will be going back to from now on.</li>
            <li> I have horrible feet (battling rough skin and calluses) so I use these very very often and I tend to go through a lot of these files.</li>
            <li> Ordinarily I would be suspicious of the quality of anything priced this low, but after reading some of the favorable reviews, I decided to take a chance. I was not disappointed. These are pretty well made and do a good job of removing the thick cracked skin on the bottom of the foot. They appear to be well made and since I got 5 of them, I think they&#x27;ll probably last for many years. I don&#x27;t see how you could go wrong.</li>
            <li> I love these things, they work better than any foot file I have every had.  Strong, yet flexible.  Great buy!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going nuts trying to find these in the store. Used to get them there all the time but could only find serious scraper types. Gee, don&#x27;t need that level of roughage; they tear my foot up. Saw this offer and am so pleased with them and the price. I hate seeing people in sandals that don&#x27;t smooth their heels, etc. Yuk. These work very well.</li>
            <li> Love them GREAT PRICE!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very, very happy with this purchase!  These are actually quality files!  I was very surprised by the thickness of the plastic handles and the excellent grit on them.  I almost didn&#x27;t order because they were plastic, was looking for wood handled file...glad I got them, they work fantastic and there are 5 of them!  These will certainly get me through the summer and maybe even into next summer...love &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> Sturdy, great value, long-lasting, colorful foot files. Great for people&#x27;s feet or dog&#x27;s nails, and they are recyclable. What more can I say?</li>
            <li> Great product - unbeatable price!</li>
            <li> Files have the sandpaper I was looking for rather than something synthetic, but it&#x27;s ultra fine.  Was hoping for a little bit more coarseness.  However, that said, it actually works pretty well to smooth my feet.  I always rinse my files and the sandpaper on these tends to bubble up a bit like it won&#x27;t last very long.  If it comes off at some point, I figure I can glue on some new wet-dry sandpaper of my choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used 1 so far and the plastic seems sturdy enough.  File isn&#x27;t too rough on my feet.  Cheaper than the 1 file I purchase and there were 5.</li>
            <li> Durable and easy to use.  Does a good job.</li>
            <li> Does not work very well for me.</li>
            <li> My wife says these foot files are the best she&#x27;s ever tried. They&#x27;re heavy duty and have large working areas. Great product.</li>
            <li> The files do the job and  with the set of five I shared then with my future daughter in law.</li>
            <li> The files remove calluses in seconds, be careful not to remove too much ...</li>
            <li> these are cheap yet work great on your feet, heels, even rough elbows.  Most files wear out after a couple of uses, these last a really long time.  I will continue to use these and have purchased numerous for friends and family to throw in an extra gift item or stocking stuffer</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to have in the shower to quickly take off dry skin on my foot without too much work. These fit the bill.  I was wary of the PedEggs because of what some people said about scraping off your skin if you rub too hard. I didn&#x27;t want to have to think about exactly when to stop, etc. when I only have time for a 5 to 10 minute shower.  These are perfect. My heals look and feel great and I don&#x27;t have to think about it.  While I&#x27;m rinsing off, I use them super quick and I&#x27;m ready to go. Full disclosure: they are not as good as sitting down and doing things properly  (I have one of those foot things with 3 or 4 different stages of pumice plus a buffer with the rotating electronic head) but for a busy mom, these work great.</li>
