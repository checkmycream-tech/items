            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>Great customer service.</li>
            <li>This works great.  </li>
            <li>you just went to the dentist for free!!!</li>
            <li>Very effective cleaning.</li>
            <li>Until something better comes out Sonicare is probably the best.</li>
            <li>It is a good quality brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am fortunate with excellent teeth and no cavities but never had a problem with sensitivity</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it was a good bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>This is really good if you&#x27;re not used to a brush with 31,000 brush strokes per minute.</li>
            <li>On my dentist&#x27;s recommendation I replaced the Sonicare with a good Oral B pro power toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for about a week now, and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>but after you do it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Your teeth will feel amazing</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve remained an enthusiastic Philip Sonicare user for around 20 years.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re kind of a gimmick</li>
            <li>Nice toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I really liked it, and it traveled with me - its dual voltage charger was so handy.</li>
            <li>But, if you are thinking this is a good unit to be available to you on your bathroom countertop, think again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>far, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, well worth the price.</li>
            <li>even dough i read other reviews where people say it will brake after a year, if this tooth brush leas for a year i will be happy with it, because dental cleaning cost more than 180$ in san francisco so this toothbrush worked for me perfectly</li>
            <li>its really awesome vibrating  high frequency clean</li>
            <li>you guys will love this set trust me</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll go into a bit more</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect to get much more life out of it (either the battery will die or the tip that vibrates will break inside.</li>
            <li>The unit itself is most unstable.  </li>
            <li>What I found I have to do, is load the brush up with toothpaste, put it in my mouth, be sure I have my bifocals on</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is lighter, which makes it travel better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it 4 months now and it just keeps getting better.</li>
            <li>My dentist complimented my healthy gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>love Philips Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Love the Philip Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>Before using this tooth brush, I had sooo many cavities every time I went into the dentist.</li>
            <li>Always my favorite brand for tooth brush.</li>
            <li>It kept my teeth clean, plaque removed, my dentist happy with my home care, and with my daily flossing, I was a happy camper.  </li>
            <li>I like the three brushing modes, I&#x27;m again getting used to Sonicare&#x27;s 30-second interval pauses, and my teeth feel nice and clean after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really good cleaning and sensitive nice</li>
            <li>It has a sensitive setting which for me works great.</li>
            <li>I love the travel case, I can fit a travel toothpaste inside and throw it in my gym bag.</li>
            <li>some really easy look fells</li>
            <li>love how clean my teeth feel after just a couple</li>
            <li>I have used Phillips Sonicare products for years and this latest toothbrush proves once again that Phillips is at the top of the class.  </li>
            <li>Great product, love the fact that it vibrates when you have to move to the next area of your mouth.</li>
            <li>Brushing a full two minutes leads to better oral hygiene compared to brushing 30 seconds to 1 minute; so the brush does &amp;#34;work&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The unit is nice but very strong even in the sensitive mode.</li>
            <li>They both work just fine.  </li>
            <li>This model does include the quick &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; after every 30 seconds to make sure you get the recommended 2 minutes of brushing.  </li>
            <li>Accurate description.</li>
            <li>yet when I talked with this person, on an Internet-connected line, none of this information was available to this person.  </li>
            <li>So powerful, love how my teeth feel after using.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I don&#x27;t see much of a difference in the two brands  myself.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean and smooth after each brushing.</li>
            <li>Replacing an original Sonicare brush I bought in 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money, buy this!</li>
            <li>You get that dentist clean feeling every time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to keep this model clean, unlike my old Sonicare which had too many nooks and crannies that got all funky and gunky.</li>
            <li>and I still have a full battery</li>
            <li>I pair this with my prescription tooth paste and flossing daily, and my teeth are healthy and strong!</li>
            <li>I was one of the original folks who purchased this powerful electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Love my new one!</li>
            <li>After brushing it leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s still too intense you can easily opt for the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Love it and I am a very sensitive tooth personðŸ˜¬</li>
            <li>The brush heads are super expensive to buy for the Sonicare, yet I have found them to be of good value and of a good size for my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I guess after 20 years I got my monies worth.</li>
            <li>I am finally able to use a Sonicare brush with a sensitive brush head and this system.</li>
            <li>In my opinion Philips really is not the same excellent company it was 20 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>liked that it was packaged with both the diamond and a regular head</li>
            <li>use it everydayï¼Œ worth</li>
            <li>in all, I am not unhappy with the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>and they are totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>The smaller brush head on this device makes it very easy to reach those hard-to-get spots.</li>
            <li>These brushes are just the best and my dentist never tells me I have any problems for the last few years.</li>
            <li>This simple charging stand is easy to wipe off and keep clean, and will be convenient to pack if I need to take it along on a trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>this was gift and she likes it very much</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding brush, and it came with an added whitening pen,  two different brushes, and travel case.</li>
            <li>This is my third Sonicare over the many years I have ben using them.  </li>
            <li>let me know it&#x27;s time to move areas in my mouth, and the whitening mode changes intensity at the end and adds two 15 second intervals to focus on your top and bottom front</li>
            <li>works really well!</li>
            <li>What I love about this item it has three levels to choose from and a timer that lets you know time to move to the next section which allows for thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li>and you will see and feel the difference after the first use.  </li>
            <li>Phillips makes several more expensive systems, but for the money, this was the best buy for me.  </li>
            <li>Has Philips eliminated this design flaw in the Philips Sonacare Hx6731/34 Healthy White model?&lt;br</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>I cannot imagine how much better the other systems clean.  </li>
            <li>when you put tooth paste on int and in mouth i cant see the light what is it clean clean and white or sensitive and when you push buttun before you put in mouth then paste is spilling around.&lt;br /&gt;charger</li>
            <li>The new slim design is a nice look, and like all my earlier Sonicare&#x27;s, my teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just had them cleaned at the dentist after a brushing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another great thing about this toothbrush is the minimal, simple charging stand.</li>
            <li>The grip feels good, the brush is different from a traditional brush and the vibrating makes you pay attention to what you are doing while brushing your</li>
            <li>But if you shop around for other brands of &amp;#34;Sonic&amp;#34; toothbrushes with the same feature you will be able to find others that will work for you at a much better price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smaller charger unit lets the brush topple easily if nudged, but it seems to stay cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I also apparently got a special price on it... by shopping around on Amazon&#x27;s site.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>How could I be a healthy and happy senior if I am frustrated?  </li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t floss as much as I should, I KNOW</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>and yes, is really recommended by dentists!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>Everything works as advertised, and I really like the teeth whitening mode.</li>
            <li>They have clearly made vast improvements over the last 20 years and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Yet, my eyes will be ever searching with other companies to locate a better product.</li>
            <li>inside the box comes with a whitenig toothpaste and types of brushs and a electric charger and full toth brush and also a white case where you put your toothbrush whitenig and toothpaste</li>
            <li>Wow, this is my first ultrasonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The 30 second timers built in are really helpful to be sure you spend equal time on each tooth section.</li>
            <li>This brush has three speeds/intensities - normal, sensitive and &amp;#34;clean and white.&amp;#34; When you start using it, the brush gradually increases the intensity of the brushing for the first 10 brushes or so.</li>
            <li>I like the product, but both prior generations were plagued by fluid (from your mouth) that leaked while brushing through the brush head and collected in the well at the top of the handle where the brush head attached.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for years, one older one just gave up the ghost</li>
            <li>Even though mine has more features, you really only use the same normal setting pall the time.</li>
            <li>Mine came with a nice hard travel case that holds the handle and brush separately clipped in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>- Doesn&#x27;t improve oral hygiene enough to be worth the cost.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But Amazon shipped a new Toothbrush one day shipping.</li>
            <li>live and learn.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums and teeth and sensitive level is  gentle yet thoroughly cleans and whitens</li>
            <li>however when using this my gums and teeth became very sensitive.</li>
            <li>A replacement for a very old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>It has been five weeks since my latest dental cleaning, and there is very little, if any, staining.</li>
            <li>Takes a little to get used to, but it really leaves your mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I will say that, I bought the lower model for my wife and it works exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I love the slim handle (I have small hands) and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just what I wanted - later but pretty much the same as my 8-year old one.</li>
            <li>So far the toothbrush seems to be working the way it should.</li>
            <li>It was a mess and a pain to clean the old style head.</li>
            <li>While I like the toothbrush, I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars due to the fact that no where in the advertising does it state that the Special Packaging (which I bought) comes with a travel case.</li>
            <li>I did have a dental visit five months after getting the new toothbrush and got nothing but praise from my dental hygienist and the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading other reviews, I was a little concerned this new head would not be as fast and powerful with the Sonicare vibration.</li>
            <li>Even though I had to regularly clean out the gunk which collected in the base, I remained very pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>But after I started using this toothbrush 3 years ago, I noticed a huge difference after only a few months.</li>
            <li>This is the second Sonicare I&#x27;ve owned and I prefer this model so much over the last one.</li>
            <li>I did not understand why there were two packaging options to choose from at nearly the same price, so I studied the photo of the box front and saw that one did indeed come with extras, so I picked that</li>
            <li>After that, I compared it with my old one, and they felt the same to me.</li>
            <li>So, far it has been short of a miracle.</li>
            <li>in (the travel charger apparently fits inside and is removable).</li>
            <li>If you travel a lot, then, it is a good thing to have a container in which to store your toothbrush, and your meager supplies, recognizing that when you eventually get home, you will want to disinfect the container.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would make a difference, but I actually think it helps me not spend too much or too little time in a particular</li>
            <li>Not sure it&#x27;s worth the hassle to try to return the extra case.</li>

            <li> This model does include the quick &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; after every 30 seconds to make sure you get the recommended 2 minutes of brushing.  </li>
            <li> Accurate description.</li>
            <li> yet when I talked with this person, on an Internet-connected line, none of this information was available to this person.  </li>
            <li> So powerful, love how my teeth feel after using.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I don&#x27;t see much of a difference in the two brands  myself.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean and smooth after each brushing.</li>
            <li> Replacing an original Sonicare brush I bought in 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money, buy this!</li>
            <li> You get that dentist clean feeling every time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to keep this model clean, unlike my old Sonicare which had too many nooks and crannies that got all funky and gunky.</li>
            <li> and I still have a full battery</li>
            <li> I pair this with my prescription tooth paste and flossing daily, and my teeth are healthy and strong!</li>
            <li> I was one of the original folks who purchased this powerful electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Love my new one!</li>
            <li> After brushing it leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s still too intense you can easily opt for the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love it and I am a very sensitive tooth personðŸ˜¬</li>
            <li> The brush heads are super expensive to buy for the Sonicare, yet I have found them to be of good value and of a good size for my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I guess after 20 years I got my monies worth.</li>
            <li> I am finally able to use a Sonicare brush with a sensitive brush head and this system.</li>
            <li> In my opinion Philips really is not the same excellent company it was 20 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> liked that it was packaged with both the diamond and a regular head</li>
            <li> use it everydayï¼Œ worth</li>
            <li> in all, I am not unhappy with the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> and they are totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> The smaller brush head on this device makes it very easy to reach those hard-to-get spots.</li>
            <li> These brushes are just the best and my dentist never tells me I have any problems for the last few years.</li>
            <li> This simple charging stand is easy to wipe off and keep clean, and will be convenient to pack if I need to take it along on a trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> this was gift and she likes it very much</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding brush, and it came with an added whitening pen,  two different brushes, and travel case.</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare over the many years I have ben using them.  </li>
            <li> let me know it&#x27;s time to move areas in my mouth, and the whitening mode changes intensity at the end and adds two 15 second intervals to focus on your top and bottom front</li>
            <li> works really well!</li>
            <li> What I love about this item it has three levels to choose from and a timer that lets you know time to move to the next section which allows for thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> and you will see and feel the difference after the first use.  </li>
            <li> Phillips makes several more expensive systems, but for the money, this was the best buy for me.  </li>
            <li> Has Philips eliminated this design flaw in the Philips Sonacare Hx6731/34 Healthy White model?&lt;br</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> I cannot imagine how much better the other systems clean.  </li>
            <li> when you put tooth paste on int and in mouth i cant see the light what is it clean clean and white or sensitive and when you push buttun before you put in mouth then paste is spilling around.&lt;br /&gt;charger</li>
            <li> The new slim design is a nice look, and like all my earlier Sonicare&#x27;s, my teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just had them cleaned at the dentist after a brushing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another great thing about this toothbrush is the minimal, simple charging stand.</li>
            <li> The grip feels good, the brush is different from a traditional brush and the vibrating makes you pay attention to what you are doing while brushing your</li>
            <li> But if you shop around for other brands of &amp;#34;Sonic&amp;#34; toothbrushes with the same feature you will be able to find others that will work for you at a much better price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smaller charger unit lets the brush topple easily if nudged, but it seems to stay cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I also apparently got a special price on it... by shopping around on Amazon&#x27;s site.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> How could I be a healthy and happy senior if I am frustrated?  </li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t floss as much as I should, I KNOW</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> and yes, is really recommended by dentists!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> Everything works as advertised, and I really like the teeth whitening mode.</li>
            <li> They have clearly made vast improvements over the last 20 years and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Yet, my eyes will be ever searching with other companies to locate a better product.</li>
            <li> inside the box comes with a whitenig toothpaste and types of brushs and a electric charger and full toth brush and also a white case where you put your toothbrush whitenig and toothpaste</li>
            <li> Wow, this is my first ultrasonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The 30 second timers built in are really helpful to be sure you spend equal time on each tooth section.</li>
            <li> This brush has three speeds/intensities - normal, sensitive and &amp;#34;clean and white.&amp;#34; When you start using it, the brush gradually increases the intensity of the brushing for the first 10 brushes or so.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but both prior generations were plagued by fluid (from your mouth) that leaked while brushing through the brush head and collected in the well at the top of the handle where the brush head attached.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for years, one older one just gave up the ghost</li>
            <li> Even though mine has more features, you really only use the same normal setting pall the time.</li>
            <li> Mine came with a nice hard travel case that holds the handle and brush separately clipped in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> - Doesn&#x27;t improve oral hygiene enough to be worth the cost.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But Amazon shipped a new Toothbrush one day shipping.</li>
            <li> live and learn.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums and teeth and sensitive level is  gentle yet thoroughly cleans and whitens</li>
            <li> however when using this my gums and teeth became very sensitive.</li>
            <li> A replacement for a very old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> It has been five weeks since my latest dental cleaning, and there is very little, if any, staining.</li>
            <li> Takes a little to get used to, but it really leaves your mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I will say that, I bought the lower model for my wife and it works exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I love the slim handle (I have small hands) and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I wanted - later but pretty much the same as my 8-year old one.</li>
            <li> So far the toothbrush seems to be working the way it should.</li>
            <li> It was a mess and a pain to clean the old style head.</li>
            <li> While I like the toothbrush, I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars due to the fact that no where in the advertising does it state that the Special Packaging (which I bought) comes with a travel case.</li>
            <li> I did have a dental visit five months after getting the new toothbrush and got nothing but praise from my dental hygienist and the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading other reviews, I was a little concerned this new head would not be as fast and powerful with the Sonicare vibration.</li>
            <li> Even though I had to regularly clean out the gunk which collected in the base, I remained very pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> But after I started using this toothbrush 3 years ago, I noticed a huge difference after only a few months.</li>
            <li> This is the second Sonicare I&#x27;ve owned and I prefer this model so much over the last one.</li>
            <li> I did not understand why there were two packaging options to choose from at nearly the same price, so I studied the photo of the box front and saw that one did indeed come with extras, so I picked that</li>
            <li> After that, I compared it with my old one, and they felt the same to me.</li>
            <li> So, far it has been short of a miracle.</li>
            <li> in (the travel charger apparently fits inside and is removable).</li>
            <li> If you travel a lot, then, it is a good thing to have a container in which to store your toothbrush, and your meager supplies, recognizing that when you eventually get home, you will want to disinfect the container.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would make a difference, but I actually think it helps me not spend too much or too little time in a particular</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s worth the hassle to try to return the extra case.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Philips need to explain in table what is mean after dash /50 /40 or /30 etc and model number more clearly its confusing customer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> I have gotten in the habit of disassembling and rinsing out the well of the handle and the brush head after each use and leaving both components disassembled to dry before next use.</li>
            <li> It stays charges for a long time as well.</li>
            <li> had a Sonicare toothbrush a long time ago, one of their earliest models.</li>
            <li> but when I bought the brush it was priced similar to the next model down</li>
            <li> The less expensive brush ( with the Pro results brush heads that is) are just as effective for less money.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;About the only (really piddly) negative thing I would say is that given the &amp;#34;special packaging&amp;#34; it would have been nice to have the charging base that you can wrap the cord around/</li>
            <li> But it *is* nice to have a tiny travel-size base.</li>
            <li> I bought this through Megan&#x27;s Mailing Merchandise on October 2nd and it arrived in less than a week.</li>
            <li> , what about all the &amp;#34;so-called fabulous&amp;#34; settings, so you can change from soft to hard, to polishing, to whitening, etc?  </li>
            <li> yet, when this gets wet, it doesn&#x27;t stay affixed to the countertop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only gripe was that the whitening pen was missing from the box.</li>
            <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> - When comparing to other rotary/vibrating brushes, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> , I wouldn&#x27;t go with any other electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> (Not too big, not too small...</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a base which could be purchased (if it were available and it isn&#x27;t), you could slip the unit in, and the unit would not fall over and potentially break apart.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare doesn&#x27;t have any fancy features that the other brand didn&#x27;t have (and I paid about 30% less for the other brand)</li>
            <li> /&gt;What is so confusing to me is the simple fact</li>
            <li> Those complicated power toothbrush charger/stands with brush head holders, etc., collect gunk and need a lot of cleaning, without adding much utility.</li>
            <li> This one does not require anything other than rinsing the brush off after each use under tap water for a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when i push it little to teeth</li>
            <li> I was mindful that the brush was a little slower to start for a week or two.</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to get used to</li>
            <li> That Intellisonic had a HUGE charging base (with UV sanitizing gimmick)</li>
            <li> I was concerned that I would be annoyed that the unit wouldn&#x27;t remember my last cleaning setting, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me to triple press to get to the whitening mode.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wasted $12.95.</li>
            <li> I got rid of it for several reasons, including its horrible design (with the huge replacement head that went halfway down the handle and allowed icky gunk to collect inside the thing - yuck).</li>
            <li> It replaced an original base model Sonicare toothbrush with the screw on replacement brush heads, which I had used for a number of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The past few years, my teeth have been staining within 2-4 weeks after a dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> Having had a recent poor experience with an Intellisonic that I bought at my dentist - never liked it, and the battery croaked after 18 months -</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, since this info was not included in the item description, I wasted ten bucks by buying a travel case elsewhere on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> So I stuck with Sonicare based on past experience and reliability.</li>
            <li> /&gt;3 - Expensive compared to a $5 traditional brush.</li>
            <li> Since most of us are horrible at estimating time, the timer allows us to know when to stop brushing.</li>
            <li> It also came with a small tube of whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> like the small, unobtrusive charging</li>
            <li> That base comes complete with 2 prongs so you can store other toothbrush</li>
            <li> A few years ago, my mom&#x27;s friend and (very expensive) dentist recommended that we use Sonicare brushes instead of regular ones.</li>
            <li> When he was ready to order this base unit, he had to ask me again for all my info.  </li>
            <li> The value, on the other hand, is questionable.  </li>
            <li> He also said that that base which stores the cord is not available in any store; however, he finally ordered one for me.  </li>
            <li> That base comes complete with space within it to store the cord and keep the excess cord out of sight.  </li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> I will not be late!!!</li>
            <li> a well-rehearsed &amp;#34;I am so sorry you feel so frustrated...</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;  Did I feel frustrated?  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed to learn that today&#x27;s models of Oral B power brushes don&#x27;t have dual-voltage chargers, and that was the deal-breaker for</li>
            <li> You can not share the base of the brush with your partner by just switching the heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll figure out how to create a base for this piece of junque and continue to use it;  After all, I now have 2 1/2 years to &amp;#34;enjoy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have TERRIBLE teeth.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush. I researched a lot of them. This was a solid purchase. Battery life is great.</li>
            <li> this was gift and she likes it very much</li>
            <li> These brushes are just the best and my dentist never tells me I have any problems for the last few years. I don&#x27;t floss as much as I should, I KNOW sorry BUT NO PROBLEMS EVER! ha! Because of those brushes and u know what, this one is the best value one.</li>
            <li> Works wonders. I haven&#x27;t had any issues as of yet. My teeth are already whitening and the automatic timing helps me brush my teeth for the recommended time.</li>
            <li> Replacing an original Sonicare brush I bought in 90&#x27;s. I guess after 20 years I got my monies worth. So I stuck with Sonicare based on past experience and reliability. No disappointments here. This is an outstanding brush, and it came with an added whitening pen,  two different brushes, and travel case. They have clearly made vast improvements over the last 20 years and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Very happy.</li>
            <li> i been using Philips for about 3 months now and i never been so happy with my tooth. i gave it 5 stars because it does very good job, i will never go with different tooth brush. even dough i read other reviews where people say it will brake after a year, if this tooth brush leas for a year i will be happy with it, because dental cleaning cost more than 180$ in san francisco so this toothbrush worked for me perfectly and i will definitely recommend this to anyone than i know.</li>
            <li> its really awesome vibrating  high frequency clean really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but when you put tooth paste on int and in mouth i cant see the light what is it clean clean and white or sensitive and when you push buttun before you put in mouth then paste is spilling around.&lt;br /&gt;charger some really easy look fells cheap.&lt;br /&gt;and when i push it little to teeth i just feel tickled.&lt;br /&gt;Philips need to explain in table what is mean after dash /50 /40 or /30 etc and model number more clearly its confusing customer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but really good cleaning and sensitive nice i like it.</li>
            <li> Yeah this is the best one to buy, with the diamond head replacements. Five stars.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush isint a ordanary toothbrush its beyond that and dont think im exagarating its beutifully packaged and inside the box is like its your birthday surprise!!!! inside the box comes with a whitenig toothpaste and types of brushs and a electric charger and full toth brush and also a white case where you put your toothbrush whitenig and toothpaste you guys will love this set trust me once your done brushing you feel like you you just went to the dentist for free!!!</li>
            <li> A few years ago, my mom&#x27;s friend and (very expensive) dentist recommended that we use Sonicare brushes instead of regular ones. That day, she went out and bought 4 of them. A year later, only my wife is using it. That should be the end of the product review but I&#x27;ll go into a bit more detail:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - This brush will break after 1 year. Don&#x27;t expect to get much more life out of it (either the battery will die or the tip that vibrates will break inside. non-repairable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 - You can not share the base of the brush with your partner by just switching the heads. While it will work, it will break the brush within 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 - Expensive compared to a $5 traditional brush. The replacement heads are also expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 - Doesn&#x27;t improve oral hygiene enough to be worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - It has a two minute timer. Since most of us are horrible at estimating time, the timer allows us to know when to stop brushing. Brushing a full two minutes leads to better oral hygiene compared to brushing 30 seconds to 1 minute; so the brush does &amp;#34;work&amp;#34;. The cheaper alternative is to stick with a traditional brush and buy a 2 minute sand timer (or just use your smartphone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 - The grip feels good, the brush is different from a traditional brush and the vibrating makes you pay attention to what you are doing while brushing your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 - When comparing to other rotary/vibrating brushes, you get what you pay for. It is a good quality brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Skip it; just brush longer with your regular tooth brush. Add some dental floss and mouth wash to the mix and you won&#x27;t need this.</li>
            <li> Great product and value.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I wanted - later but pretty much the same as my 8-year old one. Accurate description.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for over 10 years.  Love my new one!</li>
            <li> I am finally able to use a Sonicare brush with a sensitive brush head and this system. It has a sensitive setting which for me works great.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare tooth brush. The best oral health care product I have owned.</li>
            <li> Great product. No problems</li>
            <li> ACCEPTABLE TRAVEL TOOTHBRUSH SET&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve remained an enthusiastic Philip Sonicare user for around 20 years.  I was one of the original folks who purchased this powerful electric toothbrush.  It kept my teeth clean, plaque removed, my dentist happy with my home care, and with my daily flossing, I was a happy camper.  Even though I had to regularly clean out the gunk which collected in the base, I remained very pleased with my purchase.  Finally, the battery gave up the ghost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of comments by folks concerning this toothbrush set who finally settled on it because it is cheaper than the others but supposedly has the same benefits besides multiple setting which do various things and yes, is really recommended by dentists!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I feel about this $108 + purchase?  If you travel a lot, then, it is a good thing to have a container in which to store your toothbrush, and your meager supplies, recognizing that when you eventually get home, you will want to disinfect the container.  But, if you are thinking this is a good unit to be available to you on your bathroom countertop, think again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a base which could be purchased (if it were available and it isn&#x27;t), you could slip the unit in, and the unit would not fall over and potentially break apart.  That base comes complete with space within it to store the cord and keep the excess cord out of sight.  That base comes complete with 2 prongs so you can store other toothbrush units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so, with the one which comes with the set.  There is no place for extra toothbrushes.  The unit itself is most unstable.  What I had to do was get some double-sided packaging tape so I could affix the unit to my countertop; yet, when this gets wet, it doesn&#x27;t stay affixed to the countertop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, what about all the &amp;#34;so-called fabulous&amp;#34; settings, so you can change from soft to hard, to polishing, to whitening, etc?  Is there a separate button to push to turnon the unit?  No.  What I found I have to do, is load the brush up with toothpaste, put it in my mouth, be sure I have my bifocals on so I can see the lights in the mirror in front of me, while my brush is in my mouth, push the singular button time and again until it finally settles on whichever button I decide to use, and then commence to brush my teeth.  What fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about the instructions?  They are totally inadequate.  They don&#x27;t even explain the functions of the 2 brushes which come with the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even called their 800 number to talk with a rep, so maybe this person could help me understand this unit.  He had a well-rehearsed &amp;#34;I am so sorry you feel so frustrated...&amp;#34;  Did I feel frustrated?  That is not part of my nature.  How could I be a healthy and happy senior if I am frustrated?  He also said that that base which stores the cord is not available in any store; however, he finally ordered one for me.  Do I expect to receive it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is so confusing to me is the simple fact I contacted the company to register this product, providing them my name, my address, my email address, my telephone # etc., yet when I talked with this person, on an Internet-connected line, none of this information was available to this person.  When he was ready to order this base unit, he had to ask me again for all my info.  In my opinion Philips really is not the same excellent company it was 20 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I happy with this purchase?  No.  Will I return it?  No.  I&#x27;ll figure out how to create a base for this piece of junque and continue to use it;  After all, I now have 2 1/2 years to &amp;#34;enjoy&amp;#34; this unit.  Yet, my eyes will be ever searching with other companies to locate a better product.</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare over the many years I have ben using them.  Always great!</li>
            <li> The unit is nice but very strong even in the sensitive mode. I am fortunate with excellent teeth and no cavities but never had a problem with sensitivity however when using this my gums and teeth became very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Great, great, great, gruh great!  I will not be late!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the HealthyWhite from Sonicare for seven months. It replaced an original base model Sonicare toothbrush with the screw on replacement brush heads, which I had used for a number of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller charger unit lets the brush topple easily if nudged, but it seems to stay cleaner.  Everything else is an improvement over the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it does not collect water inside the brush head. It was a mess and a pain to clean the old style head. This one does not require anything other than rinsing the brush off after each use under tap water for a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is lighter, which makes it travel better. Mine came with a nice hard travel case that holds the handle and brush separately clipped in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the pace beep every 30 seconds is actually helpful. I didn&#x27;t think it would make a difference, but I actually think it helps me not spend too much or too little time in a particular area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked that it was packaged with both the diamond and a regular head so I could try each. It also came with a small tube of whitening toothpaste. I did not understand why there were two packaging options to choose from at nearly the same price, so I studied the photo of the box front and saw that one did indeed come with extras, so I picked that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether my teeth are whiter now I cannot say because if they are, it&#x27;s been over time. I did have a dental visit five months after getting the new toothbrush and got nothing but praise from my dental hygienist and the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading other reviews, I was a little concerned this new head would not be as fast and powerful with the Sonicare vibration. I was mindful that the brush was a little slower to start for a week or two. After that, I compared it with my old one, and they felt the same to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything everyone has said about it.....great!!</li>
            <li> 90 days in with this product and I have no complaints. I was concerned that I would be annoyed that the unit wouldn&#x27;t remember my last cleaning setting, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me to triple press to get to the whitening mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brief pauses each 30 seconds let me know it&#x27;s time to move areas in my mouth, and the whitening mode changes intensity at the end and adds two 15 second intervals to focus on your top and bottom front teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the small, unobtrusive charging stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it was a good bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> This is the second Sonicare I&#x27;ve owned and I prefer this model so much over the last one. I&#x27;ve had it 4 months now and it just keeps getting better. My teeth feel so clean and smooth after each brushing. My dentist complimented my healthy gums and teeth. It&#x27;s easy to keep this model clean, unlike my old Sonicare which had too many nooks and crannies that got all funky and gunky.</li>
            <li> So powerful, love how my teeth feel after using.</li>
            <li> So, far it has been short of a miracle. The past few years, my teeth have been staining within 2-4 weeks after a dental cleaning. It has been five weeks since my latest dental cleaning, and there is very little, if any, staining.</li>
            <li> works really well! I couldn&#x27;t be happier .</li>
            <li> Love it and I am a very sensitive tooth personðŸ˜¬</li>
            <li> Best purchase I could have made.  It cleans and whitens at the same time.  What I love about this item it has three levels to choose from and a timer that lets you know time to move to the next section which allows for thorough cleaning. I have sensitive gums and teeth and sensitive level is  gentle yet thoroughly cleans and whitens and you will see and feel the difference after the first use.  Phillips makes several more expensive systems, but for the money, this was the best buy for me.  I cannot imagine how much better the other systems clean.  Try it, the system will make a difference in your dental checkups.</li>
            <li> I bought this through Megan&#x27;s Mailing Merchandise on October 2nd and it arrived in less than a week. I also apparently got a special price on it... by shopping around on Amazon&#x27;s site.&lt;br /&gt;I love Philips Sonicare toothbrushes. My last one lasted over 6 years! Having had a recent poor experience with an Intellisonic that I bought at my dentist - never liked it, and the battery croaked after 18 months - I decided to go back to a Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m very happy. This brush has three speeds/intensities - normal, sensitive and &amp;#34;clean and white.&amp;#34; When you start using it, the brush gradually increases the intensity of the brushing for the first 10 brushes or so. This is really good if you&#x27;re not used to a brush with 31,000 brush strokes per minute. If it&#x27;s still too intense you can easily opt for the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; setting.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the &amp;#34;diamond&amp;#34; bristle brush or the whitening pen yet. They&#x27;re kind of a gimmick but when I bought the brush it was priced similar to the next model down, so I thought I&#x27;d go for it.&lt;br /&gt;About the only (really piddly) negative thing I would say is that given the &amp;#34;special packaging&amp;#34; it would have been nice to have the charging base that you can wrap the cord around/in (the travel charger apparently fits inside and is removable). But it *is* nice to have a tiny travel-size base. That Intellisonic had a HUGE charging base (with UV sanitizing gimmick) so I couldn&#x27;t charge it when I traveled. This brush also has a three- WEEK charge on the battery!</li>
            <li> Nice toothbrush.  The only concern is that it should be easier to pause/resume mid-cycle</li>
            <li> I love the travel case, I can fit a travel toothpaste inside and throw it in my gym bag. It stays charges for a long time as well. I&#x27;ve only had to charge it once.</li>
            <li> Love the Philip Sonicare. After brushing it leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh. Also, when placed on the clean/white mode (which I use always) your teeth do appear to begin whitening. I just love it. The Philip Sonicare was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> The smaller brush head on this device makes it very easy to reach those hard-to-get spots. Very effective cleaning.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It takes a little while to get used to but after you do it&#x27;s amazing. Your teeth will feel amazing it&#x27;s worth the money, buy this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 prior generations of Philips Sonicare and still use the last one I purchased. I like the product, but both prior generations were plagued by fluid (from your mouth) that leaked while brushing through the brush head and collected in the well at the top of the handle where the brush head attached. This has been well-publicized online. I have gotten in the habit of disassembling and rinsing out the well of the handle and the brush head after each use and leaving both components disassembled to dry before next use. Has Philips eliminated this design flaw in the Philips Sonacare Hx6731/34 Healthy White model?&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for what I need.</li>
            <li> I have TERRIBLE teeth. Before using this tooth brush, I had sooo many cavities every time I went into the dentist. I was fighting a losing battle. But after I started using this toothbrush 3 years ago, I noticed a huge difference after only a few months. Since using this toothbrush, I have only had to get restorative work done on my teeth. I pair this with my prescription tooth paste and flossing daily, and my teeth are healthy and strong!</li>
            <li> This purchase was a replacement for another Sonicare Brush that I purchased 7 years ago. It was the same model, even though the model numbers change. I figure 7 years is plenty to ask for on something you use twice a day. It works great, I wouldn&#x27;t go with any other electric toothbrush. Until something better comes out Sonicare is probably the best. I will say that, I bought the lower model for my wife and it works exactly the same. Even though mine has more features, you really only use the same normal setting pall the time. The less expensive brush ( with the Pro results brush heads that is) are just as effective for less money.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is my first ultrasonic toothbrush. Takes a little to get used to, but it really leaves your mouth feeling clean. The 30 second timers built in are really helpful to be sure you spend equal time on each tooth section. My only gripe was that the whitening pen was missing from the box. But Amazon shipped a new Toothbrush one day shipping. Great customer service.</li>
            <li> While I like the toothbrush, I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars due to the fact that no where in the advertising does it state that the Special Packaging (which I bought) comes with a travel case. Maybe I missed it when I was trying to figure out which Sonicare product to buy. I ended up ordering a separate travel case. Imagine my surprise when I opened the Sonicare box (Product HX6731/34) and there&#x27;s a travel case included with all the extras. I&#x27;ve wasted $12.95. Not sure it&#x27;s worth the hassle to try to return the extra case. Oh well . . . live and learn. So far the toothbrush seems to be working the way it should. I&#x27;ll update this review when I see my dentists in 5 months.</li>
            <li> Always my favorite brand for tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrush ... this is my second time buying a Sonicare ... love how clean my teeth feel after just a couple uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I purchased the &amp;#34;Special Bonus Pack&amp;#34; which INCLUDES the white plastic &amp;#34;Travel Case&amp;#34;.  Unfortunately, since this info was not included in the item description, I wasted ten bucks by buying a travel case elsewhere on Amazon.  Perhaps the seller could add this to the description to prevent this from happening to someone else.</li>
            <li> This works great.  Now my wife&#x27;s breath ain&#x27;t stanky.</li>
            <li> Have been using Sonicare tooth brushes for 20 years. Always a reliable product.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, well worth the price. Can already see a difference in just two weeks.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for years, one older one just gave up the ghost so we got these. Again, Sonicare knocked it out of the park with these. Everything works as advertised, and I really like the teeth whitening mode. The new slim design is a nice look, and like all my earlier Sonicare&#x27;s, my teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just had them cleaned at the dentist after a brushing.</li>
            <li> I have used Phillips Sonicare products for years and this latest toothbrush proves once again that Phillips is at the top of the class.  I love the slim handle (I have small hands) and the brushes are rugged yet do not hurt my gums.  I love the extras that came with this product: 2 cleaning brushes, battery pack, travel case, small toothpaste tube and small whitener pen.  Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> A replacement for a very old Sonicare.  These things are like gold. Once you use one you&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
            <li> use it everydayï¼Œ worth</li>
            <li> I would buy this again and again.  Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but totally worth it.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for about a week now, and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Sonicare toothbrush a long time ago, one of their earliest models. I got rid of it for several reasons, including its horrible design (with the huge replacement head that went halfway down the handle and allowed icky gunk to collect inside the thing - yuck). On my dentist&#x27;s recommendation I replaced the Sonicare with a good Oral B pro power toothbrush. I really liked it, and it traveled with me - its dual voltage charger was so handy. Recently, after ten years of service, it quit charging. I was disappointed to learn that today&#x27;s models of Oral B power brushes don&#x27;t have dual-voltage chargers, and that was the deal-breaker for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I learned that Sonicare has sleek toothbrushes, like this one, with reasonably-sized replacement heads and dual-voltage chargers? It was a no-brainer: I ordered this one. I like the three brushing modes, I&#x27;m again getting used to Sonicare&#x27;s 30-second interval pauses, and my teeth feel nice and clean after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing about this toothbrush is the minimal, simple charging stand. Those complicated power toothbrush charger/stands with brush head holders, etc., collect gunk and need a lot of cleaning, without adding much utility. This simple charging stand is easy to wipe off and keep clean, and will be convenient to pack if I need to take it along on a trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well played, Sonicare. This one&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> I replaced another brand of &amp;#34;Sonic&amp;#34; toothbrush with this Sonicare.  To be honest, I don&#x27;t see much of a difference in the two brands  myself.  They both work just fine.  The Sonicare doesn&#x27;t have any fancy features that the other brand didn&#x27;t have (and I paid about 30% less for the other brand) thus I am assuming that when you buy a Sonicare you are also paying a premium for the name.  The brush heads are super expensive to buy for the Sonicare, yet I have found them to be of good value and of a good size for my mouth.  (Not too big, not too small...somewhere in between a child&#x27;s size and those giant ones you see).  This model does include the quick &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; after every 30 seconds to make sure you get the recommended 2 minutes of brushing.  The charge lasts forever it seems (One month and I still have a full battery indicator)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am not unhappy with the Sonicare.  The value, on the other hand, is questionable.  If you can find this model deeply discounted then, by all means, buy it.  But if you shop around for other brands of &amp;#34;Sonic&amp;#34; toothbrushes with the same feature you will be able to find others that will work for you at a much better price.</li>
            <li> Great product, love the fact that it vibrates when you have to move to the next area of your mouth.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend as a gift because he had a crappy mechanical toothbrush from the drug store. He absolutely loves it! It is a must have. I have a different Sonicare that I&#x27;ve been using for three years now and they are totally worth the price. You get that dentist clean feeling every time.</li>
