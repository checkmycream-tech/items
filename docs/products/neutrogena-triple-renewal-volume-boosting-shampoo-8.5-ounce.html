    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I also have used Neutrogena anti-residue formula for years and think it is excellent.</li>
            <li>and this is the best shampoo for my course</li>
            <li>, I think it is very good.</li>
            <li>It smells great, feels great, and leaves my hair looking and feeling the way I want it to be.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, this is a very nice shampoo.</li>
            <li>Since the drug stores no longer carry this shampoo, I was thrilled to find it on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>I was very happy to be able to find it.</li>
            <li>Great lather, concentrated, good smell.  </li>
            <li>I can see the change in fullness and shine; her hair feels and smells good.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is a good buy and is a good quality shampoo.</li>
            <li>I do not know why they dropped their CLEAN line which was an excellent shampoo line.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product and it does give my fine hair more volume.  </li>
            <li>I love being a blond!</li>
            <li>Nice shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Great product and shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>The tube is nice, easy to pack but a bit difficuly to dispense.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is the best I have ever found for volume and lasting control.</li>
            <li>Love all Neutrogena products</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair glossy and healthy.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love what it does for my hair.</li>
            <li>Well...finally one shampoo that works for fine.</li>
            <li>Can anyone explain the huge price increase?   </li>
            <li>The only things I like are the price and packaging; it is great for traveling.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended this product for my very fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>Like other Neutrogena products, this shampoo does a good job in making thinning hair look</li>
            <li>I have found no other shampoo which works better.  </li>
            <li>My wife and my niece both love this product and I will definitely be reordering it.</li>
            <li>My hair looked consistently better with this product (unlike the countless others I had tried).</li>
            <li>I found that it cleaned my hair very well</li>
            <li>Since this shampoo is gentle on my hair</li>
            <li>so so much.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair dry and frizzy, it can&#x27;t beat Neutrogena&#x27;s Clean Volume (why did they take it off the market!?)</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t leave my hair nearly as shiny and clean looking as the Neutrogena Clean (pink) which I used to use.  </li>
            <li>I normally use Tresemme, practically the cheapest thing out there, and was told by my stylist that I have the healthiest hair she has ever seen.</li>
            <li>I also like Deep Clean facial cleanser -normal to oily.</li>
            <li>packaging is good too since it fits easily into small recesses in a suitcase when traveling and sits upside down on the tub edge to ensure that you get an immediate delivery of shampoo rather than squeezing and pressing to force it down to the end of the tube.</li>
            <li>It also does not really lather and I feel like I have to use more than usual.</li>
            <li>(I shampoo daily) and my hair continued to remain shiny and soft throughout</li>
            <li>Just a bit of a hitch - I bought 2 packs with 3 bottles and one was delivered with 2, apparently it had been violated.</li>
            <li>I only switched because for some reason I though my hair could only get healthier if I spent a little more money.</li>
            <li>That may sound trivial, but you&#x27;d be surprised at how frustrating that can be when you are trying to wash your hair and juggle an uncooperative tube!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not dry my hair and does add volume, as advertised.</li>
            <li>grey naturally curly hair.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product and shipped very fast. My wife and my niece both love this product and I will definitely be reordering it.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product for my very fine, straight hair. I use both the shampoo and conditioner. I found that it cleaned my hair very well (I shampoo daily) and my hair continued to remain shiny and soft throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is good too since it fits easily into small recesses in a suitcase when traveling and sits upside down on the tub edge to ensure that you get an immediate delivery of shampoo rather than squeezing and pressing to force it down to the end of the tube. That may sound trivial, but you&#x27;d be surprised at how frustrating that can be when you are trying to wash your hair and juggle an uncooperative tube!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this is a very nice shampoo. It smells great, feels great, and leaves my hair looking and feeling the way I want it to be.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and it does give my fine hair more volume.  I have found no other shampoo which works better.  Since the drug stores no longer carry this shampoo, I was thrilled to find it on Amazon!  Actually relieved to find it!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this.. volume isn&#x27;t my hair issue anymore.  My wife does though, she likes it - we are on bulk order number 3 or 4 - and I like it too.  I can see the change in fullness and shine; her hair feels and smells good.</li>
            <li> I switched to this shampoo after reading reviews and comparing prices across Amazon. I normally use Tresemme, practically the cheapest thing out there, and was told by my stylist that I have the healthiest hair she has ever seen. I only switched because for some reason I though my hair could only get healthier if I spent a little more money. I have long reddish-blonde-brown, pin strait hair, and this shampoo leaves my hair greasy.  My hair looked so bad that my friends and boyfriend thought I had stopped showering! It also does not really lather and I feel like I have to use more than usual. The only things I like are the price and packaging; it is great for traveling. I will never use it again, hopefully I can find a friend who likes it.</li>
            <li> Well...finally one shampoo that works for fine. Bodiless hair!  I have a closet shelf of products that don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I had tried it before  I ordered  it, I think it is very good.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair dry and frizzy, it can&#x27;t beat Neutrogena&#x27;s Clean Volume (why did they take it off the market!?)</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best I have ever found for volume and lasting control. I also have used Neutrogena anti-residue formula for years and think it is excellent. Triple renewal leaves hair soft but revived and not weighed down. It is extremely difficult to find in stores -so I thought it was no longer prduced. I was very happy to be able to find it. Iam 66 and this is the best shampoo for my course grey naturally curly hair. I also like Deep Clean facial cleanser -normal to oily. Thankyou for the opportunity to express opinions. The tube is nice, easy to pack but a bit difficuly to dispense. But regardless keep producing these products!</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo.  Great lather, concentrated, good smell.  Love all Neutrogena products</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t leave my hair nearly as shiny and clean looking as the Neutrogena Clean (pink) which I used to use.  I&#x27;m so disappointed that shampoo is no longer available.</li>
            <li> This is my holy grail! I changed it with high-end products and came back to this several times. It leaves my hair glossy and healthy. It might not work this well for oily hair though. I have dry frizzy hair and somewhat oily scalp and it gets oily on the second day. Since this shampoo is gentle on my hair I love it so so much.</li>
            <li> Like other Neutrogena products, this shampoo does a good job in making thinning hair look fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plan to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Just a bit of a hitch - I bought 2 packs with 3 bottles and one was delivered with 2, apparently it had been violated.</li>
            <li> I bought a 3-pack of this shampoo for 17.99 in November of 2015. Can anyone explain the huge price increase?   3.5 years ago, I must have had a bad foil. Hair was falling out. Husband got me &#x27;Ovation&#x27; products to restore. You have to be patient because it purports to make your hair grow out thicker which can take a long time to notice (6-9 months?). Meanwhile, I found the Neutrogena Shampoo. My hair looked consistently better with this product (unlike the countless others I had tried). It is definitely thicker. In fact, I can have my hair foiled again! I love being a blond!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a good buy and is a good quality shampoo. It does not dry my hair and does add volume, as advertised.</li>
            <li> Did not live up to Neutrogena standards. Just a shampoo like any other. I do not know why they dropped their CLEAN line which was an excellent shampoo line.</li>
            <li> Hair feels revitalized after using this shampoo.  Love what it does for my hair.</li>
