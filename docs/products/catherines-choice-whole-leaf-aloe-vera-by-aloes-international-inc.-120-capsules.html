    <ol>
            <li> I took this supplement for 30 days, 2 a day.  It has caused my skin on my hands and forearms to become very susceptible to being injured and bleed.  Never had this before taking this supplement.  I did not have any other effects positive or negative.  but since I was past the 30 days, could not return and could not contact seller about this order.  So Do NOT buy it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it works very well on arthritis. Within a couple of months, the pain in my elbow had disappeared. I&#x27;m hoping this will work again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just starting to use it so have no comments yet.</li>
            <li> Received promptly and at an excellent price!</li>
            <li> I am taking the aloe vera capsules daily, so hope they will help in the long run.</li>
            <li> This really is the best aloe vera cap out there.  Have tried others, but always come back to Catherine&#x27;s Choice.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Wife thinks this is great stuff. While having gotten her liquid gel before; she says Catherine&#x27;s Choice Whole Leaf seems to do much better. It was promptly shipped and well packaged.</li>
            <li> We bought the product two years ago for alleviating an arthritic condition, but continue to use it for preventing migraines.</li>
            <li> I have used Catherine&#x27;s Choice for several years and for the first few years it was wonderful. but the last few months it has not been nearly as effective plus the price has almost doubled.  Please go back to the old formula.  This one even smells different when I open the bottle.  If something doesn&#x27;t change, I will be forced to find another product to alleviate my arthritis pain.</li>
            <li> Took away stomach pain caused by strong medications.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any relief from the arthritice.  However I will continue to use the rest  of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Does not do any thing for my husband&#x27;s arthritis, may work for some but not all.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and am pleased with it.  I like the company that manufactures it - their principles - as well as their products.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product for healing, she feels it really works she has been using this product for about 2 years</li>
            <li> Used the entire bottle and noticed no difference, positive or negative.  Was like taking a sugar pill. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my mother, who suffers from back pain.  Not only did she have no relief in pain, but experienced horrible side effects:  she had an upset stomach and severe nausea.  Plus, they have refused to give a refund!</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied with the results I have had in the short time I have been taking the product. I am almost out and I am ready to order again. My hands and knuckles are not near as painful to use as before taking the Aloe Vera.</li>
            <li> The taste was terrible..just did not like them..wish I never purchased them..</li>
            <li> I found no difference in my back pain. I am on an antiflamatory as well as tramadol while I was taking these pills.</li>
            <li> This product really works for me. It&#x27;s better than popular pain medicines. I was injured in a car accident seven years ago which resulted in a back and neck injury in addition to carpal tunnel syndrome. Nothing else worked for me except Aloe Vera. If I didn&#x27;t use aloe vera I would still be in pain. I definitely recommend this product for anyone who has chronic pain.</li>
