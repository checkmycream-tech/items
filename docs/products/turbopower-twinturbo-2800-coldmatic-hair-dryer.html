            <li>This blowdryer is amazing.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>You know how it goes - you get your hair done at the salon, and it looks amazing, and then you can&#x27;t duplicate it at home.</li>
            <li>Great dryer, so powerful!</li>
            <li>I am a hairstylist and this is by far the best dryer I have used.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I like it soooooooo much better than mine from the drugstore.</li>
            <li>I use it with a tourmaline and ceramic hairbrush and am pleased with the shine I get.</li>
            <li>and I would swear I am getting more body with it.</li>
            <li>Better than others she has tried.</li>
            <li>I bought it from my stylist and my stylist is the 2007 Aveda top stylist of the year</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t have that problem again.</li>
            <li>Great quality and the distributor is very responsive.</li>
            <li>Super satisfied with the product!</li>
            <li>its a very good product, I love hair, I use hairdryers very often for styling, its strong, has good heat temperature, very professional, I would definatly say go for it.</li>
            <li>and it was great, but I had an electrical problem-it sort of blew up near where the cord meets the dryer.</li>
            <li>so it dries your hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have used them all from the $19.99 special to the $200.00 top of the line salon grade.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased and recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>It dries her hear nice and fast.</li>
            <li>Dryer is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Your hair ends up really smooth, like you came from the hair dresser.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended this hairdryer to me, and it&#x27;s indeed very powerful.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I ordered a replacement dryer, thinking the original was defective.  </li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>i thought, &#x27;it&#x27;s just hot air, how could a $100 blow dryer be better than a $10 one?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The only good thing going for this dryer is the wind power.  </li>
            <li>I really love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s powerful and easy, even fun, to use.  </li>
            <li>It drys my hair really quickly</li>
            <li>It shortened my drying time by 10 minutes and my hair looks great with less damage.  </li>
            <li>This one is just one notch higher!  </li>
            <li>it just blows really powerfully</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the power of the motor, or somehow the air is more concentrated, but damn if my hair doesn&#x27;t look more amazing, and actually feels less damaged than using my $10 blow dryer!</li>
            <li>That said, it does a great job of drying my thick hair quickly.</li>
            <li>The dryer&#x27;s so great, that this is just a small annoyance --</li>
            <li>It is so powerful that I got a tangle in my hair the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>It has a long cord and is nicely balanced and lightweight.</li>
            <li>It is really nice to have 2 fan speeds and 3 temperatures; you can use the low or medium heat with the high speed fan and not fry your head.</li>
            <li>I have hair with a mind of its own -- not straight, not curly --</li>
            <li>Great for thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>At first i was kinda skeptical but to my belief it&#x27;s the best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever had...</li>
            <li>This dryer actually makes my fine, medium length hair look like it has some body while making it super smooth at the same time.  </li>
            <li>The 9&#x27; cord is fabulous, it&#x27;s quiet, lightweight, and comes with two nozzles.  </li>
            <li>My cheap $40 Tourmaline Conair hair dryer finally conked out of me a couple of weeks ago</li>
            <li>I like it as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>so you really get a lot of air.</li>
            <li>Very reliable and fast, just as the professionals use in saloons.</li>
            <li>Very powerfull and balanced.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t damage your hair as much, because it&#x27;s a professional-quality dryer.</li>
            <li>To end on a positive note, the dryer is black, compact and great for traveling if you&#x27;re like me and need a powerful dryer to keep your hair on the straight and narrow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same as getting a $20-$30/piece of garbage from the drugstore and having to replace every year only this one works so much faster and better.</li>
            <li>I am also saving about 15 minutes per blow dry session now, which is huge for me.</li>
            <li>and she highly recommended hers.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I had read about this blow dryer in a well respected magazine and it was given high marks</li>
            <li>i HIGHLY recommend..</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this dryer after it was recommended to me by friends and even my hair dresser.</li>
            <li>looks like it was designed by a junior high student with Microsoft Paint.</li>
            <li>It gives that nice silly effect to my hair and dries super fast.</li>
            <li>This is a real professional dryer.</li>
            <li>Or you can use hot heat and low or high fan speed, if that&#x27;s what you want - a lot of flexibility depending on your hair and needs.</li>
            <li>First of all, it won&#x27;t damage your hair, the hair dryer is light and silent compare to the ones I have bought at other retailer stores.</li>
            <li>I went to the salon to buy it and nearly fell over.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m actually surprised</li>
            <li>Professional grade, I&#x27;ve seen this model in the salons used by the stylist - which is why I sought it out.  </li>
            <li>I am 45 years old, and up until I got this blow dryer</li>
            <li>My mother is a professional hair dresser and uses this hair drier.</li>
            <li>It lived up to the reviews from other owners and it definitely is a high end product for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>And that can also be a negative since my hair ends up more tangled after drying it than when it was wet.  </li>
            <li>This thing heats up quick, blows hard, and it seems to take some of the frizz out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I never had such a problem with other hair dryers I used with the same electrical outlet, so I assume this is a defect with this particular model.</li>

            <li> I know that sounds strange, but that meant I could buy the TwinTurbo 2800 hairdryer that my hairdresser sold at my salon.  </li>
            <li> wish I would have bought the TwinTurbo 2800 dryer a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first expensive model</li>
            <li> I have to be careful where I place my glasses, I&#x27;ve blown them off the sink counter a couple times!</li>
            <li> It did switch to cold almost immediately and it was powerful.</li>
            <li> I wrote down the name and model of the dryer and went on a quest to find it cheaper.  </li>
            <li> and it tames my mane with much less effort than it took with a drugstore hairdryer.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the dryer for a little over a week now</li>
            <li> Not a let down one bit!</li>
            <li> Drys super-fast, not too heavy and doesn&#x27;t seem to damage hair in any way.  </li>
            <li> The concentrators are very narrow</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist and this is my go to blow dryer every day behind the chair.</li>
            <li> This dryer is a game changer.  </li>
            <li> The controls are clunky and awkwardly placed - they dig into your hand and it is difficult to control with one hand.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s heavy, and the controls are in a terrible place.  </li>
            <li> One thing that&#x27;s been driving me crazy, however, is the  nozzle on the front pops off almost every time I use it -- and</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this hair dryer.  </li>

            <li> This blowdryer is amazing. I am a hairstylist and this is by far the best dryer I have used. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this hair dryer.  It has no heat, it&#x27;s heavy, and the controls are in a terrible place.  The controls dig into my hand.  The only good thing going for this dryer is the wind power.  And that can also be a negative since my hair ends up more tangled after drying it than when it was wet.  I&#x27;m definitely returning this dryer.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended that I purchase this dryer. It&#x27;s my first expensive model and it&#x27;s powerful and easy, even fun, to use.  It shortened my drying time by 10 minutes and my hair looks great with less damage.  The 9&#x27; cord is fabulous, it&#x27;s quiet, lightweight, and comes with two nozzles.  I won&#x27;t go back to a drugstore dryer anytime soon.</li>
            <li> This brand was recommended by my hair stylist and based on the reviews, I thought it would be great.  However, when I plugged it in and turned it on and off, I could see electric sparks by the buttons.  I ordered a replacement dryer, thinking the original was defective.  However, the replacement dryer had the same problem.  I never had such a problem with other hair dryers I used with the same electrical outlet, so I assume this is a defect with this particular model.</li>
            <li> My cheap $40 Tourmaline Conair hair dryer finally conked out of me a couple of weeks ago and I was happy about it!  I know that sounds strange, but that meant I could buy the TwinTurbo 2800 hairdryer that my hairdresser sold at my salon.  I went to the salon to buy it and nearly fell over.  They wanted $180 for it!  I wrote down the name and model of the dryer and went on a quest to find it cheaper.  Amazon was one of my stops and I found it here for $85.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the dryer for a little over a week now and I&#x27;m actually surprised I like it as much as I do.  I always thought a hair dryer was a just a hair dryer. This dryer actually makes my fine, medium length hair look like it has some body while making it super smooth at the same time.  The blowouts I do on my hair look as good as when I&#x27;m walking out of the salon after getting my hair done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have bought the TwinTurbo 2800 dryer a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/20/13:  This dryer is still going strong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/30/16:  Still works!!!</li>
            <li> This item is just great I love it</li>
            <li> My Twinturbo 2600 gave out on me finally after about 10 years!  Best hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever owned!  This one is just one notch higher!  Drys super-fast, not too heavy and doesn&#x27;t seem to damage hair in any way.  Love it!</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this hairdryer to me, and it&#x27;s indeed very powerful. I have hair with a mind of its own -- not straight, not curly -- just frizzy! and it tames my mane with much less effort than it took with a drugstore hairdryer.     One thing that&#x27;s been driving me crazy, however, is the  nozzle on the front pops off almost every time I use it -- and the plastic over the filter in the back has done the same. The dryer&#x27;s so great, that this is just a small annoyance -- but then again, invest in a $$ hairdryer, I don&#x27;t want to be hunting around for ill-fitting parts while I gotta get my hair done in time for work.    To end on a positive note, the dryer is black, compact and great for traveling if you&#x27;re like me and need a powerful dryer to keep your hair on the straight and narrow.</li>
            <li> love the settings and has great power. lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I decided to get the same blow dryer my stylist uses and she highly recommended hers. This is a real professional dryer. It is really nice to have 2 fan speeds and 3 temperatures; you can use the low or medium heat with the high speed fan and not fry your head. Or you can use hot heat and low or high fan speed, if that&#x27;s what you want - a lot of flexibility depending on your hair and needs. The concentrators are very narrow so you really get a lot of air. It has a long cord and is nicely balanced and lightweight. I like it soooooooo much better than mine from the drugstore. I use it with a tourmaline and ceramic hairbrush and am pleased with the shine I get. It drys my hair really quickly and I would swear I am getting more body with it. I did see the same one at the local beauty supply but their return policy was not cash back, but store credit, so I went with Amazon, same price. Very pleased and recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> Greatest blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever bought and I&#x27;ve been through a lot! Professional grade, I&#x27;ve seen this model in the salons used by the stylist - which is why I sought it out.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I had read about this blow dryer in a well respected magazine and it was given high marks so when I found it on Amazon at the wonderful price it was - I snatched one up. I was not disappointed. It lived up to the reviews from other owners and it definitely is a high end product for a very reasonable price. I would buy again and if you are looking for a blow dryer that gets the job done as if you were at a salon - this is a good purchase for you.</li>
            <li> Very reliable and fast, just as the professionals use in saloons.</li>
            <li> Favorite all time hair dryer !!! Great for thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> So far so good. My wife loves this hair dryer. It dries her hear nice and fast. Better than others she has tried.</li>
            <li> This is a awesome product it&#x27;s a must buy! i HIGHLY recommend.. At first i was kinda skeptical but to my belief it&#x27;s the best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever had... And i&#x27;ve been wanting this dryer ever since i&#x27;ve been going to the dominican&#x27;s to get my hair done.... Not a let down one bit!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my purchase. First of all, it won&#x27;t damage your hair, the hair dryer is light and silent compare to the ones I have bought at other retailer stores. Moreover, I can style my hair just like my hair stylist. No remorse at all!</li>
            <li> I have used them all from the $19.99 special to the $200.00 top of the line salon grade.  This thing heats up quick, blows hard, and it seems to take some of the frizz out of my hair.  I am also saving about 15 minutes per blow dry session now, which is huge for me.</li>
            <li> I am a hairdresser and this is what I use in the salon its a great dryer! would recommend it to anybody!</li>
            <li> Dryer is fantastic. Cord is really, really long for use in professional salons, and had I known HOW long, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought the dryer. That said, it does a great job of drying my thick hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer !  Works perfectly every time! Very powerfull and balanced. It feels good in my hand.  I am a hairstylist and this is my go to blow dryer every day behind the chair.</li>
            <li> Excellent, powerful dryer. Salon quality.</li>
            <li> The best blow dryer I have ever used. It gives that nice silly effect to my hair and dries super fast.</li>
            <li> I have this dryer and have had it for a couple of years now. It is amazing. I bought it from my stylist and my stylist is the 2007 Aveda top stylist of the year and this is the dryer he uses.</li>
            <li> its a very good product, I love hair, I use hairdryers very often for styling, its strong, has good heat temperature, very professional, I would definatly say go for it.</li>
            <li> Great dryer, so powerful! I have to be careful where I place my glasses, I&#x27;ve blown them off the sink counter a couple times!</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this dryer after it was recommended to me by friends and even my hair dresser. But, it is heavier than it should be. The controls are clunky and awkwardly placed - they dig into your hand and it is difficult to control with one hand. When I turned the dryer off and on I could actually see a spark next to the controls. It did switch to cold almost immediately and it was powerful. I actually wondered if this is a genuine product because of the seemingly poor quality and the box looks like it was designed by a junior high student with Microsoft Paint.</li>
            <li> Best on the market. Straightens hair flawlessly.</li>
            <li> I had one before for like 3 years and it was great, but I had an electrical problem-it sort of blew up near where the cord meets the dryer. But this one I got here is even better!  It has a sturdier cord so I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t have that problem again. It&#x27;s the same as getting a $20-$30/piece of garbage from the drugstore and having to replace every year only this one works so much faster and better. It doesn&#x27;t damage your hair as much, because it&#x27;s a professional-quality dryer. I really love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> You know how it goes - you get your hair done at the salon, and it looks amazing, and then you can&#x27;t duplicate it at home. Well, now i know WHY, it&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t have a proper blow dryer? I am 45 years old, and up until I got this blow dryer i thought, &#x27;it&#x27;s just hot air, how could a $100 blow dryer be better than a $10 one?&amp;#34; But it IS! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the power of the motor, or somehow the air is more concentrated, but damn if my hair doesn&#x27;t look more amazing, and actually feels less damaged than using my $10 blow dryer!</li>
            <li> Super satisfied with the product!</li>
            <li> I am a stylist and have had my blowdryer for 13yrs!!!! Great quality and the distributor is very responsive. Will always recommend the twin turbo!!!</li>
            <li> My mother is a professional hair dresser and uses this hair drier. This thing last for years.</li>
            <li> This dryer is a game changer.  It is so powerful that I got a tangle in my hair the first time I used it.  I was surprised that its not extremely hot... it just blows really powerfully so it dries your hair very quickly.  Your hair ends up really smooth, like you came from the hair dresser.  I save at least 5 minutes a day compared to my previous, non-pro hair dryer, which in itself is worth the extra $.</li>
