            <li> The only thing I can find to remove Black eyeliner from white carpet!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your eye lids like some do but also isn&#x27;t oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> (I have sensitive skin) and you use very little to remove your makeup.</li>
            <li> , I just dry it with a cotton swab and immediately redo whatever mess I&#x27;d made and it doesn&#x27;t run because of the remover.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m now 51) and over the years I have tried other brands.</li>
            <li> and I have stopped trying other brands.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I mess up my makeup while applying it and use this to fix it</li>
            <li> It takes her eye make off with little rubbing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on others.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m missing something.</li>
            <li> I recently switched back to this product after experiencing disappointing results with Neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Expensive</li>
            <li> the others have a weird oily component...</li>
            <li> I find the spout on the bottle to be somewhat awkward, but that doesn&#x27;t substract from the product itself.</li>

            <li> i could not find this for awhile on amazon...so i tried neutrogena and loreal after years and vowing not to again back then...and i threw them away...no comparison...this is perfect! the others have a weird oily component...not this one..</li>
            <li> Best eye makeup remover on the market.</li>
            <li> The best for waterproof mascara</li>
            <li> Tried and true product!</li>
            <li> I have used this eye makeup remover since I was 16 (I&#x27;m now 51) and over the years I have tried other brands. Nothing compares to this! it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used and I have stopped trying other brands. This is worth the price and works like a charm!</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST make-up remover.</li>
            <li> does a great job taking eye makeup off.  have used it along time.</li>
            <li> Excellent eye makeup remover! Doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue, which is great! Sometimes I mess up my makeup while applying it and use this to fix it, I just dry it with a cotton swab and immediately redo whatever mess I&#x27;d made and it doesn&#x27;t run because of the remover. I find the spout on the bottle to be somewhat awkward, but that doesn&#x27;t substract from the product itself. It does run out pretty quickly if you wear eye makeup every day (fortunately I don&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product all the time and loves it.  It takes her eye make off with little rubbing.</li>
            <li> Best ever. No oily residue.</li>
            <li> This is by far, the best make up remover ever.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on others.  This is totally worth it.  I have been using it for years and all the women in my life agree.  It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li> Decades using this product.</li>
            <li> Hands down this is the best eye makeup remover I have ever used. With other removers I always felt like it would get it off for the most part but there would still be some left that I would be scrubbing to get off. With the Lancôme remover its great for everyday makeup wear but especially for getting off a heavier, darker look. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your eye lids like some do but also isn&#x27;t oily or greasy. This product is definitely worth paying the higher price when comparing it to any drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> Fantastic eye makeup remover. I use this to remove mascara and raccoon eyes. I will buy this again and again. It goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out (I have sensitive skin) and you use very little to remove your makeup.</li>
            <li> Top to remove eye make up !!! The best !!!</li>
            <li> The only thing I can find to remove Black eyeliner from white carpet!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m missing something. I buy this product and same oz. for $28 in department stores. Love the product not the price</li>
            <li> Works amazing, but expensive, you can make your own eye makeup remover just like this at home</li>
            <li> Pro: Excellent product. It removes eye makeup including eyeliner, waterproof mascara, and eyeshadow effectively without excessive rubbing or irritation. It leaves no oily residue, thus, it is safe for contact lens wearers. It feels like water and has no offensive smell. I recently switched back to this product after experiencing disappointing results with Neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Expensive</li>
            <li> grrreat! love this eye make up remover! splendid!</li>
