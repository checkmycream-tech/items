            <li>I had many compliments and inquiries about them.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would be able to use the barrette as I wanted to.</li>
            <li>The picture that is posted for this barrette is definitely more than one.  </li>
            <li>and then it will stand out more.</li>
            <li>very cool hair pieces</li>
            <li>, clasp hid well in curly hair, and functioned as a cool accent piece close-up!</li>
            <li>Looks nice, would of been fun, but too cheap and didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>I was excited to get the hair clip</li>
            <li>Great product, delivered ahead of time, worked as expected.</li>
            <li>THESE LOOKED AMAZINGLY COOL IN MY HAIR.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I ordered, it glowed for a long time and it was bright.</li>
            <li>It is not even worth the shipping to return them.</li>
            <li>FUN WITH THE SKIRT</li>
            <li>I purchased these fiber optic hair barrettes for New Years celebrations and they were a hit!!!</li>
            <li>Did exactly what they said they would.</li>
            <li>Especially because they light up!</li>
            <li>There is bright purple color on the top, the middle is all clear and a little purple accent on the bottom.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it looks.</li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>and when you cut the strands in a fan, they really enhance your hair piece.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool look overall.</li>
            <li>Stiff and doesn&#x27;t look as cute as the photo</li>
            <li>I like the barrette, but it doesn&#x27;t show up nearly as well as the picture looks.  </li>

            <li> It unfortunately did not turn off after unclasping the barrett, however I saved the plastic that was removed from the battery and replaced it.</li>
            <li> Sorry these are really bad.</li>
            <li> Mine must have been defective because they didnt glow for crap.</li>

            <li> Bought this for the Electric Run.  It shone the entire time! and looked cute!  only minus is the barrette part is difficult to open and close.</li>
            <li> HEY I DID NAW GET THESE FER MY HAIR ON THE SIDE N BACK O MY HEAD,  I GOT EM FER MY HELICOPTERS NIGHT TIME FLYING WHEEEE!</li>
            <li> Purple option not as bright as some reviews/pictures suggested, but color was nice, clasp hid well in curly hair, and functioned as a cool accent piece close-up! Only used it once, so can&#x27;t speak for battery life, but held up well for one evening.</li>
            <li> I purchased these fiber optic hair barrettes for New Years celebrations and they were a hit!!! I had many compliments and inquiries about them.  The batteries last a long time too!</li>
            <li> Although the quality is not that good. I think the battery thing failed or something like that. But I think I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> These work, and function well but it is very obvious that the clip is in your hair and it falls out often.</li>
            <li> Did exactly what they said they would. My only wish is that there was an on/off switch but that wasn&#x27;t included in the description so can&#x27;t hold it against them.</li>
            <li> Bright color.  I really like the way it looks.</li>
            <li> this was a great accessory to have. It unfortunately did not turn off after unclasping the barrett, however I saved the plastic that was removed from the battery and replaced it.</li>
            <li> Sorry these are really bad. Only 1 work of the 2 work. I thought I would be able to use the barrette as I wanted to. It does not shut off. I have to open the batteries to stop it. There is bright purple color on the top, the middle is all clear and a little purple accent on the bottom. It is not even worth the shipping to return them.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get the hair clip but It did not work at all plus strands were coming out of the clip. Looks nice, would of been fun, but too cheap and didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I bought these to go in the table decor with effiel tower vases and feathers. It is gorgeous! Thank you</li>
            <li> Has never worked... ever replaced the batteries and still not working. A huge disappointment to me, I wont be buying this again or recommending it.</li>
            <li> Stiff and doesn&#x27;t look as cute as the photo</li>
            <li> I love these! Especially because they light up!</li>
            <li> very cool hair pieces a few came broken but if it works its great for 1 or 2 nights of fun</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I ordered, it glowed for a long time and it was bright. I love that you can buy replacement batteries and use them forever! The strings are able to be cut for shorter hair lengths, which is nice. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product, delivered ahead of time, worked as expected.</li>
            <li> THESE LOOKED AMAZINGLY COOL IN MY HAIR. FUN WITH THE SKIRT</li>
            <li> Mine must have been defective because they didnt glow for crap. I had pink ones as well and they were wicked bright. These were lame and not worth the money and the time it took to get them .</li>

            <li> The tips are a purply-pink, while the strands are almost blue they are so violet. Pretty cool look overall. Works really well and when you cut the strands in a fan, they really enhance your hair piece.</li>
            <li> Wonderful New Years add on. Great for any holiday or fun.</li>
