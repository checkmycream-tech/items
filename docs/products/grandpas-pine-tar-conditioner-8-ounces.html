            <li>sure do like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>what it might do for that, but I sure do like it and will buy again.</li>
            <li>I use Gandpa soap and shampoo and I love them both.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good conditioner.</li>
            <li>I used to use Grandpa&#x27;s Bar Soap to clean my  big beard, and it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell of the product</li>
            <li>I really do enjoy the scent, but I&#x27;m something of a mountain man.</li>
            <li>i hope this works as well for you, worth a try for sure.</li>
            <li>I just became aware that Grandpa&#x27;s also had a conditioner - naturally I quickly ordered it and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>well.&lt;br /&gt;I will warn that it has a wired smell that some may not be able to get pass, but once he is out of the shower I really can&#x27;t smell it on him.  </li>
            <li>I use Grandpa&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner at least twice a week and am very happy with them.</li>
            <li>I love it, it really sooths my skin during a psoriasis flare up</li>
            <li>If you have fungus issues, this product is worth trying.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it is good for other consumers</li>
            <li>This is the first conditioner I have used in years that leaves my hair soft and flake free.</li>
            <li>As someone recovering from cryogenic removal of some pre-cancerour lesions from my temple into the edge of my scalp, I was seeking a way to remove the scaling that was threatening to cause flaking similar to dandruff, I bought the Grandpa Soap Company shampoo and conditioner, both of which worked beautifully and still left my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Works really well, makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes the Pine Tar products.  </li>
            <li>I think because the spread ability of the conditioner, you might you 2 much.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle yet gives me some relief for a while for,</li>
            <li>They both work really well and don&#x27;t leave a smell.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Nice big bar, that scent that identifies it, and it lathers with just a little bit on your hands.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft and manageable but not greasy as some conditioners can do.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s even gentle enough to use on my beard.</li>
            <li>so far as I know, there is no cure.  </li>
            <li>Since I am of the older generation I remember when some dandruff shampoos had this same smell.  </li>
            <li>I am open to new experiences but if grandpa smelled like this, it&#x27;s a wonder grandma ever gave him the time of day.</li>
            <li>They leave my hair shiny and soft without being dry.  </li>
            <li>He has not had a single flare-up since its use, his skin is soft and healing.</li>

            <li> This has helped control my dry scalp condition.  </li>
            <li> I was washing my hair with Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar bar soap but found it to leave my hair a tad dry.</li>
            <li> I love the subtle fragrance it leaves behind in my hair and my partner does too.  </li>

            <li> love it keeps my beard cleaned. takes very little to really cover</li>

            <li> This has helped control my dry scalp condition.  I enjoy the smell of the product but my wife has a different opinion.</li>
            <li> Have tried several products of this type, and all seem to work well,  but I like this one the best.</li>
            <li> Have always loved all Grandpa Pine Tar products.  They never disappoint.</li>
            <li> I am open to new experiences but if grandpa smelled like this, it&#x27;s a wonder grandma ever gave him the time of day.</li>
            <li> This is the first conditioner I have used in years that leaves my hair soft and flake free. The pine smell fades after a short time.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes the Pine Tar products.  He has rosacea and his skin is very sensitive to other skin products for bathing, lotions, etc.  He is able to tolerate the Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar soap, shampoo, and conditioner well.&lt;br /&gt;I will warn that it has a wired smell that some may not be able to get pass, but once he is out of the shower I really can&#x27;t smell it on him.  Since I am of the older generation I remember when some dandruff shampoos had this same smell.  I will buy him more when he runs out.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite shampoo and conditioner are these pine tar products!  They leave my hair shiny and soft without being dry.  They also leave my scalp feeling soothed.  I find I can go longer between shampoos... probably because the product does not irritate my scalp.  I love the subtle fragrance it leaves behind in my hair and my partner does too.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Works really well, makes my hair super soft. Only con would be the smell but no one has said anything yet to me about that, we shall see!</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner to use with Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Shampoo.  It makes your hair soft and manageable but not greasy as some conditioners can do.</li>
            <li> I used to use Grandpa&#x27;s Bar Soap to clean my  big beard, and it worked wonderfully. When I discovered there is a Grandpa&#x27;s shampoo I bought it and the conditioner. It is everything I suspected it would be. Now my big beard and hair, are magnificent. I really do enjoy the scent, but I&#x27;m something of a mountain man.</li>
            <li> The conditioner has the smell of the shampoo, but it works wells.  I think because the spread ability of the conditioner, you might you 2 much.  However, if you are dealing with scalp issues, I have no problems with this conditioner.  I use with the shampoo and its has helped greatly.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair everyday it&#x27;s even gentle enough to use on my beard. Goes great with Granpa&#x27;s conditioner!</li>
            <li> My husband swears by all Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar products, and the conditioner did not disappoint.  If you have fungus issues, this product is worth trying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had itchy seborrhea for over 50 years. I was washing my hair with Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar bar soap but found it to leave my hair a tad dry. Then I found the shampoo.  It is gentle yet gives me some relief for a while for, so far as I know, there is no cure.  I just became aware that Grandpa&#x27;s also had a conditioner - naturally I quickly ordered it and am glad I did.  I use Grandpa&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner at least twice a week and am very happy with them.</li>
            <li> I love it, it really sooths my skin during a psoriasis flare up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about the consistency of water,  it&#x27;s difficult to use, and goes quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for years.  If you have eczema in your eyebrows and around your nose this is the soap for you.  Some of my friends use it in the shower.  It is not the best smelling soap because it does not contain perfume.  It lathers well and it works.</li>
            <li> Pretty good conditioner. Does leave thick hair very dry.</li>
            <li> sure do like this shampoo.  Great smell, don&#x27;t have to use much, it lathers nicely.  Makes my hair feel fuller&lt;br /&gt;and thicker, but that is not why I bought it.  I do not have a scalp problem, so can&#x27;t comment on anything&lt;br /&gt;about what it might do for that, but I sure do like it and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo and conditioner.  Like what Grandma used to use.  Makes hair feel great.  Smells good, too.  Speedy shipping. good price.</li>
            <li> As someone recovering from cryogenic removal of some pre-cancerour lesions from my temple into the edge of my scalp, I was seeking a way to remove the scaling that was threatening to cause flaking similar to dandruff, I bought the Grandpa Soap Company shampoo and conditioner, both of which worked beautifully and still left my hair soft. There appears to be no problem with smell residue.</li>
            <li> I use Gandpa soap and shampoo and I love them both.  They both work really well and don&#x27;t leave a smell.  The conditioner on the other hand has a very strong lingering smell which I find annoying.</li>
            <li> Nice big bar, that scent that identifies it, and it lathers with just a little bit on your hands.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Recommend use with the shampoo for the best results.  If you have any skin problems at all, this is your answer.  Would never go back to using regular conditioners.  This is the best</li>
            <li> Below expectations due to watery consistency and with unsensed effects.</li>
            <li> i purchased this for my bf who was using an over the counter shampoo since he preferred liquid soap to help with his extremely painful eczema fare-ups (palms and bottom of feet). He is very pleased with this product and uses it as body soap and shampoo. He has not had a single flare-up since its use, his skin is soft and healing. i hope this works as well for you, worth a try for sure.</li>
            <li> bought it for girlfriends scalp problems.</li>
            <li> The conditioner leaked out of the bottle during shipping.  Conditioner is good.</li>
