            <li>Great brush in the beginning</li>
            <li>I was on the hunt for a great brush with boar bristles.</li>

            <li>Love this brush!!</li>
            <li>Also I never get static electricity from it!!</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and was told that boars hair would be the best brush for me.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this brush is perfect for my hair and my scalp feels so good too.</li>
            <li>I find myself brushing with it just because it feels so good.</li>
            <li>She loved that.</li>

            <li>Read lots of great reviews about the quality of this brand, that it compared to another that was many times the price.  </li>
            <li>Feels very nice on my scalp with massaging bristles and makes my hair very smooth.</li>
            <li>and it felt very healthy since using.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>The wood pin bristles feel wonderful on my scalp (way better than nylon), the boar bristles smooth and sleeken my hair, and together they de-tangle without yanking or scratching.</li>
            <li>My wife and kids love these!  </li>
            <li>I love this brush!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>But for just brushing nightly or detangling I love it!</li>
            <li>At first this brush seemed great!</li>
            <li>Glad I found this one!  </li>
            <li>I love this brush!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll make the most of it!</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s attractive and well-made, comfortable to grip.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to discover that this Olivia Garden brush (the Ionic Combo paddle version) is, in my opinion, even better than my beloved Mason Pearson.</li>
            <li>I liked the ionic bristles for the scalp massage and</li>
            <li>the boar bristles made my coat nice and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Good for the planet earth. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice hairbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Mason Pearson brushes &amp; while they are nice...</li>
            <li>Beautiful brush and has so much cool tech, bamboo, cushion, wood bristle and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>feels very smooth on the hair, could have longer bristles though, and I have fine hair!!</li>
            <li>The hand is a nice size and shape and the natural bristle to plastic bristle ratio is perfect.</li>
            <li>Bought this brush as one of the many things I switched, and love it!</li>
            <li>Love this brush much better!</li>
            <li>It does feel very nice and gentle, is beautiful to look at and -very important for fine hair-</li>
            <li>So far this brush is great!</li>
            <li>Wow this brush is great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was expecting great things from my first boar hair/ ionic bristle combo brush.</li>
            <li>I love it and loving it encourages me to brush more often for healthy scalp and to redistribute the oils.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s easy to clean, sturdy, and feels good on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying five more of these brushes as presents for my sister, nieces and daughter, all of whom have also been Mason Pearson addicts.</li>
            <li>All they had available in hair brushes was made from China and nothing nice either.</li>
            <li>So  I shopped here and just love this brush.</li>
            <li>Really pleased with the product and the price could not be beat.</li>
            <li>Just bought 3 more.  </li>
            <li>A cat&#x27;s tongue would have created more</li>
            <li>I almost never use brushes (I use combs because they detangle better).</li>
            <li>I hope that helps! :)</li>
            <li>I remembered my Dad having one, and it would just brush over the top.</li>
            <li>Love the way it goes through my hair, and it is like getting a scalp massage, as another reviewer had said.</li>
            <li>My husband commented on how shiny my hair has been - haven&#x27;t done anything else differently, but know I am brushing my hair more as it feels so good!!</li>
            <li>I am not going to rate this anything lower than a 4 as I do not think its the brush&#x27;s fault, but it says that its anti static.</li>
            <li>I however will not discredit this brush, as I have used ionic brushes before that claimed to be anti static</li>
            <li>so I am trying to take better care of my hair and scalp to try and regain the hair I seem to be losing.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not anti static for me.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am about to buy 4 more as presents.</li>
            <li>This brush feels really good on my scalp, detangles gently, and makes my hair look shiny and fall nicely, but my hair still gets a bit staticky on occasion when using it.</li>
            <li>Still a better brush than I have ever owned before.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;d be okay if this were 1900</li>
            <li>My wife, my mother-in-law and my sister are all completely in love with this brush.</li>
            <li>love love love the bamboo construction.</li>
            <li>, was just gonna be ok.</li>
            <li>My grandaughter is enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always thought I needed more product or if that didn&#x27;t work, better product.  </li>
            <li>Yes, but it is 10x better.  </li>
            <li>Love this brush.  </li>
            <li>This brush is lovely.  </li>
            <li>And I love it.</li>
            <li>never causes static.</li>
            <li>and I love using</li>
            <li>I have had bamboo brushes before that I&#x27;ve liked and was excited to find this combo brush.  </li>
            <li>My hair had never done that before -I do not recommend this if you are looking for a static free brush.</li>
            <li>The design is nice,  and it&#x27;s pretty to look at.</li>
            <li>The striped bamboo is neat and the back of the paddle has a beautiful stamp that looks like it is wood burned.</li>
            <li>, those Germans know all about eco and fine engineering... even in a hair brush probably.</li>
            <li>Even with my fine, curly/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, but thicker hair.  </li>
            <li>The best place to buy this brush is off Aveda&#x27;s website and it is $20 plus a little for shipping.</li>
            <li>I gave it my my neighbor&#x27;s 8 year old, who has fine, not-too-thick hair, and she&#x27;s delighted with it.  </li>
            <li>cheap Mason Pearson copy cats that scratched my scalp, pulled my hair, or fell apart,</li>
            <li>It really is fantastic.</li>
            <li>But I can smooth it out so its not a deal breaker.oth it out so its not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is solidly constructed, and it may be great for someone with coarser hair, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for everyone.</li>
            <li>Feels nice on the scalp, hair is very silky.</li>
            <li>handle is comfortable and made of bamboo.</li>
            <li>Of course, the product helps smooth out my hair.  </li>
            <li>However, I liked it so much</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to clean</li>
            <li>This was great for 3 weeks, until the plastic yellow bits on the ends of the bristles came off and scratched the heck out of my scalp.</li>
            <li>my girl would not shut up about how soft it is quotes: my hair feels so good, feels like clouds</li>
            <li>) bristle in each \\&quot;patch\\&quot; of bristles which helps it detangle quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>I want bamboo everything from now on-- very strong and very beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Why I owas tempted to give 4 stars instead of 5, but I love it too much!).</li>
            <li>and I knew it was time to retire the original.</li>
            <li>I loved this brush when It was new, even my granddaughter who is two and hates her hair being brushed liked this brush.</li>
            <li>This Olivia Garden brush seemed like a good contender with the combination of boar bristle and wooden pin bristles, and besides, it&#x27;s $100 cheaper!</li>
            <li>I found that it REALLY increases static, and the wood pins are way too flimsy.  </li>
            <li>Prices on Amazon are much more reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Now it \\&quot;still works\\&quot; for the most part but the rubber tip on the end of the bristles has worn away so much its unusable without pain.</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t sleep like that, so I had to shower before bed, the shower was really nice, highly recommend a hot shower before bed.</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal Mason Pearson nylon and boar bristle brush user for decades, using them exclusively, because I&#x27;ve never found a brush I like as well, but I&#x27;m switching my allegiance to this bamboo brush.</li>
            <li>Still, loyal as I am, the price is painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a big knot in my hair, and it was able to get most of it out with no problem.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having said that, it&#x27;s very pretty...</li>
            <li>but it does feel good when I brush my long, curly hair.</li>
            <li>but I still really like this brush because of how easily it slides through my hair.</li>
            <li>THE FIRST TIME I USED IT!  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and straight.</li>
            <li>Great for a little while then goes caput on you.</li>
            <li>I was able to bend the bristles back up, so it works fine.</li>
            <li>and I appreciated the free shipping.</li>
            <li>The thing is most likley 24 years old.</li>
            <li>Worth buying 100%</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every kind of detangling brush there is, but this is the ONLY one she lets touch her head.</li>
            <li>The wood-tip bristles in between the boar&#x27;s bristles are so much more comfortable on my head than regular nylon.</li>
            <li>Paying $17.50 for this brush was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>This is my second brush of this kind.</li>
            <li>The only kind of comb that did not induce any statics is my ox horn one.</li>
            <li>But I LOVE this brush, the bristles are soft and short and spread oil down the length of the hair wonderfully.</li>
            <li>but the bristles are much stiffer, it gets down to my scalp with ease, so the Ambassador is a much better choice for someone with my kind of hair.</li>
            <li>I picked a good one, as I can brush and brush, with only normal hair shedding.  </li>
            <li>I have super thick hair and this brush is great for it.</li>
            <li>but I highly recommend for those with fine straight hair like mine!</li>
            <li>I like the design of the brush and its the same size as my old brush which is perfect for my hair which is about 3/4 back length about 4 inches from bottom of pants.</li>
            <li>I love the boar bristle brushes and how good they are for your hair, but they don&#x27;t get all the way through my thick mane!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning the Goody boar large paddle brush at Target!</li>
            <li>I was surprised how strong &amp; durable this brush is.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a soft and easy hairbrush.</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair and the bristles were barely strong enough to graze over my head.</li>
            <li>I like this brush, but the boar bristles fall out pretty easy, but it leaves my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>The shipper is also very fast</li>
            <li>The brush is very gentle on hair</li>
            <li>Sounded great with the combined bristles, pegs and cushion (a hard to find combination), however it is just not working for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for and</li>
            <li>I bought a second one for travel but noticed that many of the bristle knobs fell off while packed in my suitcase.</li>
            <li>This is the first boar bristle brush I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>This is the best brush I have ever owned and have no more interest in combs and such.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty brush too.</li>
            <li>That is for the first month</li>
            <li>I was going on and on about it with a friend, and she was interested, so had one sent to her -</li>
            <li>Only reason I gave this 4 stars was the static thing.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty brush</li>
            <li>However I only give it three stars because there are much better brushes you can buy.</li>
            <li>I am completely in love with my Aveda wooden paddle brush.</li>
            <li>I tried this brush today for the first time - bought it as a companion piece for my first ceramic ion blowdryer.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it enough yet to say I love it</li>
            <li>Love this brush - the instant I started to use it</li>
            <li>I am replacing this brush after about 9 months after ordering the first one.</li>
            <li>The wood is pretty</li>
            <li>The boar bristles are too short and just skim over the top layer of hair.</li>
            <li>Again, it&#x27;s really great until the plastic wears off, so it doesn&#x27;t last very long for the price.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush due to the high amount of good reviews.  </li>
            <li>I recently got the bright idea to start bleaching said hair blonde even though I&#x27;m a brunette.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend even complimented on it&#x27;s ability to smooth out his hair which my old brushes never did very well.</li>
            <li>First off I purchased the large paddle brush so this review applies to that</li>
            <li>had stiff plastic bristles that were surrounded by softer nylon ones and now I am so happy to find a natural version!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and then just use this new brush at the end to smooth down any static.</li>
            <li>I bought a humidifier and Alterna&#x27;s dry hail oil for the static.</li>
            <li>She had used it at the home of another grand-daughter and love it so much as it didn&#x27;t pull her long hair when brushing.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s still a good deal, just didn&#x27;t last as long as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>The quality of the wood seems decent, the price is very reasonable, and the product arrives as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Handle is smaller, and so isn&#x27;t as comfortable in my hand as this one (I have large hands)</li>
            <li>Very comfy.</li>
            <li>Why have I spent my money on a MP brush, when this is actually better.  </li>
            <li>the company I got it from got it to me amazingly fast</li>
            <li>This brush really does make getting ready in the morning easier.</li>
            <li>Eventually the knobs on the plastic bristles fell off and it got really scratchy.  </li>
            <li>So much for \\&quot;eco.\\</li>
            <li>tried rinsing it to remove the smell, boy was that a mistake, because then my whole bathroom smelled -- somewhere between scorched plastic and singed hair.</li>
            <li>But what I really like is that there is a nylon (I think they&#x27;re nylon</li>
            <li>Gentle.</li>
            <li>and I was on a quest to help her with getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li>It is gentle, doesn&#x27;t tug, and makes hair shinier.  </li>
            <li>Shipping FAST</li>
            <li>and I was really looking forward to using it.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li>The brush really makes my hair shine</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really like this brush because it adds shine to my hair.</li>
            <li>This brush works really well on my hair, which is curly and quite fizzy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who is growing a terminal-length beard and wants something low-priced that they can throw around.</li>
            <li>This lady will gently caress your tangles into a magnifiscent cascade, spouting forth from your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the hair and lives it shiny.  </li>
            <li>It did leave my hair feeling soft, though I experienced the same POOF after brushing my hair that other people have described.</li>
            <li>I have semi long hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li>I live in a dry northern California area and static cling is an issue.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly fine hair, and it seems to be thinning which for me at almost 25 is very upsetting to me, as well as long hair</li>
            <li>It works beautifully on my wavy mid-back length hair without causing extra frizz and takes knots out of my daughters (7 and 3 each with waist length hair) without pulling hard.</li>
            <li>the first few brushes (5stars)  makes your hair static (4stars)  </li>
            <li>Now it makes my hair soft again but it isn&#x27;t exactly what I wanted in the brush...</li>
            <li>Then a good chunk of my hairs upper layer broke off leaving me with only about 2 inches of hair at the tuff of my head in the back on this layer.</li>
            <li>My head is sensitive and this is the first brush that styles, detangles, and works without causing pain.</li>
            <li>I tried this brush while staying at my parents one night and was amazed how easily it slid through my wet hair.</li>
            <li>Since using this my hair is less frizzy, more manageable and healthier.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like the fact that it has both bristles and the plastic covered nubs.</li>
            <li>At first I was super careful</li>
            <li>I had high hopes when ordering this brush.  </li>
            <li>I found the plastic bristles a little flimsy but perhaps that&#x27;s better for your hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li>The plastic bristles that stick out farther from the boar bristles which I thought would help detangle are very flimsy and bendy and don&#x27;t serve any purpose that I can see.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to replace my old plastic brush, but I find I need to keep using it to brush out the tangles</li>
            <li>I love it and cannot wait to buy some for gifts after I&#x27;ve tested this one out for a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have used this brush for a few weeks now, and I love that my hair looks healthier and shinier than before.</li>
            <li>Conair Professional Full and Mid Size Nylon Cushion Brush Set, Colors may vary]] to this flimsy thing.</li>
            <li>First off the company sent me the wrong item in the mail, couldn&#x27;t have been more different than what I&#x27;d ordered, but when I finally received the correct brush I enjoyed it at first.  </li>
            <li>I am just buying a new one - for the price</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading that these natural but firm bristle brushes are optimal for stimulating the scalp which keeps hair healthy and is preventative against balding.</li>
            <li>Now, at 51, it&#x27;s shoulder length and not so thick anymore, but I still justify the expense of a Mason Pearson brush because they work so well, feel so good and last forever</li>
            <li>At first I was disapointed, because the brush had gotten smooshed in the middle from the packaging.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it last night the plastic bristles fell out!!  </li>
            <li>It detangles without pain, and my hair feels soft after using it!</li>
            <li>I know there are several other brushes (with more boar&#x27;s hair) that I want to try, but their price makes me cringe.</li>
            <li>She also said that it helped her dry her hair faster since she could blow dry her hair while brushing without worrying about static, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Falls apart too easily making it just a waste.</li>
            <li>Brush is very gentle on my beard (which is about a foot long now).</li>
            <li>Wow -</li>
            <li>When I was young</li>
            <li>The brush just works really well and was only $15.</li>
            <li>The plastic bristles help get through the hair while the boar bristles take the natural oils from your scalp and distributes the through the rest of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I want a boar bristle brush not a everyday brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for 3 days and my hair is soooo much softer and shiny.</li>
            <li>makes your hair soft</li>
            <li>The brush was mashed into the box with another item that I purchased and some bristles were damaged, one bristle cluster was knocked out of the brush completely.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>far as helping with tangled hair&#x3D;it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way too soft to get anywhere near my scalp.  </li>
            <li>They were also frayed out like an old toothbrush when we received it.</li>
            <li>So far none of the bristles/pins have fallen out or bent.</li>
            <li>Most if stiff have nylon bristles mixed in which is not what i want in a natural brush.  </li>
            <li>Only thing it doesn&#x27;t do well is hair parting (ie if I want to move my part from the left to right side of my head or whatever), I still use a comb or my old brush for that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this would work as well for someone with thicker or curly hair since the soft bristles bend so easily</li>
            <li>I have long, straight, fine hair, and have a 6 year old with long, thick, straight hair and a VERY sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>I have the kind of hair that is hard to brush through when it&#x27;s wet, it just gets stuck.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But when my current one started to wear out, after seeing the price for a new one ($113), I thought I&#x27;d shop around for something else.</li>
            <li>I see a major difference in my hair after 6 months of using it.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine but thick and this brush penetrates all the way through my hair to my scalp.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I think my hair is too fine for this type of brush; even being very gentle with totally dry hair, I was getting a lot of breakage that I don&#x27;t normally have.</li>
            <li>boar brushes were too soft, not getting through the dense hair especially when it is tangled up.  </li>
            <li>--I have owned only three Mason Pearson brushes in the past thirty five years - two full size, one travel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was a primpy little girl who wanted to sit in front of my vanity to brush my hair exactly 100 strokes.</li>
            <li>I looked long and hard to find a brush that wouldn&#x27;t tear out my thinning baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I first thought one had come out of mine when I&#x27;d been brushing, but she noticed hers was missing before removing the plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>I just can not believe that I wasted money on this for it to fall apart the first time I used it...  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li>My item shipped quickly, however, it arrived with a few bristles missing (just an empty hole where a group of bristles should be) and the majority of the bristles seem to be jutting out to the right side of the brush?  </li>
            <li>are not very long</li>
            <li>The first few combs through my hair left it looking like my head had been attacked by a balloon.</li>
            <li>I live very rural so not much choice for shopping here except for that big box store.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair but due to thyroid disorder it is often falling out, brittle and gets tangled easily.  </li>

            <li> and it felt very healthy since using.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> The wood pin bristles feel wonderful on my scalp (way better than nylon), the boar bristles smooth and sleeken my hair, and together they de-tangle without yanking or scratching.</li>
            <li> My wife and kids love these!  </li>
            <li> I love this brush!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> But for just brushing nightly or detangling I love it!</li>
            <li> At first this brush seemed great!</li>
            <li> Glad I found this one!  </li>
            <li> I love this brush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make the most of it!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s attractive and well-made, comfortable to grip.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to discover that this Olivia Garden brush (the Ionic Combo paddle version) is, in my opinion, even better than my beloved Mason Pearson.</li>
            <li> I liked the ionic bristles for the scalp massage and</li>
            <li> the boar bristles made my coat nice and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Good for the planet earth. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice hairbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Mason Pearson brushes &amp; while they are nice...</li>
            <li> Beautiful brush and has so much cool tech, bamboo, cushion, wood bristle and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> feels very smooth on the hair, could have longer bristles though, and I have fine hair!!</li>
            <li> The hand is a nice size and shape and the natural bristle to plastic bristle ratio is perfect.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush as one of the many things I switched, and love it!</li>
            <li> Love this brush much better!</li>
            <li> It does feel very nice and gentle, is beautiful to look at and -very important for fine hair-</li>
            <li> So far this brush is great!</li>
            <li> Wow this brush is great!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was expecting great things from my first boar hair/ ionic bristle combo brush.</li>
            <li> I love it and loving it encourages me to brush more often for healthy scalp and to redistribute the oils.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s easy to clean, sturdy, and feels good on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying five more of these brushes as presents for my sister, nieces and daughter, all of whom have also been Mason Pearson addicts.</li>
            <li> All they had available in hair brushes was made from China and nothing nice either.</li>
            <li> So  I shopped here and just love this brush.</li>
            <li> Really pleased with the product and the price could not be beat.</li>
            <li> Just bought 3 more.  </li>
            <li> A cat&#x27;s tongue would have created more</li>
            <li> I almost never use brushes (I use combs because they detangle better).</li>
            <li> I hope that helps! :)</li>
            <li> I remembered my Dad having one, and it would just brush over the top.</li>
            <li> Love the way it goes through my hair, and it is like getting a scalp massage, as another reviewer had said.</li>
            <li> My husband commented on how shiny my hair has been - haven&#x27;t done anything else differently, but know I am brushing my hair more as it feels so good!!</li>
            <li> I am not going to rate this anything lower than a 4 as I do not think its the brush&#x27;s fault, but it says that its anti static.</li>
            <li> I however will not discredit this brush, as I have used ionic brushes before that claimed to be anti static</li>
            <li> so I am trying to take better care of my hair and scalp to try and regain the hair I seem to be losing.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not anti static for me.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I am about to buy 4 more as presents.</li>
            <li> This brush feels really good on my scalp, detangles gently, and makes my hair look shiny and fall nicely, but my hair still gets a bit staticky on occasion when using it.</li>
            <li> Still a better brush than I have ever owned before.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;d be okay if this were 1900</li>
            <li> My wife, my mother-in-law and my sister are all completely in love with this brush.</li>
            <li> love love love the bamboo construction.</li>
            <li> , was just gonna be ok.</li>
            <li> My grandaughter is enjoying it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always thought I needed more product or if that didn&#x27;t work, better product.  </li>
            <li> Yes, but it is 10x better.  </li>
            <li> Love this brush.  </li>
            <li> This brush is lovely.  </li>
            <li> And I love it.</li>
            <li> never causes static.</li>
            <li> and I love using</li>
            <li> I have had bamboo brushes before that I&#x27;ve liked and was excited to find this combo brush.  </li>
            <li> My hair had never done that before -I do not recommend this if you are looking for a static free brush.</li>
            <li> The design is nice,  and it&#x27;s pretty to look at.</li>
            <li> The striped bamboo is neat and the back of the paddle has a beautiful stamp that looks like it is wood burned.</li>
            <li> , those Germans know all about eco and fine engineering... even in a hair brush probably.</li>
            <li> Even with my fine, curly/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, but thicker hair.  </li>
            <li> The best place to buy this brush is off Aveda&#x27;s website and it is $20 plus a little for shipping.</li>
            <li> I gave it my my neighbor&#x27;s 8 year old, who has fine, not-too-thick hair, and she&#x27;s delighted with it.  </li>
            <li> cheap Mason Pearson copy cats that scratched my scalp, pulled my hair, or fell apart,</li>
            <li> It really is fantastic.</li>
            <li> But I can smooth it out so its not a deal breaker.oth it out so its not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is solidly constructed, and it may be great for someone with coarser hair, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for everyone.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on the scalp, hair is very silky.</li>
            <li> handle is comfortable and made of bamboo.</li>
            <li> Of course, the product helps smooth out my hair.  </li>
            <li> However, I liked it so much</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to clean</li>
            <li> This was great for 3 weeks, until the plastic yellow bits on the ends of the bristles came off and scratched the heck out of my scalp.</li>
            <li> my girl would not shut up about how soft it is quotes: my hair feels so good, feels like clouds</li>
            <li> ) bristle in each \\&quot;patch\\&quot; of bristles which helps it detangle quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> I want bamboo everything from now on-- very strong and very beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Why I owas tempted to give 4 stars instead of 5, but I love it too much!).</li>
            <li> and I knew it was time to retire the original.</li>
            <li> I loved this brush when It was new, even my granddaughter who is two and hates her hair being brushed liked this brush.</li>
            <li> This Olivia Garden brush seemed like a good contender with the combination of boar bristle and wooden pin bristles, and besides, it&#x27;s $100 cheaper!</li>
            <li> I found that it REALLY increases static, and the wood pins are way too flimsy.  </li>
            <li> Prices on Amazon are much more reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Now it \\&quot;still works\\&quot; for the most part but the rubber tip on the end of the bristles has worn away so much its unusable without pain.</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t sleep like that, so I had to shower before bed, the shower was really nice, highly recommend a hot shower before bed.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Mason Pearson nylon and boar bristle brush user for decades, using them exclusively, because I&#x27;ve never found a brush I like as well, but I&#x27;m switching my allegiance to this bamboo brush.</li>
            <li> Still, loyal as I am, the price is painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a big knot in my hair, and it was able to get most of it out with no problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having said that, it&#x27;s very pretty...</li>
            <li> but it does feel good when I brush my long, curly hair.</li>
            <li> but I still really like this brush because of how easily it slides through my hair.</li>
            <li> THE FIRST TIME I USED IT!  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine and straight.</li>
            <li> Great for a little while then goes caput on you.</li>
            <li> I was able to bend the bristles back up, so it works fine.</li>
            <li> and I appreciated the free shipping.</li>
            <li> The thing is most likley 24 years old.</li>
            <li> Worth buying 100%</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every kind of detangling brush there is, but this is the ONLY one she lets touch her head.</li>
            <li> The wood-tip bristles in between the boar&#x27;s bristles are so much more comfortable on my head than regular nylon.</li>
            <li> Paying $17.50 for this brush was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This is my second brush of this kind.</li>
            <li> The only kind of comb that did not induce any statics is my ox horn one.</li>
            <li> But I LOVE this brush, the bristles are soft and short and spread oil down the length of the hair wonderfully.</li>
            <li> but the bristles are much stiffer, it gets down to my scalp with ease, so the Ambassador is a much better choice for someone with my kind of hair.</li>
            <li> I picked a good one, as I can brush and brush, with only normal hair shedding.  </li>
            <li> I have super thick hair and this brush is great for it.</li>
            <li> but I highly recommend for those with fine straight hair like mine!</li>
            <li> I like the design of the brush and its the same size as my old brush which is perfect for my hair which is about 3/4 back length about 4 inches from bottom of pants.</li>
            <li> I love the boar bristle brushes and how good they are for your hair, but they don&#x27;t get all the way through my thick mane!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning the Goody boar large paddle brush at Target!</li>
            <li> I was surprised how strong &amp; durable this brush is.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a soft and easy hairbrush.</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair and the bristles were barely strong enough to graze over my head.</li>
            <li> I like this brush, but the boar bristles fall out pretty easy, but it leaves my hair soft.  </li>
            <li> The shipper is also very fast</li>
            <li> The brush is very gentle on hair</li>
            <li> Sounded great with the combined bristles, pegs and cushion (a hard to find combination), however it is just not working for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for and</li>
            <li> I bought a second one for travel but noticed that many of the bristle knobs fell off while packed in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> This is the first boar bristle brush I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> This is the best brush I have ever owned and have no more interest in combs and such.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty brush too.</li>
            <li> That is for the first month</li>
            <li> I was going on and on about it with a friend, and she was interested, so had one sent to her -</li>
            <li> Only reason I gave this 4 stars was the static thing.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty brush</li>
            <li> However I only give it three stars because there are much better brushes you can buy.</li>
            <li> I am completely in love with my Aveda wooden paddle brush.</li>
            <li> I tried this brush today for the first time - bought it as a companion piece for my first ceramic ion blowdryer.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it enough yet to say I love it</li>
            <li> Love this brush - the instant I started to use it</li>
            <li> I am replacing this brush after about 9 months after ordering the first one.</li>
            <li> The wood is pretty</li>
            <li> The boar bristles are too short and just skim over the top layer of hair.</li>
            <li> Again, it&#x27;s really great until the plastic wears off, so it doesn&#x27;t last very long for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush due to the high amount of good reviews.  </li>
            <li> I recently got the bright idea to start bleaching said hair blonde even though I&#x27;m a brunette.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend even complimented on it&#x27;s ability to smooth out his hair which my old brushes never did very well.</li>
            <li> First off I purchased the large paddle brush so this review applies to that</li>
            <li> had stiff plastic bristles that were surrounded by softer nylon ones and now I am so happy to find a natural version!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and then just use this new brush at the end to smooth down any static.</li>
            <li> I bought a humidifier and Alterna&#x27;s dry hail oil for the static.</li>
            <li> She had used it at the home of another grand-daughter and love it so much as it didn&#x27;t pull her long hair when brushing.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s still a good deal, just didn&#x27;t last as long as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> The quality of the wood seems decent, the price is very reasonable, and the product arrives as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Handle is smaller, and so isn&#x27;t as comfortable in my hand as this one (I have large hands)</li>
            <li> Very comfy.</li>
            <li> Why have I spent my money on a MP brush, when this is actually better.  </li>
            <li> the company I got it from got it to me amazingly fast</li>
            <li> This brush really does make getting ready in the morning easier.</li>
            <li> Eventually the knobs on the plastic bristles fell off and it got really scratchy.  </li>
            <li> So much for \\&quot;eco.\\</li>
            <li> tried rinsing it to remove the smell, boy was that a mistake, because then my whole bathroom smelled -- somewhere between scorched plastic and singed hair.</li>
            <li> But what I really like is that there is a nylon (I think they&#x27;re nylon</li>
            <li> Gentle.</li>
            <li> and I was on a quest to help her with getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li> It is gentle, doesn&#x27;t tug, and makes hair shinier.  </li>
            <li> Shipping FAST</li>
            <li> and I was really looking forward to using it.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li> The brush really makes my hair shine</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this brush because it adds shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> This brush works really well on my hair, which is curly and quite fizzy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who is growing a terminal-length beard and wants something low-priced that they can throw around.</li>
            <li> This lady will gently caress your tangles into a magnifiscent cascade, spouting forth from your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the hair and lives it shiny.  </li>
            <li> It did leave my hair feeling soft, though I experienced the same POOF after brushing my hair that other people have described.</li>
            <li> I have semi long hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li> I live in a dry northern California area and static cling is an issue.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly fine hair, and it seems to be thinning which for me at almost 25 is very upsetting to me, as well as long hair</li>
            <li> It works beautifully on my wavy mid-back length hair without causing extra frizz and takes knots out of my daughters (7 and 3 each with waist length hair) without pulling hard.</li>
            <li> the first few brushes (5stars)  makes your hair static (4stars)  </li>
            <li> Now it makes my hair soft again but it isn&#x27;t exactly what I wanted in the brush...</li>
            <li> Then a good chunk of my hairs upper layer broke off leaving me with only about 2 inches of hair at the tuff of my head in the back on this layer.</li>
            <li> My head is sensitive and this is the first brush that styles, detangles, and works without causing pain.</li>
            <li> I tried this brush while staying at my parents one night and was amazed how easily it slid through my wet hair.</li>
            <li> Since using this my hair is less frizzy, more manageable and healthier.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like the fact that it has both bristles and the plastic covered nubs.</li>
            <li> At first I was super careful</li>
            <li> I had high hopes when ordering this brush.  </li>
            <li> I found the plastic bristles a little flimsy but perhaps that&#x27;s better for your hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> The plastic bristles that stick out farther from the boar bristles which I thought would help detangle are very flimsy and bendy and don&#x27;t serve any purpose that I can see.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to replace my old plastic brush, but I find I need to keep using it to brush out the tangles</li>
            <li> I love it and cannot wait to buy some for gifts after I&#x27;ve tested this one out for a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have used this brush for a few weeks now, and I love that my hair looks healthier and shinier than before.</li>
            <li> Conair Professional Full and Mid Size Nylon Cushion Brush Set, Colors may vary]] to this flimsy thing.</li>
            <li> First off the company sent me the wrong item in the mail, couldn&#x27;t have been more different than what I&#x27;d ordered, but when I finally received the correct brush I enjoyed it at first.  </li>
            <li> I am just buying a new one - for the price</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading that these natural but firm bristle brushes are optimal for stimulating the scalp which keeps hair healthy and is preventative against balding.</li>
            <li> Now, at 51, it&#x27;s shoulder length and not so thick anymore, but I still justify the expense of a Mason Pearson brush because they work so well, feel so good and last forever</li>
            <li> At first I was disapointed, because the brush had gotten smooshed in the middle from the packaging.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it last night the plastic bristles fell out!!  </li>
            <li> It detangles without pain, and my hair feels soft after using it!</li>
            <li> I know there are several other brushes (with more boar&#x27;s hair) that I want to try, but their price makes me cringe.</li>
            <li> She also said that it helped her dry her hair faster since she could blow dry her hair while brushing without worrying about static, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Falls apart too easily making it just a waste.</li>
            <li> Brush is very gentle on my beard (which is about a foot long now).</li>
            <li> Wow -</li>
            <li> When I was young</li>
            <li> The brush just works really well and was only $15.</li>
            <li> The plastic bristles help get through the hair while the boar bristles take the natural oils from your scalp and distributes the through the rest of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I want a boar bristle brush not a everyday brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for 3 days and my hair is soooo much softer and shiny.</li>
            <li> makes your hair soft</li>
            <li> The brush was mashed into the box with another item that I purchased and some bristles were damaged, one bristle cluster was knocked out of the brush completely.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> far as helping with tangled hair&#x3D;it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way too soft to get anywhere near my scalp.  </li>
            <li> They were also frayed out like an old toothbrush when we received it.</li>
            <li> So far none of the bristles/pins have fallen out or bent.</li>
            <li> Most if stiff have nylon bristles mixed in which is not what i want in a natural brush.  </li>
            <li> Only thing it doesn&#x27;t do well is hair parting (ie if I want to move my part from the left to right side of my head or whatever), I still use a comb or my old brush for that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this would work as well for someone with thicker or curly hair since the soft bristles bend so easily</li>
            <li> I have long, straight, fine hair, and have a 6 year old with long, thick, straight hair and a VERY sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> I have the kind of hair that is hard to brush through when it&#x27;s wet, it just gets stuck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But when my current one started to wear out, after seeing the price for a new one ($113), I thought I&#x27;d shop around for something else.</li>
            <li> I see a major difference in my hair after 6 months of using it.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine but thick and this brush penetrates all the way through my hair to my scalp.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I think my hair is too fine for this type of brush; even being very gentle with totally dry hair, I was getting a lot of breakage that I don&#x27;t normally have.</li>
            <li> boar brushes were too soft, not getting through the dense hair especially when it is tangled up.  </li>
            <li> --I have owned only three Mason Pearson brushes in the past thirty five years - two full size, one travel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was a primpy little girl who wanted to sit in front of my vanity to brush my hair exactly 100 strokes.</li>
            <li> I looked long and hard to find a brush that wouldn&#x27;t tear out my thinning baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I first thought one had come out of mine when I&#x27;d been brushing, but she noticed hers was missing before removing the plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> I just can not believe that I wasted money on this for it to fall apart the first time I used it...  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> My item shipped quickly, however, it arrived with a few bristles missing (just an empty hole where a group of bristles should be) and the majority of the bristles seem to be jutting out to the right side of the brush?  </li>
            <li> are not very long</li>
            <li> The first few combs through my hair left it looking like my head had been attacked by a balloon.</li>
            <li> I live very rural so not much choice for shopping here except for that big box store.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair but due to thyroid disorder it is often falling out, brittle and gets tangled easily.  </li>
            <li> if you are interested in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this after a plastic brush of mine broke and it wasn&#x27;t too expensive, I didn&#x27;t give much thought to it.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush, the only issue is the bristles do seem to fall out, but nothing excessive.</li>
            <li> I have been growing my hair out now for about 4 years and it has gotten quite long, about mid to lower back range.</li>
            <li> I have not used this brush to actually blow out my hair, but I would be interested to try other brushes from this line (round) for that purpose.</li>
            <li> then of course it left that strange odor on my scalp, and even though it was midnight</li>
            <li> pins have small round balls at the end to ensure smoothness and no scratching to your scalp, after cleaning this brush every so often and scrubbing it with a brush cleaner (brush) many (about half) of these pins came off.</li>
            <li> gave this brush 4 stars only because when I use it to blow dry my hair the bristle cushion heats up and you can smell it.</li>
            <li> I was using a brush that had synthetic boar&#x27;s hair in it previously, and I find that the Olivia Garden brush helps the natural hair oils distribute throughout my hair better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and then I kinda got cocky and assumed my hair, having always been full and resilient to anything I did to it in the past</li>
            <li> The little rubber balls at the tops of the bristles were unexpected and not what I wanted</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a little disappointed in that respect, since it&#x27;s a good amount of money to spend on a brush you barely use.</li>
            <li> I think I will have it a long time.</li>
            <li> and if I&#x27;m correct I will have it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Now i use a softer brush to finish up with a long brushing after I use this to get all the tangles out.  </li>
            <li> It might have just been a quality control thing but there appear to be other options for the same price that might not have this problem.</li>
            <li> use it daily because there are other brushes I have discovered that I prefer to this</li>
            <li> On that note, I would like to say that amount of hair this brush claims from my head as opposed to my old hard bristle brush is next to nothing in comparison</li>
            <li> , I spent an entire hour one day with tweezers trying to pull tiny little fluff fibers out of the boar bristles and only came away with about 50% of it.  </li>
            <li> My two goals were helping her dry her hair faster and reducing static.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I blow it dry</li>
            <li> I loved this product for a few months, then the plastic balls on the end of the bristles began falling off and it scrapes my scalp and is painful to brush my hair with.  </li>
            <li> The trouble is that after 5 months, the lower boar bristles are complete engulfed in fluff and fuzz.  </li>
            <li> give this brush 3 stars because I think it is above average.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> If your hair is thin, it will probably work well for you, but sadly not me.  </li>
            <li> and I used the brush on both wet and dry hair and either way the bristles didn&#x27;t reach my scalp.  </li>
            <li> for the brush itself, I&#x27;m not sure if it is only supposed to be used on wet hair or what, but I can&#x27;t brush my hair only using that brush.</li>
            <li> The boar bristle in it stays okay, but without those nubs on the plastic bristles, it pulls the hair quite badly.</li>
            <li> I have the big round Olivia Garden too.</li>
            <li> The only thing - on both our brushes, 1 area of bristles is missing.</li>
            <li> Disappointed at how long it lasted as I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my hair</li>
            <li> With my regular rubber base paddle brush I can hear static clics when i brush my hair.</li>
            <li> (I have naturally wavy/curly hair which I color and blow out regularly, mid/long length, thin hair but a lot of it), does not seem to break my hair like other brushes, and I have noticed an improvement in shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few natural brushes, or ones advertised as such over the past few years</li>
            <li> We now have gone through 2 due to to bristle tips breaking.  </li>
            <li> I like that it isn&#x27;t extremely heave, because of the bamboo.</li>
            <li> So when I saw this, with the ionic bristles too (other reviews had said how this helped get the brush through their hair)</li>
            <li> But I will say that inconjuncition with the other reviewers I do feel that it does leave my hair softer.</li>
            <li> The price was affordable as compared to other ionic paddle brushes.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and this brush barely works on it.</li>
            <li> little while ago however, the thing cracked down the center while I was brushing my hair.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s nearly impossible to clean that stuff out</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t cost so much I&#x27;d give it to my niece to play with, but since it did cost so much, I&#x27;m going to save it until I know someone with thin hair and then awkwardly offer this to them.</li>
            <li> only complaint with this purchase was not the brush but the packaging.</li>
            <li> so I am always looking for ways to make it less frizzy, straighter and less puffy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lasted about 5 years now and is still stiff enough to brush my SO&#x27;s thick hair thoroughly.</li>
            <li> usually just brush my hair for a few seconds after I get out of the shower, and by the time I finish brushing my teeth and put on my PJs, my hair is almost 90% dry.</li>
            <li> She has long, thick hair</li>
            <li> The little wood tips started falling off in mass quantities, which is what always seems to happen with brushes - one day the bristles hurt my head</li>
            <li> For some reason, it is unable to penetrate to my scalp especially when my hair is wet.  </li>
            <li> A few months ago the plastic bristles started getting all bent out of shape, and then almost all of the tops of the bristles fell off.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for a few months now.</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for over a year now and use it a few times a week,</li>
            <li> The underside of this is not nearly as smooth.</li>
            <li> I do my daughter&#x27;s hair with it everyday.</li>
            <li> but after a few months the tips fall off the ends of the bristles and start to scrape your scalp.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s overpriced for even a wood brush and although the bristles are stiff</li>
            <li> My recommendation here would be that they retire the small ball end covers and instead just round over the ends of the pins.&lt;br /&gt;The pins</li>
            <li> my hair was very thick and very long.</li>
            <li> I have thin, dry hair.  </li>
            <li> smooths my hair as I brush, gets tangles out with less breakage and no static!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;She was a little worried that this brush wouldn&#x27;t get through her thick hair, but it was not an issue.</li>
            <li> going off why this brush would not work well with thick hair is that the pins bend and get deformed a little too</li>
            <li> No more tears.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this is.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for the past three years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this is, I don&#x27;t roll about in the lint trap of my clothes dryer</li>
            <li> Not sure what to do about that.</li>
            <li> The little bulb on the end fell off, making those bristles very sharp and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I read a bunch of reviews for brushes and was having a hard time - I eventually settled on this brush because of the price and the talk about bristles adding shine to your hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations as I have been disappointed by</li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t brush all the way through my fairly thick hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bamboo base, it is wood feeling but much lighter weight.</li>
            <li> and I think this brush would not work well with thick</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after a couple months, we lost some of the heads of the plastic bristles... making it pretty painful to brush.</li>
            <li> However, I have very thick, dense,  wavy hair, and this brush couldn&#x27;t get much past the surface:  </li>
            <li> the price is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Now having it for just a short while almost all the tips on the bristles have fallen off which has made it impossible to continue using it as it scratches my scalp.</li>
            <li> If only it lasted.  :(</li>
            <li> I recommend if you are looking for a wooden paddle brush to check that out, you will not be disappointed as all the flaws with this brush I have pointed out here are corrected on that brush.</li>
            <li> and I was exhausted from working all day</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend who is growing out his thick hair, so it was absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> The nylon bristles on this brush are very thin and do not even reach the scalp through my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this brush.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I got paranoid after this.</li>
            <li> It works on ALL hair types so you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just an expensive hairbrush.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed when I tried it.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this brush :(</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m usually disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Everything about it is worthless</li>
            <li> the base and the rubber brush have held up well to washings&lt;</li>
            <li> I hate the statics.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this brush!! Wow - I see a major difference in my hair after 6 months of using it. And it&#x27;s easy to clean, sturdy, and feels good on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Very comfy. I love this brush. I have the big round Olivia Garden too.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Mason Pearson nylon and boar bristle brush user for decades, using them exclusively, because I&#x27;ve never found a brush I like as well, but I&#x27;m switching my allegiance to this bamboo brush. When I was young my hair was very thick and very long. Now, at 51, it&#x27;s shoulder length and not so thick anymore, but I still justify the expense of a Mason Pearson brush because they work so well, feel so good and last forever--I have owned only three Mason Pearson brushes in the past thirty five years - two full size, one travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when my current one started to wear out, after seeing the price for a new one ($113), I thought I&#x27;d shop around for something else. This Olivia Garden brush seemed like a good contender with the combination of boar bristle and wooden pin bristles, and besides, it&#x27;s $100 cheaper! I didn&#x27;t have high expectations as I have been disappointed by cheap Mason Pearson copy cats that scratched my scalp, pulled my hair, or fell apart, and I&#x27;d always return to the Mason Pearson. It really is fantastic. Still, loyal as I am, the price is painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was thrilled to discover that this Olivia Garden brush (the Ionic Combo paddle version) is, in my opinion, even better than my beloved Mason Pearson. The wood pin bristles feel wonderful on my scalp (way better than nylon), the boar bristles smooth and sleeken my hair, and together they de-tangle without yanking or scratching. I find myself brushing with it just because it feels so good. It&#x27;s wonderfully lightweight. Plus I like the bamboo versus plastic. I&#x27;m buying five more of these brushes as presents for my sister, nieces and daughter, all of whom have also been Mason Pearson addicts. It remains to be seen how well they last compared to the Mason Pearson brush, but hey, you could buy eight of these for the price of one Mason Pearson brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Pearson brush fan, and I have even bought a Dollar Store brush out of curiosity. I now have this brush.  Where has this brush been all my life? Why have I spent my money on a MP brush, when this is actually better.  I think I will have it a long time. Quality Brush. The design is nice,  and it&#x27;s pretty to look at.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing.  It never hurts.  I can brush my kiddos hair without any tears or fussing.  We have 6 because we won&#x27;t use anything else.  Seriously!</li>
            <li> I am VERY happy with this brush. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for and the company I got it from got it to me amazingly fast</li>
            <li> Combines best of boar bristle and paddle brush. It works beautifully on my wavy mid-back length hair without causing extra frizz and takes knots out of my daughters (7 and 3 each with waist length hair) without pulling hard. This brush really does make getting ready in the morning easier.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this brush.  I found that it REALLY increases static, and the wood pins are way too flimsy.  They won&#x27;t brush all the way through my fairly thick hair.  I have had bamboo brushes before that I&#x27;ve liked and was excited to find this combo brush.  I was extremely disappointed when I tried it.</li>
            <li> This was a great brush.  I liked the ionic bristles for the scalp massage and the boar bristles made my coat nice and shiny.  Eventually the knobs on the plastic bristles fell off and it got really scratchy.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order another one on the chance it does it again.  It might have just been a quality control thing but there appear to be other options for the same price that might not have this problem.</li>
            <li> I live very rural so not much choice for shopping here except for that big box store. All they had available in hair brushes was made from China and nothing nice either. So  I shopped here and just love this brush. The shipper is also very fast and I appreciated the free shipping. I have fine hair and this brush is perfect for my hair and my scalp feels so good too.</li>
            <li> I looked long and hard to find a brush that wouldn&#x27;t tear out my thinning baby fine hair.  Read lots of great reviews about the quality of this brand, that it compared to another that was many times the price.  I just don&#x27;t want my remaining hair pulled out.  I picked a good one, as I can brush and brush, with only normal hair shedding.  Really pleased with the product and the price could not be beat.</li>
            <li> My wife and kids love these!  Doesn&#x27;t pull their hair the way traditional brushes do.  We now have gone through 2 due to to bristle tips breaking.  Got about 2 years out of them.  Just bought 3 more.  One for each of them!</li>
            <li> The little rubber balls at the tops of the bristles were unexpected and not what I wanted so I returned it immediately.</li>
            <li> I have the kind of hair that is hard to brush through when it&#x27;s wet, it just gets stuck. I tried this brush while staying at my parents one night and was amazed how easily it slid through my wet hair. I couldn&#x27;t believe it so I bought one the next day and have used it ever since. I bought a second one for travel but noticed that many of the bristle knobs fell off while packed in my suitcase. I don&#x27;t find that it&#x27;s anti-static like it claims as I still have issues with that but I still really like this brush because of how easily it slides through my hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased for one of our grand-daughters for Christmas. She had used it at the home of another grand-daughter and love it so much as it didn&#x27;t pull her long hair when brushing. No more tears.</li>
            <li> So much for \\&quot;eco.\\&quot; Out of the package, the brush smelled like it was made by slave labor in a third world country. You know what I&#x27;m talking about... the smell of Dollar Stores and Walmart toy aisles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried rinsing it to remove the smell, boy was that a mistake, because then my whole bathroom smelled -- somewhere between scorched plastic and singed hair. I quit smoking 3 years ago, so my sense of smell has increased tenfold by now. But even with a cigarette burning between my lips, I don&#x27;t think you could NOT notice the smell of cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I figured, I might as well try it out. But who is this brush made for? Homer Simpsons and Charlie Browns? I have fine straight hair and the bristles were barely strong enough to graze over my head. A cat&#x27;s tongue would have created more pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then of course it left that strange odor on my scalp, and even though it was midnight and I was exhausted from working all day, I couldn&#x27;t sleep like that, so I had to shower before bed, the shower was really nice, highly recommend a hot shower before bed. Not the brush though. Forget this brush. Everything about it is worthless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have gone with the pricier Widu, those Germans know all about eco and fine engineering... even in a hair brush probably.</li>
            <li> This is the first boar bristle brush I have ever owned.  I like this brush, but the boar bristles fall out pretty easy, but it leaves my hair soft.  I like that it isn&#x27;t extremely heave, because of the bamboo.</li>
            <li> I almost never use brushes (I use combs because they detangle better). But I LOVE this brush, the bristles are soft and short and spread oil down the length of the hair wonderfully. But what I really like is that there is a nylon (I think they&#x27;re nylon) bristle in each \\&quot;patch\\&quot; of bristles which helps it detangle quickly and easily. My hair is fine and straight. I&#x27;m not sure if this would work as well for someone with thicker or curly hair since the soft bristles bend so easily but I highly recommend for those with fine straight hair like mine! I hope that helps! :)</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this brush!!!  Quality.  Gentle. Even with my fine, curly/wavy hair.  Salons sell Olivia Garden brushes.  Prices on Amazon are much more reasonable.  I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> This is the best brush I have ever owned and have no more interest in combs and such.  I bought this after reading that these natural but firm bristle brushes are optimal for stimulating the scalp which keeps hair healthy and is preventative against balding.</li>
            <li> Best brush in the world. Doesnt rip hair out, leaves it silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my wife. She has long, thick hair and I was on a quest to help her with getting ready in the morning. My two goals were helping her dry her hair faster and reducing static.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush just works. She intentionally tried to make her hair staticky (is that a word) and she couldn&#x27;t. She loved that. She also said that it helped her dry her hair faster since she could blow dry her hair while brushing without worrying about static, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was a little worried that this brush wouldn&#x27;t get through her thick hair, but it was not an issue. The brush just works really well and was only $15.</li>
            <li> So far this brush is great! It is well made and if I&#x27;m correct I will have it for a long time. It&#x27;s a pretty brush too. The striped bamboo is neat and the back of the paddle has a beautiful stamp that looks like it is wood burned. The plastic bristles help get through the hair while the boar bristles take the natural oils from your scalp and distributes the through the rest of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion it is a great price for this type of brush. I will be ordering one of these for my daughter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this brush 4 stars only because when I use it to blow dry my hair the bristle cushion heats up and you can smell it. But there isn&#x27;t an odor otherwise.</li>
            <li> Falls apart too easily making it just a waste. I was hoping for quality as this line wishes to portray.</li>
            <li> I loved this brush when It was new, even my granddaughter who is two and hates her hair being brushed liked this brush. That is for the first month then the tips over the end fell off and it became torture to use this brush after two months all the tips were gone and this brush is in the trash.</li>
            <li> Was looking for the bristle brushes, but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot.  This one works great.  I particularly like the fact that it has both bristles and the plastic covered nubs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for almost a year. A few months ago the plastic bristles started getting all bent out of shape, and then almost all of the tops of the bristles fell off. It hurt to brush my hair, and after a couple weeks the brush started doing actual damage to my hair. I finally took out scissors today and cut off all the plastic bristles so now it&#x27;s just a boar bristle brush. Now it makes my hair soft again but it isn&#x27;t exactly what I wanted in the brush... another brush I have (Goodys) I have had for 5 years and it&#x27;s still great. Disappointed in this brush :(</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and was told that boars hair would be the best brush for me. I remembered my Dad having one, and it would just brush over the top. So when I saw this, with the ionic bristles too (other reviews had said how this helped get the brush through their hair), figured I&#x27;d try it. Well, it is so awesome! Love the way it goes through my hair, and it is like getting a scalp massage, as another reviewer had said. I was going on and on about it with a friend, and she was interested, so had one sent to her - and she also loves it!! Also I never get static electricity from it!! (Was always a problem). The only thing - on both our brushes, 1 area of bristles is missing. I first thought one had come out of mine when I&#x27;d been brushing, but she noticed hers was missing before removing the plastic wrap. Not sure why this is. (Why I owas tempted to give 4 stars instead of 5, but I love it too much!). This is the best brush I have ever used!! My husband commented on how shiny my hair has been - haven&#x27;t done anything else differently, but know I am brushing my hair more as it feels so good!! You will not be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> At first I was disapointed, because the brush had gotten smooshed in the middle from the packaging. I was able to bend the bristles back up, so it works fine. I had a big knot in my hair, and it was able to get most of it out with no problem. Impressive!</li>
            <li> ***UPDATE 2/20/2012*** I have used this brush for a few months now. And while it lasted it was a great brush.&lt;br /&gt;A little while ago however, the thing cracked down the center while I was brushing my hair. Now it \\&quot;still works\\&quot; for the most part but the rubber tip on the end of the bristles has worn away so much its unusable without pain. It scrapes my scalp with each comb. Great for a little while then goes caput on you. I have a brush that has lasted me since I was child. The thing is most likley 24 years old. But I want a boar bristle brush not a everyday brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting great things from my first boar hair/ ionic bristle combo brush. I am not going to rate this anything lower than a 4 as I do not think its the brush&#x27;s fault, but it says that its anti static. The first few combs through my hair left it looking like my head had been attacked by a balloon. I however will not discredit this brush, as I have used ionic brushes before that claimed to be anti static and it did the same thing. So it&#x27;s quite possible I just have hair that is that unruly. But I will say that inconjuncition with the other reviewers I do feel that it does leave my hair softer. My boyfriend even complimented on it&#x27;s ability to smooth out his hair which my old brushes never did very well. I like the design of the brush and its the same size as my old brush which is perfect for my hair which is about 3/4 back length about 4 inches from bottom of pants. I have incredibly fine hair, and it seems to be thinning which for me at almost 25 is very upsetting to me, as well as long hair so I am trying to take better care of my hair and scalp to try and regain the hair I seem to be losing. On that note, I would like to say that amount of hair this brush claims from my head as opposed to my old hard bristle brush is next to nothing in comparison so I very happy with that. Only reason I gave this 4 stars was the static thing. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me but it&#x27;s not anti static for me. But I can smooth it out so its not a deal breaker.oth it out so its not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> I love it. I am about to buy 4 more as presents.</li>
            <li> Feels very nice on my scalp with massaging bristles and makes my hair very smooth. Good for the planet earth. :)</li>
            <li> This is the best investment I&#x27;ve ever made. I&#x27;ve only had it for 3 days and my hair is soooo much softer and shiny. After blow drying I use this brush and it smooths it out so well I don&#x27;t even use my straightener anymore! Worth buying 100%</li>
            <li> I have semi long hair that tangles easily and I absolutely loved this brush. Even my 4yo loved it. Unfortunately after a couple months, we lost some of the heads of the plastic bristles... making it pretty painful to brush. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> What can I say? It&#x27;s a nice hairbrush. The hand is a nice size and shape and the natural bristle to plastic bristle ratio is perfect.</li>
            <li> feels very smooth on the hair, could have longer bristles though, and I have fine hair!!</li>
            <li> I have always bought regular brushes from grocery stores or the pharmacy, but after reading an article about thinning hair in women, the boars-hair brush was recommended so I tried it.  It is gentle, doesn&#x27;t tug, and makes hair shinier.  I will continue to use this brush and/or boar-hair brushes.</li>
            <li> This brush feels really good on my scalp, detangles gently, and makes my hair look shiny and fall nicely, but my hair still gets a bit staticky on occasion when using it. I bought a humidifier and Alterna&#x27;s dry hail oil for the static. Still a better brush than I have ever owned before.</li>
            <li> A lot of people swear by boar bristle brushes, and I thought I&#x27;d give one a shot. I like that this one has the longer bristles for detangling as well. Unfortunately, I think my hair is too fine for this type of brush; even being very gentle with totally dry hair, I was getting a lot of breakage that I don&#x27;t normally have. The brush itself is solidly constructed, and it may be great for someone with coarser hair, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for everyone.</li>
            <li> What can I say, I like the look, it works</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and this brush barely works on it. I have to go over the same piece of hair several times before it&#x27;s actually thoroughly brushed. That&#x27;d be okay if this were 1900 and I was a primpy little girl who wanted to sit in front of my vanity to brush my hair exactly 100 strokes. But it&#x27;s not and I&#x27;m not and I don&#x27;t. If it didn&#x27;t cost so much I&#x27;d give it to my niece to play with, but since it did cost so much, I&#x27;m going to save it until I know someone with thin hair and then awkwardly offer this to them.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend loved it(5stars)  makes your hair soft the first few brushes (5stars)  makes your hair static (4stars)  my girl would not shut up about how soft it is quotes: my hair feels so good, feels like clouds Great brush  Shipping FAST</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because I wanted a boar bristle brush but I like the feel of the plastic bristle on my scalp.  The first time I used it last night the plastic bristles fell out!!  THE FIRST TIME I USED IT!  I just can not believe that I wasted money on this for it to fall apart the first time I used it...  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Fell apart quickly, especially the plastic bits. The little bulb on the end fell off, making those bristles very sharp and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> My wife, my mother-in-law and my sister are all completely in love with this brush. Feels nice on the scalp, hair is very silky. Amazing.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased this brush and I&#x27;d never used a boar bristle brush before. I&#x27;ve always used plastic, inexpensive brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I love love love the bamboo construction. I want bamboo everything from now on-- very strong and very beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;As for the brush itself, I&#x27;m not sure if it is only supposed to be used on wet hair or what, but I can&#x27;t brush my hair only using that brush. Maybe it&#x27;s meant for thinner hair, but I like to feel the brush actually detangling my hair, and with this brush I just felt like it was gliding on the surface. The plastic bristles that stick out farther from the boar bristles which I thought would help detangle are very flimsy and bendy and don&#x27;t serve any purpose that I can see.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to replace my old plastic brush, but I find I need to keep using it to brush out the tangles and then just use this new brush at the end to smooth down any static. So I&#x27;m a little disappointed in that respect, since it&#x27;s a good amount of money to spend on a brush you barely use.</li>
            <li> I loved this product for a few months, then the plastic balls on the end of the bristles began falling off and it scrapes my scalp and is painful to brush my hair with.  Disappointed at how long it lasted as I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my hair and it felt very healthy since using.  If only it lasted.  :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few natural brushes, or ones advertised as such over the past few years and I&#x27;m usually disappointed.  I have thick hair but due to thyroid disorder it is often falling out, brittle and gets tangled easily.  I use organic shampoos and soaps, some I make myself and it bothers me to brush my hair and scalp with nylon and plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most boar brushes were too soft, not getting through the dense hair especially when it is tangled up.  Most if stiff have nylon bristles mixed in which is not what i want in a natural brush.  One plastic one I had that worked well had stiff plastic bristles that were surrounded by softer nylon ones and now I am so happy to find a natural version!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smooths my hair as I brush, gets tangles out with less breakage and no static!  I love it and loving it encourages me to brush more often for healthy scalp and to redistribute the oils.  Now i use a softer brush to finish up with a long brushing after I use this to get all the tangles out.  I love it and cannot wait to buy some for gifts after I&#x27;ve tested this one out for a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is comfortable and made of bamboo.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I have been growing my hair out now for about 4 years and it has gotten quite long, about mid to lower back range. I recently got the bright idea to start bleaching said hair blonde even though I&#x27;m a brunette. At first I was super careful and then I kinda got cocky and assumed my hair, having always been full and resilient to anything I did to it in the past, was just gonna be ok. Then a good chunk of my hairs upper layer broke off leaving me with only about 2 inches of hair at the tuff of my head in the back on this layer. Needless to say I got paranoid after this. Bought this brush as one of the many things I switched, and love it! It detangles without pain, and my hair feels soft after using it! Love it! Only thing it doesn&#x27;t do well is hair parting (ie if I want to move my part from the left to right side of my head or whatever), I still use a comb or my old brush for that. But for just brushing nightly or detangling I love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for its anti-static properties. It is a pretty brush and I was really looking forward to using it. I live in a dry northern California area and static cling is an issue. With my regular rubber base paddle brush I can hear static clics when i brush my hair. However when I applied this brush my hair actually stood out like when you rub your head with a balloon! My hair had never done that before -I do not recommend this if you are looking for a static free brush.</li>
            <li> Great brush.  My grandaughter is enjoying it.  I was surprised how strong &amp; durable this brush is.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a soft and easy hairbrush. This is it. I have super thick hair and this brush is great for it.</li>
            <li> I have big, frizzy hair.  I dye it, I blow it dry and I straighten it so I am always looking for ways to make it less frizzy, straighter and less puffy.  I&#x27;ve always thought I needed more product or if that didn&#x27;t work, better product.  I have switched shampoos, conditioners, frizz serums, hair straighteners and nothing worked.  Who knew the solution was a hair brush? I have used the same hair brush for about 15 years never thinking it was part of the reason why my hair was so frizzy.  After using this hair brush for one day, my husband asked me what I had done to my hair.  He never notices anything unless I tell him.  Since using this my hair is less frizzy, more manageable and healthier.  Does it still get frizzy?  Yes, but it is 10x better.  Do I still use product?  Of course, the product helps smooth out my hair.  Will I ever be without this hair brush?  Never.</li>
            <li> First off I purchased the large paddle brush so this review applies to that if you are interested in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this after a plastic brush of mine broke and it wasn&#x27;t too expensive, I didn&#x27;t give much thought to it. I have had this brush for over a year now and use it a few times a week, I don;t use it daily because there are other brushes I have discovered that I prefer to this one.&lt;br /&gt;Things I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;Large paddle size, great for longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;Bamboo base, it is wood feeling but much lighter weight. I personally prefer actual wood.&lt;br /&gt;Both the base and the rubber brush have held up well to washings&lt;br /&gt;It is good for styling and can be around heat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things that need improvement&lt;br /&gt;The pins have small round balls at the end to ensure smoothness and no scratching to your scalp, after cleaning this brush every so often and scrubbing it with a brush cleaner (brush) many (about half) of these pins came off. The underside of this is not nearly as smooth. My recommendation here would be that they retire the small ball end covers and instead just round over the ends of the pins.&lt;br /&gt;The pins are not very long and I think this brush would not work well with thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also going off why this brush would not work well with thick hair is that the pins bend and get deformed a little too easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this brush 3 stars because I think it is above average. However I only give it three stars because there are much better brushes you can buy. I am completely in love with my Aveda wooden paddle brush. The best place to buy this brush is off Aveda&#x27;s website and it is $20 plus a little for shipping. I recommend if you are looking for a wooden paddle brush to check that out, you will not be disappointed as all the flaws with this brush I have pointed out here are corrected on that brush. It works on ALL hair types so you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I tried this brush today for the first time - bought it as a companion piece for my first ceramic ion blowdryer.  I have thick hair and I used the brush on both wet and dry hair and either way the bristles didn&#x27;t reach my scalp.  In my opinion, the bristles are too short.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, it&#x27;s very pretty...if it works for you.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  I&#x27;ve had Mason Pearson brushes &amp; while they are nice...the price is ridiculous.  This brush is lovely.  I do my daughter&#x27;s hair with it everyday.</li>
            <li> Great brush in the beginning but after a few months the tips fall off the ends of the bristles and start to scrape your scalp.  I&#x27;ve bought two of these and it happened to both of them.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for the past three years And I love it. I have long, straight, fine hair, and have a 6 year old with long, thick, straight hair and a VERY sensitive scalp. I&#x27;ve tried every kind of detangling brush there is, but this is the ONLY one she lets touch her head. It does feel very nice and gentle, is beautiful to look at and -very important for fine hair- never causes static.</li>
            <li> I was on the hunt for a great brush with boar bristles. At first this brush seemed great! Now having it for just a short while almost all the tips on the bristles have fallen off which has made it impossible to continue using it as it scratches my scalp. I would not recommend or order again.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.  I haven&#x27;t used it enough yet to say I love it but it does feel good when I brush my long, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love the boar bristle brushes and how good they are for your hair, but they don&#x27;t get all the way through my thick mane!  This brush is the perfect compromise for getting the best of both worlds!!!  The boar bristles leave your hair luxurious and silky, the man made bristles allow for fuller heads of hair to be completely brushed out, from roots to tips.  Handle is sturdy bamboo and the bristle pad is well installed, not one of those pads that falls out all the time!</li>
            <li> Love this brush - the instant I started to use it I knew it was for me. The wood-tip bristles in between the boar&#x27;s bristles are so much more comfortable on my head than regular nylon. Glad I found this one!  Update: I am replacing this brush after about 9 months after ordering the first one. The little wood tips started falling off in mass quantities, which is what always seems to happen with brushes - one day the bristles hurt my head and I knew it was time to retire the original. However, I liked it so much I am just buying a new one - for the price, it&#x27;s still a good deal, just didn&#x27;t last as long as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! The combination of boar and manufactured bristles is just perfect for my hair. My hair is fine but thick and this brush penetrates all the way through my hair to my scalp. The brush really makes my hair shine and I love using it.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint with this purchase was not the brush but the packaging. The brush was mashed into the box with another item that I purchased and some bristles were damaged, one bristle cluster was knocked out of the brush completely.</li>
            <li> This brush is excellent. It&#x27;s attractive and well-made, comfortable to grip. Easy to clean. Doesn&#x27;t seem to break my hair when I comb. Makes my hair really soft. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush due to the high amount of good reviews.  My item shipped quickly, however, it arrived with a few bristles missing (just an empty hole where a group of bristles should be) and the majority of the bristles seem to be jutting out to the right side of the brush?  I&#x27;m assuming this is an isolated incident.  I&#x27;ll make the most of it!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes when ordering this brush.  Sounded great with the combined bristles, pegs and cushion (a hard to find combination), however it is just not working for me.  I have fine, but thicker hair.  For some reason, it is unable to penetrate to my scalp especially when my hair is wet.  If your hair is thin, it will probably work well for you, but sadly not me.  I gave it three stars for having all the elements needed in a good brush.</li>
            <li> Posted from my husband&#x27;s perspective: As a man who has a history of thinning hair, I take great care of my hair. I really like this brush because it adds shine to my hair. I was using a brush that had synthetic boar&#x27;s hair in it previously, and I find that the Olivia Garden brush helps the natural hair oils distribute throughout my hair better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually just brush my hair for a few seconds after I get out of the shower, and by the time I finish brushing my teeth and put on my PJs, my hair is almost 90% dry. I do believe that is helps speed up the drying time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this brush for a few weeks now, and I love that my hair looks healthier and shinier than before. I know there are several other brushes (with more boar&#x27;s hair) that I want to try, but their price makes me cringe. Paying $17.50 for this brush was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Wow this brush is great! I&#x27;m returning the Goody boar large paddle brush at Target! Love this brush much better!</li>
            <li> It works great as a brush and it has a nice weight. The wood is pretty but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s natural wood.&lt;br /&gt;As far as helping with tangled hair&#x3D;it dosen&#x27;t. It&#x27;s overpriced for even a wood brush and although the bristles are stiff it&#x27;s just an expensive hairbrush.</li>
            <li> This brush works really well on my hair, which is curly and quite fizzy. But, the plastic nubs that cover the plastic bristles come off after 6 - 8 months or so. The boar bristle in it stays okay, but without those nubs on the plastic bristles, it pulls the hair quite badly. This is my second brush of this kind. Again, it&#x27;s really great until the plastic wears off, so it doesn&#x27;t last very long for the price.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush, the only issue is the bristles do seem to fall out, but nothing excessive.</li>
            <li> Brush is very gentle on my beard (which is about a foot long now). The quality of the wood seems decent, the price is very reasonable, and the product arrives as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who is growing a terminal-length beard and wants something low-priced that they can throw around. No need to buy Mason Pearson, beard bros. This lady will gently caress your tangles into a magnifiscent cascade, spouting forth from your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that I won&#x27;t experience statics with this comb but I still did. It&#x27;s a well made and beautiful comb but not for me. I hate the statics. The only kind of comb that did not induce any statics is my ox horn one.</li>
            <li> Beautiful brush and has so much cool tech, bamboo, cushion, wood bristle and feels amazing. It&#x27;s also easy to clean</li>
            <li> I have thin, dry hair.  It is gentle on the hair and lives it shiny.  The price was affordable as compared to other ionic paddle brushes.</li>
            <li> This was great for 3 weeks, until the plastic yellow bits on the ends of the bristles came off and scratched the heck out of my scalp. just no.</li>
            <li> My head is sensitive and this is the first brush that styles, detangles, and works without causing pain. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> First off the company sent me the wrong item in the mail, couldn&#x27;t have been more different than what I&#x27;d ordered, but when I finally received the correct brush I enjoyed it at first.  I found the plastic bristles a little flimsy but perhaps that&#x27;s better for your hair and scalp.  It did leave my hair feeling soft, though I experienced the same POOF after brushing my hair that other people have described. The trouble is that after 5 months, the lower boar bristles are complete engulfed in fluff and fuzz.  I&#x27;m not sure why this is, I don&#x27;t roll about in the lint trap of my clothes dryer and I haven&#x27;t been using this to brush my carpet.  And it&#x27;s nearly impossible to clean that stuff out, I spent an entire hour one day with tweezers trying to pull tiny little fluff fibers out of the boar bristles and only came away with about 50% of it.  Not sure what to do about that.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful brush to look at, and appears to be well make.  However, I have very thick, dense,  wavy hair, and this brush couldn&#x27;t get much past the surface:  it&#x27;s way too soft to get anywhere near my scalp.  I gave it my my neighbor&#x27;s 8 year old, who has fine, not-too-thick hair, and she&#x27;s delighted with it.  I ordered the Ambassador Oval Oak Handle Hairbrush ([...]), a boar and nylon bristle brush, and it arrived today.  Handle is smaller, and so isn&#x27;t as comfortable in my hand as this one (I have large hands) but the bristles are much stiffer, it gets down to my scalp with ease, so the Ambassador is a much better choice for someone with my kind of hair.</li>
            <li> The nylon bristles on this brush are very thin and do not even reach the scalp through my thin hair. I purchased this for my boyfriend who is growing out his thick hair, so it was absolutely useless. The boar bristles are too short and just skim over the top layer of hair. They were also frayed out like an old toothbrush when we received it. Overall, I prefer my [[ASIN:B001T8S7T8 Conair Professional Full and Mid Size Nylon Cushion Brush Set, Colors may vary]] to this flimsy thing. It&#x27;s lasted about 5 years now and is still stiff enough to brush my SO&#x27;s thick hair thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I read a bunch of reviews for brushes and was having a hard time - I eventually settled on this brush because of the price and the talk about bristles adding shine to your hair. The brush is very gentle on hair (I have naturally wavy/curly hair which I color and blow out regularly, mid/long length, thin hair but a lot of it), does not seem to break my hair like other brushes, and I have noticed an improvement in shine. So far none of the bristles/pins have fallen out or bent. I have not used this brush to actually blow out my hair, but I would be interested to try other brushes from this line (round) for that purpose.</li>
