            <li>Considering the price of the eyeliner, the quality is very good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good with blending, but I recommend not using the applicator it comes with.</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>I use the brush that came with it for my lower lid as it is not the best of brushes but does a great job of blending on the lower lids.  </li>
            <li>This eyeliner is great.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s okay not that great.</li>
            <li>This product is nice.</li>
            <li>But the product I liked.</li>
            <li>Great color, took me a minute to learn a technique for it, but great overall.</li>
            <li>The color is great but the cheap applicator brush they provided doesn&#x27;t allow for smooth application of the liner.</li>
            <li>it came quick ,must have !!</li>
            <li>My friend love this product and it does work</li>
            <li>I love the cream eyeliner so much better.  </li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>It felt more like a melted crayon.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is just ok.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love gel eye liner, but not this one.  </li>
            <li>and you can do better</li>
            <li>Buy a better one than the plastic brush they give you.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the gel liner.  </li>
            <li>is better to buy the Bobbi brown</li>
            <li>Но могу точно сказать не разочаровали все подошло и понравилось-:)</li>
            <li>I tried to apply it over my eyeshadow for a more defined liner look an d</li>
            <li>very excited to use all the timetime</li>
            <li>It took a while to dry, which ruined my perfect eyeshadow when I sneezed.  </li>
            <li>Good product, and fast shipping</li>
            <li>Easy to put on...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use for beginners or pros.</li>
            <li>Sephora brand is ok but Buxom and Smashbox are great and will be my next buy!</li>
            <li>This one works fine, easy to remove too.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>light oily like liner.</li>
            <li>But it is cheap</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I was NOT disappointed.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t create a clean line - it&#x27;s all smudged and blurry.</li>
            <li>I love the color of the product and the smooth gliding gel goes on so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, I just wish mine would&#x27;ve had more of a creamier consistency like the black, the purple and the punk purple have.</li>
            <li>First, it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy and spreadable and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>really great for the price even more than another that i proved and more expensive, i really like it.</li>
            <li>but luckily i had another angle eyeliner brush that worked out  for me very well!</li>
            <li>Right now, it&#x27;s just not optimal.</li>
            <li>I apply eyeshadow and all that to my eyes before eye liner and I must say it takes few coats of this liner in order to get a good bold line on my lid.</li>
            <li>When I try to put more on to cover the bare spots it just moves the product out of the way leaving more bare spots.</li>
            <li>think if I dry it out a bit more, the color might concentrate and the consistency might become more normal.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine if you are okay with putting in a little work to get the bold line your are expecting.</li>
            <li>It took only a couple days to ship it, and when I applied it in the morning before going to work, it went on very smooth.</li>
            <li>been using this liner on a daily basis..goes on very smooth and stays in place all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid ELF lover</li>
            <li>Took it into the bath and looked at it under natural light</li>
            <li>I think NYX has better options for similar price points, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one to anyone.</li>
            <li>no messy clean up and the brush is very convenient to.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s great combined with a dark blue shadow for a smoky eye).</li>
            <li>I was looking around for a new eyeline and this is not the one!!</li>
            <li>New to cream liners, I tried this because the price was right</li>
            <li>The applicator is tiny and doesn&#x27;t really apply the eyeliner smoothly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very dissapointed</li>
            <li>so it really surprises me when I find something from their lines that I really don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>You have to set or seal them really well</li>
            <li>This is a very creamy eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>I was constantly loading the brush because it would apply too lightly.  </li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t even stick it smears to much.</li>
            <li>I really like elf products</li>
            <li>That said, I STILL paid too much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is the cheap kind i only used it a few times&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Highly recommend seller!</li>
            <li>My fav eyeliner, long wearing and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m gonna try it alone as a liner and see if it works better, but it does smudge easily if its not dry, can be messy</li>
            <li>Nice little brush that comes with the eyeliner too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so creamy that when I first opened it up, I made the mistake of sinking my brush too far into the pot.  </li>
            <li>I have bought several of these liquid eye liners in many different colors.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this color because it looked like it would be a very pretty almost-black blue.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too old to wear those pretty colors that the young fashionistas (models, teenagers and 20 somethings) wear and what I wore when I was that age</li>
            <li>Never been able to use it, waste of money.</li>
            <li>When they are new and you start to use them, they are alright.</li>
            <li>My only compliant is that it&#x27;s also very small compared to the photo, but a good deal considering</li>
            <li>Easy to apply with the little angled brush that&#x27;s included and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner glides on smoothly and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really more of a black with a hint of blue if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li>It smudges and looks like a cheap mess, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I will say that I got my eyeliner in midnight directly from the ELF website and not from Amazon.</li>
            <li>The midnight is a great dark blue and makes my green eyes pop!</li>
            <li>No matter how many brushes I tried, it comes out translucent and barely dark grey,</li>
            <li>Looks great behind a set a falsies!!  </li>
            <li>I only apply liner to my top lashline usually.  </li>
            <li>The line was not bold, despite adequate product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several times with the exact same result.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this, but it is a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s kinda of hard to smooth on</li>
            <li>Barely goes on</li>
            <li>you can barely see it.</li>
            <li>It is possible to get a nice thick dark line, but it takes some work.</li>
            <li>and I could barely see the blue.</li>

            <li> It is possible to get a nice thick dark line, but it takes some work.</li>
            <li> and I could barely see the blue.</li>
            <li> I am literally able to turn the jar upside down and it drops into my hand as a little dried up nugget of product.</li>
            <li> My major issue with it was that it was very dry when I got it.</li>
            <li> They last a very, very long time.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t long before this product was somehow smeared underneath my eyes, and all bunched up into my creases.  </li>
            <li> I use it with a different brush than the one it came with, also I wet it a bit .</li>
            <li> Product was old dried up</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s much harder than any regular eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long to arrive.</li>
            <li> stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> One might be forgiven for thinking it will be similar to other cream eyeliners, but it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> They dry out and pull from the sides of the container.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I like to line on the heavy side with a deep red lip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really liked E.L.F. products but was really disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> Not too dry, didnt crumble or flake off!</li>
            <li> Although I did not spend much on this product, I thought it was extremely weak.</li>
            <li> I opened this up under artificial light (yellow) and it looked black.</li>
            <li> It clumps on it and the bristles are extremely rough on skin.</li>
            <li> I bought the black and the grey</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> However, the blue color is very dark and comes off almost black -</li>
            <li> Feels like imitation</li>
            <li> They also dry up within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t go on well, the pigment was really weak, and instead of setting up like other gel eye liners do this one stayed moist and soft.  </li>
            <li> Because it was so dry, I got little black specks in my eyes when I tried to apply it.</li>
            <li> wasnt mad because it was so cheap, but dont waste any of your money on this.</li>

            <li> I had little black flakes under my eyes before I&#x27;d even finished doing the rest of my makeup.  Proceed with caution</li>
            <li> Really great eyeliner! Not too dry, didnt crumble or flake off! Very smooth beautiful application!</li>
            <li> My friend love this product and it does work it came quick ,must have !!</li>
            <li> light oily like liner. Feels like imitation</li>
            <li> First, it arrived very quickly. I love the brush that came with it; it can give you a perfect tip if you have precision. I did however buy an actual eyeliner brush to be precautionary. I would definitely recommend it to a friend</li>
            <li> Product is excellent...</li>
            <li> Although I did not spend much on this product, I thought it was extremely weak. The liner was thin and did not apply black, but translucent.</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of 3 dollars.... It&#x27;s not worth it&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner comes out horrible&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very dissapointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid ELF lover so it really surprises me when I find something from their lines that I really don&#x27;t like. These cream eye liners are one of the duds they carry. I&#x27;ve tried them in about 5 shades and all of them have had the same issue. When they are new and you start to use them, they are alright. You have to set or seal them really well or they smudge almost immediately. Unless that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for. They also dry up within a few weeks. Even with them stored properly and kept covered. They dry out and pull from the sides of the container. I am literally able to turn the jar upside down and it drops into my hand as a little dried up nugget of product. Try something else. :(</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is terrible.  I only apply liner to my top lashline usually.  It wasn&#x27;t long before this product was somehow smeared underneath my eyes, and all bunched up into my creases.  It&#x27;s a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is great.  Easy to put on...and it stays on...  I only wish that there was a case for the brush.</li>
            <li> Before using cream eyeliner by elf I had only used pencils.  I love the cream eyeliner so much better.  There is less smudging the color is vibrant and it&#x27;s easy to use.  I will never use a eyeliner pencil again.  I love this product</li>
            <li> This one works fine, easy to remove too. My tip:  I use it with a different brush than the one it came with, also I wet it a bit .</li>
            <li> Considering the price of the eyeliner, the quality is very good.  Its water proof so it doesnt smudge all night, and its easier to use than the liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner glides on smoothly and is long lasting. Also blends well. I will refer this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> I ordered this color because it looked like it would be a very pretty almost-black blue. I was NOT disappointed. I opened this up under artificial light (yellow) and it looked black. Took it into the bath and looked at it under natural light and I could barely see the blue. I&#x27;m too old to wear those pretty colors that the young fashionistas (models, teenagers and 20 somethings) wear and what I wore when I was that age but this allows me to \\&quot;pretend,\\&quot; I&#x27;m still that age. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product. It&#x27;s creamy and spreadable and worth every penny. It&#x27;s an excellent price for a fantastic product! You have GOT to give it a try. Now I need to order the plum, [[ASIN:B004DIUX0C e.l.f. Studio Cream Eyeliner (Plum Purple) elf]] and the black, [[ASIN:B004DIUX34 E.l.f. Studio Cream Eyeliner (Black) elf]]! 13:33 PM 02/17/2012</li>
            <li> Good product, and fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is a very creamy eyeliner.  One might be forgiven for thinking it will be similar to other cream eyeliners, but it isn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s so creamy that when I first opened it up, I made the mistake of sinking my brush too far into the pot.  I was expecting some measure of &amp;#34;pushback&amp;#34; from the product, but it&#x27;s the consistency of whipped cream, not cream eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is weak.  I was constantly loading the brush because it would apply too lightly.  The line was not bold, despite adequate product.  It took a while to dry, which ruined my perfect eyeshadow when I sneezed.  I finally had to set the eyeliner with a hairdryer and eyeshadow to hasten the drying time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if I dry it out a bit more, the color might concentrate and the consistency might become more normal.  Right now, it&#x27;s just not optimal.</li>
            <li> I like it but I stick to liquid eye liner.</li>
            <li> Great color, took me a minute to learn a technique for it, but great overall.</li>
            <li> It felt more like a melted crayon. Horrible. Barely goes on</li>
            <li> This product is nice. A little goes a long way. It is waterproof and stays in place.</li>
            <li> Product was old dried up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really liked E.L.F. products but was really disappointed with this one. It doesn&#x27;t create a clean line - it&#x27;s all smudged and blurry. I&#x27;ve tried several times with the exact same result. Brush is fine, it&#x27;s the product that&#x27;s crap. I&#x27;m sticking with their liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Easy to use for beginners or pros. no messy clean up and the brush is very convenient to. Luv it!</li>
            <li> I didnt like the brush because it kinda choppy it made the eyeliner faded and to thick but luckily i had another angle eyeliner brush that worked out  for me very well! very excited to use all the timetime</li>
            <li> wasnt mad because it was so cheap, but dont waste any of your money on this. I was looking around for a new eyeline and this is not the one!! Sephora has a lot to choose from. Sephora brand is ok but Buxom and Smashbox are great and will be my next buy!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this, but it is a huge disappointment. It goes on streaky. When I try to put more on to cover the bare spots it just moves the product out of the way leaving more bare spots.</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t even stick it smears to much. But it is cheap so that&#x27;s fine, I just don&#x27;t ever plan non buying this again. I really like elf products but this was just disappointing</li>
            <li> When product arrived it was hard as rock. Never been able to use it, waste of money. At least i recyclied the container to put my lipstics on.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is just ok. It&#x27;s very dry and difficult to apply. It is possible to get a nice thick dark line, but it takes some work. I ended up having to use an eyeshadow sponge applicator, rather than a brush.</li>
            <li> Good quality but it&#x27;s kinda of hard to smooth on &amp; it&#x27;s much harder than any regular eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Great product!!  I love it</li>
            <li> I love gel eye liner, but not this one.  I bought the black and the grey hoping that I could expand my collection.  These didn&#x27;t go on well, the pigment was really weak, and instead of setting up like other gel eye liners do this one stayed moist and soft.  I think NYX has better options for similar price points, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one to anyone.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed with this product when I recieved it in the mail. It took only a couple days to ship it, and when I applied it in the morning before going to work, it went on very smooth. It&#x27;s very good with blending, but I recommend not using the applicator it comes with. It clumps on it and the bristles are extremely rough on skin. My only compliant is that it&#x27;s also very small compared to the photo, but a good deal considering it&#x27;s very good quality and a nice piece of makeup.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE product that flakes - do not purchase this product it is not worth it and you can do better</li>
            <li> Was definitely not a creamy gel.  Because it was so dry, I got little black specks in my eyes when I tried to apply it. It didn&#x27;t go on smoothly. I threw it out!</li>
            <li> The color is great but the cheap applicator brush they provided doesn&#x27;t allow for smooth application of the liner. Buy a better one than the plastic brush they give you.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply with the little angled brush that&#x27;s included and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I will say that I got my eyeliner in midnight directly from the ELF website and not from Amazon. Also, I purchased it two years ago, so things may have changed in the meantime. However, the blue color is very dark and comes off almost black - I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called midnight as opposed o navy. It&#x27;s really more of a black with a hint of blue if that makes any sense. My major issue with it was that it was very dry when I got it. However, I found that it acts as a great base for a smoky eye. It&#x27;s softer than a straight black base making the result look somehow sexier. (It&#x27;s great combined with a dark blue shadow for a smoky eye). It also prevents the makeup from creasing and keeps it put forever. It&#x27;s a good product, I just wish mine would&#x27;ve had more of a creamier consistency like the black, the purple and the punk purple have.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan. I felt like no matter what I did it went on clunky and uneven. I will stick with stick eyeliners!</li>
            <li> estoy muy complacido con este producto, en Venezuela no consigo esta marca. excelente calidad, estuche hermoso y acabado profesional... good</li>
            <li> I could have gotten this eyeliner at a dept store for the3 dollars, and saved the shipping too. I didn&#x27;t know of ELF COSMETICS THEN? I was fooled. But the product I liked. I went and bought 3 mores colors. Thumbs up to E.L.F.</li>
            <li> I apply eyeshadow and all that to my eyes before eye liner and I must say it takes few coats of this liner in order to get a good bold line on my lid. I do not think it is as thick as other gel or cream liners I have worked with but it&#x27;s fine if you are okay with putting in a little work to get the bold line your are expecting.</li>
            <li> I love the color of the product and the smooth gliding gel goes on so smooth and soft.  Nice little brush that comes with the eyeliner too!</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the worst eyeliners I&#x27;ve ever used.  It is difficult to apply, smudges with the slightest rise in body temperature, or crisps on the eyes like burnt paper after a couple of hours.  New to cream liners, I tried this because the price was right and I didn&#x27;t want to make a big investment in something I might not like.  That said, I STILL paid too much.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the gel liner.  It lasts all day and does not run! I use the brush that came with it for my lower lid as it is not the best of brushes but does a great job of blending on the lower lids.  I use a different brush to create a thicker line or cat eye on the upper lid. The midnight is a great dark blue and makes my green eyes pop!</li>
            <li> photos looks larger than what arrived. Very good product. been using this liner on a daily basis..goes on very smooth and stays in place all day.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long to arrive. I&#x27;ve been using it a lot and it works great. Doesn&#x27;t run. stays on for a long time. Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> is better to buy the Bobbi brown&lt;br /&gt;this is the cheap kind i only used it a few times&lt;br /&gt;but from this kind is more better the liquid eyeliner !!!</li>
            <li> The applicator is tiny and doesn&#x27;t really apply the eyeliner smoothly.  Have a hard time getting an even coating on.</li>
            <li> My fav eyeliner, long wearing and easy to apply. I highly recommend.Sometimes I like to line on the heavy side with a deep red lip. Great look!</li>
            <li> Замену искала Mac ,боялась,что не подойдет или что не понравиться качества,так как цена дешевле чем Mac.Но могу точно сказать не разочаровали все подошло и понравилось-:)</li>
            <li> really great for the price even more than another that i proved and more expensive, i really like it.</li>
            <li> I have bought several of these liquid eye liners in many different colors.  I absolutely love them!! They last a very, very long time.  Looks great behind a set a falsies!!  Highly recommend seller!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay not that great.</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst cream liner I have ever used. No matter how many brushes I tried, it comes out translucent and barely dark grey, much less the black thats promised. It smudges and looks like a cheap mess, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I tried to apply it over my eyeshadow for a more defined liner look an d you can barely see it. I think I&#x27;m gonna try it alone as a liner and see if it works better, but it does smudge easily if its not dry, can be messy</li>
