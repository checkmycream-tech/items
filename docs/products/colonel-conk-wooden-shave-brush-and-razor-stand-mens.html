    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The makers of the product could make this perfect by opening up these cut outs by just a couple of millimeters, but they continue to pass it off as is.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It fits my shaving brush perfectly, and the razor section is great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>holds everything great.  </li>
            <li>It looks great and was a great price</li>
            <li>At this price its a good deal and looks great on the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>I could find and is surprisingly functional.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time in good condition.  </li>
            <li>It does that fairly well.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>The stand has very \\&quot;good fit and finish.\\</li>
            <li>I purchased a nice badger brush to accomadate this stand</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice looking stand.</li>
            <li>Is a nice looking and stable stand for the razor and brush.  </li>
            <li>Looked nice in the website.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it is a nice looking &amp; functional stand.</li>
            <li>Nice, quality product.</li>
            <li>It is well constructed and looks great and as it should, holds my razor and brush perfectly keeping the brush and bald dry.</li>
            <li>The razor blade handle is best stored on the top section horizontally instead of vertically, the brush holder is very small but fits my Parker Badger hair brush perfectly.</li>
            <li>The wood feels very cheap.</li>
            <li>i was able to put in a boar or badger brush in no problem (at the bristles not the handle notch).  </li>
            <li>so i have to lay my razor across the top in the groove.  </li>
            <li>the razor fits great up there and is in no danger of falling unless you knock into the whole stand.  </li>
            <li>The brush fits nicely in the stand and the razor lies securely within the recess on top (horizontally).  </li>
            <li>a lot of the bristles stick out the top of the stand.</li>
            <li>Glad I have it.</li>
            <li>I go more for function than look when it comes to things like this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I sit my edwin jagger DB89 across the top horizontally.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>but I lean it over the top</li>
            <li>, brush fits fine and it its suitable the razor can be placed horizontally across the top (this is what I ended up doing)</li>
            <li>Smooth finish and very easy to clean off!</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars if it&#x27;d fit the razor better.</li>
            <li>It will fit most of the Merkur razors just fine.  </li>
            <li>Fit and finish could be better, and my Parker butterfly handle required a bit of sanding to fit the wider handle in the groove.</li>
            <li>The Tweezerman brush fits just fine.  </li>
            <li>Holds my tweezerman and my EcoTools Kabuki just fine.</li>
            <li>Everythanding just fine with stand..as I expected,Thanks.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>The brush fits fine, but the Merkur does not quite fit into the angled slot on the backside of the stand.</li>
            <li>This little stand holds my brush and razor perfectly.  </li>
            <li>stars because my brush doesn&#x27;t fit comfortably into the stand.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the product.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t fit the brush part or the handle onto this.</li>
            <li>Fits most modern razors in the indenture that runs across the top, but a mach 3-type razor won&#x27;t fit in the hanging notch.</li>
            <li>My Mach5 didn&#x27;t fit in the razor slot</li>
            <li>I had to take a dremel tool to the sides of the razor-end of the stand so the wood fit under the blade and secure it.</li>
            <li>Both fit in it....</li>
            <li>the fit and finish is what you would come to expect from a end of year 1st year woodworking student in a four year program.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really fit the razor well</li>
            <li>I just lean my too fat brush at an angle tipped back and still looks great.  </li>
            <li>I have a Mach 3 razor that doesn&#x27;t fit correctly</li>
            <li>I would not be surprised if this didn&#x27;t swell some since it being in a bathroom &#x3D; steam&#x3D; moisture, as the finish doesn&#x27;t appear to be that good at protecting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With a vintage razor on top, and a shaving brush in the tray, this nifty little holder looks great.  </li>
            <li>Looks good, it&#x27;s solid wood.</li>
            <li>I imagined it would slide right in from the side, but it doesn&#x27;t I have to kind of squish it in either from the top or angled from the open side and</li>
            <li>It looks great with all my other shaving gear.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased, but I may eventually widen the gap to better accommodate my brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll take it out to my wood working shop and add a coat of paste wax to it, which will protect it, cause any water droplets that get on it to simply bubble up, but not enter into the wood grain itself and give it a more appealing sheen to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since its a cheap stand I was going to use it for travel, mainly cause its kinda cheap all around.</li>
            <li>Maybe if the opening was a little wider it would be great</li>
            <li>Both the brush and the razor stand fit very well.</li>
            <li>This stand looks nice, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>A product should be designed to be universal for it&#x27;s purpose, any razor with any kind of widening under the head will not rest in this stand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice now that I&#x27;ve sanded the opening larger.</li>
            <li>Make sure you measure your brush to insure a proper fit.</li>
            <li>The razor doesn&#x27;t fit properly into the stand, it is good quality and nice looking but forced to buy another stand.</li>
            <li>My first stand for a shave brush, and it&#x27;s pretty adequate.</li>
            <li>My modifications to the stand weren&#x27;t hard and I supposed it&#x27;s better that I had the option to remove material rather than needing more material than was available.</li>
            <li>far as size/weight, it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
            <li>This little stand accomplishes that and looks good to boot.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks and pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>looked at many different ones and settled on the Colnel Conk.</li>
            <li>Again, I sanded down the underside of the stand for a better fit.    </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really work right now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Niether the handle or the bristles will fit.&lt;br /&gt;But other than that it looks nice and will do the job.</li>
            <li>I think that they could easily bore this out to accommodate anything up to 1/2&amp;#34; in diameter without compromising the stand&#x27;s ability to hold onto the razor, and it would then accommodate a much larger array of razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay, way to small a fit for an HD razor.</li>
            <li>However, be forewarned that if you have a brush with a large handle, this may not work well for you.</li>
            <li>Well made, not much of a protective coating and is very light weight for the brush.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m relatively new to DE shaving, but I have to say that this simple setup looks good and didn&#x27;t set me back much at all.  </li>
            <li>I really like the looks.</li>
            <li>Is that really a bid deal?</li>
            <li>The stand is very stable.  </li>
            <li>Overall I can recommend this stand if you are looking for a light tone wood stand.</li>
            <li>It holds the brush really well and keeps the brush bristles straight which he loves.</li>
            <li>Its also really sturdy and looks alot nicer in person than on the photo</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really expect it to.</li>
            <li>Again, I don&#x27;t expect much from this product.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>All of this has been glued together, I assume with a waterproof glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray finish used is not even, nor does it really give it any type of shine or luster.</li>
            <li>In all honesty I would expect this only to be valued at a couple of dollars given the fit and finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have four brushes and only the smallest one will fit, with some work.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really use it like it is intended.  </li>
            <li>but have some glue ready.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, that&#x27;s possible with wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other then that, an OK stand.  </li>
            <li>All I wanted was something that would store both the brush and razor neatly and cleanly allowing for proper drying in order to get the maximum life out of both tools.  </li>
            <li>Clean and simple.</li>
            <li>Seems like it&#x27;ll last a nice long time, and for the $15</li>
            <li>gave it 3 stars simply because it arrived quickly (amazon prime)</li>
            <li>The finish is decent, but the wood looks like is separated at the seams a bit after drying...</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really complain, it was cheap compared to some of the other stands.</li>
            <li>It may be a little overpriced, but it seems like most of  these shaving accessories are like that.  </li>
            <li>likely I&#x27;ll simply use this one as a pattern and build my own out of a fancier burl this fall when time allows, only reason I didn&#x27;t do that now was because lack of time to get out into the work shop and do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wider, Gillette will fit in there, but it has to hang at an angle and isn&#x27;t as neat as if it would hang straight down.</li>
            <li>and I really have to squeeze the bristles tight for it to fit</li>
            <li>It is an okay piece, but be aware that it is really only for a narrow range of sizes.</li>
            <li>I almost returned the unit for this reason, but I can live with it as is.</li>
            <li>I bought this to go with a wooden vanity I have that is made of light stained wood, similar to the wood in this.  </li>
            <li>but it fails in the most important thing.  </li>
            <li>I think that this thing is gonna be a bit small for most people&#x27;s razor/brush setups.  </li>
            <li>Fit was a little tight on the neck of my Escali brush, and it doesn&#x27;t fit the new, wider necked razors as well as it should.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tight fit.</li>
            <li>The opening was wide enough but the brush hairs flare out too much to cleanly fit through the opening.</li>
            <li>I only had Stainless steel stands up to this point and thought I&#x27;d check this out.  </li>
            <li>This is a really simple hardwood stand that I purchased for use with the Tweezerman brush and Merkur HD Classic razor.  </li>
            <li>The opening for hanging the brush was too small to fit hanging the brush.</li>
            <li>Nice solid construction but a very small brush hanging gap (only reason for 4 stars).  </li>
            <li>The Parker Brush I have doesn&#x27;t fit, far too thick.  </li>
            <li>It seems from other reviewers that most brushes will not fit either.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak strongly enough to the complete ineffectiveness of this stand.</li>
            <li>I switched to a slimmer brush that barely fits, even at the bristles.</li>
            <li>i can get a little messy when shaving.  :-)  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that my Parker 22R fit so poorly, however.</li>
            <li>Just something about this little stand that really catches my interest.</li>
            <li>I suppose that, if it really bugged me, I could always rework and refinish the wood to the needed dimensions, but it isn&#x27;t so bad and to me, it just isn&#x27;t worth that much time and effort.</li>

            <li> It holds the brush really well and keeps the brush bristles straight which he loves.</li>
            <li> Its also really sturdy and looks alot nicer in person than on the photo</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really expect it to.</li>
            <li> Again, I don&#x27;t expect much from this product.</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> All of this has been glued together, I assume with a waterproof glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray finish used is not even, nor does it really give it any type of shine or luster.</li>
            <li> In all honesty I would expect this only to be valued at a couple of dollars given the fit and finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have four brushes and only the smallest one will fit, with some work.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really use it like it is intended.  </li>
            <li> but have some glue ready.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, that&#x27;s possible with wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other then that, an OK stand.  </li>
            <li> All I wanted was something that would store both the brush and razor neatly and cleanly allowing for proper drying in order to get the maximum life out of both tools.  </li>
            <li> Clean and simple.</li>
            <li> Seems like it&#x27;ll last a nice long time, and for the $15</li>
            <li> gave it 3 stars simply because it arrived quickly (amazon prime)</li>
            <li> The finish is decent, but the wood looks like is separated at the seams a bit after drying...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really complain, it was cheap compared to some of the other stands.</li>
            <li> It may be a little overpriced, but it seems like most of  these shaving accessories are like that.  </li>
            <li> likely I&#x27;ll simply use this one as a pattern and build my own out of a fancier burl this fall when time allows, only reason I didn&#x27;t do that now was because lack of time to get out into the work shop and do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wider, Gillette will fit in there, but it has to hang at an angle and isn&#x27;t as neat as if it would hang straight down.</li>
            <li> and I really have to squeeze the bristles tight for it to fit</li>
            <li> It is an okay piece, but be aware that it is really only for a narrow range of sizes.</li>
            <li> I almost returned the unit for this reason, but I can live with it as is.</li>
            <li> I bought this to go with a wooden vanity I have that is made of light stained wood, similar to the wood in this.  </li>
            <li> but it fails in the most important thing.  </li>
            <li> I think that this thing is gonna be a bit small for most people&#x27;s razor/brush setups.  </li>
            <li> Fit was a little tight on the neck of my Escali brush, and it doesn&#x27;t fit the new, wider necked razors as well as it should.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tight fit.</li>
            <li> The opening was wide enough but the brush hairs flare out too much to cleanly fit through the opening.</li>
            <li> I only had Stainless steel stands up to this point and thought I&#x27;d check this out.  </li>
            <li> This is a really simple hardwood stand that I purchased for use with the Tweezerman brush and Merkur HD Classic razor.  </li>
            <li> The opening for hanging the brush was too small to fit hanging the brush.</li>
            <li> Nice solid construction but a very small brush hanging gap (only reason for 4 stars).  </li>
            <li> The Parker Brush I have doesn&#x27;t fit, far too thick.  </li>
            <li> It seems from other reviewers that most brushes will not fit either.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak strongly enough to the complete ineffectiveness of this stand.</li>
            <li> I switched to a slimmer brush that barely fits, even at the bristles.</li>
            <li> i can get a little messy when shaving.  :-)  </li>
            <li> I was surprised that my Parker 22R fit so poorly, however.</li>
            <li> Just something about this little stand that really catches my interest.</li>
            <li> I suppose that, if it really bugged me, I could always rework and refinish the wood to the needed dimensions, but it isn&#x27;t so bad and to me, it just isn&#x27;t worth that much time and effort.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to bump it pretty hard to knock it over.  </li>
            <li> I suspect it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> After two months of everyday use the brush holder part fell out, but a little superglue took right care of that problem.</li>
            <li> Personally I remove my blade, dry it and place on a dry cloth on a shelf.</li>
            <li> parker 92R has a knurled collar just under the head, to grip with wet hands and open and close the head.</li>
            <li> Like one of the other guys said, you have to sandpaper the opening a littler larger</li>
            <li> an open comb cadet razor, the other four I have won&#x27;t stay in the cradle section.  </li>
            <li> The cut-out in the back of the stand is too narrow for the collar and prevents the razor from nesting properly in the stand.</li>
            <li> The Colonel Conk Evernice Model 121 Hardwood Stand has a limited application.  </li>
            <li> Not really, but if the opening were only slightly wider I wouldn&#x27;t have an issue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obvious that it is designed for a narrow necked model.</li>
            <li> It is unfinished wood so can be stained and sealed or just left plain.</li>
            <li> So, if you want something really small, use this, if not, get something bigger.</li>
            <li> Got the item, it&#x27;s as advertised, however there was a small cut in the wood on the back.</li>
            <li> My Parker DE razor doesn&#x27;t fit though, the head is the wrong shape, and the handle is too thick.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say except that you may need to widen the opening a little for the brush.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m even thinking of sanding it down a bit.  </li>
            <li> The main base is simply been cut on a band saw and the final slope at the bottom is not even.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 2.5, but you can&#x27;t give out half stars.ut half stars.</li>
            <li> The brush holding portion is a little tight for the brush that I have, but this can be overcome by pinching the bristles down with my fingers before sliding the brush into the stand.  </li>
            <li> so it don&#x27;t mess up the bursh hairs.</li>
            <li> It needs to have a little wider opening for the brush.</li>
            <li> This thing is a nifty little stand.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m afraid i&#x27;m going to ruin the brush which was much more expensive</li>
            <li> There is just enough room for my alum bar to slide in on its side behind the brush.</li>
            <li> Except my Merkur Futur does not fit in the stand.</li>
            <li> I use it with an Escali 100% Badger Brush and Merkur \\&quot;Heavy</li>
            <li> Fishish started to come off a few weeks after purchase.</li>
            <li> The holder for the brush is too narrow for my brush (or the handle)</li>
            <li> almost like they used wood that wasn&#x27;t completely dried.</li>
            <li> The wood is already starting to rot as the sealant was poor quality.  </li>
            <li> Also my razor does not fit in the handle.</li>
            <li> Too much trouble to exchange, so</li>
            <li> Also, the opening for the brush is small too, you have to squeeze the bristles in to get it in there.</li>
            <li> The hangar for the brush is small.  </li>
            <li> I have a small handled brush for this stand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick (that&#x27;s what she said).</li>
            <li> hanger section for the brush where it connects appears to either been done with multiple passes over a blade as one section is slightly out, leaving a gap between the hanger insert and the base.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this item is not a universally useful piece.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that it&#x27;s still probably a little overpriced given that its just a hunk of wood made in Taiwan, but it&#x27;s about the least expensive stand</li>
            <li> The razor would not hang on the razor stand side, and the opening was too big for our brush, either at the base of the bristles or at the bottom of the handle.  </li>
            <li> Received broken - brush hanger broken off on receipt.  </li>
            <li> You need a thin handled razor.</li>
            <li> Should have gotten a clue when the photo shows the razor hanging on the wrong</li>
            <li> /&gt;Customers should not have to rework prodicts in order for them to function as designed, sorry.</li>
            <li> This is a bit disappointing as the Merker 180 has a relatively thin handle.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed and it can&#x27;t rust!!!</li>

            <li> holds everything great.  i was able to put in a boar or badger brush in no problem (at the bristles not the handle notch).  There is just enough room for my alum bar to slide in on its side behind the brush. Almost like it was designed like that on purpose.  I use a safety razor not a mach3 style so i have to lay my razor across the top in the groove.  the razor fits great up there and is in no danger of falling unless you knock into the whole stand.  It has held up well to being drenched in water and siting in water. i can get a little messy when shaving.  :-)  you won&#x27;t be disappointed and it can&#x27;t rust!!!</li>
            <li> This stand looks nice, especially for the price.  However, it seems that the arms for the brush holder are just a tad too close together. I&#x27;m even thinking of sanding it down a bit.  I purchased a nice badger brush to accomadate this stand and I really have to squeeze the bristles tight for it to fit, I&#x27;m afraid i&#x27;m going to ruin the brush which was much more expensive then the stand.</li>
            <li> This is a really simple hardwood stand that I purchased for use with the Tweezerman brush and Merkur HD Classic razor.  So, I&#x27;m relatively new to DE shaving, but I have to say that this simple setup looks good and didn&#x27;t set me back much at all.  The brush fits nicely in the stand and the razor lies securely within the recess on top (horizontally).  All I wanted was something that would store both the brush and razor neatly and cleanly allowing for proper drying in order to get the maximum life out of both tools.  This little stand accomplishes that and looks good to boot.  I have to say that it&#x27;s still probably a little overpriced given that its just a hunk of wood made in Taiwan, but it&#x27;s about the least expensive stand I could find and is surprisingly functional.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice looking stand. Simple, functional. I really like the looks. Except my Merkur Futur does not fit in the stand. It&#x27;s too thick (that&#x27;s what she said).</li>
            <li> Clean and simple. My razor sits on it like a champ.&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because my brush doesn&#x27;t fit comfortably into the stand. I imagined it would slide right in from the side, but it doesn&#x27;t I have to kind of squish it in either from the top or angled from the open side and a lot of the bristles stick out the top of the stand. I then do a couple of spins of the brush and it sits in like I imagined it would. Is that really a bid deal? Not really, but if the opening were only slightly wider I wouldn&#x27;t have an issue. Also...maybe I have a crappy brush.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the product.  It arrived on time in good condition.  Is a nice looking and stable stand for the razor and brush.  The brush holding portion is a little tight for the brush that I have, but this can be overcome by pinching the bristles down with my fingers before sliding the brush into the stand.  Overall I&#x27;m pleased, but I may eventually widen the gap to better accommodate my brush.</li>
            <li> The Colonel Conk Evernice Model 121 Hardwood Stand has a limited application.  I bought it along with the Van Der Hagen Shave Set (Soap,Bowl,Brush) The opening for hanging the brush was too small to fit hanging the brush. I will have to buy another stand that will let me hang the brush.</li>
            <li> Looks good, it&#x27;s solid wood. Fit and finish could be better, and my Parker butterfly handle required a bit of sanding to fit the wider handle in the groove. Glad I have it.</li>
            <li> At this price its a good deal and looks great on the bathroom sink. But at the $20 I paid it was pricey.</li>
            <li> Looked nice in the website. Should have gotten a clue when the photo shows the razor hanging on the wrong side.&lt;br /&gt;My parker 92R has a knurled collar just under the head, to grip with wet hands and open and close the head. The cut-out in the back of the stand is too narrow for the collar and prevents the razor from nesting properly in the stand. Also, the opening for the brush is small too, you have to squeeze the bristles in to get it in there. A product should be designed to be universal for it&#x27;s purpose, any razor with any kind of widening under the head will not rest in this stand. It seems from other reviewers that most brushes will not fit either. The makers of the product could make this perfect by opening up these cut outs by just a couple of millimeters, but they continue to pass it off as is.&lt;br /&gt;Customers should not have to rework prodicts in order for them to function as designed, sorry.</li>
            <li> I bought this to go with a wooden vanity I have that is made of light stained wood, similar to the wood in this.  I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks and pleased with my purchase.  The stand has very \\&quot;good fit and finish.\\&quot;  I suspect it will last a long time. I use it with an Escali 100% Badger Brush and Merkur \\&quot;Heavy Classic\\&quot; Double-Edged Safety Razor 34c, both of which you can buy on Amazon.  Both the brush and the razor stand fit very well. However, be forewarned that if you have a brush with a large handle, this may not work well for you. The stand is very stable.  You&#x27;d have to bump it pretty hard to knock it over.  It may be a little overpriced, but it seems like most of  these shaving accessories are like that.  Overall I can recommend this stand if you are looking for a light tone wood stand.</li>
            <li> It fits my shaving brush perfectly, and the razor section is great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually put Velcro on the back of it and stuck it to my bathroom wall above the sink, so it doesn&#x27;t slide around.</li>
            <li> this is the second one of these I bought.  I have one with me on the road and one at home...what do they say never leave home without it.</li>
            <li> Somehow I thought someting as simple as a shaving brush and stand would have evolved to a standard size.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a brush and bowl set earlier this year and have found the need of a brush stand important.&lt;br /&gt;I looked at many different ones and settled on the Colnel Conk. Opps, off to the shop so I can cut a bit of the wood to let the brush slide in to the holder.&lt;br /&gt;Niether the handle or the bristles will fit.&lt;br /&gt;But other than that it looks nice and will do the job.</li>
            <li> Also didn&#x27;t hold my brush... I couldn&#x27;t fit the brush part or the handle onto this. So, if you want something really small, use this, if not, get something bigger.</li>
            <li> Fishish started to come off a few weeks after purchase. Will replace with a metal design. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Got it for my husband. It holds the brush really well and keeps the brush bristles straight which he loves. Its also really sturdy and looks alot nicer in person than on the photo haha.</li>
            <li> My first stand for a shave brush, and it&#x27;s pretty adequate. After two months of everyday use the brush holder part fell out, but a little superglue took right care of that problem. Fits most modern razors in the indenture that runs across the top, but a mach 3-type razor won&#x27;t fit in the hanging notch. Seems like it&#x27;ll last a nice long time, and for the $15 or so I paid for it, it&#x27;s entirely serviceable.</li>
            <li> It needs to have a little wider opening for the brush. We have to squish the bristles put the lower ones in and then twist to get them all in till its sitting in the holder. I guess I thought it would hold it by the handle.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve had this stand for about a month. My Mach5 didn&#x27;t fit in the razor slot but I didn&#x27;t really expect it to. I was surprised that my Parker 22R fit so poorly, however. I had to take a dremel tool to the sides of the razor-end of the stand so the wood fit under the blade and secure it. Even then, the razor is precariously balanced but it works and all it has to do it stand there.    The opening for the brush was a bit too snug for my brush. The opening was wide enough but the brush hairs flare out too much to cleanly fit through the opening. Again, I sanded down the underside of the stand for a better fit.    My modifications to the stand weren&#x27;t hard and I supposed it&#x27;s better that I had the option to remove material rather than needing more material than was available. The wood feels very cheap. Again, I don&#x27;t expect much from this product. All it has to do it stand there and hold my stuff. It does that fairly well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this item is not a universally useful piece.  We have the Edwin Jaeger razor and a brush (I can&#x27;t recall the brand) and NEITHER of them worked with this holder.  The razor would not hang on the razor stand side, and the opening was too big for our brush, either at the base of the bristles or at the bottom of the handle.  There was no way to use this item at all.  I was very disappointed.  It is an okay piece, but be aware that it is really only for a narrow range of sizes.</li>
            <li> Just something about this little stand that really catches my interest. Very well made. It looks great with all my other shaving gear.</li>
            <li> Like one of the other guys said, you have to sandpaper the opening a littler larger so it don&#x27;t mess up the bursh hairs. It&#x27;s nice now that I&#x27;ve sanded the opening larger.</li>
            <li> Ordered this to go with a Escali Badger brush and a Merkur Model 180 DE Razor. Both fit in it.... color of the badger brush and this are a close match if you are going for that.. I go more for function than look when it comes to things like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is made in Taiwan, the fit and finish is what you would come to expect from a end of year 1st year woodworking student in a four year program. The main base is simply been cut on a band saw and the final slope at the bottom is not even. There is still a red line from where the pattern was drawn on one area, which this is under the spray finish, so you can&#x27;t wipe that off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hanger section for the brush where it connects appears to either been done with multiple passes over a blade as one section is slightly out, leaving a gap between the hanger insert and the base. All of this has been glued together, I assume with a waterproof glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray finish used is not even, nor does it really give it any type of shine or luster. I would not be surprised if this didn&#x27;t swell some since it being in a bathroom &#x3D; steam&#x3D; moisture, as the finish doesn&#x27;t appear to be that good at protecting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll take it out to my wood working shop and add a coat of paste wax to it, which will protect it, cause any water droplets that get on it to simply bubble up, but not enter into the wood grain itself and give it a more appealing sheen to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most likely I&#x27;ll simply use this one as a pattern and build my own out of a fancier burl this fall when time allows, only reason I didn&#x27;t do that now was because lack of time to get out into the work shop and do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it is, your paying for the name and not quality. In all honesty I would expect this only to be valued at a couple of dollars given the fit and finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 3 stars simply because it arrived quickly (amazon prime) and it appears it will do its job.. I would have given it 2.5, but you can&#x27;t give out half stars.ut half stars.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Fit was a little tight on the neck of my Escali brush, and it doesn&#x27;t fit the new, wider necked razors as well as it should. It&#x27;s obvious that it is designed for a narrow necked model. My wider, Gillette will fit in there, but it has to hang at an angle and isn&#x27;t as neat as if it would hang straight down. I almost returned the unit for this reason, but I can live with it as is. I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars if it&#x27;d fit the razor better. I suppose that, if it really bugged me, I could always rework and refinish the wood to the needed dimensions, but it isn&#x27;t so bad and to me, it just isn&#x27;t worth that much time and effort.</li>
            <li> With a vintage razor on top, and a shaving brush in the tray, this nifty little holder looks great.  It&#x27;s made of real hardwood and not cheap particle board.</li>
            <li> Bought this stand as a way to handle my ever expanding double edged razor collection. I only had Stainless steel stands up to this point and thought I&#x27;d check this out.  It can only hold one of my razors, an open comb cadet razor, the other four I have won&#x27;t stay in the cradle section.  Additionally the brush holder only holds a very specific size of brush. I have four brushes and only the smallest one will fit, with some work. I&#x27;m hesitant to even use it as the continued forcing of brushes into that section will begin to deteriorate the brush.  I can&#x27;t speak strongly enough to the complete ineffectiveness of this stand. Stay away, and just save your money and get anything else.</li>
            <li> The holder for the brush is too narrow for my brush (or the handle) so I can&#x27;t really use it like it is intended.  It looks great and was a great price but it fails in the most important thing.  Maybe if the opening was a little wider it would be great but it doesn&#x27;t really work right now.</li>
            <li> This thing is a nifty little stand.  It&#x27;s a bit top-heavy.  It will fit most of the Merkur razors just fine.  My Parker DE razor doesn&#x27;t fit though, the head is the wrong shape, and the handle is too thick.  The hangar for the brush is small.  The Parker Brush I have doesn&#x27;t fit, far too thick.  The Tweezerman brush fits just fine.  I think that this thing is gonna be a bit small for most people&#x27;s razor/brush setups.  The finish is decent, but the wood looks like is separated at the seams a bit after drying... almost like they used wood that wasn&#x27;t completely dried.</li>
            <li> I bought this to go with one of Colonel Conk&#x27;s badger brushes &amp; a Merkur 180. The brush fits fine, but the Merkur does not quite fit into the angled slot on the backside of the stand. This is a bit disappointing as the Merker 180 has a relatively thin handle. I think that they could easily bore this out to accommodate anything up to 1/2&amp;#34; in diameter without compromising the stand&#x27;s ability to hold onto the razor, and it would then accommodate a much larger array of razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a nice looking &amp; functional stand.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really fit the razor well, brush fits fine and it its suitable the razor can be placed horizontally across the top (this is what I ended up doing)</li>
            <li> This little stand holds my brush and razor perfectly.  It is sturdy and does not wobble.  Well made product.  I would buy it again if it ever broke.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really complain, it was cheap compared to some of the other stands. Holds my tweezerman and my EcoTools Kabuki just fine. I sit my edwin jagger DB89 across the top horizontally.</li>
            <li> Make sure you measure your brush to insure a proper fit. Smooth finish and very easy to clean off! Love it</li>
            <li> The razor doesn&#x27;t fit properly into the stand, it is good quality and nice looking but forced to buy another stand.</li>
            <li> I ended up using another brush as the brissels fell out of this one after every use.  Stand works well for a styptic pencil and safety razor that I have.</li>
            <li> The wood is already starting to rot as the sealant was poor quality.  Also my razor does not fit in the handle.</li>
            <li> Nice solid construction but a very small brush hanging gap (only reason for 4 stars).  You will need a curvy (Mansfield?) handle on your brush.  I just lean my too fat brush at an angle tipped back and still looks great.  It is unfinished wood so can be stained and sealed or just left plain.</li>
            <li> Got the item, it&#x27;s as advertised, however there was a small cut in the wood on the back. However, just turn it around and it&#x27;s unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> It is well constructed and looks great and as it should, holds my razor and brush perfectly keeping the brush and bald dry.</li>
            <li> Received broken - brush hanger broken off on receipt.  Too much trouble to exchange, so I just glued it back on.  Other then that, an OK stand.  Go ahead and buy - but have some glue ready.</li>
            <li> Everythanding just fine with stand..as I expected,Thanks.</li>
            <li> Okay, way to small a fit for an HD razor. Won&#x27;t even come close. You need a thin handled razor. I have a small handled brush for this stand. Since its a cheap stand I was going to use it for travel, mainly cause its kinda cheap all around. It&#x27;s a tight fit. You shouldn&#x27;t have to go out of your way to use two hand to set the brush in a stand, especially while shaving. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> The razor blade handle is best stored on the top section horizontally instead of vertically, the brush holder is very small but fits my Parker Badger hair brush perfectly.</li>
            <li> Not much to say except that you may need to widen the opening a little for the brush. I have a Mach 3 razor that doesn&#x27;t fit correctly but I lean it over the top and it&#x27;s fine. I switched to a slimmer brush that barely fits, even at the bristles. Probably have to carve a larger opening. Fortunately, that&#x27;s possible with wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as size/weight, it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
            <li> Nice, quality product.</li>
            <li> Well made, not much of a protective coating and is very light weight for the brush. Personally I remove my blade, dry it and place on a dry cloth on a shelf.</li>
            <li> This item works well.</li>
