    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Satin Perfect Epilator (white/purple),  The hand&#x27;s thumb clicks the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button and the epilator</li>
            <li>The best epilator there is in the mart.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She advises it is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I am already very happy with my choice!</li>
            <li>I am very happy I decided to buy Philips!&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Its perfectly portable.</li>
            <li>the Philips Satin Perfect is as close as you can get.</li>
            <li>Being cordless makes it way easier to use (according to her :D)</li>
            <li>So if you can&#x27;t take waxing best to skip this</li>
            <li>I have used Emjoi brand for 6 years and it was the best brand until Philips came out with this one!</li>
            <li>Until Philips the Emjoi was the best.</li>
            <li>PERFECT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve retreated upon plans to use it for those areas, but the device itself is very good; I&#x27;m just a wuss.</li>
            <li>Good luck brave ladies!</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with the results.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be a happy girl.  </li>
            <li>This product comes in a attractive package with all the needed  items&lt;br /&gt;i.e.</li>
            <li>I am an experienced user of epilators.</li>
            <li>Great industrial design and ergonomics.   </li>
            <li>Great results.    </li>
            <li>This product would be great, if you had some anestesia, or maybe loss of nerve endings.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who realizes that these gadgets do sting some but do a great job with hair removal.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice epilator.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice epilator.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am a bit disadvantaged in my pursuit of perfectly groomed underarms by many factors:</li>
            <li>Con&#x27;s are that it didn&#x27;t do as good a job for me as my  metal tip model.</li>
            <li>Looks good and feel good in hand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>in all, a good purchase</li>
            <li>Afterwards, my legs felt smooth and the best part is that it lasted for over 2 weeks!  </li>
            <li>i knew how good philips was so my decision was for philips again.</li>
            <li>Its wonderful because it has a light that helps me to see where are hair to be pulled out still</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait until I&#x27;d been using it a while to give it a fair review.  </li>
            <li>I learned quickly that once it hit my skin, it was best not to lift it up.  </li>
            <li>While this is a great idea, and the product itself is really cute looking...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I opened it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can confidently say that I have been extremely happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: This device is powered by an AC adapter that is 110-240v.</li>
            <li>, I decided to try the Philips Satin Perfect, and just used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>My face is baby butt smooth!!</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable in the hand, looks good, has a contoured, removable head  </li>
            <li>however it was amazing and tweezing of all the hairs.</li>
            <li>She travels with the unit as it comes with the cord and epilator in a nice travel bag.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with a nice travel bag.</li>
            <li>I used to use Phillips in Europe, but when I moved to the USA, it was not that popular, so I went with Braun.</li>
            <li>Consider splashing with a nice witch hazel astringent afterwards.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used one and are considering it this is a nice model to start with.</li>
            <li>Anyway, men or women can benefit for a wonderful epilator that is there ready for you to use whenever you need it.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I thought I would return it without opening it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The unit can be used with or without the cord plugged in which is nice</li>
            <li>It was also after she bought a couple home wax and/or honey kits for waxing your own legs at home.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend the Phillips HP6576/60 Satin Perfect Epilator.</li>
            <li>works well and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I also found that this epilator wasn&#x27;t as good at pulling out fine hair.</li>
            <li>Read the directions, there are some good tips on how to use this thing (e.g. stretch your skin, use light touch, consider exfoliating scrub days before and/or after).    </li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised at the excellent job the epilator does when used on the legs.</li>
            <li>Arrived early and product works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>great thing about this epilator is that it has a light, so it makes it really easy to see the hairs.</li>
            <li>I heard they are much better now, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I gave this device a try.     </li>
            <li>and you are out more money.</li>
            <li>The Phillips did an OK  job of  hair removal</li>
            <li>i think I am going to put a piece of masking tape over it :)</li>
            <li>When I finally gave it awhirl, it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>Anyway, most of the hair was ripped out immediately.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than shaving and/or waxing.</li>
            <li>but I was able to do both legs and underarms and haven&#x27;t needed to recharge yet.   </li>
            <li>However I put up with it for many years now since this was the most efficient epilator for awhile on the market, until I decided to purchase this epilator.</li>
            <li>I owned and used an EpiLady many years ago.  </li>
            <li>It pulled and pinched and required a lot of effort to remove most, but not all, of the hair on my legs.  </li>
            <li>I did not anticipate just how much better this Philips model would work.  </li>
            <li>This one is definitely one of the best I ever used.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no such thing as a perfect epilator but</li>
            <li>This Epilator is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>The more I lifted, the more it hurt.</li>
            <li>I was able to do all this without having to even charge it once since it showed up charged.  </li>
            <li>Serendipity :-)</li>
            <li>/&gt;:-)</li>
            <li>works great, very quality made, no need to shave legs all the time.....</li>
            <li>It is not painless but better than the Emjoi.</li>
            <li>Now the Philips is the Cream de la Cream :)</li>
            <li>found using this epilator to be a rather stinging experience, which I gather most people would say about any epilator.  </li>
            <li>the Philips Satin Perfect is fast, doesn&#x27;t hurt me even with longish hair, easy to clean, and can be used cordless.</li>
            <li>I was able to tolerate it for both legs</li>
            <li>and I was relatively pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m saving money every month and her legs are silky smooth!</li>
            <li>But my epilator won&#x27;t turn on any more.</li>
            <li>I really think that the CIA should consider using this instead of waterboarding, it would be much more effective at getting information out of suspected furry terrorists!  </li>
            <li>This would be a good choice for a first time epilator.</li>
            <li>, this epilator seems pretty good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of shaving so when I learned about epilators, I was really excited!</li>
            <li>With patience and a light touch (don&#x27;t use it like a razor, it will hurrrt), using it gets better and better.  </li>
            <li>patience and a light touch (don&#x27;t use it like a razor, it will hurrrt), using it gets better and better.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, it was very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The rotating heads cut the hairs smoothly and quickly and my wife says it is by far the best she has ever owned.</li>
            <li>Very cool design</li>
            <li>Most importantly I did not want to  have to worry about hair regrowth while I was on vacation and found  </li>
            <li>The fact that this unit has a battery was great since you do not need to stand near an outlet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This may be an ideal solution for some people, but for myself, it fell short of my expectations</li>
            <li>She uses and has enjoyed the light that comes with this model as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, easy, comfortable and effective.    </li>
            <li>, Philips is WAY more gentle, I love it!</li>
            <li>- Plastic tweezers seem more friendly than metal chompers.  </li>
            <li>a rechargeable unit makes it a attractive  product at this price point and love that the cloth case actually sits flat&lt;br</li>
            <li>X&#x27;elle Easy Start Epilator]], [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>- Easy washing-- removable head can be rinsed out.  </li>
            <li>In this video, I demonstrate the features and use of the Satin Perfect epilator, and discuss issues such as pain, tips for success, and recommended aftercare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it 3 times now and it just gets easier to use (it&#x27;s easy to clean as well since the top part clicks off and separates).  </li>
            <li>it is easy to use, helpful.</li>
            <li>The head is easily removable for cleaning and it does come with a cleaning brush.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love it for Face fuzz of 58 year old skin :)</li>
            <li>I have fine hair on my legs and this didn&#x27;t pick up about a tenth of the hair.  </li>
            <li>Likes:    - Light and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>If not you may end up dealing with ingrown hairs and a bumpy skin instead of a nice smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;The machine itself is very noisy!</li>
            <li>But what the heck, I got it free for doing the evaluation.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin totally smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to follow the directions that recommend doing the removal at night</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use my mine every where - face, legs, feet (why do I  have hairy toes?), arms, underarms &amp; bikini area - so it&#x27;s important that the head doesn&#x27;t catch skin or pull.</li>
            <li>I like the light feature as it makes it easier to see the hair I want to remove.  </li>
            <li>Smooth legs, smooth armpits.</li>
            <li>skin stayed smooth and hair free for weeks.</li>
            <li>Since this was available through Vine</li>
            <li>There is a light that makes it easier to see</li>
            <li>I like how smooth my legs feel after using it.</li>
            <li>and i was surprised how good it was.</li>
            <li>Not being a contortionist, I wasn&#x27;t able to get the stretching right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad Amazon had this as a deal of the day right when I ran out of wax at home.  </li>
            <li>a very  nice pouch that actually  is designed to SIT on the counter vs. fall over&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall a very nice unit.  </li>
            <li>you can clean, a carry pouch, a light, pressure control, and an adapter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It picks up the hairs quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite appliance.  :-)</li>
            <li>It really does a better job than shaving with a razor and is really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>My wife had many electric razors throughout the years however this is the first time she has used  an \\&quot;Epilator\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>When I first used this, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>She opens the head and uses a spray can of air to completely clean the unit after each use.</li>
            <li>I feel much safer and more comfortable than with Braun.</li>
            <li>Philips is an European brand that is highly popular in Europe in terms of razors, etc, although here in the US is more known for bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;Get</li>
            <li>It does help the pain to cut any hair first, but using it, for instance, in an isolated area around an eyebrow is pretty effective.  </li>
            <li>so I feel this is a pretty fair review of a new product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After testing this epilator on my legs, I realized that I would not be able to endure having the hair pulled out from a much more sensitive area, my underarms, and possibly more intimate areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>having never  owned an epilator, but boy did I make the right choice!</li>
            <li>Seems more comfortable than older ones we&#x27;ve used though.    </li>
            <li>- it really helps to be able to see finer hair.  </li>
            <li>love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This device is good for delivering such pain and results, though.  </li>
            <li>The extra touches on this one make it a good  buy, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>After using many different epilators, this is the best one by far, so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s virtually painless to me, and it removes the hair quickly and thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>did do a decent job on my legs, but truthfully,</li>
            <li>It does pull some and it doesn&#x27;t feel real great, but I&#x27;ve never found a hair removal item that doesn&#x27;t, be it wax, tweezers or my medieval electric tweezers as mentioned above.</li>
            <li>The lite is handy to be able to see  the skin surface of you lower legs but can&#x27;t see what other use it might have.</li>
            <li>This is my very first epilator.  </li>
            <li>overall i am very glad i made my decision from philips side.</li>
            <li>of the things I have always envied about other women is their ablity to achieve near perfect underarm grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does do a great job of removing hair and slowing down regrowth, which is what I hoped for.  </li>
            <li>This epilator charged very quickly, and I was ready to do the deed in well under an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I will keep at it in the hopes that it only gets better!</li>
            <li>And, I was able to do my arms, face, sideburns and armpits in less time than it used to take me to warm up the microwaveable wax</li>
            <li>The sound is much louder than I anticipated and makes one cringe.  </li>
            <li>the LED light is VERY helpful.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it is cordless and has a light</li>
            <li>let&#x27;s face it, a gal wants to feel silky smooth....</li>
            <li>, this made every iota of the pain worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was it worth it?</li>
            <li>It does not remove the short hair effectively.</li>
            <li>but the results are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can honestly say that I probably won&#x27;t go back to using a razor again.  </li>
            <li>is absolutely worth it...and NO RAZOR</li>
            <li>Overall review: If you can get through the pain of the first use, you&#x27;ll fall in love with it!  </li>
            <li>A note about the price of epilators: It is more expensive at first, but an very good value over time.</li>
            <li>you will notice right off the bat</li>
            <li>NEVER be without the right batteries..</li>
            <li>And it won&#x27;t matter  if the electrical outlet is the right voltage.  </li>
            <li>I looked on amazon for one right away</li>
            <li>The charging cord is nice and long.</li>
            <li>The camera pans the leg, showing that it is now mostly smooth, with some fine hairs still present.  </li>
            <li>When the hair grew back after using the epilator, it was very fine and sparse.</li>
            <li>Giving up a couple of waxings will certainly pay for this!</li>
            <li>The head removes easily so you can clear out any hair.    </li>
            <li>For the record, I am somewhat fair and not super hairy.</li>
            <li>So the real issue became: my legs looked smooth, but really weren&#x27;t to the touch</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very effective hair removal device, even on my fine, thin hairs.  </li>
            <li>Very LOUD sound.</li>
            <li>It is VERY fast.</li>
            <li>I forgot about it until I used Philips again, but it makes a huge difference on more sensitive areas i.e. upper thighs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Ow, that really hurts!  </li>
            <li>First off, it does hurt.</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator I have used that doesn&#x27;t use metal tweezer heads.</li>
            <li>The sound is LOUD..</li>
            <li>As for sound, it is considerable quite.</li>
            <li>Instead of the tweezers being silver like most epilators, they are actually white ceramic.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using an epilator</li>
            <li>This is not my first epilator.  </li>
            <li>My old one had a ceramic tweezer system and this one is just as comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>This may be designed for women, but at our house, it is he who uses it the most for his shoulder and back area.</li>
            <li>Most definitely.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I had ever used an epilator</li>
            <li>i always plucced during day time thats why i am not sure how effective the light is.</li>
            <li>It did exactly what the item description states it will do.</li>
            <li>at first i thought it would hurt a lot, turns out it works well,</li>
            <li>I want to get used to using it on my legs first.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I&#x27;ll admit that it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;enjoyable&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I had the first leg done, longish hair without pain, in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>First, don&#x27;t judge the product by the first use.  </li>
            <li>not merely just look the part.</li>
            <li>Exfoliating the skin with a good scrub for a few days before and after exfoliating will be helpful.</li>
            <li>The price may seem a little high however the prices on good electric razors are in the same price range and this unit is far superior.</li>
            <li>epilator left my skin smooth, it does take hair our very well, much better than my old epilator.</li>
            <li>If you already use one, and the pain doesn&#x27;t bother you, then this item is nice due to</li>
            <li>It is cordless, and rechargeable, and a bonus is the handy light to use on hard to see areas.  </li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying that I read many different reviews, like you are now, and I was very iffy about buying this product.</li>
            <li>I have double duty hair on my lower legs - most of it is very coarse, but some of it is somewhat fine.  </li>
            <li>Just rinse the top two pieces under hot water and let dry.  </li>
            <li>After the first time it does not pain too much.</li>
            <li>Also, I found making fast swipes and lots of them the first time was easier to get through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This morning I touched up some of the spots I missed (about 5 days after the first use) and it didn&#x27;t hurt much all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Right out of the box, I saw that the epilator is a high quality product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned an older emjoi, then the emjoi gently caress, and most recently the braun silk epi exelle.</li>
            <li>I certainly won&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve found that if I dry my skin really well after a shower it works better.  </li>
            <li>I finally  decided to make the switch to something that would be long lasting and  hopefully more effective.</li>
            <li>It has a nice design on it and when you plug it in a little battery flashes to let you know it&#x27;s charging.</li>
            <li>The little bag is nice.  </li>
            <li>And wow, it was FAST!!</li>
            <li>The dialog is real, recorded by my husband without my knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t holding out much hope for the \\&quot;Perfect\\&quot; Epilator.  </li>
            <li>It has two speeds and both of them seem to be extremely fast.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t refer to pain, it really depends on every person&#x27;s sensitivity to epilation.</li>
            <li>it really allows you to see missed hair and saves time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Emjoi Gently Gold Cordless Rechargable Hair Removal System]], [[ASIN:B001EWFBLQ Braun 5180</li>
            <li>- Built-in led light gives extra visibility where you need to go.  </li>
            <li>The emjoi epilators don&#x27;t hurt as much</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get used to the sensation of hair being pulled out and the more you use it the hair gets finer and in most cases will not grow back after a few years of use.</li>
            <li>my legs are still hair free almost a week later.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work well</li>
            <li>It really hurts.  </li>
            <li>Does it hurt as much as waxing?  </li>
            <li>This device travels charged and ready.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to hit the beach.  </li>
            <li>There are some that say that it hurt, but for me, not so much.</li>
            <li>Again, I didn&#x27;t feel much pain (I wouldn&#x27;t even call it pain).</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t bother you that much anymore.</li>
            <li>highly recommend giving it a chance!</li>
            <li>I never actually had smooth legs.</li>
            <li>She just goes in the bathroom and with this epilator, she&#x27;s ready to go in about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The promise of a smooth face and chin are finally fulfilled.</li>
            <li>Rely on it as much as razor for my face.</li>
            <li>If you are a first time epilator, keep in mind that you do NOT need to press down on the epilator - just allow it to pass on top of the skin.  </li>
            <li>This has been very useful in our international travels.</li>
            <li>battery lasts longer then needed to do both legs and any other spots, and rapid charges very fast...would consider buying another one, love the ceramic tips...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very important to exfoliate regularly and make sure your skin and body hair is dry prior to using.</li>
            <li>My wife found that if the hairs are allowed to grow a little the removal is very easy with the epilator.</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t need to shave every other day!But you have to give it a chance.</li>
            <li>but I would like it if the light was adjustable or a little less bright to prevent glare.</li>
            <li>The first few seconds I was definitely in more pain as it was a shock.</li>
            <li>In the summer, this will be a huge timesaver since I normally shave every 2-3 days with a regular razor!</li>
            <li>I am able to do my legs much faster than with previous epilators.</li>
            <li>The light is placed well for lighting up the area you are working on and the charge holds for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t need to shave every other day!</li>
            <li>and I developed  little sensitivity to any kind of wax.</li>
            <li>I understand with this type of shaver that the more times you use it the less discomfort as the hairs grow in thinner.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly on my legs, where the pain is somewhat less.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t go for a more expensive one.</li>
            <li>This unit in particular is the nicest epilator I&#x27;ve seen:    </li>
            <li>She had used an epilator for a number of years, but it was a much older model and required a power</li>
            <li>Leaving my skin very smooth, and hairless, this little tool works well.  </li>
            <li>I sat down after a nice long shower, made sure that my legs were dry and began.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very loud and it hurts!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this device.</li>
            <li>It is obviously a high end epilator</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I was kind of surprised that I didn&#x27;t really mind it either in fast or slow gear.</li>
            <li>due to the options for speed, lite to see what you are doing on lower extremities, rechargeability is a big plus and a nice case to tuck away the product in a suitcase for travel.</li>
            <li>It does hurt, like little pins pricking your skin, but it&#x27;s nothing I can&#x27;t handle, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li>It was a little more of a deal from the legs, but it didn&#x27;t stop me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I use it on my arms or face, it hurts a little more than I want.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to hold no matter where you are shaving due to the shape.</li>
            <li>Got!&lt;br /&gt;The old one is not retired yet, going to use as a travel options.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing design, very comfortable to use, much less growing into skin hair, don&#x27;t need to shave often.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>I have cavities filled without novocaine, but I&#x27;m not ready to make an epilator part of my routine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using an epilator for 4 years, so I&#x27;ve already developed a tolerance for the pain and can&#x27;t really address that as a beginner in my review.</li>
            <li>and I normally don&#x27;t write reviews about these things because let&#x27;s face it</li>
            <li>I was very cautious at first, but again, no big deal.</li>
            <li>I am able to do both underarms in less than 5 minutes!</li>
            <li>The light makes it so much easier to use than any of the other ones I&#x27;ve had, and somehow the ceramic grippers on this thing work well and so fast that you barely feel it.  </li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t use it right outside the sleeping baby&#x27;s room at night.  </li>
            <li>There are very few hairs that even grow on my legs now (like 1 every 2 or 3 inches of leg) and those are very fine.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it takes several passes in different directions to get absolutely all the fine hairs, but to just have to shave every couple of days with no mess</li>
            <li>Personally, I use this epilator for my legs and have to use it about once every 2 weeks before the hair that grows back becomes noticeable which I believe is a great alternative to shaving, which some people how to do every few days!</li>
            <li>- Nice little white zip-up carrying bag.    </li>
            <li>so i decided to buy  new epilator.</li>
            <li>B000F4USEY Panasonic ES2045P Wet/Dry Two-Speed Epilator with Three Heads (Pink)]], and most recently [[ASIN:B003H6FPVI Remington EP6025</li>
            <li>When using on my underarms, I actually have to use the lower setting because the fast setting is too fast.</li>
            <li>The amount that grew back was light in color and not at all noticeable like it would be with regular shaving.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin that gets red bumps easily, and this causes the bumps in those latter two areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The charge time is very fast, only about an hour.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>three-star rating is due to the epilator&#x27;s noisiness and the fact that it removed most but not all the hair in its path, leaving about one-tenth of my hair unplucked even after multiple passes.  </li>
            <li>And boy, have I been pleasantly surprised!    </li>
            <li>But definite advantage of plastic (or ceramic) disks is that it does not hurt as much as the metal ones in Braun!</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth it to buy a long term reusable hair removal device like an epilator.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it correspond exactly to what I am expecting about a epilator, the essential : Epilate.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use features and little storage bag.</li>
            <li>OK - &#x27;comfortable&#x27; is a relative term, but anyone who uses an epilator regularly will know what I mean.</li>
            <li>The hair removal is done quickly and with absolutely no scratches, pressure or pain.</li>
            <li>begins to buzz loudly.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention it&#x27;s loud</li>
            <li>much louder than my current Emjoi</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t  have to worry about running out of razors or if having the time in my  busy schedule to go and get waxed.</li>
            <li>So now I found few Phillips available, and went with this one.</li>
            <li>i am 35 years old</li>
            <li>It works well, but is loud - thus the four star rating.</li>
            <li>this is loud</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to be near an outlet when you are using it.</li>
            <li>Completely done with both legs in 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>The charge holds for a long time and charging it back up is quick - you can even use it plugged in if your charge dies..</li>
            <li>And a little of pulling is worth it to me!  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it did sting just a little bit, and I had to go over my legs a few times just to make sure I got it all</li>
            <li>If you have the guts to try epilation, particularly if you dare to do your underarms, you may never go back.  </li>
            <li>The epilator removed the coarse hair pretty well, but took several passes in each area.  </li>
            <li>If you have a low pain tolerance, then purchase a topical anesthetic first.  </li>
            <li>Her old epilator made it sound like she was running a small chainsaw.</li>
            <li>My old epilator finally died after 4+ of service, so I decided to go for a new Philips.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>But I did want to compare the Philips Satin Perfect Epilator to my previous epilator, the Braun 5270 Silk Epil X&#x27;elle, which I&#x27;d grown unhappy with.</li>
            <li>extra wide head makes pluccing finish quickly.</li>
            <li>The honey made such a huge mess.</li>
            <li>second problem was that the epilator requires stretching the skin tight and using a light hand.</li>
            <li>but I rinsed with cold water and applied a fragrance free lotion afterwards so my legs felt fine.</li>
            <li>So I have gone back to shaving in the last year and have really missed not having to worry about shaving all the time.</li>
            <li>After 4+ years it doesn&#x27;t really hurt and I won&#x27;t pay extra for fancy extra features, like massagers and numbing wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is nice to have a light, but this one is not directed on your skin, but instead you have to stare at it all the time, which is annoying.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, but after testing it out last night, I would have to say it works fairly well.  </li>
            <li>Other things you might be interested to know...  </li>
            <li>cannot compare it to any other epilators as this is my first.  </li>
            <li>noticed that the description of the product talks about facial hair removal but the directions that came with it clearly state that it&#x27;s for hair removal below the neck</li>
            <li>The first time using an epilator is kind of painful.  </li>
            <li>The hair that grows back is soft and not prickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I then did a strip all the way up to my knee and still felt barely anything.</li>
            <li>Obviously I like to try new epilators, so when I found this one I definitely wanted to get it.   </li>
            <li>That was one of the problems I had with the Braun -- it seemed that I could never get it clean enough, especially when I lost the little brush</li>
            <li>So if you are brave of heart and are sick of waxing, by all means consider this as an option.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t shower first as I normally do before epilating, and it had been a week since I last epilated... which usually means pain.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, the first time I used this epilator, it caused severe irritation because I was pressing down during the multiple passes on my legs.  </li>
            <li>other issue with using epilation in general (and not this one in particular) is that it requires quite a bit of prepwork.</li>
            <li>- This is still an epilator, which requires patience and a bit of pain to work with, especially the first few times.  </li>
            <li>The epilator didn&#x27;t do as well removing the fine hair, even on the lowest setting with very slow passes.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am already very happy with my choice!</li>
            <li> I am very happy I decided to buy Philips!&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Its perfectly portable.</li>
            <li> the Philips Satin Perfect is as close as you can get.</li>
            <li> Being cordless makes it way easier to use (according to her :D)</li>
            <li> So if you can&#x27;t take waxing best to skip this</li>
            <li> I have used Emjoi brand for 6 years and it was the best brand until Philips came out with this one!</li>
            <li> Until Philips the Emjoi was the best.</li>
            <li> PERFECT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve retreated upon plans to use it for those areas, but the device itself is very good; I&#x27;m just a wuss.</li>
            <li> Good luck brave ladies!</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with the results.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be a happy girl.  </li>
            <li> This product comes in a attractive package with all the needed  items&lt;br /&gt;i.e.</li>
            <li> I am an experienced user of epilators.</li>
            <li> Great industrial design and ergonomics.   </li>
            <li> Great results.    </li>
            <li> This product would be great, if you had some anestesia, or maybe loss of nerve endings.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who realizes that these gadgets do sting some but do a great job with hair removal.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice epilator.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice epilator.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a bit disadvantaged in my pursuit of perfectly groomed underarms by many factors:</li>
            <li> Con&#x27;s are that it didn&#x27;t do as good a job for me as my  metal tip model.</li>
            <li> Looks good and feel good in hand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> in all, a good purchase</li>
            <li> Afterwards, my legs felt smooth and the best part is that it lasted for over 2 weeks!  </li>
            <li> i knew how good philips was so my decision was for philips again.</li>
            <li> Its wonderful because it has a light that helps me to see where are hair to be pulled out still</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait until I&#x27;d been using it a while to give it a fair review.  </li>
            <li> I learned quickly that once it hit my skin, it was best not to lift it up.  </li>
            <li> While this is a great idea, and the product itself is really cute looking...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I opened it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can confidently say that I have been extremely happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: This device is powered by an AC adapter that is 110-240v.</li>
            <li> , I decided to try the Philips Satin Perfect, and just used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> My face is baby butt smooth!!</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable in the hand, looks good, has a contoured, removable head  </li>
            <li> however it was amazing and tweezing of all the hairs.</li>
            <li> She travels with the unit as it comes with the cord and epilator in a nice travel bag.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a nice travel bag.</li>
            <li> I used to use Phillips in Europe, but when I moved to the USA, it was not that popular, so I went with Braun.</li>
            <li> Consider splashing with a nice witch hazel astringent afterwards.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used one and are considering it this is a nice model to start with.</li>
            <li> Anyway, men or women can benefit for a wonderful epilator that is there ready for you to use whenever you need it.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I thought I would return it without opening it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The unit can be used with or without the cord plugged in which is nice</li>
            <li> It was also after she bought a couple home wax and/or honey kits for waxing your own legs at home.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend the Phillips HP6576/60 Satin Perfect Epilator.</li>
            <li> works well and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I also found that this epilator wasn&#x27;t as good at pulling out fine hair.</li>
            <li> Read the directions, there are some good tips on how to use this thing (e.g. stretch your skin, use light touch, consider exfoliating scrub days before and/or after).    </li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised at the excellent job the epilator does when used on the legs.</li>
            <li> Arrived early and product works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> great thing about this epilator is that it has a light, so it makes it really easy to see the hairs.</li>
            <li> I heard they are much better now, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I gave this device a try.     </li>
            <li> and you are out more money.</li>
            <li> The Phillips did an OK  job of  hair removal</li>
            <li> i think I am going to put a piece of masking tape over it :)</li>
            <li> When I finally gave it awhirl, it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Anyway, most of the hair was ripped out immediately.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than shaving and/or waxing.</li>
            <li> but I was able to do both legs and underarms and haven&#x27;t needed to recharge yet.   </li>
            <li> However I put up with it for many years now since this was the most efficient epilator for awhile on the market, until I decided to purchase this epilator.</li>
            <li> I owned and used an EpiLady many years ago.  </li>
            <li> It pulled and pinched and required a lot of effort to remove most, but not all, of the hair on my legs.  </li>
            <li> I did not anticipate just how much better this Philips model would work.  </li>
            <li> This one is definitely one of the best I ever used.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no such thing as a perfect epilator but</li>
            <li> This Epilator is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> The more I lifted, the more it hurt.</li>
            <li> I was able to do all this without having to even charge it once since it showed up charged.  </li>
            <li> Serendipity :-)</li>
            <li> /&gt;:-)</li>
            <li> works great, very quality made, no need to shave legs all the time.....</li>
            <li> It is not painless but better than the Emjoi.</li>
            <li> Now the Philips is the Cream de la Cream :)</li>
            <li> found using this epilator to be a rather stinging experience, which I gather most people would say about any epilator.  </li>
            <li> the Philips Satin Perfect is fast, doesn&#x27;t hurt me even with longish hair, easy to clean, and can be used cordless.</li>
            <li> I was able to tolerate it for both legs</li>
            <li> and I was relatively pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m saving money every month and her legs are silky smooth!</li>
            <li> But my epilator won&#x27;t turn on any more.</li>
            <li> I really think that the CIA should consider using this instead of waterboarding, it would be much more effective at getting information out of suspected furry terrorists!  </li>
            <li> This would be a good choice for a first time epilator.</li>
            <li> , this epilator seems pretty good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of shaving so when I learned about epilators, I was really excited!</li>
            <li> With patience and a light touch (don&#x27;t use it like a razor, it will hurrrt), using it gets better and better.  </li>
            <li> patience and a light touch (don&#x27;t use it like a razor, it will hurrrt), using it gets better and better.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, it was very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The rotating heads cut the hairs smoothly and quickly and my wife says it is by far the best she has ever owned.</li>
            <li> Very cool design</li>
            <li> Most importantly I did not want to  have to worry about hair regrowth while I was on vacation and found  </li>
            <li> The fact that this unit has a battery was great since you do not need to stand near an outlet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This may be an ideal solution for some people, but for myself, it fell short of my expectations</li>
            <li> She uses and has enjoyed the light that comes with this model as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, easy, comfortable and effective.    </li>
            <li> , Philips is WAY more gentle, I love it!</li>
            <li> - Plastic tweezers seem more friendly than metal chompers.  </li>
            <li> a rechargeable unit makes it a attractive  product at this price point and love that the cloth case actually sits flat&lt;br</li>
            <li> X&#x27;elle Easy Start Epilator]], [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> - Easy washing-- removable head can be rinsed out.  </li>
            <li> In this video, I demonstrate the features and use of the Satin Perfect epilator, and discuss issues such as pain, tips for success, and recommended aftercare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3 times now and it just gets easier to use (it&#x27;s easy to clean as well since the top part clicks off and separates).  </li>
            <li> it is easy to use, helpful.</li>
            <li> The head is easily removable for cleaning and it does come with a cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love it for Face fuzz of 58 year old skin :)</li>
            <li> I have fine hair on my legs and this didn&#x27;t pick up about a tenth of the hair.  </li>
            <li> Likes:    - Light and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> If not you may end up dealing with ingrown hairs and a bumpy skin instead of a nice smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;The machine itself is very noisy!</li>
            <li> But what the heck, I got it free for doing the evaluation.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin totally smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to follow the directions that recommend doing the removal at night</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use my mine every where - face, legs, feet (why do I  have hairy toes?), arms, underarms &amp; bikini area - so it&#x27;s important that the head doesn&#x27;t catch skin or pull.</li>
            <li> I like the light feature as it makes it easier to see the hair I want to remove.  </li>
            <li> Smooth legs, smooth armpits.</li>
            <li> skin stayed smooth and hair free for weeks.</li>
            <li> Since this was available through Vine</li>
            <li> There is a light that makes it easier to see</li>
            <li> I like how smooth my legs feel after using it.</li>
            <li> and i was surprised how good it was.</li>
            <li> Not being a contortionist, I wasn&#x27;t able to get the stretching right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad Amazon had this as a deal of the day right when I ran out of wax at home.  </li>
            <li> a very  nice pouch that actually  is designed to SIT on the counter vs. fall over&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall a very nice unit.  </li>
            <li> you can clean, a carry pouch, a light, pressure control, and an adapter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It picks up the hairs quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite appliance.  :-)</li>
            <li> It really does a better job than shaving with a razor and is really easy to use.  </li>
            <li> My wife had many electric razors throughout the years however this is the first time she has used  an \\&quot;Epilator\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> When I first used this, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> She opens the head and uses a spray can of air to completely clean the unit after each use.</li>
            <li> I feel much safer and more comfortable than with Braun.</li>
            <li> Philips is an European brand that is highly popular in Europe in terms of razors, etc, although here in the US is more known for bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;Get</li>
            <li> It does help the pain to cut any hair first, but using it, for instance, in an isolated area around an eyebrow is pretty effective.  </li>
            <li> so I feel this is a pretty fair review of a new product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After testing this epilator on my legs, I realized that I would not be able to endure having the hair pulled out from a much more sensitive area, my underarms, and possibly more intimate areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> having never  owned an epilator, but boy did I make the right choice!</li>
            <li> Seems more comfortable than older ones we&#x27;ve used though.    </li>
            <li> - it really helps to be able to see finer hair.  </li>
            <li> love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This device is good for delivering such pain and results, though.  </li>
            <li> The extra touches on this one make it a good  buy, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> After using many different epilators, this is the best one by far, so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s virtually painless to me, and it removes the hair quickly and thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> did do a decent job on my legs, but truthfully,</li>
            <li> It does pull some and it doesn&#x27;t feel real great, but I&#x27;ve never found a hair removal item that doesn&#x27;t, be it wax, tweezers or my medieval electric tweezers as mentioned above.</li>
            <li> The lite is handy to be able to see  the skin surface of you lower legs but can&#x27;t see what other use it might have.</li>
            <li> This is my very first epilator.  </li>
            <li> overall i am very glad i made my decision from philips side.</li>
            <li> of the things I have always envied about other women is their ablity to achieve near perfect underarm grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does do a great job of removing hair and slowing down regrowth, which is what I hoped for.  </li>
            <li> This epilator charged very quickly, and I was ready to do the deed in well under an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I will keep at it in the hopes that it only gets better!</li>
            <li> And, I was able to do my arms, face, sideburns and armpits in less time than it used to take me to warm up the microwaveable wax</li>
            <li> The sound is much louder than I anticipated and makes one cringe.  </li>
            <li> the LED light is VERY helpful.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it is cordless and has a light</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s face it, a gal wants to feel silky smooth....</li>
            <li> , this made every iota of the pain worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was it worth it?</li>
            <li> It does not remove the short hair effectively.</li>
            <li> but the results are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can honestly say that I probably won&#x27;t go back to using a razor again.  </li>
            <li> is absolutely worth it...and NO RAZOR</li>
            <li> Overall review: If you can get through the pain of the first use, you&#x27;ll fall in love with it!  </li>
            <li> A note about the price of epilators: It is more expensive at first, but an very good value over time.</li>
            <li> you will notice right off the bat</li>
            <li> NEVER be without the right batteries..</li>
            <li> And it won&#x27;t matter  if the electrical outlet is the right voltage.  </li>
            <li> I looked on amazon for one right away</li>
            <li> The charging cord is nice and long.</li>
            <li> The camera pans the leg, showing that it is now mostly smooth, with some fine hairs still present.  </li>
            <li> When the hair grew back after using the epilator, it was very fine and sparse.</li>
            <li> Giving up a couple of waxings will certainly pay for this!</li>
            <li> The head removes easily so you can clear out any hair.    </li>
            <li> For the record, I am somewhat fair and not super hairy.</li>
            <li> So the real issue became: my legs looked smooth, but really weren&#x27;t to the touch</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very effective hair removal device, even on my fine, thin hairs.  </li>
            <li> Very LOUD sound.</li>
            <li> It is VERY fast.</li>
            <li> I forgot about it until I used Philips again, but it makes a huge difference on more sensitive areas i.e. upper thighs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;Ow, that really hurts!  </li>
            <li> First off, it does hurt.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I have used that doesn&#x27;t use metal tweezer heads.</li>
            <li> The sound is LOUD..</li>
            <li> As for sound, it is considerable quite.</li>
            <li> Instead of the tweezers being silver like most epilators, they are actually white ceramic.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an epilator</li>
            <li> This is not my first epilator.  </li>
            <li> My old one had a ceramic tweezer system and this one is just as comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> This may be designed for women, but at our house, it is he who uses it the most for his shoulder and back area.</li>
            <li> Most definitely.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I had ever used an epilator</li>
            <li> i always plucced during day time thats why i am not sure how effective the light is.</li>
            <li> It did exactly what the item description states it will do.</li>
            <li> at first i thought it would hurt a lot, turns out it works well,</li>
            <li> I want to get used to using it on my legs first.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I&#x27;ll admit that it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;enjoyable&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I had the first leg done, longish hair without pain, in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> First, don&#x27;t judge the product by the first use.  </li>
            <li> not merely just look the part.</li>
            <li> Exfoliating the skin with a good scrub for a few days before and after exfoliating will be helpful.</li>
            <li> The price may seem a little high however the prices on good electric razors are in the same price range and this unit is far superior.</li>
            <li> epilator left my skin smooth, it does take hair our very well, much better than my old epilator.</li>
            <li> If you already use one, and the pain doesn&#x27;t bother you, then this item is nice due to</li>
            <li> It is cordless, and rechargeable, and a bonus is the handy light to use on hard to see areas.  </li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I read many different reviews, like you are now, and I was very iffy about buying this product.</li>
            <li> I have double duty hair on my lower legs - most of it is very coarse, but some of it is somewhat fine.  </li>
            <li> Just rinse the top two pieces under hot water and let dry.  </li>
            <li> After the first time it does not pain too much.</li>
            <li> Also, I found making fast swipes and lots of them the first time was easier to get through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This morning I touched up some of the spots I missed (about 5 days after the first use) and it didn&#x27;t hurt much all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Right out of the box, I saw that the epilator is a high quality product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned an older emjoi, then the emjoi gently caress, and most recently the braun silk epi exelle.</li>
            <li> I certainly won&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve found that if I dry my skin really well after a shower it works better.  </li>
            <li> I finally  decided to make the switch to something that would be long lasting and  hopefully more effective.</li>
            <li> It has a nice design on it and when you plug it in a little battery flashes to let you know it&#x27;s charging.</li>
            <li> The little bag is nice.  </li>
            <li> And wow, it was FAST!!</li>
            <li> The dialog is real, recorded by my husband without my knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t holding out much hope for the \\&quot;Perfect\\&quot; Epilator.  </li>
            <li> It has two speeds and both of them seem to be extremely fast.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t refer to pain, it really depends on every person&#x27;s sensitivity to epilation.</li>
            <li> it really allows you to see missed hair and saves time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Emjoi Gently Gold Cordless Rechargable Hair Removal System]], [[ASIN:B001EWFBLQ Braun 5180</li>
            <li> - Built-in led light gives extra visibility where you need to go.  </li>
            <li> The emjoi epilators don&#x27;t hurt as much</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get used to the sensation of hair being pulled out and the more you use it the hair gets finer and in most cases will not grow back after a few years of use.</li>
            <li> my legs are still hair free almost a week later.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work well</li>
            <li> It really hurts.  </li>
            <li> Does it hurt as much as waxing?  </li>
            <li> This device travels charged and ready.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to hit the beach.  </li>
            <li> There are some that say that it hurt, but for me, not so much.</li>
            <li> Again, I didn&#x27;t feel much pain (I wouldn&#x27;t even call it pain).</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t bother you that much anymore.</li>
            <li> highly recommend giving it a chance!</li>
            <li> I never actually had smooth legs.</li>
            <li> She just goes in the bathroom and with this epilator, she&#x27;s ready to go in about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The promise of a smooth face and chin are finally fulfilled.</li>
            <li> Rely on it as much as razor for my face.</li>
            <li> If you are a first time epilator, keep in mind that you do NOT need to press down on the epilator - just allow it to pass on top of the skin.  </li>
            <li> This has been very useful in our international travels.</li>
            <li> battery lasts longer then needed to do both legs and any other spots, and rapid charges very fast...would consider buying another one, love the ceramic tips...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very important to exfoliate regularly and make sure your skin and body hair is dry prior to using.</li>
            <li> My wife found that if the hairs are allowed to grow a little the removal is very easy with the epilator.</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t need to shave every other day!But you have to give it a chance.</li>
            <li> but I would like it if the light was adjustable or a little less bright to prevent glare.</li>
            <li> The first few seconds I was definitely in more pain as it was a shock.</li>
            <li> In the summer, this will be a huge timesaver since I normally shave every 2-3 days with a regular razor!</li>
            <li> I am able to do my legs much faster than with previous epilators.</li>
            <li> The light is placed well for lighting up the area you are working on and the charge holds for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t need to shave every other day!</li>
            <li> and I developed  little sensitivity to any kind of wax.</li>
            <li> I understand with this type of shaver that the more times you use it the less discomfort as the hairs grow in thinner.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly on my legs, where the pain is somewhat less.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t go for a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> This unit in particular is the nicest epilator I&#x27;ve seen:    </li>
            <li> She had used an epilator for a number of years, but it was a much older model and required a power</li>
            <li> Leaving my skin very smooth, and hairless, this little tool works well.  </li>
            <li> I sat down after a nice long shower, made sure that my legs were dry and began.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very loud and it hurts!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this device.</li>
            <li> It is obviously a high end epilator</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was kind of surprised that I didn&#x27;t really mind it either in fast or slow gear.</li>
            <li> due to the options for speed, lite to see what you are doing on lower extremities, rechargeability is a big plus and a nice case to tuck away the product in a suitcase for travel.</li>
            <li> It does hurt, like little pins pricking your skin, but it&#x27;s nothing I can&#x27;t handle, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li> It was a little more of a deal from the legs, but it didn&#x27;t stop me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I use it on my arms or face, it hurts a little more than I want.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to hold no matter where you are shaving due to the shape.</li>
            <li> Got!&lt;br /&gt;The old one is not retired yet, going to use as a travel options.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing design, very comfortable to use, much less growing into skin hair, don&#x27;t need to shave often.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> I have cavities filled without novocaine, but I&#x27;m not ready to make an epilator part of my routine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an epilator for 4 years, so I&#x27;ve already developed a tolerance for the pain and can&#x27;t really address that as a beginner in my review.</li>
            <li> and I normally don&#x27;t write reviews about these things because let&#x27;s face it</li>
            <li> I was very cautious at first, but again, no big deal.</li>
            <li> I am able to do both underarms in less than 5 minutes!</li>
            <li> The light makes it so much easier to use than any of the other ones I&#x27;ve had, and somehow the ceramic grippers on this thing work well and so fast that you barely feel it.  </li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t use it right outside the sleeping baby&#x27;s room at night.  </li>
            <li> There are very few hairs that even grow on my legs now (like 1 every 2 or 3 inches of leg) and those are very fine.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it takes several passes in different directions to get absolutely all the fine hairs, but to just have to shave every couple of days with no mess</li>
            <li> Personally, I use this epilator for my legs and have to use it about once every 2 weeks before the hair that grows back becomes noticeable which I believe is a great alternative to shaving, which some people how to do every few days!</li>
            <li> - Nice little white zip-up carrying bag.    </li>
            <li> so i decided to buy  new epilator.</li>
            <li> B000F4USEY Panasonic ES2045P Wet/Dry Two-Speed Epilator with Three Heads (Pink)]], and most recently [[ASIN:B003H6FPVI Remington EP6025</li>
            <li> When using on my underarms, I actually have to use the lower setting because the fast setting is too fast.</li>
            <li> The amount that grew back was light in color and not at all noticeable like it would be with regular shaving.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin that gets red bumps easily, and this causes the bumps in those latter two areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charge time is very fast, only about an hour.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> three-star rating is due to the epilator&#x27;s noisiness and the fact that it removed most but not all the hair in its path, leaving about one-tenth of my hair unplucked even after multiple passes.  </li>
            <li> And boy, have I been pleasantly surprised!    </li>
            <li> But definite advantage of plastic (or ceramic) disks is that it does not hurt as much as the metal ones in Braun!</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth it to buy a long term reusable hair removal device like an epilator.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it correspond exactly to what I am expecting about a epilator, the essential : Epilate.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use features and little storage bag.</li>
            <li> OK - &#x27;comfortable&#x27; is a relative term, but anyone who uses an epilator regularly will know what I mean.</li>
            <li> The hair removal is done quickly and with absolutely no scratches, pressure or pain.</li>
            <li> begins to buzz loudly.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention it&#x27;s loud</li>
            <li> much louder than my current Emjoi</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t  have to worry about running out of razors or if having the time in my  busy schedule to go and get waxed.</li>
            <li> So now I found few Phillips available, and went with this one.</li>
            <li> i am 35 years old</li>
            <li> It works well, but is loud - thus the four star rating.</li>
            <li> this is loud</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to be near an outlet when you are using it.</li>
            <li> Completely done with both legs in 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> The charge holds for a long time and charging it back up is quick - you can even use it plugged in if your charge dies..</li>
            <li> And a little of pulling is worth it to me!  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it did sting just a little bit, and I had to go over my legs a few times just to make sure I got it all</li>
            <li> If you have the guts to try epilation, particularly if you dare to do your underarms, you may never go back.  </li>
            <li> The epilator removed the coarse hair pretty well, but took several passes in each area.  </li>
            <li> If you have a low pain tolerance, then purchase a topical anesthetic first.  </li>
            <li> Her old epilator made it sound like she was running a small chainsaw.</li>
            <li> My old epilator finally died after 4+ of service, so I decided to go for a new Philips.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> But I did want to compare the Philips Satin Perfect Epilator to my previous epilator, the Braun 5270 Silk Epil X&#x27;elle, which I&#x27;d grown unhappy with.</li>
            <li> extra wide head makes pluccing finish quickly.</li>
            <li> The honey made such a huge mess.</li>
            <li> second problem was that the epilator requires stretching the skin tight and using a light hand.</li>
            <li> but I rinsed with cold water and applied a fragrance free lotion afterwards so my legs felt fine.</li>
            <li> So I have gone back to shaving in the last year and have really missed not having to worry about shaving all the time.</li>
            <li> After 4+ years it doesn&#x27;t really hurt and I won&#x27;t pay extra for fancy extra features, like massagers and numbing wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is nice to have a light, but this one is not directed on your skin, but instead you have to stare at it all the time, which is annoying.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but after testing it out last night, I would have to say it works fairly well.  </li>
            <li> Other things you might be interested to know...  </li>
            <li> cannot compare it to any other epilators as this is my first.  </li>
            <li> noticed that the description of the product talks about facial hair removal but the directions that came with it clearly state that it&#x27;s for hair removal below the neck</li>
            <li> The first time using an epilator is kind of painful.  </li>
            <li> The hair that grows back is soft and not prickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then did a strip all the way up to my knee and still felt barely anything.</li>
            <li> Obviously I like to try new epilators, so when I found this one I definitely wanted to get it.   </li>
            <li> That was one of the problems I had with the Braun -- it seemed that I could never get it clean enough, especially when I lost the little brush</li>
            <li> So if you are brave of heart and are sick of waxing, by all means consider this as an option.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t shower first as I normally do before epilating, and it had been a week since I last epilated... which usually means pain.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, the first time I used this epilator, it caused severe irritation because I was pressing down during the multiple passes on my legs.  </li>
            <li> other issue with using epilation in general (and not this one in particular) is that it requires quite a bit of prepwork.</li>
            <li> - This is still an epilator, which requires patience and a bit of pain to work with, especially the first few times.  </li>
            <li> The epilator didn&#x27;t do as well removing the fine hair, even on the lowest setting with very slow passes.  </li>
            <li> No one will be able to hear it behind a closed bathroom door when the shower water is running.</li>
            <li> A torn rotator cuff, a ruptured biceps tendon, a ruptured cervical disc, very sensitive skin,  a propensity for developing razor burn, and naturally dark body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My leg hair wasn&#x27;t quite long enough for the epilator to grab it all, but I tested it on my husband and it definitely works.  </li>
            <li> Once you get through the first one, then I advise you to use the epilator at least once a week to keep it up.  </li>
            <li> and I expect it to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> About me:  42 year old Caucasian female with thin, straight brown hair.  </li>
            <li> It pinched the skin behind my knees and sometimes on my underarms, it took more than 20 minutes to do one leg just up to the knee, and if I didn&#x27;t do it every 3-4 days, it became painful again unless I shaved first (in which case the whole process of shaving plus epilating took an hour).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading lots of reviews</li>
            <li> really didn&#x27;t want or need this epilator for my legs, due to some genetic quirk, I have less hair on my legs than I do in my eyebrows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Epilator is find instrument that is far better than painful waxing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I picked this product up a few months ago after reviewing nearly all of the possible options.</li>
            <li> Of course, like any other epilator out there - it takes time, it is a little noisy, and it really does not pull ALL the hair</li>
            <li> It is a little quieter than other epilators I have used (although no epilator is really \\&quot;quiet\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> It definitely isn&#x27;t a problem with the outlet I&#x27;m using to charge it because I can charge other things from the same outlet.  </li>
            <li> its been about that long</li>
            <li> I am a long time epilator user..</li>
            <li> I am a long term epilator user and have owned [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> and I did get a minor rash</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very difficult for me to shave my underarms, and I was hoping that epilating my underarms would be a better way to groom than using a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not pleasant the first time you use it.    </li>
            <li> It is not pleasant the first time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to pick up tiny stubble as well as some other epilators, but overall the quality of the product surpasses other epilators.  </li>
            <li> charge lasts for a long time!</li>
            <li> After a week, I only had a few finer hairs back</li>
            <li> I bought an old version 10 years ago in Europe, and couldn&#x27;t find at least something close enough in US.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I found the slow speed less painful than the fast and similarly effective.  </li>
            <li> so my hair is pretty thin at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Had to give you the full picture... sorry).</li>
            <li> I have to repeatedly move it up and down the area with short hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to go over the same area over and over, so there&#x27;s a lot less skin irritation and pinching.  </li>
            <li> Awful, not sure what the point of this is, sure it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as others, but I&#x27;ve been using epilators for 15 years and this one does nothing, it leaves behind all the hairs, you can go over it 20 times and not pick it up, where as my old one even in it&#x27;s current broken state picks up more hairs.  </li>
            <li> since I have so little hair on my legs, it would have probably been faster to do the job with a regular pair of tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After use, my legs were red and bumpy (little red spots) for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Also my legs were irritated for a few hours and red where the hairs were pulled out.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward (not really) to using it on my bikini area to see if the pain is reduced there as well.  </li>
            <li> shipping was on time , packaging was how i expected.</li>
            <li> However, subsequent uses are not near as painful because the amount of hair that grows back is much less than the first use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t downgrade it due to the pain it caused.  </li>
            <li> However, it is not an extreme pain at all.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first</li>
            <li> After opening it, it looked pretty scary.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, this hurts.  </li>
            <li> That is to be expected - you&#x27;re ripping hair out at the root!  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> and price was also lower than philips web side and other market prices.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, the problem I face is separating the pain from the product.  </li>
            <li> When I first tried it I was uncomfortable due to the amount of hairs coming out.</li>
            <li> Having never waxed my legs before, I was definitely uncomfortable the first time I used the epilator.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other \\&quot;electric</li>
            <li> It gets less and less painful with each use and it seems to produce better results each time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of this device as it is my first try with an epilator.</li>
            <li> (small tiny ones are still there waiting their turn when they grow a little).</li>
            <li> It was charged out of the box (at least enough to do two legs and two armpits).</li>
            <li> If we need to go to the beach on short notice, she doesn&#x27;t have to complain that she hasn&#x27;t had a waxing lately.</li>
            <li> The epilator can be locked for travel so that the thing doesn&#x27;t turn on on the suitcase and run down the battery.</li>
            <li> It took me about a half hour to do both legs from the knee down.</li>
            <li> slight flaw of this epilator would be in my opinion its \\&quot;Opti-light\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> If you have ever tried waxing, it hurt noticeable less.</li>
            <li> I just used it on my armpits and there was MUCHHH less pain,</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and thin, my skin is sensitive, and either the method hurt, it didn&#x27;t work well, or it irritated the crap out of my skin.    </li>
            <li> It was a little time consuming.</li>
            <li> And a little on the pricey side for an epilator&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does take a little getting used to</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get used to it after you use it for a little while.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get used to it after you use it for a little while.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re using and epilator, there&#x27;s a little sting as it removes hair from your body.</li>
            <li> I plugged it in, put on the hair lifter attachment, and tried one little patch of long-ish hair on speed 1.</li>
            <li> I know it is really plucking and not just cutting the hairs (which leads me to wonder whether my previous epilators were truly plucking the hairs as well).   </li>
            <li> Also, the hairs grow back very slowly.</li>
            <li> the noise epilator creates is little weird comparing to my old one.</li>
            <li> As the directions say might happen, I did have a few ingrown hairs on the thigh</li>
            <li> and I credit my inexperience with device for the hairs that it left behind.  </li>
            <li> After the first few seconds it isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> The second time I used this it was much less painful and left no rash or stinging.  </li>
            <li> However, I really feel like it wound up being less painful than waxing.     </li>
            <li> I have to admit that the first swipe across my legs was painful</li>
            <li> It is definitely painful at first but in a comparitively insensitive area like the legs it is not too bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and, when the discs touched the skin it yanked off little chunks of skin!</li>
            <li> It really hurts and you are supposed to keep running it up your leg to painfully remove the rest of the hairs.</li>
            <li> I use to wax my legs but had to stop after having my second child because it was expensive</li>
            <li> It also leaves a lot of hair that still need to be shaved unless you go over the area repetitively.</li>
            <li> one might get from an ordinary electric razor.</li>
            <li> At first I was disappointed because on the box it says \\&quot;cordless use,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> As a man, I&#x27;ve used it in small areas.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The spinning disks run along your skin and pull your hairs out in a small patch leaving spots of blood where your folicle is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every method of hair removal over the years, from the original Epilady to creams to razors to waxes, and hated them all.  </li>
            <li> it is not very pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> I used the highest speed setting and after applying it to my hairy skin, I hardly felt any pain.</li>
            <li> Wax doesn&#x27;t travel and shaving sucks.  </li>
            <li> My wife was doing a lot of waxing, but it got expensive and often the people doing it would door a poor job and leave her wanting a 2nd one just to fix it.</li>
            <li> Slowly, a hand enters the frame, holding a Philips HP6576/60</li>
            <li> It was very painful the first time when I used it to remove my leg hair.</li>
            <li> In fact it hurt less than Nair, which gave me a weird burning sensation in my nips (not supposed to use it in that area</li>
            <li> For a serious razor clutz like myself (my legs are criss crossed with unintentional \\&quot;How</li>
            <li> It is very loud and the noise is annoying.</li>
            <li> It hurts really bad especially on the bikini area.</li>
            <li> yet since I&#x27;m getting over a broken leg and can&#x27;t maneuver there yet.  </li>
            <li> Philips is less painful but still does have some pain and does not get skin caught in blades like the Emjoi does.</li>
            <li> its painful little bit but its not like unbearable.  </li>
            <li> It can be very painful especially on thicker coarser hairs</li>
            <li> Really scary devices that could rip your skin to shreds in addition to yanking out your hair.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry.</li>
            <li> Braun would pull my skin, so it would leave nasty red bloodshot spots</li>
            <li> I would be quite unhappy if it didn&#x27;t support this these days.</li>
            <li> option to use when it plugged in, don&#x27;t need to wait till fully charged, which I have in Panasonic version (going to rid of it, very bad and painful experience, not cheap...</li>
            <li> This product is just to painful to use.</li>
            <li> After a while, I got used to the sensation, but you must remember that this does pull the hair out, and that is painful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using it in the armpits was a disaster for two reasons - it was horrendously painful.</li>
            <li> painful compare to others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> Sick of  buying disposable razors or going to get pricey waxes</li>
            <li> I got sick to my stomach from the pain, and I&#x27;m not a weakling.  </li>
            <li> I used this stupid thing 5 times and now it won&#x27;t start.  </li>
            <li> , it hurts terribly to use these things.</li>

            <li> Close-up:  A woman&#x27;s leg, tan but stubbly.  Slowly, a hand enters the frame, holding a Philips HP6576/60 Satin Perfect Epilator (white/purple),  The hand&#x27;s thumb clicks the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button and the epilator begins to buzz loudly.  The hand cautiously lowers the epilator to the leg and begins to run it up the shin.  A voice is heard:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Ow, that really hurts!  Son of a [bleep]!\\&quot; But the hand continues to run the epilator on the leg until, a minute later, it shuts off the epilator. The camera pans the leg, showing that it is now mostly smooth, with some fine hairs still present.  The voice is heard again: \\&quot;No [bleep]ing way I&#x27;m doing this. It hurts like a son of a [bleep]!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fadeout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leg, hand and voice were mine.  The dialog is real, recorded by my husband without my knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remembered the old-time epilators.  Really scary devices that could rip your skin to shreds in addition to yanking out your hair.  I heard they are much better now, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  This epilator charged very quickly, and I was ready to do the deed in well under an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any way this thing could cut into your skin.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do: pull out your hair by its roots.  It doesn&#x27;t get everything, though.  I have fine hair on my legs and this didn&#x27;t pick up about a tenth of the hair.  Not to mention it&#x27;s loud and it hurts!  I have cavities filled without novocaine, but I&#x27;m not ready to make an epilator part of my routine.  For anybody who waxes, this will probably be no big deal, in which case I say go for it.  For myself, I&#x27;ll just shave, thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My three-star rating is due to the epilator&#x27;s noisiness and the fact that it removed most but not all the hair in its path, leaving about one-tenth of my hair unplucked even after multiple passes.  I didn&#x27;t downgrade it due to the pain it caused.  I figure that goes with the territory.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every method of hair removal over the years, from the original Epilady to creams to razors to waxes, and hated them all.  My hair is fine and thin, my skin is sensitive, and either the method hurt, it didn&#x27;t work well, or it irritated the crap out of my skin.    I wasn&#x27;t holding out much hope for the \\&quot;Perfect\\&quot; Epilator.  But what the heck, I got it free for doing the evaluation.  And boy, have I been pleasantly surprised!    It&#x27;s a very effective hair removal device, even on my fine, thin hairs.  The light makes it so much easier to use than any of the other ones I&#x27;ve had, and somehow the ceramic grippers on this thing work well and so fast that you barely feel it.  I don&#x27;t have to go over the same area over and over, so there&#x27;s a lot less skin irritation and pinching.  It&#x27;s quick, easy, comfortable and effective.    It&#x27;s such a pleasure to get a personal care appliance that actually works as advertised!</li>
            <li> The best epilator there is in the mart.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing come close.&lt;br /&gt;Painful at 1st but u will get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Fast.&lt;br /&gt;Effective.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of this device as it is my first try with an epilator. I use to wax my legs but had to stop after having my second child because it was expensive and I developed  little sensitivity to any kind of wax. So I have gone back to shaving in the last year and have really missed not having to worry about shaving all the time. I am so glad I gave this device a try.     First off, it does hurt. However, it is not an extreme pain at all. After the first few seconds it isn&#x27;t bad at all. The first few seconds I was definitely in more pain as it was a shock. However, I really feel like it wound up being less painful than waxing.     It was a little time consuming. It took me about a half hour to do both legs from the knee down. Of course, by the time you go to a salon and get your legs waxed its been about that long and you are out more money. Also my legs were irritated for a few hours and red where the hairs were pulled out. That is about the same as with the waxing experience. Furthermore, it was very easy to clean. The head removes easily so you can clear out any hair.    I am extremely happy with the results. I don&#x27;t anticipate getting four weeks out of one use but it seems it will be about 2 - 3 with my rate of hair growth. I highly recommend this device.</li>
            <li> Give me a razor and a bar of soap and I&#x27;ll be a happy girl.  While this is a great idea, and the product itself is really cute looking...it&#x27;s very loud and it hurts!  It has two speeds and both of them seem to be extremely fast.  The sound is much louder than I anticipated and makes one cringe.  I tried it on my leg and all I could get it to do was feel like it was pinching me.  I personally would rather spend 5 minutes shaving every so often than endure the 30 plus minutes it takes to use this torture!  If you already use one, and the pain doesn&#x27;t bother you, then this item is nice due to it&#x27;s easy to use features and little storage bag.</li>
            <li> I am sorry. I realy wanted this to work. This product is just to painful to use. It also leaves a lot of hair that still need to be shaved unless you go over the area repetitively. Again ouch.</li>
            <li> This is not an electric razor. My wife had many electric razors throughout the years however this is the first time she has used  an \\&quot;Epilator\\&quot;. She advises it is wonderful. The hair removal is done quickly and with absolutely no scratches, pressure or pain. The unit works as advertised. The unit has been charged once and after days of use it is still fully charged. You can hold the unit in your hand with confidence that it is not about to fall apart as this is a quality made machine. The rotating heads cut the hairs smoothly and quickly and my wife says it is by far the best she has ever owned.The disc are quite. My wife found that if the hairs are allowed to grow a little the removal is very easy with the epilator. Cleanup is a snap---do not put it in water. She opens the head and uses a spray can of air to completely clean the unit after each use.You do not have to apply a lot of pressure when using thus your skin does not take the beating one might get from an ordinary electric razor. She travels with the unit as it comes with the cord and epilator in a nice travel bag. The price may seem a little high however the prices on good electric razors are in the same price range and this unit is far superior.</li>
            <li> I am a long time epilator user..so I feel this is a pretty fair review of a new product.&lt;br /&gt;First let me say epilating isn&#x27;t for everyone but once you start it is the only way. This product comes in a attractive package with all the needed  items&lt;br /&gt;i.e. a brush for cleaning the head&lt;br /&gt;  a very  nice pouch that actually  is designed to SIT on the counter vs. fall over&lt;br /&gt;  a plug in charger&lt;br /&gt;  Instruction manual&lt;br /&gt;One item you will notice right off the bat it this unit has  2 Speeds and a LITE.. The head of the unit is made out of either a plastic or possibly ceramic tweezer heads. This is the first epilator I have used that doesn&#x27;t use metal tweezer heads. The lite is handy to be able to see  the skin surface of you lower legs but can&#x27;t see what other use it might have. The sound is LOUD.. much louder than my current Emjoi but it is what it is and this is a product you would use in private anyway. I do like that it is a rechargeable unit  NEVER be without the right batteries.. when you need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Function.. this is where this product lost one STAR... I did a test using this product and then using my current epilator ... The Phillips did an OK  job of  hair removal but when  I did the same area using my current model with the metal tweezers it picked up much smaller, thinner hair strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in Summary:&lt;br /&gt; .......  Pro&#x27;s are  that is appears and feels like a solid unit with a lite head and 2 speeds.&lt;br /&gt;  a rechargeable unit makes it a attractive  product at this price point and love that the cloth case actually sits flat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; .......  Con&#x27;s are that it didn&#x27;t do as good a job for me as my  metal tip model. Very LOUD sound. And a little on the pricey side for an epilator&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations:&lt;br /&gt;  This would be a good choice for a first time epilator. due to the options for speed, lite to see what you are doing on lower extremities, rechargeability is a big plus and a nice case to tuck away the product in a suitcase for travel.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use before a beach getaway I had planned. Sick of  buying disposable razors or going to get pricey waxes I finally  decided to make the switch to something that would be long lasting and  hopefully more effective. I was a bit skeptical at first having never  owned an epilator, but boy did I make the right choice! Now I don&#x27;t  have to worry about running out of razors or if having the time in my  busy schedule to go and get waxed. Most importantly I did not want to  have to worry about hair regrowth while I was on vacation and found  that once I used used the epilator I did not have to use it again for  about two weeks! It does take a little getting used to (I won&#x27;t lie  and say its totally painless), but once you get the hang of it I bet  you will be like me and not go back to regular shaving!</li>
            <li> I am an experienced user of epilators. My old epilator finally died after 4+ of service, so I decided to go for a new Philips.&lt;br /&gt;This one doesn&#x27;t have a shaver or tweezers and I don&#x27;t need that. I won&#x27;t refer to pain, it really depends on every person&#x27;s sensitivity to epilation. After 4+ years it doesn&#x27;t really hurt and I won&#x27;t pay extra for fancy extra features, like massagers and numbing wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator left my skin smooth, it does take hair our very well, much better than my old epilator. the LED light is VERY helpful. it really allows you to see missed hair and saves time.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a nice travel bag. You can use it while charging. Looks good and feel good in hand.&lt;br /&gt;I like this epilator a lot and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t go for a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> I have been epilating for over 20 years, so I can say I have some experience in this area. I used to use Phillips in Europe, but when I moved to the USA, it was not that popular, so I went with Braun. I have been using my last one for couple of years until my dog ate it (!). So now I found few Phillips available, and went with this one. I am already very happy with my choice! Of course, like any other epilator out there - it takes time, it is a little noisy, and it really does not pull ALL the hair (small tiny ones are still there waiting their turn when they grow a little). But definite advantage of plastic (or ceramic) disks is that it does not hurt as much as the metal ones in Braun! I forgot about it until I used Philips again, but it makes a huge difference on more sensitive areas i.e. upper thighs. Braun would pull my skin, so it would leave nasty red bloodshot spots, Philips is WAY more gentle, I love it! I use it on my armpits and bikini area and it I feel much safer and more comfortable than with Braun. I am very happy I decided to buy Philips!&lt;br /&gt;One slight flaw of this epilator would be in my opinion its \\&quot;Opti-light\\&quot;. It is nice to have a light, but this one is not directed on your skin, but instead you have to stare at it all the time, which is annoying. i think I am going to put a piece of masking tape over it :)</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this Philips Epilator and I cannot be any happier. Keep in mind that I am a guy. I bought this version from Philips because it was noticeable cheaper and didn&#x27;t vary at all from the one that is marketed for men (only the color was different). Let me start off by saying that I read many different reviews, like you are now, and I was very iffy about buying this product. One day I took a chance just clicked buy now. It took two days to arrive (Amazon student prime account). After opening it, it looked pretty scary. I got how it worked, just all the teeth had me worried about it grabbing ahold of my skin and hurting me in some way. When I finally gave it awhirl, it worked perfectly. I used the highest speed setting and after applying it to my hairy skin, I hardly felt any pain. If you have ever tried waxing, it hurt noticeable less. In fact it hurt less than Nair, which gave me a weird burning sensation in my nips (not supposed to use it in that area but I did). Anyway, most of the hair was ripped out immediately. Sometimes another passthrough was needed, big deal. The fact that this unit has a battery was great since you do not need to stand near an outlet. Its perfectly portable. As for sound, it is considerable quite. No one will be able to hear it behind a closed bathroom door when the shower water is running. I definitely recommend this to anyone out there and I hope you all took time to read this review.</li>
            <li> I like it. It&#x27;s much better than shaving and/or waxing. After the first time it does not pain too much.</li>
            <li> I am a long term epilator user and have owned [[ASIN:B001NX02HO Emjoi Gently Gold Cordless Rechargable Hair Removal System]], [[ASIN:B001EWFBLQ Braun 5180 Silk-Epil X&#x27;elle Easy Start Epilator]], [[ASIN:B000F4USEY Panasonic ES2045P Wet/Dry Two-Speed Epilator with Three Heads (Pink)]], and most recently [[ASIN:B003H6FPVI Remington EP6025 Womens  Recharegeable Epilator with Bonus Facial Epilator Attachment]]. Obviously I like to try new epilators, so when I found this one I definitely wanted to get it.   Right out of the box, I saw that the epilator is a high quality product. Instead of the tweezers being silver like most epilators, they are actually white ceramic. It has a nice design on it and when you plug it in a little battery flashes to let you know it&#x27;s charging. It stops to let you know when it&#x27;s fully charged, and turns red when the battery is low. At first I was disappointed because on the box it says \\&quot;cordless use,\\&quot; so I thought it could only be used cordless. Well for those who are wondering, it can also be plugged in and used.   It is a little quieter than other epilators I have used (although no epilator is really \\&quot;quiet\\&quot;). It is VERY fast. I am able to do my legs much faster than with previous epilators. It picks up the hairs quickly and easily. When using on my underarms, I actually have to use the lower setting because the fast setting is too fast. I am able to do both underarms in less than 5 minutes! The hairs collect under the tweezers and I can see the root of the hairs, so I know it is really plucking and not just cutting the hairs (which leads me to wonder whether my previous epilators were truly plucking the hairs as well).   The charge time is very fast, only about an hour. It says you get 40 minutes of cordless use, and I haven&#x27;t timed myself but I was able to do both legs and underarms and haven&#x27;t needed to recharge yet.   Other things you might be interested to know...  There is no cover. I would prefer a cover but the efficiency of the epilator makes up for this.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to pick up tiny stubble as well as some other epilators, but overall the quality of the product surpasses other epilators.  The set that I received came with the epilator, charger, cleaning brush, and pouch.   It is obviously a high end epilator and I expect it to last for a long time. Includes a 2 year warranty.   A note about the price of epilators: It is more expensive at first, but an very good value over time. If you use 1 razorblade per week for a year at $10 for 4 blades, that works out to about $120 a year to shave. So if an epilator lasts you 5 years for example, it works out to this:  Epilator: $100  Shaving: $600!!  It is definitely worth it to buy a long term reusable hair removal device like an epilator.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice epilator.  It is an epilator, though, which is basically a mechanical set of tweezers that pulls hair out.  It is not pleasant the first time you use it.    With patience and a light touch (don&#x27;t use it like a razor, it will hurrrt), using it gets better and better.  And the results last longer than shaving.    This unit in particular is the nicest epilator I&#x27;ve seen:    Likes:    - Light and easy to hold.  - Built-in led light gives extra visibility where you need to go.  - Plastic tweezers seem more friendly than metal chompers.  - Contoured head.  Very cool design they way the head is curved and works well in practice.  - Lithium Ion battery: this is high-end electronics with a lasting charge and plenty of power.  - Hair removal.   Leaves skin totally smooth.  No stubble.  - Easy washing-- removable head can be rinsed out.  Comes with cleaning brush.  - Nice little white zip-up carrying bag.    Dislikes:  - This is still an epilator, which requires patience and a bit of pain to work with, especially the first few times.  Seems more comfortable than older ones we&#x27;ve used though.    Overall a very nice unit.  Great industrial design and ergonomics.   Great results.    Tips:    Read the directions, there are some good tips on how to use this thing (e.g. stretch your skin, use light touch, consider exfoliating scrub days before and/or after).    Consider splashing with a nice witch hazel astringent afterwards.  [...]</li>
            <li> When I first used this, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I have to admit that the first swipe across my legs was painful and I wondered what I got myself into. I had never used an epilator before.  After a while, I got used to the sensation, but you must remember that this does pull the hair out, and that is painful. However, subsequent uses are not near as painful because the amount of hair that grows back is much less than the first use. After use, my legs were red and bumpy (little red spots) for a few hours. It&#x27;s important to follow the directions that recommend doing the removal at night so you have until morning for the redness to go away. This matters if you intend to wear shorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that some almond body oil soothed any irritation that I had immediately after hair removal. The instructions recommend any soothing lotion that doesn&#x27;t have alcohol in it. I have very sensitive skin and I didn&#x27;t find the temporary discomfort a big deal. As the directions say might happen, I did have a few ingrown hairs on the thigh area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about this epilator is that it has a light, so it makes it really easy to see the hairs. Also, the hairs grow back very slowly. After a week, I only had a few finer hairs back and I did a touch-up. The following week, I did another touch-up. The amount that grew back was light in color and not at all noticeable like it would be with regular shaving. The hair that grows back is soft and not prickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts for a long time! The epilator can be locked for travel so that the thing doesn&#x27;t turn on on the suitcase and run down the battery. The charging cord is nice and long. It&#x27;s easy to clean after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t yet tried this for underarm hair removal. I wanted to see how my legs responded first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that the description of the product talks about facial hair removal but the directions that came with it clearly state that it&#x27;s for hair removal below the neck only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. But you have to give it a chance. You&#x27;ll get used to it after you use it for a little while. I love that I don&#x27;t need to shave every other day!But you have to give it a chance. You&#x27;ll get used to it after you use it for a little while. I love that I don&#x27;t need to shave every other day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 3 epilators before this one and I normally don&#x27;t write reviews about these things because let&#x27;s face it, it hurts terribly to use these things. I&#x27;ve owned an older emjoi, then the emjoi gently caress, and most recently the braun silk epi exelle. The emjoi epilators don&#x27;t hurt as much but it is not as efficient at pulling out hairs. The braun silk gets everything but the pain is BLINDING!! It hurts really bad especially on the bikini area. However I put up with it for many years now since this was the most efficient epilator for awhile on the market, until I decided to purchase this epilator. I just used it on my armpits and there was MUCHHH less pain, however it was amazing and tweezing of all the hairs. I am looking forward (not really) to using it on my bikini area to see if the pain is reduced there as well.  After using many different epilators, this is the best one by far, so far.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an epilator and I was pleasantly surprised at the excellent job the epilator does when used on the legs. It is definitely painful at first but in a comparitively insensitive area like the legs it is not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;Using it in the armpits was a disaster for two reasons - it was horrendously painful. That may be different for a different person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second problem was that the epilator requires stretching the skin tight and using a light hand. Not being a contortionist, I wasn&#x27;t able to get the stretching right and, when the discs touched the skin it yanked off little chunks of skin! I wonder if a mesh screen attachment might not have taken care of this problem. The bottom line is that for use on armpit hair it is not very pleasant at all. So, for me, legs are an option, anything else is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other issue with using epilation in general (and not this one in particular) is that it requires quite a bit of prepwork. Exfoliating the skin with a good scrub for a few days before and after exfoliating will be helpful. If not you may end up dealing with ingrown hairs and a bumpy skin instead of a nice smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;The machine itself is very noisy! The light is placed well for lighting up the area you are working on and the charge holds for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good purchase if you prep well.</li>
            <li> This is not my first epilator.  I owned and used an EpiLady many years ago.  It pulled and pinched and required a lot of effort to remove most, but not all, of the hair on my legs.  I finally gave up using it.  I did not anticipate just how much better this Philips model would work.  It&#x27;s virtually painless to me, and it removes the hair quickly and thoroughly.  Being cordless and rechargeable is a big plus.  This is my new favorite appliance.  :-)</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:4a9c8a135b537ef7a2e08d09d2d1be5c]] Imagine this:  you go on a two-week vacation, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about shaving, not once.  If you have the guts to try epilation, particularly if you dare to do your underarms, you may never go back.  I certainly won&#x27;t.  In this video, I demonstrate the features and use of the Satin Perfect epilator, and discuss issues such as pain, tips for success, and recommended aftercare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an epilator for almost 20 years and have used all types of styles. This one is definitely one of the best I ever used. There&#x27;s no such thing as a perfect epilator but the Philips Satin Perfect is as close as you can get. I use my mine every where - face, legs, feet (why do I  have hairy toes?), arms, underarms &amp; bikini area - so it&#x27;s important that the head doesn&#x27;t catch skin or pull. My old one had a ceramic tweezer system and this one is just as comfortable to use. OK - &#x27;comfortable&#x27; is a relative term, but anyone who uses an epilator regularly will know what I mean. I like the light feature as it makes it easier to see the hair I want to remove.  If you&#x27;ve never used one and are considering it this is a nice model to start with. It&#x27;s very important to exfoliate regularly and make sure your skin and body hair is dry prior to using. You&#x27;ll get used to the sensation of hair being pulled out and the more you use it the hair gets finer and in most cases will not grow back after a few years of use. Trust me.</li>
            <li> This may be designed for women, but at our house, it is he who uses it the most for his shoulder and back area. Anyway, men or women can benefit for a wonderful epilator that is there ready for you to use whenever you need it. Philips is an European brand that is highly popular in Europe in terms of razors, etc, although here in the US is more known for bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;Get this gadget, and take it with you everywhere. He or She will benefit from it!</li>
            <li> Using this device hurt like the dickens. I sat down after a nice long shower, made sure that my legs were dry and began. Ouch! Ouch! OUCH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT...my legs are still hair free almost a week later. For a serious razor clutz like myself (my legs are criss crossed with unintentional \\&quot;How did I do that?\\&quot; scars), this made every iota of the pain worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...did it hurt? Yes. Was it worth it? YES! Will I be using it again as the hair grows back? Most definitely.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but after testing it out last night, I would have to say it works fairly well.  My leg hair wasn&#x27;t quite long enough for the epilator to grab it all, but I tested it on my husband and it definitely works.  It does hurt, like little pins pricking your skin, but it&#x27;s nothing I can&#x27;t handle, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li> I got this device to use on my arm pits hoping that I wouldn&#x27;t have to shave for a while.  It didn&#x27;t really work well and I received almost like scratch-like burn marks on both arm pits.  Ouch!  I will try this again and see if it is possible that I&#x27;m not using it correctly.</li>
            <li> Arrived early and product works wonderfully. My girlfriend loves it!  Being cordless makes it way easier to use (according to her :D)</li>
            <li> It was very painful the first time when I used it to remove my leg hair. My skin was irritated and turned red. It is very loud and the noise is annoying. It does not remove the short hair effectively. I have to repeatedly move it up and down the area with short hair. No wonder it was on sale. I would not recommend it to anyone unless it is below $50.</li>
            <li> This is my very first epilator.  As other reviewers have noted, this hurts.  That is to be expected - you&#x27;re ripping hair out at the root!  Now, it doesn&#x27;t collect the hair, so the hairs get strewn about.  Keep that in mind when starting.  It does collect longer hairs well and it didn&#x27;t seem to break them off often, if at all.  The problem I found with this epilator is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to get all the hair - not even close.  I have double duty hair on my lower legs - most of it is very coarse, but some of it is somewhat fine.  The epilator removed the coarse hair pretty well, but took several passes in each area.  I would say it took five to ten passes in each area to remove the coarse hair.  The epilator didn&#x27;t do as well removing the fine hair, even on the lowest setting with very slow passes.  I still have some stubble after two days of epilating.  I will keep at it in the hopes that it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the first time I used this epilator, it caused severe irritation because I was pressing down during the multiple passes on my legs.  If you are a first time epilator, keep in mind that you do NOT need to press down on the epilator - just allow it to pass on top of the skin.  Other than that, this epilator seems pretty good and I will keep at it in the hopes that it only gets better!</li>
            <li> This Epilator is fantastic!  It really does a better job than shaving with a razor and is really easy to use.  The first time I used it, it did sting just a little bit, and I had to go over my legs a few times just to make sure I got it all but I rinsed with cold water and applied a fragrance free lotion afterwards so my legs felt fine. This was the first time I had ever used an epilator so my legs were not used to it and I did get a minor rash but it went away within hours. I really like the fact that it is cordless and has a light - it really helps to be able to see finer hair.  Afterwards, my legs felt smooth and the best part is that it lasted for over 2 weeks!  In the summer, this will be a huge timesaver since I normally shave every 2-3 days with a regular razor! When the hair grew back after using the epilator, it was very fine and sparse. The second time I used this it was much less painful and left no rash or stinging.  I&#x27;ve used it 3 times now and it just gets easier to use (it&#x27;s easy to clean as well since the top part clicks off and separates).  The charge holds for a long time and charging it back up is quick - you can even use it plugged in if your charge dies..&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Obvious point that wasn&#x27;t so obvious to me before I got this:  pulling hair from my body hurts.  It really hurts.  This device is good for delivering such pain and results, though.  It does help the pain to cut any hair first, but using it, for instance, in an isolated area around an eyebrow is pretty effective.  I found the slow speed less painful than the fast and similarly effective.  The little bag is nice.  As a man, I&#x27;ve used it in small areas.  I tried using it around my shoulders and back and pain ensued.  I&#x27;ve retreated upon plans to use it for those areas, but the device itself is very good; I&#x27;m just a wuss.</li>
            <li> i am 35 years old and i have always used philips epilator all my life.this is my third epilator. reason i had to buy this product was that since it was european plug , i was converting voltage to europe standard and with converter i saw electric spark from power outlet. so i decided to buy  new epilator. i knew how good philips was so my decision was for philips again. and i was surprised how good it was. extra wide head makes pluccing finish quickly. i always plucced during day time thats why i am not sure how effective the light is. the noise epilator creates is little weird comparing to my old one. but its bearable. once i chargeepilator i could finish both legs without needing to charge again. and it plucs every bit of hair without breaking. its painful little bit but its not like unbearable.  overall i am very glad i made my decision from philips side. and price was also lower than philips web side and other market prices. shipping was on time , packaging was how i expected. i advised already to my friends.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, the problem I face is separating the pain from the product.  Epilators hurt!  But for a product that causes pain, this one works well.  It is cordless, and rechargeable, and a bonus is the handy light to use on hard to see areas.  Leaving my skin very smooth, and hairless, this little tool works well.  I learned quickly that once it hit my skin, it was best not to lift it up.  The more I lifted, the more it hurt. My advice is to place it on your skin in one daring move, and then leave it there until the deed is done.  It works well, but is loud - thus the four star rating.</li>
            <li> About me:  42 year old Caucasian female with thin, straight brown hair.  Of note, I have been waxing for about 20 years so my hair is pretty thin at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The con:  this is loud so you can&#x27;t use it right outside the sleeping baby&#x27;s room at night.  Oh, and yes, it HURTS.  So if you can&#x27;t take waxing best to skip this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  this device ROCKS!!!!!  I&#x27;ve used it on my sideburns, face, back of neck, armpits, arms and legs.  I was able to do all this without having to even charge it once since it showed up charged.  Does it hurt as much as waxing?  During, yes, but after NO!!  No lingering burn or sting.  And, I was able to do my arms, face, sideburns and armpits in less time than it used to take me to warm up the microwaveable wax roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used I on my bikini area yet since I&#x27;m getting over a broken leg and can&#x27;t maneuver there yet.  Will update my review once I can give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best part?  This device travels charged and ready.  So next vacation, if I missed a spot, one pass and I&#x27;m ready to hit the beach.  And it won&#x27;t matter  if the electrical outlet is the right voltage.  Wax doesn&#x27;t travel and shaving sucks.  I&#x27;m so glad Amazon had this as a deal of the day right when I ran out of wax at home.  Serendipity :-)</li>
            <li> If you read my reviews, please do not fault me for having a lot of 4 and 5 star reviews. I try to do my homework before purchasing. That being said, this was a \\&quot;whim\\&quot; purchase from the daily deals offered by Amazon. Honestly, I thought I would return it without opening it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I opened it. It was charged out of the box (at least enough to do two legs and two armpits). For the record, I am somewhat fair and not super hairy. (Had to give you the full picture... sorry). The legs were a breeze. I was kind of surprised that I didn&#x27;t really mind it either in fast or slow gear. There are some that say that it hurt, but for me, not so much. And, I have to say... I&#x27;m usually \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also never thought that I would even attempt the armpits. After I did the legs (without reading the instructions), I decided to read the instructions to see if you could do the armpits. No problem. The Epilator is made for these too!  I was very cautious at first, but again, no big deal. It was a little more of a deal from the legs, but it didn&#x27;t stop me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend the Phillips HP6576/60 Satin Perfect Epilator. It did exactly what the item description states it will do. Again, I didn&#x27;t feel much pain (I wouldn&#x27;t even call it pain). Smooth legs, smooth armpits. Go figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
            <li> It can be very painful especially on thicker coarser hairs but the results are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;My skin stayed smooth and hair free for weeks.</li>
            <li> it is easy to use, helpful. at first i thought it would hurt a lot, turns out it works well,</li>
            <li> This is a very nice epilator. It is an epilator, though, which is basically a mechanical set of tweezers that pulls hair out. It is not pleasant the first time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With patience and a light touch (don&#x27;t use it like a razor, it will hurrrt), using it gets better and better. And the results last longer than shaving.</li>
            <li> well made .  works well and very easy to use.  once you get use to the pulling out of hairs, it is a breeze.  and you can go for a couple of weeks before you need to do it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried using any type of epilator before. I&#x27;ve used disposable and electric razors. Since this was available through Vine I decided to try it. It is easy to hold no matter where you are shaving due to the shape. There is a light that makes it easier to see but I would like it if the light was adjustable or a little less bright to prevent glare. The head is easily removable for cleaning and it does come with a cleaning brush. The unit can be used with or without the cord plugged in which is nice so you don&#x27;t have to be near an outlet when you are using it. When I first tried it I was uncomfortable due to the amount of hairs coming out. When I used it slower in a smaller area the discomfort wasn&#x27;t a problem. I understand with this type of shaver that the more times you use it the less discomfort as the hairs grow in thinner. I like how smooth my legs feel after using it. I will continue to use this rather than going back to razors. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my armpits yet. I want to get used to using it on my legs first.</li>
            <li> This product would be great, if you had some anestesia, or maybe loss of nerve endings. The spinning disks run along your skin and pull your hairs out in a small patch leaving spots of blood where your folicle is. It really hurts and you are supposed to keep running it up your leg to painfully remove the rest of the hairs. ICK! I got sick to my stomach from the pain, and I&#x27;m not a weakling.  I really think that the CIA should consider using this instead of waterboarding, it would be much more effective at getting information out of suspected furry terrorists!  Good luck brave ladies! I think I&#x27;ll opt for laser hair removal next.</li>
            <li> works great, very quality made, no need to shave legs all the time.....battery lasts longer then needed to do both legs and any other spots, and rapid charges very fast...would consider buying another one, love the ceramic tips...</li>
            <li> Its wonderful because it has a light that helps me to see where are hair to be pulled out still</li>
            <li> I like this product because it correspond exactly to what I am expecting about a epilator, the essential : Epilate. No others fonctions unuseful.</li>
            <li> I have used Emjoi brand for 6 years and it was the best brand until Philips came out with this one! Philips is less painful but still does have some pain and does not get skin caught in blades like the Emjoi does. It is not painless but better than the Emjoi. Until Philips the Emjoi was the best. Now the Philips is the Cream de la Cream :) Love Love Love it for Face fuzz of 58 year old skin :)</li>
            <li> I have never used an epilator before and jumped at the chance to use this one.  It is very comfortable in the hand, looks good, has a contoured, removable head  you can clean, a carry pouch, a light, pressure control, and an adapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found using this epilator to be a rather stinging experience, which I gather most people would say about any epilator.  It does do a great job of removing hair and slowing down regrowth, which is what I hoped for.  I use it mostly on my legs, where the pain is somewhat less.  If I use it on my arms or face, it hurts a little more than I want.  I also have sensitive skin that gets red bumps easily, and this causes the bumps in those latter two areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot compare it to any other epilators as this is my first.  I would recommend it to anyone who realizes that these gadgets do sting some but do a great job with hair removal.  The extra touches on this one make it a good  buy, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of shaving so when I learned about epilators, I was really excited! I looked on amazon for one right away and it took awhile, but i eventually decided to buy this one. The first time I used it, I&#x27;ll admit that it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;enjoyable&amp;#34;. When you&#x27;re using and epilator, there&#x27;s a little sting as it removes hair from your body. However, eventually you get used to it and it doesn&#x27;t bother you that much anymore. Personally, I use this epilator for my legs and have to use it about once every 2 weeks before the hair that grows back becomes noticeable which I believe is a great alternative to shaving, which some people how to do every few days! Get this epilator! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an epilator for 4 years, so I&#x27;ve already developed a tolerance for the pain and can&#x27;t really address that as a beginner in my review. But I did want to compare the Philips Satin Perfect Epilator to my previous epilator, the Braun 5270 Silk Epil X&#x27;elle, which I&#x27;d grown unhappy with. It pinched the skin behind my knees and sometimes on my underarms, it took more than 20 minutes to do one leg just up to the knee, and if I didn&#x27;t do it every 3-4 days, it became painful again unless I shaved first (in which case the whole process of shaving plus epilating took an hour).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading lots of reviews, I decided to try the Philips Satin Perfect, and just used it for the first time. I didn&#x27;t shower first as I normally do before epilating, and it had been a week since I last epilated... which usually means pain. I plugged it in, put on the hair lifter attachment, and tried one little patch of long-ish hair on speed 1. No pain. I then did a strip all the way up to my knee and still felt barely anything. I switched the attachment to the basic one, and continued to use it without pain. And wow, it was FAST!! I had the first leg done, longish hair without pain, in 10 minutes. Completely done with both legs in 20 minutes. Then I read the cleaning instructions: I can rinse the parts under water! That was one of the problems I had with the Braun -- it seemed that I could never get it clean enough, especially when I lost the little brush it came with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can think of is that it&#x27;s louder than the Braun. But that only bothers my kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum: the Philips Satin Perfect is fast, doesn&#x27;t hurt me even with longish hair, easy to clean, and can be used cordless. PERFECT!</li>
            <li> Warning, this review does contain some TMI&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really didn&#x27;t want or need this epilator for my legs, due to some genetic quirk, I have less hair on my legs than I do in my eyebrows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I have always envied about other women is their ablity to achieve near perfect underarm grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a bit disadvantaged in my pursuit of perfectly groomed underarms by many factors: A torn rotator cuff, a ruptured biceps tendon, a ruptured cervical disc, very sensitive skin,  a propensity for developing razor burn, and naturally dark body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very difficult for me to shave my underarms, and I was hoping that epilating my underarms would be a better way to groom than using a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After testing this epilator on my legs, I realized that I would not be able to endure having the hair pulled out from a much more sensitive area, my underarms, and possibly more intimate areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did do a decent job on my legs, but truthfully, since I have so little hair on my legs, it would have probably been faster to do the job with a regular pair of tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be an ideal solution for some people, but for myself, it fell short of my expectations</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product almost 6 months now.  I wanted to wait until I&#x27;d been using it a while to give it a fair review.  First, don&#x27;t judge the product by the first use.  The first time using an epilator is kind of painful.  If you have a low pain tolerance, then purchase a topical anesthetic first.  Once you get through the first one, then I advise you to use the epilator at least once a week to keep it up.  Also, I found making fast swipes and lots of them the first time was easier to get through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that I probably won&#x27;t go back to using a razor again.  I use the epilator on my armpits every 2 days and legs every 4 days now that it&#x27;s summer.  There are very few hairs that even grow on my legs now (like 1 every 2 or 3 inches of leg) and those are very fine.  Also, I&#x27;ve found that if I dry my skin really well after a shower it works better.  Yes, it takes several passes in different directions to get absolutely all the fine hairs, but to just have to shave every couple of days with no mess is absolutely worth it...and NO RAZOR STUBBLE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charge the battery once a month, so that&#x27;s not a problem.  Clean-up is a breeze.  Just rinse the top two pieces under hot water and let dry.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t try it sooner.</li>
            <li> Overall review: If you can get through the pain of the first use, you&#x27;ll fall in love with it!  It gets less and less painful with each use and it seems to produce better results each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product on a whim after reading online reviews.  Having never waxed my legs before, I was definitely uncomfortable the first time I used the epilator.  I was able to tolerate it for both legs and I was relatively pleased with the results.  It removed almost all of the thicker/darker hair on my legs and I credit my inexperience with device for the hairs that it left behind.  This morning I touched up some of the spots I missed (about 5 days after the first use) and it didn&#x27;t hurt much all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend giving it a chance!</li>
            <li> Yes, ripping out hair can hurt but it wasn&#x27;t unbearable...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t care for was that my hair grew back at different speeds, so I never actually had smooth legs. I also found that this epilator wasn&#x27;t as good at pulling out fine hair. So the real issue became: my legs looked smooth, but really weren&#x27;t to the touch....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And let&#x27;s face it, a gal wants to feel silky smooth.... not merely just look the part.</li>
            <li> My wife was doing a lot of waxing, but it got expensive and often the people doing it would door a poor job and leave her wanting a 2nd one just to fix it. She had used an epilator for a number of years, but it was a much older model and required a power adapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this product up a few months ago after reviewing nearly all of the possible options. It was also after she bought a couple home wax and/or honey kits for waxing your own legs at home. The honey made such a huge mess. It literally took a couple months for all of the stickiness to go away. The ceramic pincers on this thing are so quiet! Her old epilator made it sound like she was running a small chainsaw. They also cause a lot less pain than the older models. She uses and has enjoyed the light that comes with this model as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m saving money every month and her legs are silky smooth! Also she doesn&#x27;t have to let the hair grow out like you have to do for waxing. If we need to go to the beach on short notice, she doesn&#x27;t have to complain that she hasn&#x27;t had a waxing lately. She just goes in the bathroom and with this epilator, she&#x27;s ready to go in about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can confidently say that I have been extremely happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: This device is powered by an AC adapter that is 110-240v. This has been very useful in our international travels. I would be quite unhappy if it didn&#x27;t support this these days.</li>
            <li> I like it! I love it! I bought an old version 10 years ago in Europe, and couldn&#x27;t find at least something close enough in US.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Got!&lt;br /&gt;The old one is not retired yet, going to use as a travel options.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing design, very comfortable to use, much less growing into skin hair, don&#x27;t need to shave often.&lt;br /&gt;Nice option to use when it plugged in, don&#x27;t need to wait till fully charged, which I have in Panasonic version (going to rid of it, very bad and painful experience, not cheap...).&lt;br /&gt;Yes a bit pricy, but it pays it back.&lt;br /&gt;Less painful compare to others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;Yes noisy, but I don&#x27;t care, it does its job - that I care!</li>
            <li> Awful, not sure what the point of this is, sure it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as others, but I&#x27;ve been using epilators for 15 years and this one does nothing, it leaves behind all the hairs, you can go over it 20 times and not pick it up, where as my old one even in it&#x27;s current broken state picks up more hairs.  I wish I could send this back but lost the receipt, will be going back to buy a a replacement silk epil instead.</li>
            <li> I received this for a Christmas gift this year after having it on my wish list for a couple of years. The promise of a smooth face and chin are finally fulfilled. The Epilator is find instrument that is far better than painful waxing.  I&#x27;ve had other \\&quot;electric tweezers\\&quot; that don&#x27;t stand up to the job this epilator does. It does pull some and it doesn&#x27;t feel real great, but I&#x27;ve never found a hair removal item that doesn&#x27;t, be it wax, tweezers or my medieval electric tweezers as mentioned above. I am assuming that I will get used to it. My face is baby butt smooth!! And a little of pulling is worth it to me!  So if you are brave of heart and are sick of waxing, by all means consider this as an option. Giving up a couple of waxings will certainly pay for this!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Rely on it as much as razor for my face.</li>
            <li> I used this stupid thing 5 times and now it won&#x27;t start.  It definitely isn&#x27;t a problem with the outlet I&#x27;m using to charge it because I can charge other things from the same outlet.  But my epilator won&#x27;t turn on any more.</li>
