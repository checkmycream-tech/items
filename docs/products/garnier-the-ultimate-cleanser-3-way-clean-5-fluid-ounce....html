            <li>Love the way this works.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>But i am glad i tried.</li>
            <li>Best face wash ever - so glad that Amazon carries this now (as well as all my other favorite Garnier products).</li>
            <li>This cleanser works perfectly for me, and I love the three ways to use it--two less products to buy.  </li>
            <li>although I&#x27;ve use other excellent products from Garnier.  </li>
            <li>But for a daily face wash, it&#x27;s really great.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin smooth and tightens my pores.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for me either way to be honest.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, nice packaging.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that does a great job with both cleansing and exfoliating.</li>
            <li>Love this for a quick scrub, full mask treatment or overnight &#x27;spot&#x27; fixer.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as effectively as the other products, but I haven&#x27;t given it a fair amount of time to work.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean and leaves skin feeling smooth without drying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited to see the difference in a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>and you face feels so clean.  </li>
            <li>My face feels clean with out drying it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and refreshed after each use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Someone mentioned here that this product is too drying, and I&#x27;m sure it could be for certain skin types.  </li>
            <li>Super product at just the right price!</li>
            <li>It always leaves my skin feeling so fresh and clean, but never stripped.</li>
            <li>My favorite of the three in one is the mask, and it leaves your face so soft and smooth...</li>
            <li>bought this to replace a more expensive mask and scrub I use and as it goes, once you&#x27;ve found the best, you can&#x27;t replace it.</li>
            <li>okay, so i&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for a good portion of my middle school and high school years and still to this day, but this has helped my acne so much.</li>
            <li>works great for my skin, not overly harsh, non-scented, and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not afraid to use my prescription acne cream after this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very refreshing, and leaves my skin feeling smooth and tight.</li>
            <li>It works really well whether I&#x27;m just using it for a quick wash or scrub or if I leave it on as a mask.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and the little granules are gentle enough for all the parts of my face, and especially great on the oily area.  </li>
            <li>I have gone through many different types of face wash to find one that I like.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve moved a bit north of middle age, and my face requires a bit more skincare.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely tried many many facial cleansers, masks etc.</li>
            <li>I first used it as a mask and Immediatly as I was applying it</li>
            <li>My hands were so soft and smooth feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>Sorry, not the greatest fan and I&#x27;m a product junkie.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle!</li>
            <li>All three purposes of the facewash really do work!</li>
            <li>I love this for daily cleansing.  </li>
            <li>After a couple days, already my skin is starting to clear up even better than before!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used it as a daily cleanser and as a polishing cleanser and the results were great--after each use my face felt clean and fresh .  </li>
            <li>Having liked their Dark Spot Remover so much I decided to try this cleanser as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have paid as much as $30 for face wash.</li>
            <li>and this really keeps it controlled.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even introduced this to my boyfriend, and he really enjoys using it too.</li>
            <li>Very \\&quot;spa\\&quot; like quality.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to moisturize and go to bed.</li>
            <li>It really gets all my make up and dirt off from the day.  </li>
            <li>Stick to natural things like coconut oil or fresh aloe vera</li>
            <li>straight from the plant.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel much smoother.  </li>
            <li>I hope it keeps it up much longer.</li>
            <li>It also is a nice face mask when I have the time to relax for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>all of a sudden, I was in search of something more sensitive yet still did the job of scrubbing away make-up and blackouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only use it at night before my moisture cream as I have read that there is no need to scrub your face in the am but to use a mild cleanser or just hot water instead followed with your moisture.  </li>
            <li>But I do like the way this cleanser leaves my face feeling extra clean.  </li>
            <li>I love that it can serve as both a daily cleanser and a facial mask!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 20-something, and I&#x27;ve suffered from acne since high school.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally rate products.</li>
            <li>It may work better for oilier and less sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t expect these products to live up to all their claims.</li>
            <li>, I think they added new product and are not going to carry this anymore.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with The Ultimate Cleanser</li>
            <li>It cleans without completely drying you out, and without making you oily again.</li>
            <li>I tried it thanks to a friend from France, and then bought it that same day while I was studying abroad in Spain.</li>
            <li>So I was so pleasantly surprised when I found this facewash.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, do NOT use this.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even make my skin soft - it made it dryer than ever.</li>
            <li>My advice: trash it and go all natural.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel tingly and soft</li>
            <li>skin is not tight anymore.</li>
            <li>I have smaller pores, smoother skin, more of an even tone and little to no blackheads!</li>
            <li>My older skin (54 yrs) looks and feels much younger than its age.</li>
            <li>Exactly the same as the actual one they sold in stores.</li>
            <li>acne doesn&#x27;t stay away from me, because of genetics and stress, but this cleanser really helps control my acne so that i only receive the bare minimum.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and even though I&#x27;m now in my mid 20s</li>
            <li>No I still see the same old face in the mirror</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive, yet this product still gave me a burning sensation the second it touched my skin.</li>
            <li>In the mornings, I wake up and simply wash my face with warm water (I find it to be too irritating if I use it twice daily).</li>
            <li>The reviews that annoy me are those that downgrade the product because it arrived a day later than expected--perhaps an issue but certainly not related to the quality of the product--or just give a general scree for no discernible reason.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all types of cleansers, especially the tough ones with scrubbers that left my skin red, dry (and thus creating more oil at the end of the day clogging my pores).</li>
            <li>Of course that&#x27;s why I am a critical (meaning assessing both good and bad) consumer of any information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Super product at just the right price!</li>
            <li> It always leaves my skin feeling so fresh and clean, but never stripped.</li>
            <li> My favorite of the three in one is the mask, and it leaves your face so soft and smooth...</li>
            <li> bought this to replace a more expensive mask and scrub I use and as it goes, once you&#x27;ve found the best, you can&#x27;t replace it.</li>
            <li> okay, so i&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for a good portion of my middle school and high school years and still to this day, but this has helped my acne so much.</li>
            <li> works great for my skin, not overly harsh, non-scented, and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not afraid to use my prescription acne cream after this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing, and leaves my skin feeling smooth and tight.</li>
            <li> It works really well whether I&#x27;m just using it for a quick wash or scrub or if I leave it on as a mask.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and the little granules are gentle enough for all the parts of my face, and especially great on the oily area.  </li>
            <li> I have gone through many different types of face wash to find one that I like.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve moved a bit north of middle age, and my face requires a bit more skincare.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely tried many many facial cleansers, masks etc.</li>
            <li> I first used it as a mask and Immediatly as I was applying it</li>
            <li> My hands were so soft and smooth feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> Sorry, not the greatest fan and I&#x27;m a product junkie.</li>
            <li> It is so gentle!</li>
            <li> All three purposes of the facewash really do work!</li>
            <li> I love this for daily cleansing.  </li>
            <li> After a couple days, already my skin is starting to clear up even better than before!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used it as a daily cleanser and as a polishing cleanser and the results were great--after each use my face felt clean and fresh .  </li>
            <li> Having liked their Dark Spot Remover so much I decided to try this cleanser as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have paid as much as $30 for face wash.</li>
            <li> and this really keeps it controlled.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even introduced this to my boyfriend, and he really enjoys using it too.</li>
            <li> Very \\&quot;spa\\&quot; like quality.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to moisturize and go to bed.</li>
            <li> It really gets all my make up and dirt off from the day.  </li>
            <li> Stick to natural things like coconut oil or fresh aloe vera</li>
            <li> straight from the plant.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel much smoother.  </li>
            <li> I hope it keeps it up much longer.</li>
            <li> It also is a nice face mask when I have the time to relax for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> all of a sudden, I was in search of something more sensitive yet still did the job of scrubbing away make-up and blackouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only use it at night before my moisture cream as I have read that there is no need to scrub your face in the am but to use a mild cleanser or just hot water instead followed with your moisture.  </li>
            <li> But I do like the way this cleanser leaves my face feeling extra clean.  </li>
            <li> I love that it can serve as both a daily cleanser and a facial mask!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 20-something, and I&#x27;ve suffered from acne since high school.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally rate products.</li>
            <li> It may work better for oilier and less sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t expect these products to live up to all their claims.</li>
            <li> , I think they added new product and are not going to carry this anymore.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with The Ultimate Cleanser</li>
            <li> It cleans without completely drying you out, and without making you oily again.</li>
            <li> I tried it thanks to a friend from France, and then bought it that same day while I was studying abroad in Spain.</li>
            <li> So I was so pleasantly surprised when I found this facewash.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone sensitive skin</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, do NOT use this.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even make my skin soft - it made it dryer than ever.</li>
            <li> My advice: trash it and go all natural.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel tingly and soft</li>
            <li> skin is not tight anymore.</li>
            <li> I have smaller pores, smoother skin, more of an even tone and little to no blackheads!</li>
            <li> My older skin (54 yrs) looks and feels much younger than its age.</li>
            <li> Exactly the same as the actual one they sold in stores.</li>
            <li> acne doesn&#x27;t stay away from me, because of genetics and stress, but this cleanser really helps control my acne so that i only receive the bare minimum.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and even though I&#x27;m now in my mid 20s</li>
            <li> No I still see the same old face in the mirror</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive, yet this product still gave me a burning sensation the second it touched my skin.</li>
            <li> In the mornings, I wake up and simply wash my face with warm water (I find it to be too irritating if I use it twice daily).</li>
            <li> The reviews that annoy me are those that downgrade the product because it arrived a day later than expected--perhaps an issue but certainly not related to the quality of the product--or just give a general scree for no discernible reason.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all types of cleansers, especially the tough ones with scrubbers that left my skin red, dry (and thus creating more oil at the end of the day clogging my pores).</li>
            <li> Of course that&#x27;s why I am a critical (meaning assessing both good and bad) consumer of any information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry, not overly sensitive skin, and this product dries it out a lot, plus it feels too scratchy, even when I apply very little pressure.</li>
            <li> I just threw this Garnier product away, and it&#x27;s the last time I&#x27;ll ever use something that&#x27;s not natural.</li>
            <li> I have clear skin before using this product, and only broke out with a couple small pimples.</li>
            <li> so I am not a young woman</li>
            <li> I exfoliate every night like it says to get rid of the dry/dead skin cells, since I have wicked dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> do have dry skin.</li>
            <li> You only need a small dab each time, so this quantity actually lasts quite a while (maybe about a month, if you use it once per day).</li>
            <li> husband has commented several times on my &amp;#34;beautiful face&amp;#34; in the past several weeks.</li>
            <li> but what I have seen in a few weeks of using this product is that my pores seem much smaller and a couple of places that like to break out (yes even at my age) have cleared up and haven&#x27;t had a break out since this cleanser cleared them up weeks ago.</li>
            <li> wearing tinted moisturizer everyday, this is the only product I &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; can get deep into the pores to remove the dirt yet doesn&#x27;t feel to harsh.  </li>
            <li> However, the micro-beads are too sharp for my skin.</li>
            <li> Unless my skin changes and I need something that addresses other issues, this is it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been skeptical of face masks, but this really does seem to work.</li>
            <li> Never have had any drying effects like with other cleansers (no matter if I use it as a cleanser, an exfoliator, or a mask)!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I was a little skeptical to use it.</li>
            <li> it is because of the \\&quot;little scrubbies\\&quot; in it.</li>
            <li> but for everyday use I do not think mu aggressive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a few years and have never had a problem with it.</li>
            <li> Used in conjuction with the garnier lift and firm serum</li>
            <li> When I travel, I must bring a small jar of this stuff where ever I go.</li>
            <li> No more caking the make-up on under my eyes to hide the cirlces either.</li>
            <li> The Eye Care for dark circles is HEAVEN!!!</li>
            <li> I have serious combination skin</li>
            <li> Too bad Garnier has discontinued the product, guess it didn&#x27;t generate enough $$$ being 3 products in one.  </li>
            <li> But when I used it twice a day I found that it was too irritating for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Dangerous ingredient, i&#x27;ve heard.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have gone through many different types of face wash to find one that I like. I have paid as much as $30 for face wash. But you know what, this works the best. I like the fact that there are 3 different ways to use it. It&#x27;s not the best mask when you leave it on, but it&#x27;s pretty good. But for a daily face wash, it&#x27;s really great. It cleans without completely drying you out, and without making you oily again. I have serious combination skin and this really keeps it controlled.</li>
            <li> Shame I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore...works great for my skin, not overly harsh, non-scented, and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as effectively as the other products, but I haven&#x27;t given it a fair amount of time to work.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product that I have ordered more. I am a grandmother so I am not a young woman and I don&#x27;t expect these products to live up to all their claims. But I do like the way this cleanser leaves my face feeling extra clean.  I tell my friends it is because of the \\&quot;little scrubbies\\&quot; in it. It also is a nice face mask when I have the time to relax for a few minutes. I only use it at night before my moisture cream as I have read that there is no need to scrub your face in the am but to use a mild cleanser or just hot water instead followed with your moisture.  Well - do I look years younger ??  No I still see the same old face in the mirror but what I have seen in a few weeks of using this product is that my pores seem much smaller and a couple of places that like to break out (yes even at my age) have cleared up and haven&#x27;t had a break out since this cleanser cleared them up weeks ago.</li>
            <li> This product smells great, and does what it claims to do - you can use it 3 ways no problem. However, the micro-beads are too sharp for my skin. I have normal to dry, not overly sensitive skin, and this product dries it out a lot, plus it feels too scratchy, even when I apply very little pressure. It may work better for oilier and less sensitive skin. However, I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I realy enjoy using this product, it does a good job on your face. It open up your pore the way you want.</li>
            <li> Actually. I threw this product away when I saw it contains micro beads. Dangerous ingredient, i&#x27;ve heard.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for oily skin, and as a mask is excellent. but for everyday use I do not think mu aggressive</li>
            <li> This cleanser works perfectly for me, and I love the three ways to use it--two less products to buy.  Admittedly--and fortunately--I inherited great genes for skin.  But I&#x27;ve moved a bit north of middle age, and my face requires a bit more skincare.  This is my first experience with The Ultimate Cleanser although I&#x27;ve use other excellent products from Garnier.  Unless my skin changes and I need something that addresses other issues, this is it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;d like to say here (and maybe in subsequent reviews).  The reviews that help me best in making my buying decisions are the ones that give concrete reasons for likes and dislikes and show an understanding that usually no one product is best for everyone.  Someone mentioned here that this product is too drying, and I&#x27;m sure it could be for certain skin types.  The reviews that annoy me are those that downgrade the product because it arrived a day later than expected--perhaps an issue but certainly not related to the quality of the product--or just give a general scree for no discernible reason.  Of course that&#x27;s why I am a critical (meaning assessing both good and bad) consumer of any information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0</li>
            <li> This product works great just have to use it more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bee. Using this product since day 1 it&#x27;s giving a lot of confidence on my appearance I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments from men @ women on what I used on my skin @ how my face has a nice texture it&#x27;s part of my life forever</li>
            <li> My local grocery store quit stocking this!  So, now I buy it through Amazon. I have combination skin.  My older skin (54 yrs) looks and feels much younger than its age.</li>
            <li> Best face wash ever - so glad that Amazon carries this now (as well as all my other favorite Garnier products). For the price and effectiveness of this face wash, I think it&#x27;s a very good value. You only need a small dab each time, so this quantity actually lasts quite a while (maybe about a month, if you use it once per day).</li>
            <li> wearing tinted moisturizer everyday, this is the only product I &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; can get deep into the pores to remove the dirt yet doesn&#x27;t feel to harsh.  Love the smell as well. I always order x3 every time.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! Exactly the same as the actual one they sold in stores. same size and everything!!! This is the only cream, wash, and mask that helps and works on my skin!!</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and it&#x27;s the same one that I could no longer find at Walgreens. It&#x27;s a shame, because this face wash really is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. Daily cleanser, exfoliater, and rejuvenating face mask all in one bottle. Fantastic.</li>
            <li> okay, so i&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for a good portion of my middle school and high school years and still to this day, but this has helped my acne so much. acne doesn&#x27;t stay away from me, because of genetics and stress, but this cleanser really helps control my acne so that i only receive the bare minimum. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a few years and have never had a problem with it.</li>
            <li> My favorite scrub. Love it&#x27;s warming effect. Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely tried many many facial cleansers, masks etc. I swear by this stuff. I&#x27;ve even stocked up on this fearing that it might be discontinued one day as most beauty products are. I&#x27;m 20-something, and I&#x27;ve suffered from acne since high school. I&#x27;ve tried all types of cleansers, especially the tough ones with scrubbers that left my skin red, dry (and thus creating more oil at the end of the day clogging my pores). I then was prescribed acne cream, and all of a sudden, I was in search of something more sensitive yet still did the job of scrubbing away make-up and blackouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product only at night as a daily cleanser. It leaves my skin smooth and tightens my pores. It&#x27;s quite refreshing. It smells great too. I&#x27;m not afraid to use my prescription acne cream after this. In the mornings, I wake up and simply wash my face with warm water (I find it to be too irritating if I use it twice daily). Once a month, I use the mask. It&#x27;s very refreshing, and leaves my skin feeling smooth and tight. When I travel, I must bring a small jar of this stuff where ever I go. I&#x27;ve even introduced this to my boyfriend, and he really enjoys using it too. This product is great, and I love the fact that it is so versatile.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is wonderful...  I&#x27;ts so refreshing. I first used it as a mask and Immediatly as I was applying it I got the refreshing feel.&lt;br /&gt;  My favorite of the three in one is the mask, and it leaves your face so soft and smooth...&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my hands to too. My hands were so soft and smooth feeling afterwards. I did&#x27;nt even need any lotion or moisturizer afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff,  I&#x27;m using it from now on. And the results last a while also...</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used.  I wish the company was still making this!</li>
            <li> It works really well whether I&#x27;m just using it for a quick wash or scrub or if I leave it on as a mask. I</li>
            <li> Sorry, not the greatest fan and I&#x27;m a product junkie. Doesn&#x27;t do much for me either way to be honest. I will use it up but likely will stick with the Garnier Radiance Gelee cleanser which I must admit is my fave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to replace a more expensive mask and scrub I use and as it goes, once you&#x27;ve found the best, you can&#x27;t replace it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, nice packaging. Bottle never used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is just the right texture and smells awesome.  Very \\&quot;spa\\&quot; like quality.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally rate products. But I have been searching for this product since I got home from Spain. I tried it thanks to a friend from France, and then bought it that same day while I was studying abroad in Spain. I have very sensitive skin, and even though I&#x27;m now in my mid 20s I still break out. So I was so pleasantly surprised when I found this facewash. It is so gentle! Never have had any drying effects like with other cleansers (no matter if I use it as a cleanser, an exfoliator, or a mask)! It always leaves my skin feeling so fresh and clean, but never stripped. I just love brushing my finger across my skin after I use it! It&#x27;s a great value for your money as well! All three purposes of the facewash really do work! And at this price it&#x27;s just a superb deal! I&#x27;m so glad to have found it on amazon so I don&#x27;t have to ask my boyfriend for it as a gift when he&#x27;s in Europe! This is a buy you won&#x27;t regret!</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so clean and refreshed after!! LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I was a little skeptical to use it. I break out EASILY!!!!! I have clear skin before using this product, and only broke out with a couple small pimples. After a couple days, already my skin is starting to clear up even better than before! I have smaller pores, smoother skin, more of an even tone and little to no blackheads! YES! I love using it as a cleanser. I exfoliate every night like it says to get rid of the dry/dead skin cells, since I have wicked dry skin in the winter. I&#x27;m really excited to see the difference in a couple of weeks.  I also use the Miracle Skin Perfector B.B. Cream and love it! I don&#x27;t break out at all and the tint is perfect for helping to even my skin even more throughout the day. The Eye Care for dark circles is HEAVEN!!! No more caking the make-up on under my eyes to hide the cirlces either. I love it all and feel great leaving my house! Garnier is a great product.</li>
            <li> I had never heard about this product untill a family member recommended me this. I am very happy with this product..</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product she has great skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since middle school. It works wonderfully as a mask. I&#x27;m so in love with this product.</li>
            <li> This can be used for cleansing and as a mask. It rinses clean and leaves skin feeling smooth without drying.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used it as a daily cleanser and as a polishing cleanser and the results were great--after each use my face felt clean and fresh .  i have yet to use it as a mask but will likely try that soon.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that does a great job with both cleansing and exfoliating. And it&#x27;s just one step: Wash your face with this and you&#x27;re ready to moisturize and go to bed. I&#x27;ve always been skeptical of face masks, but this really does seem to work. My skin is definitely smoother after using this as a mask; just 3 minutes and it clears away all the flakiness that I get in the winter. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a daily deep cleanser than this is for you.  I love it, it smells great and makes my skin feel so exhilarated you can feel the beads in it working and you face feels so clean.  I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> Having liked their Dark Spot Remover so much I decided to try this cleanser as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like it since it does a great job exfoliating and improving my skin quality.  I have acne prone sensitive skin and I did find that this is a great product for me for the evening.  It really gets all my make up and dirt off from the day.  But when I used it twice a day I found that it was too irritating for my skin.  So, now I am using a gentler cleanser in the morning and continuing to use this at night.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and can&#x27;t seem to find it at stores anymore. It&#x27;s nice that you can use it as a cleanser or as a mask.</li>
            <li> I had tried this when I picked it up at one of the &amp;#34;big box&amp;#34; retailers and loved it. Having found it on Amazon and a huge savings, it made it even better for me! Super product at just the right price!</li>
            <li> I love this for daily cleansing.  I have combination skin and the little granules are gentle enough for all the parts of my face, and especially great on the oily area.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, do NOT use this. My skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive, yet this product still gave me a burning sensation the second it touched my skin. I do not recommend it at all. Actually, I do not recommend any chemically made products. Stick to natural things like coconut oil or fresh aloe vera straight from the plant. They actually do make your skin softer and healthier. I just threw this Garnier product away, and it&#x27;s the last time I&#x27;ll ever use something that&#x27;s not natural. It didn&#x27;t even make my skin soft - it made it dryer than ever. My advice: trash it and go all natural.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face wash. I use it. My daughter uses it. My face feels clean with out drying it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for months now and Amazon is the only place I can find it at anymore. It has micro-scrubbing beads and is made with clay, which helps purify my pores without over-drying. It can be used as a cleanser or a scrub. When I&#x27;m in the shower and don&#x27;t have a lot of time, I wash my face, rinse, and finish showering. When I have an extra couple of minutes, I&#x27;ll leave the cleanser on while I wash, then rinse it off. I just ordered the 3-pack - I don&#x27;t want to be without this stuff!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! I love that it can serve as both a daily cleanser and a facial mask! It even helped take hair dye off of my forehead. Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> The stores in my area have been out. Been waiting for them to replenish however, I think they added new product and are not going to carry this anymore.Love this product. Glad I was able to stock up on here.</li>
            <li> Love this for a quick scrub, full mask treatment or overnight &#x27;spot&#x27; fixer.  Too bad Garnier has discontinued the product, guess it didn&#x27;t generate enough $$$ being 3 products in one.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> I love this. It makes my skin feel tingly and soft and I know for a fact that my skin looks better; dewy, almost. Im nearing my 40th bday and am definately impressed with this stuff. Used in conjuction with the garnier lift and firm serum ITS GOLD!&lt;br /&gt;My husband has commented several times on my &amp;#34;beautiful face&amp;#34; in the past several weeks. Nice!</li>
            <li> Love the way this works.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It clears up my skin and makes my face feel great. I can&#x27;t find it in local stores anymore and I thought it was gone forever. I&#x27;m happy to have found it here.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this product. But i am glad i tried. My skin feels clean and refreshed after each use.&lt;br /&gt;I do have dry skin. After cleaning my face with this cleanser, i followed Garnier Fructis Moisture Rescue.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is not tight anymore. Happy with my purchase. Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a good skin cleaner.  Makes your skin feel much smoother.  I hope it keeps it up much longer.</li>
            <li> This product is great for my skin and I can feel it working and it makes my skin feel cleaner and fresher.</li>
