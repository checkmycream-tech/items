            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>/&gt; Love it....</li>
            <li>I gifted it to, because I know she likes the perfume...</li>
            <li>what could be any better....</li>
            <li>This is the last step to perfect layering scent.  </li>
            <li>(turns out it smells really nice!), price was much more reasonable than in stores, but most importantly - it was packaged securely and arrived before Christmas even though the &#x27;Estimated Delivery Time&#x27; made it sound like having it for Christmas</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a person who desires heavily scented perfumes, but this one is perfect.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I enjoy it and recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to any woman who wants to smell nice but not be over-powering.</li>
            <li>My wife loved it even more, to the degree I purchased her a bigger bottle of the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and I love Reveal</li>
            <li>It has a pleasantly sweet fragrance without venturing into saccrin sweet.</li>
            <li>I prefer light clean ,fresh and crisp scents.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the entire transaction.</li>
            <li>I also love Halle Berry \\&quot;Closer\\&quot; which smells almost exactly like this one only a bit stronger &amp; spicier.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will definitely reorder it because it smells EXACTLY like I remembered it 2 years ago.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to be able to find it at such a low price.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this same product in a smaller ounce bottle from local retail stores and I am very pleased that this is truly the &#x27;real deal&#x27; at a much better price.</li>
            <li>I initially smelled it on friend and it was intoxicating since I prefer clean, fresh scents.  </li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t know much about the perfume</li>
            <li>Shipping was not so fast though.</li>
            <li>I had received it originally as a gift last year, and have been ordering it ever since.</li>
            <li>Pleasant enough for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Amazon is our new source for this product!</li>
            <li>well besides that it wasn&#x27;t new..</li>

            <li> Very good price, arrived promptly. 5stars😁</li>
            <li> I will rate it for the individual I gifted it to, because I know she likes the perfume...I&#x27;ve never used it myself, so cannot say.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and I love Reveal.....and so does my husband.......what could be any better....highly suggested for younger or older women.</li>
            <li> It was a gift so I didn&#x27;t know much about the perfume (turns out it smells really nice!), price was much more reasonable than in stores, but most importantly - it was packaged securely and arrived before Christmas even though the &#x27;Estimated Delivery Time&#x27; made it sound like having it for Christmas was going to be &amp;#34;iffy&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the entire transaction.</li>
            <li> Good deal. Wife loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a person who desires heavily scented perfumes, but this one is perfect.  It possesses a noticeable, yet tasteful scent that doesn&#x27;t hang obnoxiously in the air after leaving the room.  It&#x27;s delicate, feminine and everything a tasteful perfume should aspire to be.</li>
            <li> I liked the smell, very good feminine perfume.  My wife loved it even more, to the degree I purchased her a bigger bottle of the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance for the price. Pleasant enough for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this gift for my wife. It has a pleasantly sweet fragrance without venturing into saccrin sweet. My wife and I enjoy it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Xmas present for my mother in law. She loves it and continues to buy it. Shipping was not so fast though. I did not recieve the product before Xmas.</li>
            <li> I really loved this item. It arrived on time and the scent was just as i expected it to be because i had used this perfume before. will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will definitely reorder it because it smells EXACTLY like I remembered it 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> This is the same size bottle I use to get for three times the price.  I was so glad to be able to find it at such a low price.</li>
            <li> I prefer light clean ,fresh and crisp scents.  The scent is just that.  This is the last step to perfect layering scent.  I purchased the shower gel, body lotion and the perfume.  I initially smelled it on friend and it was intoxicating since I prefer clean, fresh scents.  I would recommend it to any woman who wants to smell nice but not be over-powering.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few fragrances my daughter likes to wear and it is almost impossible to find in stores.  Great price!</li>
