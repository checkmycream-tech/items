            <li>But the magic it does is incredible.</li>

            <li>smell is much more pleasant</li>
            <li>VERY UPSET WITH THIS COMPANY !!!!!</li>
            <li>I was sent a sample, liked it and ordered a jar.</li>
            <li>This cream smells medicinal, but I actually kind of like it.</li>
            <li>And believe me ive made my own face nutrients, and bought them for years...</li>
            <li>who spends that kind of money on a lotion?</li>
            <li>the kind of miracle the company hypes it as,</li>
            <li>If it sounds too good to be true, it IS!</li>
            <li>not too impressed so far  -  nice cream  -  </li>
            <li>Honestly you would be better buying OIL OF OLAY</li>
            <li>I love the way it seems to tighten in a nice way on my face.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love Aloe Vella!</li>
            <li>The product is not animal-tested, which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>Be sure and check all additives before you order.  </li>
            <li>(okay)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll be glad to get rid of this item.&lt;br</li>
            <li>On top of that, I am allergic to the product.  </li>
            <li>The product in the jar seems Not to be more water than the cream.</li>
            <li>Packets were more creamy, stayed on, when you massaged it in you felt it.</li>
            <li>get better results.</li>
            <li>I was so glad I found these products on Amazon</li>
            <li>I love this product and don&#x27;t mind the smell at all.</li>
            <li>it does like as if by magic ...</li>
            <li>Will be reporting them to the better business bureau.</li>
            <li>I love getting samples of WRINKLESS in the mail..</li>
            <li>I really am pleased with the way these products make my skin feel</li>
            <li>The hype was better than the results.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>Better use a beauty product that is established.</li>
            <li>I love the camphor smell, I like the tingle you get (partly because I grew up with noxzema).</li>
            <li>What bothers me most is their advertising and trying to pull one over on the consumer.</li>
            <li>This product tightened my skin better than most creams which helps wrinkles</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>Have been using it for more than two months now, and I can see improvement in reducing the age lines that were so prominent.</li>
            <li>EXCEPT the results from trying it the first time!!!</li>
            <li>I got this cream with the Ayur cream and so far have not noticed any thing great by using these creams.</li>
            <li>The results is more important than the smell everyone keeps talking about.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li>A jar is not as sanitary as a dispenser bottle; consequently, it is best to use a cotton swab to scoop out the amount needed, and it&#x27;s kind of hard to be vigilant about that.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend you NOT to buy this product from their website.</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural with Aloe Vella which we all know has alway been good for are skin.</li>
            <li>The lines around my mouth are gone and my fine lines around my eyes are almost gone...</li>
            <li>A quick aside - the parent company, Ojas Enterprises, has an F rating on the Better Business Bureau.</li>
            <li>The texture of this stuff is a little funky and the smell is not the best but not objectionable.  </li>
            <li>Kept my makeup smooth and my face from drying out during the Holidays.</li>
            <li>Was light</li>
            <li>It has a smooth feeling on my face.  </li>
            <li>Free trail size DO NOT FALL FOR THIS .My</li>
            <li>free trail cost me $139.00.I tried to return these products but was told they would refund my money</li>
            <li>I enjoy it on my face.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, it really does erase/ tighten up  those wrinkles and almost within seconds of putting it on.</li>
            <li>I ordered One as a free trail, yet got Two.</li>
            <li>Onto the important information: it does soften wrinkles and smooth out the skin.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, my credit card company is stepping in to recover my funds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>well so far so good.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing special about this or their skin renewal products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Ingredients listed on bottle of Wrinkless*&lt;br /&gt;water, cetyl alcohol, sodium acrylate, sodium acryloyl dimethyltaurate copolymer, glyceryl stearate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, glycerin, sweet almond oil, acetyl-hexapeptide-8, acrylamide/sodium acrylate copolymer, mineral oil, trideceth-6, dimethicone, saccharide isomerate, pseudoalteromonas ferment extract, hydrolized wheat protein, hydrolyzed soy protein, tripeptide-10 citruline, tripeptide-1, lecithin, xanthum gum, carbomer, triethanolamine, phenoxyethanol, butylene glycol, caprylyl glycol, ubiquinone 50, squalane, sodium carboxymethyl beta glucan, aloe vera gel, propylene glycol, diazolidinyl urea, iodopropynyl butyl carbamate, sodium EDTA, avocado fruit extract, carrot root extract, cucumber fruit extract, ginseng root extract, Linden tree leaf extract, and Tromethamine (an anti-inflammatory drug and analgesic made by the pharmaceutical company Roche).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They wanted to charge him full value at the end of the month.</li>
            <li>Obviously, you can&#x27;t get good cream for $5</li>
            <li>Love the cream - great texture and I really believe I look better after using it for a few months!  </li>
            <li>It is true amazement before your eyes.</li>
            <li>- I reccommend the full sized product over the samples though...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to use a straight moisturizer on my face, until this one; all of the rest make me break out.</li>
            <li>You can feel the cream firming up your skin right away, and you really don&#x27;t have to use much to get good results.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely the best, most gentle, facial moisturizer I have tried.</li>
            <li>After the first month, I started adding moisturizer at night which also seems to give a bit more smoothness and reduces the look of large pores.  </li>
            <li>I used this face cream and did not like it at all, you have to use a lot of it just to feel like you did put something on your face,&lt;br /&gt;it does not rub into you skin easily, you have to really work at it, besides it did not work the way the advertisement showed.</li>
            <li>read the fine print and saw that i was responsible for returning both products at my expense-</li>
            <li>I ordered the $5 \\&quot;free\\&quot; trial and received 60 days worth (2 bottles each) of cream.</li>
            <li>Worth every cent I paid</li>
            <li>Not quite worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>Nice product combined with companion product; seems to work very well so far</li>
            <li>Quite frankly, the smell is worth the results.</li>
            <li>I have used many wrinkle creams though out life and have never seen such quick results  like this.</li>
            <li>the jar and texture is great because you don&#x27;t need to use but a small amount on the areas you need it on.</li>
            <li>and I will be a life long purchaser and user of this amazing skin cream.</li>
            <li>The medicated type odor seems less pleasant than many&lt;br /&gt;creams, but I plan to order it if the cost is reasonable since tightening my&lt;br /&gt;face and neck skin was my goal of trying the product.</li>
            <li>This may explain why there are currently 70 complaints against the manufacturer (Ojas Enterprises) listed with the Better Business Bureau.  </li>
            <li>parents were still willing to pay until my mom opened one of the bottle and....</li>
            <li>Will order more in the future.</li>
            <li>Love how it goes on but in hot humid weather it left my face feeling sticky which I did not like.</li>
            <li>I got the first shipment only three days before the first 15 day time limit so my account was charged immediately which is OK.  </li>
            <li>figured this was just the trade off for a cream that REALLY WORKS!  </li>
            <li>I really like this product!  </li>
            <li>I might not be as upset if purchased through Amazon, but my experience was first through the Aloe vella company.  </li>
            <li>jar was nowhere near full, perhaps used and returned and rewrapped in c</li>
            <li>This is the very first in a long line of creams I have used, and there&#x27;s been a lot, that has shown a significant improvement in my wrinkles and softness of my skin.</li>
            <li>Enter Amazon, where I was able to procure a single jar without signing up.</li>
            <li>This really has been helpful in softening wrinkles around my mouth caused by using dentures.  </li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>then in the very smallest of print mention that they will be charging your credit card</li>
            <li>The representative from Ojas was very helpful and polite.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is great for sensitive skin, and for minimal to moderate wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Really that&#x27;s all u need to know.</li>
            <li>Does not perform as advertised, I seems no different than the cheap alternatives available at the local drug store.  </li>
            <li>but so far they look better and it has only been 5 days.  </li>
            <li>This free trial sample- after sent back and original shipping cost 14.95 plus the $8 to have it sent back.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure everyone can agree this is extremely unethical marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I saw the charge on my card for the full price of the product, I called the company about the extra charge and the fact that I was dissatisfied with product.</li>
            <li>lovely!)At first, i was surprised at the medicinal odor , but then read the ingredients...</li>
            <li>Basically, I&#x27;ve to ship the item back to them within 10 days and everything would be fine if I included both items among which one should be completely sealed/unused.</li>
            <li>but I have older skin</li>
            <li>However, just because a product is all natural, it doesn&#x27;t mean its good for your skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>However, I do use a heavier Night Cream that is completely Organic, because of loss of moisture at night!!</li>
            <li>live on a fixed income and this really upset me</li>
            <li>It appears that the manufacturer has invented their own definition of \\&quot;all natural\\&quot;, as half of the ingredients are synthetic including several forms of acrylate and acrylamide copolymers (carcinogens and neurotoxins), along with Tromethamine.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels like new.</li>
            <li>Wow, what fraud!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a complete convert!  </li>
            <li>I usually only use Organic products, but this one is more natural than any other product I have seen in the Marketplace.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice it, but I am accustomed to using products that may smell a little strange; artificial fragrances, which many skin-care companies employ in order to make their products more appealing, irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>far as how the product performs...I have no idea.</li>
            <li>This cream had ingredients listed on the jar that may have been carcinogenic, also dye, and perfume that were not all natural ingredients..</li>
            <li>SO PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR GET RIPPED OFF</li>
            <li>Really smooths my upper lip lines which bothered me a lot.</li>
            <li>Complete ripoff.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product a month ago and it CONTINUES to show a marked improvement in the texture, glow and diminishment of wrinkles on my face/neck.</li>
            <li>The last jar I received the cream had separate and it would not spread on my face very well.  </li>
            <li>I was told that the Wrinkless should be used at night and the Ayur during the day because the Wrinkless can make you sun sensitive.  </li>
            <li>So far, it seems to be helping</li>
            <li>Claim to be all natural is suspect when looking at the ingrediants.</li>
            <li>the all natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I developed a burn like rash around one eye</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to call it</li>
            <li>The product does moisturize my face better than my previous cream, but not much improvement with wrinkles so far.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;free trial\\&quot; was apparently for 15 days, after which I now own TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS worth of horrible face cream.</li>
            <li>Despite calls and emails to Aloe Vella seeking to cancel the subscription the only solution I could find was to cancel my credit card and request a new number.</li>
            <li>So, I tried to order off the company&#x27;s website, but they want you to sign up for auto-delivery of a jar a month, which is ridiculous, since one jar is going to last me many months.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed huge improvements regarding wrinkles and tighter skin, but not much improvement for the dark circles under the eye area.</li>
            <li>I had noticeable forehead wrinkles, now they&#x27;re barely visible, even from up close.</li>
            <li>That sample lasted several weeks -- long enough to prove that it did work and was gentle enough for my skin.</li>
            <li>I think the organic materials break down in older samples(?)</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The product in the jar seems Not to be more water than the cream.</li>
            <li> Packets were more creamy, stayed on, when you massaged it in you felt it.</li>
            <li> get better results.</li>
            <li> I was so glad I found these products on Amazon</li>
            <li> I love this product and don&#x27;t mind the smell at all.</li>
            <li> it does like as if by magic ...</li>
            <li> Will be reporting them to the better business bureau.</li>
            <li> I love getting samples of WRINKLESS in the mail..</li>
            <li> I really am pleased with the way these products make my skin feel</li>
            <li> The hype was better than the results.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> Better use a beauty product that is established.</li>
            <li> I love the camphor smell, I like the tingle you get (partly because I grew up with noxzema).</li>
            <li> What bothers me most is their advertising and trying to pull one over on the consumer.</li>
            <li> This product tightened my skin better than most creams which helps wrinkles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> and I really love it.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for more than two months now, and I can see improvement in reducing the age lines that were so prominent.</li>
            <li> EXCEPT the results from trying it the first time!!!</li>
            <li> I got this cream with the Ayur cream and so far have not noticed any thing great by using these creams.</li>
            <li> The results is more important than the smell everyone keeps talking about.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li> A jar is not as sanitary as a dispenser bottle; consequently, it is best to use a cotton swab to scoop out the amount needed, and it&#x27;s kind of hard to be vigilant about that.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend you NOT to buy this product from their website.</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural with Aloe Vella which we all know has alway been good for are skin.</li>
            <li> The lines around my mouth are gone and my fine lines around my eyes are almost gone...</li>
            <li> A quick aside - the parent company, Ojas Enterprises, has an F rating on the Better Business Bureau.</li>
            <li> The texture of this stuff is a little funky and the smell is not the best but not objectionable.  </li>
            <li> Kept my makeup smooth and my face from drying out during the Holidays.</li>
            <li> Was light</li>
            <li> It has a smooth feeling on my face.  </li>
            <li> Free trail size DO NOT FALL FOR THIS .My</li>
            <li> free trail cost me $139.00.I tried to return these products but was told they would refund my money</li>
            <li> I enjoy it on my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, it really does erase/ tighten up  those wrinkles and almost within seconds of putting it on.</li>
            <li> I ordered One as a free trail, yet got Two.</li>
            <li> Onto the important information: it does soften wrinkles and smooth out the skin.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, my credit card company is stepping in to recover my funds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well so far so good.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing special about this or their skin renewal products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Ingredients listed on bottle of Wrinkless*&lt;br /&gt;water, cetyl alcohol, sodium acrylate, sodium acryloyl dimethyltaurate copolymer, glyceryl stearate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, glycerin, sweet almond oil, acetyl-hexapeptide-8, acrylamide/sodium acrylate copolymer, mineral oil, trideceth-6, dimethicone, saccharide isomerate, pseudoalteromonas ferment extract, hydrolized wheat protein, hydrolyzed soy protein, tripeptide-10 citruline, tripeptide-1, lecithin, xanthum gum, carbomer, triethanolamine, phenoxyethanol, butylene glycol, caprylyl glycol, ubiquinone 50, squalane, sodium carboxymethyl beta glucan, aloe vera gel, propylene glycol, diazolidinyl urea, iodopropynyl butyl carbamate, sodium EDTA, avocado fruit extract, carrot root extract, cucumber fruit extract, ginseng root extract, Linden tree leaf extract, and Tromethamine (an anti-inflammatory drug and analgesic made by the pharmaceutical company Roche).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They wanted to charge him full value at the end of the month.</li>
            <li> Obviously, you can&#x27;t get good cream for $5</li>
            <li> Love the cream - great texture and I really believe I look better after using it for a few months!  </li>
            <li> It is true amazement before your eyes.</li>
            <li> - I reccommend the full sized product over the samples though...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to use a straight moisturizer on my face, until this one; all of the rest make me break out.</li>
            <li> You can feel the cream firming up your skin right away, and you really don&#x27;t have to use much to get good results.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely the best, most gentle, facial moisturizer I have tried.</li>
            <li> After the first month, I started adding moisturizer at night which also seems to give a bit more smoothness and reduces the look of large pores.  </li>
            <li> I used this face cream and did not like it at all, you have to use a lot of it just to feel like you did put something on your face,&lt;br /&gt;it does not rub into you skin easily, you have to really work at it, besides it did not work the way the advertisement showed.</li>
            <li> read the fine print and saw that i was responsible for returning both products at my expense-</li>
            <li> I ordered the $5 \\&quot;free\\&quot; trial and received 60 days worth (2 bottles each) of cream.</li>
            <li> Worth every cent I paid</li>
            <li> Not quite worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price</li>
            <li> Nice product combined with companion product; seems to work very well so far</li>
            <li> Quite frankly, the smell is worth the results.</li>
            <li> I have used many wrinkle creams though out life and have never seen such quick results  like this.</li>
            <li> the jar and texture is great because you don&#x27;t need to use but a small amount on the areas you need it on.</li>
            <li> and I will be a life long purchaser and user of this amazing skin cream.</li>
            <li> The medicated type odor seems less pleasant than many&lt;br /&gt;creams, but I plan to order it if the cost is reasonable since tightening my&lt;br /&gt;face and neck skin was my goal of trying the product.</li>
            <li> This may explain why there are currently 70 complaints against the manufacturer (Ojas Enterprises) listed with the Better Business Bureau.  </li>
            <li> parents were still willing to pay until my mom opened one of the bottle and....</li>
            <li> Will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> Love how it goes on but in hot humid weather it left my face feeling sticky which I did not like.</li>
            <li> I got the first shipment only three days before the first 15 day time limit so my account was charged immediately which is OK.  </li>
            <li> figured this was just the trade off for a cream that REALLY WORKS!  </li>
            <li> I really like this product!  </li>
            <li> I might not be as upset if purchased through Amazon, but my experience was first through the Aloe vella company.  </li>
            <li> jar was nowhere near full, perhaps used and returned and rewrapped in c</li>
            <li> This is the very first in a long line of creams I have used, and there&#x27;s been a lot, that has shown a significant improvement in my wrinkles and softness of my skin.</li>
            <li> Enter Amazon, where I was able to procure a single jar without signing up.</li>
            <li> This really has been helpful in softening wrinkles around my mouth caused by using dentures.  </li>
            <li> This works very well.</li>
            <li> then in the very smallest of print mention that they will be charging your credit card</li>
            <li> The representative from Ojas was very helpful and polite.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great for sensitive skin, and for minimal to moderate wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Really that&#x27;s all u need to know.</li>
            <li> Does not perform as advertised, I seems no different than the cheap alternatives available at the local drug store.  </li>
            <li> but so far they look better and it has only been 5 days.  </li>
            <li> This free trial sample- after sent back and original shipping cost 14.95 plus the $8 to have it sent back.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure everyone can agree this is extremely unethical marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw the charge on my card for the full price of the product, I called the company about the extra charge and the fact that I was dissatisfied with product.</li>
            <li> lovely!)At first, i was surprised at the medicinal odor , but then read the ingredients...</li>
            <li> Basically, I&#x27;ve to ship the item back to them within 10 days and everything would be fine if I included both items among which one should be completely sealed/unused.</li>
            <li> but I have older skin</li>
            <li> However, just because a product is all natural, it doesn&#x27;t mean its good for your skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> However, I do use a heavier Night Cream that is completely Organic, because of loss of moisture at night!!</li>
            <li> live on a fixed income and this really upset me</li>
            <li> It appears that the manufacturer has invented their own definition of \\&quot;all natural\\&quot;, as half of the ingredients are synthetic including several forms of acrylate and acrylamide copolymers (carcinogens and neurotoxins), along with Tromethamine.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels like new.</li>
            <li> Wow, what fraud!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a complete convert!  </li>
            <li> I usually only use Organic products, but this one is more natural than any other product I have seen in the Marketplace.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice it, but I am accustomed to using products that may smell a little strange; artificial fragrances, which many skin-care companies employ in order to make their products more appealing, irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> far as how the product performs...I have no idea.</li>
            <li> This cream had ingredients listed on the jar that may have been carcinogenic, also dye, and perfume that were not all natural ingredients..</li>
            <li> SO PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR GET RIPPED OFF</li>
            <li> Really smooths my upper lip lines which bothered me a lot.</li>
            <li> Complete ripoff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a month ago and it CONTINUES to show a marked improvement in the texture, glow and diminishment of wrinkles on my face/neck.</li>
            <li> The last jar I received the cream had separate and it would not spread on my face very well.  </li>
            <li> I was told that the Wrinkless should be used at night and the Ayur during the day because the Wrinkless can make you sun sensitive.  </li>
            <li> So far, it seems to be helping</li>
            <li> Claim to be all natural is suspect when looking at the ingrediants.</li>
            <li> the all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I developed a burn like rash around one eye</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to call it</li>
            <li> The product does moisturize my face better than my previous cream, but not much improvement with wrinkles so far.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;free trial\\&quot; was apparently for 15 days, after which I now own TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS worth of horrible face cream.</li>
            <li> Despite calls and emails to Aloe Vella seeking to cancel the subscription the only solution I could find was to cancel my credit card and request a new number.</li>
            <li> So, I tried to order off the company&#x27;s website, but they want you to sign up for auto-delivery of a jar a month, which is ridiculous, since one jar is going to last me many months.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed huge improvements regarding wrinkles and tighter skin, but not much improvement for the dark circles under the eye area.</li>
            <li> I had noticeable forehead wrinkles, now they&#x27;re barely visible, even from up close.</li>
            <li> That sample lasted several weeks -- long enough to prove that it did work and was gentle enough for my skin.</li>
            <li> I think the organic materials break down in older samples(?)</li>
            <li> It is a little high priced</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t faze deep set wringles but works very well on small ones.</li>
            <li> Search hard and read everything first.  </li>
            <li> I was issued only HALF of my $ 90 when I should have gotten the complete refund.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to offer an opinion.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost a lot of weight on a special diet and am working hard to keep wrinkled skin down.</li>
            <li> They are only returning only $ 59 back as they CLAIM I only sent back ONE bottle and not the other ( which I DID return BOTH- NO question!!! )</li>
            <li> Anything all natural will smell a little.</li>
            <li> I have been using  this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> red, itchy, bumpy from mid face area and down.</li>
            <li> It can irritate and dry your skin.</li>
            <li> and I only had to pay half price to keep the products .Sure</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look so much younger and less</li>
            <li> Sometimes the lid is not screwed down tight enough and lose some of the cream before you open it.</li>
            <li> In case you are wondering what \\&quot;Carbopol 940\\&quot; is, it&#x27;s made by a chemical company called Lubrizol and is loosely described as a \\&quot;cross-linked polyacrylate polymer\\&quot;, which, if you search further, is contaminated with heavy metals and benzene (a carcinogen).</li>
            <li> I got a little suspicious, read the actual letter and turns out they just had him subscribed to the product.</li>
            <li> I was glad to order through Amazon because I had a bad experience ordering from the company, Aloe Vella.</li>
            <li> is the worst smell I have ever experienced.  </li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not ready for.</li>
            <li> I ended up with EXTREMELY dried out skin , especially around the jawline and neck areas...</li>
            <li> The little sample arrived in the mail, and since I only need moisturizer in a few dry areas, I just tried it there instead of wasting it on my hands, which is what the directions on the sample said to do.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get through on the phone and not sure if I can get my money back.</li>
            <li> I ended up calling them in my pissed off voice and the dude on the other end</li>
            <li> Also Ayur Gold Water and any other products</li>
            <li> I read in other reviews when u buy from the company they put you on automatic refill.  </li>
            <li> The creams color is not consistent with every jar, neither is the consistency and texture.</li>
            <li> What can I Say, it works.better than all the other creams I have tried.</li>
            <li> THEN, when I DID return the other two bottles UNOPENED and IN PLENTY of time-</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t gressy like some of the other products out their.</li>
            <li> I threw it away because it is not a recognizable name or company and it might be damaging to my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is scary to think that Tromethamine might be covering up any irritating effects of the many chemicals in this cream.  </li>
            <li> Nothing natural about those, and this stuff sure as heck doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume, it smells like disgusting chemicals.    </li>
            <li> Holy cow  </li>
            <li> Have to use a powder that doubles function as a base foundation and a powder and still must go very lightly and pouf it on not swipe it.  </li>
            <li> Put it on after you wash your face, while its still a little wet.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have mentioned that it has an odd odor.</li>
            <li> I also has softened all wrinkles on the rest of my face that were not so obvious, so now you can hardly see them at all.  </li>
            <li> Definitely NOT WORTH</li>
            <li> far as I can tell, this is false advertising and could be harmful to consumers.  </li>
            <li> .. had to eat less  all because I saw their add on an internet  article I was reading.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-appeared to have been previously opened/used.</li>
            <li> I have had my jar for less than a week</li>
            <li> -  odd fragrance</li>
            <li> has anyone looked at the JAR- less than 1 oz.,</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily or mess up your makeup either.</li>
            <li> the smell isn&#x27;t that bad and goes away quickly...</li>
            <li> ( I was just looking for a little help with those &amp;#34;angry 11&#x27;s&amp;#34;, so that&#x27;s why I bought the products. )</li>
            <li> To make things worse, the ingredients listed on their website and in their advertisements are completely different than what is stated on my 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;t WASTE YOUR MONEY.CREAM SMELLY, GOT A RASH FROM USING</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time, or money.</li>
            <li> Get over the odor for a few seconds..and POW..</li>
            <li> It reminds me a bit of Campho-Phenique, but it does dissipate after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Save the cash and move past this one, it&#x27;s just not worth the asking price.</li>
            <li> IT JUST plain WORKS...</li>
            <li> Has a very odd plastic type smell to it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any positive results as far as wrinkles go, and the smell is horrible.  </li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  </li>
            <li> I was immediately skeptical of this product and decided to do further research on the ingredients.</li>
            <li> So if you are going to purchase from them, buy from Amazon, but I&#x27;d recommend not touching this stuff with a 10 foot pole.    </li>
            <li> Worst scam ever and the customer service department even more probelmatic.  </li>
            <li> Camphor, or menthol or eucalyptus is not very good for your skin.</li>
            <li> If you want to try an actual natural wrinkle cream, try NYR Organics, Bella Organics, Arganica Argan Oil, or a really small company that doesn&#x27;t send you random crap in the mail.</li>
            <li> and now they are probably untraceable.</li>
            <li> The company is a is dishonest in their advertisements.  </li>
            <li> I have taken this up with my credit card company and made a complaint.</li>
            <li> EXPENSIVE, not worth it.  </li>
            <li> It was thick on the skin and somewhat irritating because I felt itchy.  </li>
            <li> but I have never experienced a cream like this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product, they don&#x27;t stand behind it.</li>
            <li> It shares the falsely advertised ingredient problem and sneaky autoship commitment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> False advertising...</li>
            <li> They were very unpleasant and said it was past the time I could have returned the product by a few days, so they would not refund anything.</li>
            <li> It smells like a weird baby powder to me.  </li>
            <li> I will not put it on my skin with the potentially dangerous ingredients it contains.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and the cream is awful, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> And then it moisturizes, but a bit sticky so not a great foundation base.</li>
            <li> I tried the cream and found that it was NOT effective against wrinkles and also had a very bad smell.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> It was so bad that when it got on my hand,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Bad Customer Service, argumentative phone people and a rip off.  </li>
            <li> When you are sent a bad jar, it&#x27;s really bad.</li>
            <li> NOTHING could make me use something that smelled as bad as the samples of this stuff -</li>
            <li> because the jarred product doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as bad.</li>
            <li> $39.99.I was shocked .I</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t rub in well, awful texture, smells bad, made my face chapped.</li>
            <li> false bottom, and an insert in the jar holding the product-  shameful!!!!</li>
            <li> It smells terrible as well.    </li>
            <li> it smelled awful.</li>
            <li> Horrible product....</li>
            <li> Terrible product!</li>
            <li> A terrible scam, stay away!  </li>
            <li> Has a horrible smell, save your money, no visible results with 60 days of use.  </li>

            <li> I just received Wrinkless yesterday, but will be returning it today.  It appears that the manufacturer has invented their own definition of \\&quot;all natural\\&quot;, as half of the ingredients are synthetic including several forms of acrylate and acrylamide copolymers (carcinogens and neurotoxins), along with Tromethamine.  The latter is a pharmaceutical drug made by the  company Roche that acts as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic. It is scary to think that Tromethamine might be covering up any irritating effects of the many chemicals in this cream.  To make things worse, the ingredients listed on their website and in their advertisements are completely different than what is stated on my 2 bottles. Compare for  yourself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Website Ingredient list for Wrinkless*&lt;br /&gt;Carrot Seed Oil, Winter Cherry Extract, Brahmi, Aloe Vera, Sesame Seed Oil, Turmeric, Cinnamon, Mustard Seed, Ginger &amp; Honey, Clove Oil, Saffron, Cardamom Oil, Pearl, and Camphor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Ingredients listed on bottle of Wrinkless*&lt;br /&gt;water, cetyl alcohol, sodium acrylate, sodium acryloyl dimethyltaurate copolymer, glyceryl stearate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, glycerin, sweet almond oil, acetyl-hexapeptide-8, acrylamide/sodium acrylate copolymer, mineral oil, trideceth-6, dimethicone, saccharide isomerate, pseudoalteromonas ferment extract, hydrolized wheat protein, hydrolyzed soy protein, tripeptide-10 citruline, tripeptide-1, lecithin, xanthum gum, carbomer, triethanolamine, phenoxyethanol, butylene glycol, caprylyl glycol, ubiquinone 50, squalane, sodium carboxymethyl beta glucan, aloe vera gel, propylene glycol, diazolidinyl urea, iodopropynyl butyl carbamate, sodium EDTA, avocado fruit extract, carrot root extract, cucumber fruit extract, ginseng root extract, Linden tree leaf extract, and Tromethamine (an anti-inflammatory drug and analgesic made by the pharmaceutical company Roche).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I can tell, this is false advertising and could be harmful to consumers.  This may explain why there are currently 70 complaints against the manufacturer (Ojas Enterprises) listed with the Better Business Bureau.  I also feel that the manufacturer is using a form of trickery in their promotion that you have 30 days from the date of purchase to decide if you like the product.  My Wrinkless cream took almost a month to ship, which left me with only 2 days to decide if I wanted a refund and to cancel the autoship that I didn&#x27;t know they signed me up for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as how the product performs...I have no idea. I will not put it on my skin with the potentially dangerous ingredients it contains.  The same goes for the sister product I purchased at the same time:  Ayur Skin Renewal Serum.  It shares the falsely advertised ingredient problem and sneaky autoship commitment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion, avoid this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased Aloe Vella Wrinkless cream and the ingredients contained in it were different from the ingredients labeled on the advertisement and on the information sent with the samples. This cream had ingredients listed on the jar that may have been carcinogenic, also dye, and perfume that were not all natural ingredients.. It lacked the pearl powder,turmeric,and saffron that is listed on the advertised samples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called the company but got nowhere. I was told since I purchased the cream from Amazon.com that it may have been altered. I called Amazon.com and they helped me return the cream to the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> has yellow dye.  Be sure and check all additives before you order.  Product may be very good, but can not use any products with dyes. I am returning the product.  I will let you know how the return goes.</li>
            <li> Kept my makeup smooth and my face from drying out during the Holidays. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This company is totally fraudulent--do not be scammed!! I ordered the $5 \\&quot;free\\&quot; trial and received 60 days worth (2 bottles each) of cream. I was charged $10 on that credit card statement. However, on my following credit card bill I have charges for $100 and $139!!!!! The \\&quot;free trial\\&quot; was apparently for 15 days, after which I now own TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS worth of horrible face cream. Wow, what fraud! I was also automatically signed up for autoship, so if I had not called them I would have continued to receive charges on my credit card. Oh, and the cream is awful, don&#x27;t waste your money. I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks with zero benefit. It smells terrible as well.    If you were also scammed, please submit complaints with the following organizations:    http://www.ag.ny.gov/internet-bureau-online-complaint-form    http://www.bbb.org/    Also try to get the charges reversed by filing a dispute with your credit card.  Let&#x27;s try to put these unethical scammers out of business!!</li>
            <li> The company advertises that you will receive a trial for just the cost of shipping, so I ordered the trial product. When I received the product, there were two containers of Wrinkless Cream. I thought that was the quantity needed for the trial.  I tried the cream and found that it was NOT effective against wrinkles and also had a very bad smell.&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the charge on my card for the full price of the product, I called the company about the extra charge and the fact that I was dissatisfied with product. They were very unpleasant and said it was past the time I could have returned the product by a few days, so they would not refund anything.</li>
            <li> I could see a noticeable difference when it was applied.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d bought this from Amazon instead of using a link to it in my email and getting it from Foresight Media. They said I&#x27;d pay only $7.40, but they took $229.80!!! I can&#x27;t get through on the phone and not sure if I can get my money back. It took about a month to get it and now they are probably untraceable. This has never happened to me before. Be careful. The product does moisturize my face better than my previous cream, but not much improvement with wrinkles so far.</li>
            <li> good seller .. good product</li>
            <li> I have not purchased this cream, but received a sample in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;This is the worst smell I have ever experienced.  It was so bad that when it got on my hand,&lt;br /&gt;I freaked out when I could not get the smell off.....(even after I washed 3 times).&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I would rather have wrinkles than use this cream!!!&lt;br /&gt;It would be torture having this on my face and having to smell like a perfumed corpse all day.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend you NOT to buy this product from their website. Hell if you can help it, do NOT buy this product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dad got two from them and they initially charged him $5 for shipping and handling. I got a little suspicious, read the actual letter and turns out they just had him subscribed to the product. They wanted to charge him full value at the end of the month. They also had him setup to receive two boxes every two month. Obviously, you can&#x27;t get good cream for $5 but I&#x27;m sure everyone can agree this is extremely unethical marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My parents were still willing to pay until my mom opened one of the bottle and....it smelled awful. Dad called up and asked for return/refund and they wanted him to pay for return shipping (okay) AND they wanted to charge him $20 for god knows what reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ended up calling them in my pissed off voice and the dude on the other end was still trying to make a bargain. I eventually threaten to call my CC at which point they agreed they would not charge us any money. Basically, I&#x27;ve to ship the item back to them within 10 days and everything would be fine if I included both items among which one should be completely sealed/unused. I&#x27;m gonna have to pay for shipping but I&#x27;ll be glad to get rid of this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still got a feeling that they will end up charging some money at which point we&#x27;ll be calling the credit card.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this.  The company is a is dishonest in their advertisements.  On top of that, I am allergic to the product.  It doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  Horrible product....Company is a SCAM!</li>
            <li> well so far so good.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to offer an opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice cream but noting as miraculous as it claims to be!</li>
            <li> The product in the jar seems Not to be more water than the cream. Packets were more creamy, stayed on, when you massaged it in you felt it. Was light but you knew it was on.</li>
            <li> I like the cream.  It has a smooth feeling on my face.  I don&#x27;t know if it helps eliminate wrinkles because&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.</li>
            <li> Love the cream - great texture and I really believe I look better after using it for a few months!  Try it!</li>
            <li> The texture of this stuff is a little funky and the smell is not the best but not objectionable.  Probably will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was immediately skeptical of this product and decided to do further research on the ingredients. A quick aside - the parent company, Ojas Enterprises, has an F rating on the Better Business Bureau. So if you are going to purchase from them, buy from Amazon, but I&#x27;d recommend not touching this stuff with a 10 foot pole.    Actual ingredients (from [...]): D.M. Water, Aloe Vera Juice(90% Concentrated, Stearic Acid, Mustard Oil, Glycerin, Honey, Sorbitol, Camphor, Cocoa Butter, Winter Cherry Extract, Bees Wax, Carbopol 940, Sodium Benzoate, Tocopherol(Vitamin E), Almond Oil, Brahmi Oil, Cinnamon Oil, Cardamom Oil, Ginger Oil, Clove Oil, Carrot Seed Oil, FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6, Perfume.    In case you are wondering what \\&quot;Carbopol 940\\&quot; is, it&#x27;s made by a chemical company called Lubrizol and is loosely described as a \\&quot;cross-linked polyacrylate polymer\\&quot;, which, if you search further, is contaminated with heavy metals and benzene (a carcinogen). Also, yellow 6 and perfume? Nothing natural about those, and this stuff sure as heck doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume, it smells like disgusting chemicals.    If you want to try an actual natural wrinkle cream, try NYR Organics, Bella Organics, Arganica Argan Oil, or a really small company that doesn&#x27;t send you random crap in the mail. And no, I don&#x27;t work for those companies.</li>
            <li> This really has been helpful in softening wrinkles around my mouth caused by using dentures.  I also has softened all wrinkles on the rest of my face that were not so obvious, so now you can hardly see them at all.  I usually only use Organic products, but this one is more natural than any other product I have seen in the Marketplace.  However, I do use a heavier Night Cream that is completely Organic, because of loss of moisture at night!!</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;t WASTE YOUR MONEY.CREAM SMELLY, GOT A RASH FROM USING IT.&lt;br /&gt;TRYING FOR 2 MONTHS TO GET A REFUND......STILL WAITING!!!</li>
            <li> There is nothing special about this or their skin renewal products.Free trail size DO NOT FALL FOR THIS .My free trail cost me $139.00.I tried to return these products but was told they would refund my money and I only had to pay half price to keep the products .Sure why not?After receiving my bank statement they refunded me $39.99.I was shocked .I live on a fixed income and this really upset me but I didn&#x27;t know what to do.. had to eat less  all because I saw their add on an internet  article I was reading.Using tnese products did nothing at all for my skin.Honestly you would be better buying OIL OF OLAY .and get better results.I was so glad I found these products on Amazon so I could get this out. SO PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR GET RIPPED OFF LIKE I DID  PLEASE REMEMBER THE NAMES SO IF THEY POP UP ON THE INTERNET FOR A FREE TRAIL JUST PLEASE STAY AWAY!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was sent a sample, liked it and ordered a jar. Love it! Really smooths my upper lip lines which bothered me a lot. Will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> DO NOT purchase anything from this company.  They will NOT cancel your order and charge your card, after you specifically tell them not to.  Also Ayur Gold Water and any other products Ojas Enterprises sells.  Bad Customer Service, argumentative phone people and a rip off.  Have turned them into BBB and Rip Off report.  Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I had noticeable forehead wrinkles, now they&#x27;re barely visible, even from up close. This cream smells medicinal, but I actually kind of like it. It doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily or mess up your makeup either. After putting this cream on I let it sink in for about a minute; then I put my primer and makeup on over it. You can feel the cream firming up your skin right away, and you really don&#x27;t have to use much to get good results.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do all it claims but I have older skin and it definitely improves my skin and softens the wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;It is one of the best anti wrinkle creams I&#x27;ve tried.  I was glad to order through Amazon because I had a bad experience ordering from the company, Aloe Vella.</li>
            <li> Did not see any advantage over a good face cream.</li>
            <li> Best wrinkle cream ever...IT JUST plain WORKS...the smell isn&#x27;t that bad and goes away quickly...the jar and texture is great because you don&#x27;t need to use but a small amount on the areas you need it on. I love it!</li>
            <li> I got this cream with the Ayur cream and so far have not noticed any thing great by using these creams.</li>
            <li> I was totally dissatisfied with this product because:&lt;br /&gt;-appeared to have been previously opened/used. Somehow there were traces of the cream on the outside of the jar that had turned brown from age.&lt;br /&gt;-It smelled rancid/old&lt;br /&gt;-the jar was nowhere near full, perhaps used and returned and rewrapped in c It had no seal on the inside of the jar</li>
            <li> Complete ripoff. Do not use ever. Does not work.</li>
            <li> This cream felt very good n my face</li>
            <li> I love this product and don&#x27;t mind the smell at all. Anything all natural will smell a little. Love how it goes on but in hot humid weather it left my face feeling sticky which I did not like. Have stopped using it for now. Will start using it again in the Fall.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for the money. Everyone in our family uses it.</li>
            <li> This cream does everything it says it does like as if by magic ...the wrinkles are gone, Nada one on your face, but God is it smelly and not in a good way. The odor is just about unbearable to take... But the magic it does is incredible. And then it moisturizes, but a bit sticky so not a great foundation base. Have to use a powder that doubles function as a base foundation and a powder and still must go very lightly and pouf it on not swipe it.  I would have given four of three stars because of the smell but I have never experienced a cream like this. It is true amazement before your eyes.</li>
            <li> Terrible product! Doesn&#x27;t rub in well, awful texture, smells bad, made my face chapped. They wouldn&#x27;t refund it. Don&#x27;t buy this product, they don&#x27;t stand behind it. Wish I saw all the reviews before I bought it.</li>
            <li> I have been using  this product for a long time.  It works great otherwise I would not have reordered it.</li>
            <li> Great product! Just what I wanted. S</li>
            <li> It is absolutely a great wrinkle reducing cream. I use it on my neck.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any positive results as far as wrinkles go, and the smell is horrible.  It smells like a weird baby powder to me.  Yuk.</li>
            <li> Has a very odd plastic type smell to it. I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s all natural. Packet I received was awesome &amp; worked better then the purchase order. Probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for about 5 or 6 months and I&#x27;ve noticed huge improvements regarding wrinkles and tighter skin, but not much improvement for the dark circles under the eye area.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a month ago and it CONTINUES to show a marked improvement in the texture, glow and diminishment of wrinkles on my face/neck. Worth every cent I paid and I will be a life long purchaser and user of this amazing skin cream.</li>
            <li> A terrible scam, stay away!  Will be reporting them to the better business bureau.</li>
            <li> This works very well. I have just bought my third bottle thru Amazon so I can buy it when I need it instead of automatically getting a bottle I&#x27;m not ready for.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see any difference.  On my second bottle so will not buy again when this one is finished.</li>
            <li> Worst scam ever and the customer service department even more probelmatic.  Don&#x27;t waste your time, or money.</li>
            <li> I totally agree with  jnelou86 .  This is a total rip off. Do not buy this product!!!!!!!!! They make an offer to try it and then in the very smallest of print mention that they will be charging your credit card every month.&lt;br /&gt;BAD,BAD,BAD!!!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look younger and helps to remove freckles</li>
            <li> I love getting samples of WRINKLESS in the mail..They keep sending them,along with their product Luxoderm.(which smells lovely!)At first, i was surprised at the medicinal odor , but then read the ingredients...All natural..contains everything that nowadays they tell u your skin needs..Get over the odor for a few seconds..and POW..this stuff is great....And believe me ive made my own face nutrients, and bought them for years...The fact that it  doesnt remind u of walking in a field of flowers is because some of the good for your skin ingredients DON&#x27;T SMELL GOOD, Period.&lt;br /&gt;  I like it a lot..Only takes a little,let it soak in well. I pat mine in....I used my samples like gold...now will order more!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maya Pinion</li>
            <li> I have had my jar for less than a week and I&#x27;m impressed! The lines around my mouth are gone and my fine lines around my eyes are almost gone... Still waiting for the lines between my eye to go away but so far they look better and it has only been 5 days.  The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all like some people talk about... It does remind me of noxzema.  I would definitely buy from amazon I read in other reviews when u buy from the company they put you on automatic refill.  I like to decide when &amp;#34;I&amp;#34; need a refill.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> think this was way over price</li>
            <li> This works great.  The compliments are still coming in from friends and family.</li>
            <li> When you can get a good jar, it&#x27;s wonderful. When you are sent a bad jar, it&#x27;s really bad. The smell can be over whelming. The creams color is not consistent with every jar, neither is the consistency and texture. Sometimes the lid is not screwed down tight enough and lose some of the cream before you open it. But I do have to say, it works for wrinkles and it doesn&#x27;t break my face out. When I get a good jar. I am so happy. I enjoy it on my face. The last jar I received the cream had separate and it would not spread on my face very well.  What can I Say, it works.better than all the other creams I have tried. I hope you get a good one. I would give this product five stars if it were consistant, but each jar is a surprise.......</li>
            <li> I am using the Ayur cream and Wrinkless Cream.  I was told that the Wrinkless should be used at night and the Ayur during the day because the Wrinkless can make you sun sensitive.  The representative from Ojas was very helpful and polite.  He offered a 25% discount if I continued the automatic shipping.  I got the first shipment only three days before the first 15 day time limit so my account was charged immediately which is OK.  I really am pleased with the way these products make my skin feel and I have noticed reduction in the appearance of wrinkles.  I am going to keep using it to give it a really good try.  I&#x27;ll write another review in a month.</li>
            <li> If you buy from Ojas, don&#x27;t. They will rip you off!</li>
            <li> So far, it seems to be helping</li>
            <li> The hype was better than the results. Not quite worth the price.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Didn&#x27;t no my face could look the way this cream makes me look</li>
            <li> I love it. It feels great and seems to be doing a great job.I can already see the difference after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Has a horrible smell, save your money, no visible results with 60 days of use.  Claim to be all natural is suspect when looking at the ingrediants.</li>
            <li> Awesome I love it. ..is all I can say!! Well worth the price..easy to use no gimmicks. .love the all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> not too impressed so far  -  nice cream  -  does not cause any problems on my skin  -  odd fragrance however -  my wrinkles are all still there though!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!  THIS PRODUCT IS A TOTAL RIPOFF!  If Karma exists, the CEO will be reincarnated  as a slug.</li>
            <li> Nice product combined with companion product; seems to work very well so far</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, it really does erase/ tighten up  those wrinkles and almost within seconds of putting it on. The aroma is well...medicinal. It reminds me a bit of Campho-Phenique, but it does dissipate after a few minutes. Quite frankly, the smell is worth the results. (Never, thought I&#x27;d ever say that about a product.) I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with the cream clashing with my foundation, but I do use a primer with my mineral powder foundation.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars, because it is not finish, I will buy it again, then I will make another review.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It makes my skin look so much younger and less wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I was only using in the morning now I am using it both day &amp; night</li>
            <li> I used this face cream and did not like it at all, you have to use a lot of it just to feel like you did put something on your face,&lt;br /&gt;it does not rub into you skin easily, you have to really work at it, besides it did not work the way the advertisement showed.</li>
            <li> Used in conjunction with Ayur skin cream. I developed a burn like rash around one eye I am now trying to heal. Stay away! Better use a beauty product that is established. I&#x27;ve gone back to Clarins.</li>
            <li> Stinky, smelly and sticky!  Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I ordered these two items after reading very GOOD results and gave it a try. DON&#x27;T ORDER THESE PRODUCTS, PEOPLE!!!  If it sounds too good to be true, it IS! THEN, when I DID return the other two bottles UNOPENED and IN PLENTY of time- I was issued only HALF of my $ 90 when I should have gotten the complete refund. They are only returning only $ 59 back as they CLAIM I only sent back ONE bottle and not the other ( which I DID return BOTH- NO question!!! ) I have taken this up with my credit card company and made a complaint. ALSO- very important info!!- I ended up with EXTREMELY dried out skin , especially around the jawline and neck areas... red, itchy, bumpy from mid face area and down. I am still trying to RE HYDRATE MY usually beautiful skin  ( I was just looking for a little help with those &amp;#34;angry 11&#x27;s&amp;#34;, so that&#x27;s why I bought the products. ) VERY UPSET WITH THIS COMPANY !!!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t faze deep set wringles but works very well on small ones.</li>
            <li> NOTHING could make me use something that smelled as bad as the samples of this stuff - EXCEPT the results from trying it the first time!!! I&#x27;m a complete convert!  I think the organic materials break down in older samples(?) because the jarred product doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as bad. WRINKLES ARE VISIBLY REDUCED INSTANTLY - INSTANTLY - TAKE A PHOTO - YOU WILL WANT TO SEE THIS!!!  After a week, my 2 frown lines between my eyes were GONE....GONE!!!  I would have used it even if it had smelled the same as the samples from the jar....figured this was just the trade off for a cream that REALLY WORKS!  GREAT STUFF - I reccommend the full sized product over the samples though...smell is much more pleasant and it just works!</li>
            <li> I personally have a love/hate feeling about this cream. I love the camphor smell, I like the tingle you get (partly because I grew up with noxzema). I love the way it seems to tighten in a nice way on my face. However, just because a product is all natural, it doesn&#x27;t mean its good for your skin. Camphor, or menthol or eucalyptus is not very good for your skin. It can irritate and dry your skin. I have used it, but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I dont find it smelly or sticky etc like I have seen some comments from others- In fact i actually LIKE the moisturizing effect on my sin, - BUT have not noticed any difference in the appearance of my wrinkles. What bothers me most is their advertising and trying to pull one over on the consumer. I ordered One as a free trail, yet got Two. read the fine print and saw that i was responsible for returning both products at my expense- otherwise i would be continue to get shipments at 90.  Holy cow  who spends that kind of money on a lotion? also- has anyone looked at the JAR- less than 1 oz., false bottom, and an insert in the jar holding the product-  shameful!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost a lot of weight on a special diet and am working hard to keep wrinkled skin down. I feel this cream has been beneficial in that regard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to use a straight moisturizer on my face, until this one; all of the rest make me break out. The little sample arrived in the mail, and since I only need moisturizer in a few dry areas, I just tried it there instead of wasting it on my hands, which is what the directions on the sample said to do. That sample lasted several weeks -- long enough to prove that it did work and was gentle enough for my skin. So, I tried to order off the company&#x27;s website, but they want you to sign up for auto-delivery of a jar a month, which is ridiculous, since one jar is going to last me many months. Enter Amazon, where I was able to procure a single jar without signing up. Win! Onto the important information: it does soften wrinkles and smooth out the skin. I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to call it the kind of miracle the company hypes it as, but it&#x27;s definitely the best, most gentle, facial moisturizer I have tried. The product is not animal-tested, which is very important to me. Other reviewers have mentioned that it has an odd odor. I don&#x27;t notice it, but I am accustomed to using products that may smell a little strange; artificial fragrances, which many skin-care companies employ in order to make their products more appealing, irritate my skin. The only drawback to this cream is the packaging. A jar is not as sanitary as a dispenser bottle; consequently, it is best to use a cotton swab to scoop out the amount needed, and it&#x27;s kind of hard to be vigilant about that. This moisturizer is great for sensitive skin, and for minimal to moderate wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This product tightened my skin better than most creams which helps wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;appear smaller.  The medicated type odor seems less pleasant than many&lt;br /&gt;creams, but I plan to order it if the cost is reasonable since tightening my&lt;br /&gt;face and neck skin was my goal of trying the product.</li>
            <li> Saw no results.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have used many wrinkle creams though out life and have never seen such quick results  like this.I love that it is all natural with Aloe Vella which we all know has alway been good for are skin. It isn&#x27;t gressy like some of the other products out their. It is a little high priced but I buy it because this stuff works.</li>
            <li> False advertising...Beware of fine print...somewhere!!! Search hard and read everything first.  This free trial sample- after sent back and original shipping cost 14.95 plus the $8 to have it sent back.  EXPENSIVE, not worth it.  If you decide to keep it, it is 99.90.  Definitely NOT WORTH IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;The advertising is NOT obvious to the truth and facts surrounding the product!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love Aloe Vella! Why? Because it works! This is the very first in a long line of creams I have used, and there&#x27;s been a lot, that has shown a significant improvement in my wrinkles and softness of my skin. I will continue to use it forever! I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Awsome product. This is my second bottle of this stuff and I really love it. It really works. The cherry smell is not a problem for me. The results is more important than the smell everyone keeps talking about. Really that&#x27;s all u need to know. Thank you! Amazon for making it possible to order it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  Have been using it for more than two months now, and I can see improvement in reducing the age lines that were so prominent. The odor does not bother me enough not to use it. After the first month, I started adding moisturizer at night which also seems to give a bit more smoothness and reduces the look of large pores.  I think it works just as the ads say it will!</li>
            <li> Does not perform as advertised, I seems no different than the cheap alternatives available at the local drug store.  I might not be as upset if purchased through Amazon, but my experience was first through the Aloe vella company.  They employ a series of tricks to lock you into a subscription including attempts to charge your credit card under multiple vender names.  I wish I would have read the reviews here before doing business with this crooked outfit.  Despite calls and emails to Aloe Vella seeking to cancel the subscription the only solution I could find was to cancel my credit card and request a new number. Fortunately, my credit card company is stepping in to recover my funds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter where you buy it, the product is over priced and yields no attributable results. Save the cash and move past this one, it&#x27;s just not worth the asking price.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li> I did not like cream. It was thick on the skin and somewhat irritating because I felt itchy.  I threw it away because it is not a recognizable name or company and it might be damaging to my skin.  Decided to stay away from this product</li>
            <li> Wonderful!! Put it on after you wash your face, while its still a little wet. My skin feels like new. Highly recommend it.</li>
