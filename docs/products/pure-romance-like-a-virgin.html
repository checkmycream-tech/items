            <li>We already have amazing sex, but I keep trying new things and making it better always.</li>
            <li>great product ♡ I&#x27;ll come back with an update</li>
            <li>Their products are really worth it though!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure you don&#x27;t need that much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had for two months now and still have almost a full bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li>I think this product was worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never needed this product to begin with, me and my just recently married husband just wanted to try it for fun.</li>
            <li>You can go on Pure Romance website to find a consultant!</li>
            <li>This stuff works ladies and you don&#x27;t use very much.</li>
            <li>First package got lost BUT they took very care of me with a surprise-!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I had a orgasm during intercourse.</li>
            <li>We will be coming back for more.</li>
            <li>If you put too much inside you&#x27;ll close up!</li>
            <li>Use only if you really need!!!!</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s what you get with pure romance.</li>
            <li>Thank you much madam</li>
            <li>If to much is used it will close up.</li>
            <li>I ordered this wondering if this would really work...</li>
            <li>Honestly, I really didn&#x27;t think this product would work.</li>
            <li>but thanks anyway</li>
            <li>You should definitely wait for about an hour to get the full effect.  </li>
            <li>I ended up using a little too much just to make sure</li>
            <li>the following day i noticed a bit of a difference just feeling myself in the shower, I was almost scared it was too right after having had 4 kids</li>
            <li>I also paired it with Pure Romance&#x27;s Basic Instinct Attractant Perfume, and while I think my guy never notices these little things like most guys out there, they DO notice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>:) it is a small container</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t the same results as the first time...</li>
            <li>So I recommend this if u have only one partner that you don&#x27;t use protection, so this way y&#x27;all can both feel this product really work!</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I bought this product from a friend who is a actual pure romance consultant for 15 dollars.</li>
            <li>Not online because they might have old products and it might not work as well.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave the product 5 stars is because it really does work and do what its suppose to, if you need it.</li>
            <li>All in all, a good product, although the suggested method of application is useless.  </li>
            <li>I got it on all walls, and my little love canal nearly closed.</li>
            <li>It was almost painful lol.</li>
            <li>Even though tube is small, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept it from my hubby, and yes, it&#x27;s perfectly fine to keep our beauty secrets a secret.</li>

            <li> I followed the instructions and used a liberal amount due to having 3 children naturally.</li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so much money for such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> It is small but you need such a tiny amount it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Prefer a bigger size but other than that I recommend it !</li>
            <li> Besides, it is pretty darned expensive for the amount you get, but it&#x27;s definitely a quality product that I will continue buying.</li>
            <li> IM ONLY UPSET WITH THE PRICE YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR SUCH A SMALL TUBE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty tight, but it seriously makes me feel almost like a virgin again.</li>
            <li> , not much of a difference,</li>
            <li> it closed me up for hours, could get nothing inside.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this crap it does not work, if you do buy it you w ill be asking for a refune, dont wast your time and dont wast your good money!!!</li>
            <li> Tiny tube , half air half cream...</li>
            <li> #34;like a virgin&amp;#34; and wind up wondering what he did wrong that made you go back to normal on the times you don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> ; A little goes a long ways!</li>
            <li> Thats crazy for how much this cost!!</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the price for size of bottle</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> You only use a very small amt.  </li>
            <li> applied it about 45 before intercourse just to see if it would work less than 24 hours sooner</li>
            <li> Tried a few times before my review</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> , THE TUBE IS ENTIRELY TO SMALL.</li>
            <li> So small!</li>
            <li> i tired it</li>
            <li> It lasts 24 hours and apply a thin layer very thin layer.</li>
            <li> How small this was for the price is crazy!</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical about whether this would work or not.</li>
            <li> It is usually complicated for me to climax during intercourse.</li>
            <li> For those that say it didn&#x27;t work, perhaps they applied it wrong.</li>
            <li> Worthless.</li>
            <li> I was shocked by the size!</li>
            <li> insane</li>

            <li> First package got lost BUT they took very care of me with a surprise-! :) it is a small container but I&#x27;m sure you don&#x27;t need that much cause if you do you better start those kegels Which are 100% FREE :^) . Thank you much madam great product ♡ I&#x27;ll come back with an update</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 4 children, and use kegals. I ended up using a little too much just to make sure I got it on all walls, and my little love canal nearly closed. It was almost painful lol. So, they weren&#x27;t kidding. A pea sized amount does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept it from my hubby, and yes, it&#x27;s perfectly fine to keep our beauty secrets a secret. We already have amazing sex, but I keep trying new things and making it better always. It&#x27;s fun. I also paired it with Pure Romance&#x27;s Basic Instinct Attractant Perfume, and while I think my guy never notices these little things like most guys out there, they DO notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I wasn&#x27;t a hermit, I&#x27;d sell the stuff myself and hope for a discount so I can always use their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, don&#x27;t dare use this stuff constantly. Your partner will get used to you being &amp;#34;like a virgin&amp;#34; and wind up wondering what he did wrong that made you go back to normal on the times you don&#x27;t use it. Besides, it is pretty darned expensive for the amount you get, but it&#x27;s definitely a quality product that I will continue buying.</li>
            <li> This stuff works ladies and you don&#x27;t use very much. It lasts 24 hours and apply a thin layer very thin layer. If to much is used it will close up.</li>
            <li> OK FOR THE PRICE YOU PAY FOR THIS TINY 0.5 OZ TUBE IS INSANE &amp; FUTHER MORE THE SELLER NEEDS TO PUT THE SIZE OF THE TUBE IN THE DISCRIPTION THE TUBE LOOKS MUCH BIGGER IN THE PICTURE IT DOES WORK I BOUGHT IT AND I COULDNT BE ANY HAPPIER ABOUT IT IM ONLY UPSET WITH THE PRICE YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR SUCH A SMALL TUBE</li>
            <li> I ordered this wondering if this would really work... &amp; it does!!! I could definatley tell a difference...&amp; so could hubby. Even thought this is more of a &amp;#34;sample size,&amp;#34; A little goes a long ways! I&#x27;ve had for two months now and still have almost a full bottle.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and used a liberal amount due to having 3 children naturally. Only seemed to tighten at the opening and left a odor afterwards</li>
            <li> Going to try china shrink cream next. And Like a Virgin does not work 24 hours like it says. Unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> How small this was for the price is crazy! Haven&#x27;t used it. Its smaller than the size of a chapstick. Thats crazy for how much this cost!!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this crap it does not work, if you do buy it you w ill be asking for a refune, dont wast your time and dont wast your good money!!!</li>
            <li> When I didn&#x27;t tell my partner I used it I could definitely tell a difference in what he felt while he was inside and he was enjoying it a lot... But the 2nd time I used it and he had on a condom it wasn&#x27;t the same results as the first time... So I recommend this if u have only one partner that you don&#x27;t use protection, so this way y&#x27;all can both feel this product really work!</li>
            <li> I have birthed two children. It definitely made me feel tighter. All you need is a pea size amount and you&#x27;re good! You should definitely wait for about an hour to get the full effect.  I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Tiny tube , half air half cream...insane</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical about whether this would work or not. applied it about 45 before intercourse just to see if it would work less than 24 hours sooner, not much of a difference, the following day i noticed a bit of a difference just feeling myself in the shower, I was almost scared it was too right after having had 4 kids lol last night we had sex and it was amazing for both, like a virgin which was a shock considering I have had 4 kids in 5 years.</li>
            <li> It makes a difference. I&#x27;m pretty tight, but it seriously makes me feel almost like a virgin again. It&#x27;s nice to mix things up.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I really didn&#x27;t think this product would work. I was shocked by the size! So small! I tried it and wow! My partner also felt a difference. It is usually complicated for me to climax during intercourse. I climax more just by the clitoris. This was the first time I had a orgasm during intercourse. It was amazing and I beyond satisfied. Definitely recommend to give it a try and buy from your local consultant. Not online because they might have old products and it might not work as well. You can go on Pure Romance website to find a consultant!</li>
            <li> Amazing. He was extremely impressed and so was I. We will be coming back for more.</li>
            <li> Used as directed several times with no results.</li>
            <li> Works really good! two thumbs up. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so much money for such a small bottle. But that&#x27;s what you get with pure romance. Their products are really worth it though!</li>
            <li> Caused irritation. Tried a few times before my review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never needed this product to begin with, me and my just recently married husband just wanted to try it for fun. Use only if you really need!!!! it closed me up for hours, could get nothing inside. Ruined our night. The only reason I gave the product 5 stars is because it really does work and do what its suppose to, if you need it. If you need this product, I can definitely tell you, it works!!! Make sure to use lots of lube if u do use!!!!!</li>
            <li> Worthless. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Great item... fast shipping</li>
            <li> For those that say it didn&#x27;t work, perhaps they applied it wrong. Or maybe it had something to do with storage. Everyone that I know who has used it feel the same as I do.  I didn&#x27;t tell my husband that I used it and he commented on it afterward exclaiming that he enjoyed what he felt.  I didn&#x27;t physically feel it tighten but it did.  I enjoyed it too.  You only use a very small amt.  It does last 24 hours.  Even though tube is small, it&#x27;s worth it.  It will last .</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the price for size of bottle</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! After 2 kids things are never the same but this stuff helps a lot. I&#x27;ll reorder soon.</li>
            <li> All in all, a good product, although the suggested method of application is useless.  You will have to try it and come it with your own way.  I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from a friend who is a actual pure romance consultant for 15 dollars. So I recomment finding your local salesperson if you can for a price reduction! I think this product was worth the money. It does make you tighter. I see a lot of people complaining about the size of the bottle. It is small but you need such a tiny amount it will last a long time. If you put too much inside you&#x27;ll close up! So stick to the pea size instructions. I like it!</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH THE MONEY. I WOULDNT BUY FROM THEM, THE TUBE IS ENTIRELY TO SMALL.</li>
            <li> i tired it and i did what the directions said to do and it didnt work at but thanks anyway</li>
            <li> Prefer a bigger size but other than that I recommend it !</li>
