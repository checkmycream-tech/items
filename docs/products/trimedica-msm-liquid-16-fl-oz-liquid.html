    <ol>
            <li>AWESOME MSM!!!!</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Also use their lotion, works great as well, although kinda pricey for the amount.</li>
            <li>I also use the lotion but this is great if you don&#x27;t want anything to get on your clothes.</li>
            <li>Great additive to body lotions.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>MSM is truely amazing!</li>
            <li>Trimedica MSM Liquid is wonderful for rubbing into aching muscles and soothes inflammation significantly for me.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I purchased this MSM in order to make my own hair concoction.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell great (not bad though)</li>
            <li>This is the best MSM product by far.</li>
            <li>Like mixing my own better.</li>
            <li>This brand of MSN is by far the BEST brand on the market.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this online.</li>
            <li>I think the liquid may work as well  or better than the powder</li>
            <li>Better than a pill and can put it in lotion, shampoo, etc.</li>
            <li>However, i&#x27;m continuing to take the MSM which I know has many health benefits, including muscles, joints, hair and complexion.  </li>
            <li>and I can see thousands more translucent hairs all over my legs, arms, fingers, hair line</li>
            <li>just ordered two more bottles.  </li>
            <li>I find the liquid MSM much better to take than</li>
            <li>best part of the tablets is only in the cost.  </li>
            <li>This is much better than the powdered MSM for me.</li>
            <li>I Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product and the quality.  </li>
            <li>This helps with my sore muscles and I add it to many of my home made products.</li>
            <li>Have recommended it to many people that have used it with much success!!</li>
            <li>also like the purity better with the liquid over the tablets, however the pure MSM powder is also a good</li>
            <li>The emu oil easily crosses the dermal layer (your skin) and the theory was that it would take the MSM into the affected area.</li>
            <li>My nails are strong.  </li>
            <li>Tastes horrid but works fine.</li>
            <li>I instantly saw great results on the first day of using this brand.</li>
            <li>I love this product - I really prefer the liquid to the pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mainly purchased it for my hair, so I&#x27;m waiting for it to work :-)</li>
            <li>I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting anything to happen but kept checking daily.  </li>
            <li>I do need to point out that I felt a mild headache the first week.  </li>
            <li>Some grew pretty quickly and the normal pigment color filled in.  </li>
            <li>so I know exactly what I&#x27;m getting.</li>
            <li>so I stick to the pure liquid form of MSM.</li>
            <li>the large horse tablets</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I use it topically even though it is available in creams etc.</li>
            <li>I do notice the skin is much softer and pliable.  </li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However ...I was just about to order some more, when I saw \\&quot;benzyl alcohol\\&quot; listed as \\&quot;other ingredients\\&quot;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s refreshing to use a product/supplement that returns such obvious results.</li>
            <li>This came really quickly, and I am already starting to use it.</li>
            <li>It has helped me with my acne, my energy level is really high.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for certain that applying to the legs is doing anything in addition to taking the capsules, as far as hair growth goes.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more in the near future.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without it..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to spill and therefore waste.</li>
            <li>I both drink it and spray it topically on my body (after spritzing first with DMSO) and it makes my skin SO soft.</li>
            <li>This last year it really stepped up and went away in bunches.  </li>
            <li>Visually looks so much healthier.  </li>
            <li>prefer this MSM liquid, although my dog doesn&#x27;t care for it too much, but still getting a spoonful of liquid down my dogs mouth is not difficult to do at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only complaint is that the top is just a plain screw on/off cap whereas a lid with a small opening would work much better as the liquid comes out very fast</li>
            <li>kind of SLOPPY, lay it to one side and get to it later after my break attitude,&lt;br /&gt;Is just NOT acceptable.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t find the taste of this liquid as bitter as I thought it would be, it is still bitter, but I&#x27;m used to it now, and it&#x27;s not all that bad.&lt;br /&gt;In comparison, the MSM powder mixed in water is in my opinion 10x more bitter than this liquid is.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m taking this for various muscle pains and after two weeks haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in the muscle pain, but i think the pains are due to nerve impingement and supplements may not help this.  </li>

            <li> and I, I add a small amount of this MSM liquid to 100% pure saline solution (shop around for 100%) produced for contact lenses.</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t what I received , the name is different as far as the manufacturer, not sure if it works the same</li>
            <li> I have tried several others and they seem to have a bitter taste to them.</li>

            <li> It was convenient having it as a liquid, but have since gone to dry form and mix it myself</li>
            <li> Pain in my knees decreased by 95% the first day.  </li>
            <li> , my internal system has transformed I&#x27;m very regular, I lost 10 lbs in about two weeks(i&#x27;m a small girl, wasn&#x27;t trying to lose weight), for me it&#x27;s also a bit of an appetite suppressant, so i have to remind myself to eat sometimes, but my energy has soared!</li>
            <li> In the past I have tried the MSM powder, which I recall had a bitter taste when mixed with juice.  </li>
            <li> I am allergic to the other products that are usually combined with MSM (such as glucosamine)...</li>
            <li> Had a messed up ankle (decreased flexibility) after an injury, started to get down because I thought that was it, I would have to live like that from now on (almost a year after injury).</li>

            <li> My feet are less tingly</li>
            <li> and my knees go through the day with much less pain.</li>

            <li> have even found relief from rubbing a small amount onto my forehead and temples to relieve head-ache and sinus</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I will purchase again because of price.  </li>
            <li> Within a week found small translucent hairs sprouting just below my knee cap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of the difference, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I have used this product at least 3 years.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I buy this again and again and see results</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Had a messed up ankle (decreased flexibility) after an injury, started to get down because I thought that was it, I would have to live like that from now on (almost a year after injury). MSM in three days did what I thought was impossible.</li>
            <li> Got it on time and am using it to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  No mixing or pills to swallow. I can feel the benefits of this product with taking only one teaspoon daily.</li>
            <li> I got my product on time and it was just what I was looking for. its doing just what it promised to do, I can already see results</li>
            <li> My husband has used this for several years and believes it helps with his joint issues.  He has had a frozen shoulder and it helped with the pain.  He takes the recommended dose for his needs.</li>
            <li> I both drink it and spray it topically on my body (after spritzing first with DMSO) and it makes my skin SO soft. Love it. Also use their lotion, works great as well, although kinda pricey for the amount.</li>
            <li> This is the best MSM product by far. I used to get it from a health food store and then we moved. I have tried several others and they seem to have a bitter taste to them. So glad I found this online. I use the liquid one.</li>
            <li> My feet are less tingly and my knees go through the day with much less pain. A podiatrist recommended using the MSM liquid along with the emu oil.  The emu oil easily crosses the dermal layer (your skin) and the theory was that it would take the MSM into the affected area. It really works.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, its GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;As for this order, I am still waiting!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it on Nov 4th, as of today, Nov 15th, it still is NOT here.&lt;br /&gt;All the other items which I ordered at the same time, arrived in 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;This kind of SLOPPY, lay it to one side and get to it later after my break attitude,&lt;br /&gt;Is just NOT acceptable.</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t what I received , the name is different as far as the manufacturer, not sure if it works the same</li>
            <li> Trimedica MSM Liquid is wonderful for rubbing into aching muscles and soothes inflammation significantly for me. I also use the lotion but this is great if you don&#x27;t want anything to get on your clothes. You can also mix the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have even found relief from rubbing a small amount onto my forehead and temples to relieve head-ache and sinus pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell great (not bad though) but you can add a drop of organic lavender or tea-tree essential oil which also helps reduce pain and inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the top is just a plain screw on/off cap whereas a lid with a small opening would work much better as the liquid comes out very fast and it&#x27;s easy to spill and therefore waste.</li>
            <li> I think the liquid may work as well  or better than the powder</li>
            <li> I use it to help me treat migraines.  It works.  I use it topically even though it is available in creams etc.</li>
            <li> My husband has been taking this product for a long time.. He loves it!</li>
            <li> I like this product &amp;#34;BUT&amp;#34; I have noticed a big increase in price over the last 1.5 years.  It has gone from $12.39 to $20.00.  I&#x27;m not sure if I will purchase again because of price.  I&#x27;m waiting to hear back from TriMedica International,  their reason for price increase.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that Timedica no longer produces the MSM Liquid and I found this out through research because I thought I was sent the wrong item. Next time - inform the consumer beforehand!</li>
            <li> Tastes horrid but works fine. Better than a pill and can put it in lotion, shampoo, etc.</li>
            <li> I purchased this MSM in order to make my own hair concoction. once i received it i decided to take it orally as directed, and it immediately got rid of inflammation i didn&#x27;t know had, this stuff cleaned me out, from the inside out, my internal system has transformed I&#x27;m very regular, I lost 10 lbs in about two weeks(i&#x27;m a small girl, wasn&#x27;t trying to lose weight), for me it&#x27;s also a bit of an appetite suppressant, so i have to remind myself to eat sometimes, but my energy has soared!</li>
            <li> In the past I have tried the MSM powder, which I recall had a bitter taste when mixed with juice.  I could not taste the liquid MSM when mixed with orange juice.  I&#x27;m taking this for various muscle pains and after two weeks haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in the muscle pain, but i think the pains are due to nerve impingement and supplements may not help this.  However, i&#x27;m continuing to take the MSM which I know has many health benefits, including muscles, joints, hair and complexion.  i recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product at least 3 years.  I always get a reaction from the tablet form of MSM.  Severe pains in the intestines, gas etc.  I found that the liquid does not give this reaction. I am allergic to the other products that are usually combined with MSM (such as glucosamine)... so I stick to the pure liquid form of MSM.</li>
            <li> I love this product - I really prefer the liquid to the pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But has anyone else noticed that there are two different 16 oz size options for this product, and that one of them is $12.55 and the other is $20.60? Is there any difference between the two?</li>
            <li> I had come across some information that indicated MSM might help restore hair lost on legs.  I am a male in my 40&#x27;s who has systematically been losing hair for 15+ years.  This last year it really stepped up and went away in bunches.  I ordered msm lotion but received the liquid msm in error.  I decided to keep it and apply it to my legs.  Along with taking MSM capsules internally.  I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting anything to happen but kept checking daily.  Within a week found small translucent hairs sprouting just below my knee cap.  Some grew pretty quickly and the normal pigment color filled in.  It&#x27;s been close to a month now and I can see thousands more translucent hairs all over my legs, arms, fingers, hair line etc...I can&#x27;t say for certain that applying to the legs is doing anything in addition to taking the capsules, as far as hair growth goes.  I do notice the skin is much softer and pliable.  Visually looks so much healthier.  I also applied the liquid MSM to a slow healing cut on the bridge of my nose.  The rapid healing was undeniable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s refreshing to use a product/supplement that returns such obvious results. I also believe it&#x27;s helped me lose a few pounds.  Lessened the definition of wrinkles around my eyes.  Softened the hair all over my body from head to toe.  I do need to point out that I felt a mild headache the first week.  I believe my body adapted as I don&#x27;t feel it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered two more bottles.  I am switching from the capsules to taking the liquid internally.  I&#x27;ll keep applying it to my legs as well.  With time I&#x27;m hopeful I can get the majority of the hair back on my legs and also head off premature hair loss on my scalp.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I find the liquid MSM much better to take than the large horse tablets I&#x27;ve been forcing down for way too long.&lt;br /&gt;The best part of the tablets is only in the cost.  However, even though the liquid is way more expensive than the tablets, I will be purchasing the liquid from now on.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the purity better with the liquid over the tablets, however the pure MSM powder is also a good option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find the taste of this liquid as bitter as I thought it would be, it is still bitter, but I&#x27;m used to it now, and it&#x27;s not all that bad.&lt;br /&gt;In comparison, the MSM powder mixed in water is in my opinion 10x more bitter than this liquid is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this MSM liquid, although my dog doesn&#x27;t care for it too much, but still getting a spoonful of liquid down my dogs mouth is not difficult to do at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this MSM liquid to make eye drops for my dog and I, I add a small amount of this MSM liquid to 100% pure saline solution (shop around for 100%) produced for contact lenses.</li>
            <li> It was convenient having it as a liquid, but have since gone to dry form and mix it myself so I know exactly what I&#x27;m getting.</li>
            <li> This is much better than the powdered MSM for me. It works very well. I&#x27;m not sure of the difference, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t bad tasting stuff, and it served my purpose.  I&#x27;d rather \\&quot;drink\\&quot; MSM than take the capsules.&lt;br /&gt;However ...I was just about to order some more, when I saw \\&quot;benzyl alcohol\\&quot; listed as \\&quot;other ingredients\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;So! This is NOT \\&quot;pure\\&quot; MSM.&lt;br /&gt;The liquid form contains deionized water AND benzyl alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;Benzyl alcohol is a neurotoxin -- whatever THAT is.&lt;br /&gt;Thus, it loses 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be taking this in liquid form anymore.</li>
            <li> MSM is truely amazing! It has helped me with my acne, my energy level is really high. My nails are strong.  I Love this stuff. I will always and forever use it!!!</li>
            <li> Great additive to body lotions.&lt;br /&gt;Will order again.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without it.. It does work! Have recommended it to many people that have used it with much success!!</li>
            <li> This came really quickly, and I am already starting to use it. I mainly purchased it for my hair, so I&#x27;m waiting for it to work :-)</li>
            <li> Like mixing my own better.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the quality.  I will definitely be ordering more in the near future.  This helps with my sore muscles and I add it to many of my home made products.</li>
            <li> This brand of MSN is by far the BEST brand on the market. I instantly saw great results on the first day of using this brand. Pain in my knees decreased by 95% the first day.  I will conitue using this product. I have also started my wife and Father to using this product as well and they too, have had the same results. AWESOME MSM!!!!</li>
