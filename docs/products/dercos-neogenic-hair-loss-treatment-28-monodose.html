    <ol>
            <li>Great product!!!</li>
            <li>Currently, I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my results</li>
            <li>Awesome stuff, works great!</li>
            <li>Seller is awesome as well.</li>
            <li>Very happy with it.</li>
            <li>but a lot of people tell me that it&#x27;s a great solution for hair&#x27;s problems.</li>
            <li>This combination is the best I have had so far.</li>
            <li>I read many articles with some information about it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a bit more than two months now.</li>
            <li>I just love the results.</li>
            <li>that my experience with it, I will through it away for sure.</li>
            <li>its results are nowhere as strong as I had with once a day application of Minox 5%.</li>
            <li>He decide combine this two products, because his scalps begin to be faster and Dercos is a lotion, and he has been using Nioxin&#x27;s treatment for a 10 years now, and works good but not enough.  </li>
            <li>but I guess it has not been the full 28 days</li>
            <li>I also use this as a vehicle for other powdered hair loss products and it works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a miracle, really works!!</li>
            <li>better than minoxidil in my case some people minoxidil is not as effective as others worth a try if minoxidil had little effect on u</li>
            <li>and I see a lot of new hair, to be honest my scalp is visible only in one spot now, that is huge improvement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, probably not an effective product in the long run</li>
            <li>After two months, this area has filled in almost completely!</li>
            <li>So one box will be more than enough for the 3 months treatment.</li>
            <li>I finished the first three boxes as prescribed and it really worked!</li>
            <li>It first stopped hair loss</li>
            <li>It says to stop after the first three months</li>
            <li>After completing the second application, the new hair gains were not as apparent but it did ultimately maintain my hairline which is excellent.</li>
            <li>My hair loss is in the early stages and am glad I acted early on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I really like the smell and consistency of this product.</li>
            <li>Moreover, my hair looks so much healthier than before.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The applicator works nicely, gradually dosing out the liquid and after 2 months I have only used 12 monodoses with daily application.</li>
            <li>but I was very surprised to see results within the first two weeks.</li>
            <li>as 35 year old woman with visible scalp I was willing to try.</li>
            <li>I started seeing results after one month more or less.</li>
            <li>but I can deal with the dispenser as long as my hair is growing back :)</li>
            <li>new hair started to grow...</li>
            <li>Hair started to thicken, and started to see the beginning of new hairs.</li>
            <li>For me, new hairs are sprouting up alongside hairs that were already there.</li>
            <li>Currently, I have not had any other side effects and feel like I might be responding to this product better than others.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve done one month so far, was applying everything as it&#x27;s written .</li>
            <li>No results at all so far..</li>
            <li>I have used minoxidil before and it completely destroyed my hairline.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the only things that has worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>It may just be a suggestion since this product is so new and would not be surprised to see the dosage change later on.</li>
            <li>No changes for the better or worse</li>
            <li>After returning to this product after three months for a second round I shed some of the hairs that grew in but many did actually stay after stopping for a few months.</li>
            <li>He use around half the dose (2.5ml) as 5 ml is too much.</li>
            <li>At around half the dose (2.5ml) as 5 ml is too much.</li>
            <li>I found it ultimately creates an illusion causing hair shedding to synchronize while not really growing new hairs.</li>

            <li> This is also an innovation that you can&#x27;t find in other similar product.</li>

            <li> I am using it for 24 days now, only half of the dosage a day</li>
            <li> About a month ago, I started the second round of three months.</li>
            <li> I have found that holding the applicator button then tapping the monodose helps the liquid get back inside the monodose faster, otherwise a few drops may leak out but not much.</li>

            <li> Wish the price would come down, as it stands it&#x27;s over overpriced.</li>
            <li> I have found that applying after the scalp is slightly damp helps.</li>

            <li> Fully dissolves the powders added to it within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> For me each monodose lasts around 4-5 days because the area i use is fairly small.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything under the sun to recover some of the hair i have lost over the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> But on the other hand Minox gave me dark circles, horrible skin, and my heart would thump fast some time I applied it&lt;</li>
            <li> Just start it using hope will work  for me, the delivery is slow, need to find a close provider.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it just didn&#x27;t work. I might got a fake product though! Because all the concept and the statistics seems like it should work.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done one month so far, was applying everything as it&#x27;s written . No results at all so far.. Unfortunately</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over 1 month. I use it on my temples/receding hairline. Hairs are starting to grow where before there was no hair! So looking forward for the next 2 months of treatment. I have used minoxidil before and it completely destroyed my hairline. And also had side effects. Dercos Neogenic is easier to use and no side effects. For me each monodose lasts around 4-5 days because the area i use is fairly small. So one box will be more than enough for the 3 months treatment.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to notice hair growth. Will update on that later. But I really like the smell and consistency of this product. It&#x27;s not goopy and dries non greasy so you can put it on before styling your hair if you wish. I also use this as a vehicle for other powdered hair loss products and it works great. Fully dissolves the powders added to it within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I finished the first three boxes as prescribed and it really worked! It first stopped hair loss and then I saw visible results. After about two months, though, I started to lose hair again. About a month ago, I started the second round of three months. I am a bit disappointed this time. It did reduce hair loss significantly but failed to stop. I also do not see any improvements so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, probably not an effective product in the long run</li>
            <li> I knew this product in a TRND project. I read many articles with some information about it. I haven&#x27;t try it yet but a lot of people tell me that it&#x27;s a great solution for hair&#x27;s problems. This is also an innovation that you can&#x27;t find in other similar product. I think that everyone should try it as soon as possible!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work.it makes itch.</li>
            <li> Simply, Did not work for me</li>
            <li> I have not seen any difference in the amount of hair growth. The product is not worth the price</li>
            <li> My husband has been applying it for around 6 months now. He use combined whit Nioxin&#x27;s System 4 shampoo and scalp treatment, and works. He decide combine this two products, because his scalps begin to be faster and Dercos is a lotion, and he has been using Nioxin&#x27;s treatment for a 10 years now, and works good but not enough.  He use around half the dose (2.5ml) as 5 ml is too much. It works, you will see vellus hair pop up, shedding to pick up and then reduce and remain at reduced levels, and some of the existing vellus hair will become darker which is good.&lt;br /&gt;This product works, but is very expensive.</li>
            <li> No changes for the better or worse but I guess it has not been the full 28 days yet so we will see what happens</li>
            <li> Just start it using hope will work  for me, the delivery is slow, need to find a close provider.</li>
            <li> I could notice some difference in my hair after a month ....new hair started to grow...I am still using this product and will let you know how it progress...</li>
            <li> Great product!!! Definitely working on thinning hair! With just 2 weeks I can notice the difference in my hair! Love it</li>
            <li> I read that it takes 3 months for results to appear or just begin working but I was very surprised to see results within the first two weeks. Hair started to thicken, and started to see the beginning of new hairs. I had a slowly receding hairline on both sides then a quarter-sized bald area on one side was starting to turn my widows peak area into an island (I noticed people starting to looking at it, and could feel the wind!). After two months, this area has filled in almost completely! The temples, are restoring as well but slower since it is a larger area. For me, new hairs are sprouting up alongside hairs that were already there. Currently, I have not had any other side effects and feel like I might be responding to this product better than others. I do have an underactive thyroid and my hair loss may in part be due to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator works nicely, gradually dosing out the liquid and after 2 months I have only used 12 monodoses with daily application. I have found that holding the applicator button then tapping the monodose helps the liquid get back inside the monodose faster, otherwise a few drops may leak out but not much. I have found that applying after the scalp is slightly damp helps. I applied it at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will follow up later. It says to stop after the first three months and I will see how well my hair responds once treatment has stopped. It may just be a suggestion since this product is so new and would not be surprised to see the dosage change later on. Currently, I am very happy with the results. My hair loss is in the early stages and am glad I acted early on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second edit. After returning to this product after three months for a second round I shed some of the hairs that grew in but many did actually stay after stopping for a few months. The hair remained thick. After completing the second application, the new hair gains were not as apparent but it did ultimately maintain my hairline which is excellent. I tried minoxidil in the meantime but did not like it or the side effects (dryness, lots and lots of shedding) and the way it works. I found it ultimately creates an illusion causing hair shedding to synchronize while not really growing new hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a bit more than two months now. I cannot guarantee that my hair has regrown but it looks like it has. Moreover, my hair looks so much healthier than before. I just love the results. I recommend having some patience. I started seeing results after one month more or less.</li>
            <li> Coused my hair to fall like never before but maybe it will work on other I don&#x27;t know but that my experience with it, I will through it away for sure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a miracle, really works!!</li>
            <li> better than minoxidil in my case some people minoxidil is not as effective as others worth a try if minoxidil had little effect on u I&#x27;m very happy with my results</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, works great! Seller is awesome as well. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. It&#x27;s one of the only things that has worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything under the sun to recover some of the hair i have lost over the past 10 years. I am a diffuse thinner with MPB. The product does work and i am using it with Minoxidil and Nizoral shampoo. This combination is the best I have had so far. Use Nizoral 1% daily for the shedding. It halted mine. This will help with the regrowth. I hope the progress continues</li>
            <li> Wish the price would come down, as it stands it&#x27;s over overpriced. Does seem to thicken hair</li>
            <li> I have been applying it for around 2-3 weeks now. At around half the dose (2.5ml) as 5 ml is too much. Plus allows for product to be used for longer. It works, you will see vellus hair pop up, shedding to pick up and then reduce and remain at reduced levels, and some of the existing vellus hair will become darker which is good.&lt;br /&gt;But its results are nowhere as strong as I had with once a day application of Minox 5%. But on the other hand Minox gave me dark circles, horrible skin, and my heart would thump fast some time I applied it&lt;br /&gt;So Neogenic, finally a product that works, but is very expensive..</li>
            <li> It works really well. Very expensive though</li>
            <li> 4 years ago I was pregnant and after pregnancy I lost a lot of hair from the top of my head, it looked miserable, I could see skin and I was getting sunburn of my scalp in the summer. I tried everything, I&#x27;ve seen dermatologist but hair was the same. When I found this product I thought I am going to loose 130$ but as 35 year old woman with visible scalp I was willing to try. I am using it for 24 days now, only half of the dosage a day and I see a lot of new hair, to be honest my scalp is visible only in one spot now, that is huge improvement. I am very happy with this product, the only negative is the dispenser, it is horrible, I don&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t put all this product in one big bottle with pipette or spray it would be easier and cheaper but I can deal with the dispenser as long as my hair is growing back :)</li>
            <li> Product seems to be working, it does take time and of course it varies on the person.</li>
            <li> This product DOES works. Very happy with it.</li>
