            <li>and it is good as new.</li>
            <li>brushes are super soft, great quality and the application:</li>
            <li>I own MAC brushes, real techniques and Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>These brushes perfectly fit that description and are now must haves in my every day makeup routine.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a great set of brushes, look no further!</li>
            <li>Packaging was very cute and nice..brushes themselves proved to be great quality, precise application worth and overall worth every sweet penny.</li>
            <li>I recently ordered more SIgma brushes to complement this set, but this was PERFECT for starting into Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>worth every penny!</li>
            <li>These brushes are absolutely amazing, they are soft and they pick up the makeup so well!</li>
            <li>As soon as I got these brushes in the mail I used them right away!</li>
            <li>The other brushes are great.</li>
            <li>These are great brushes, but I wish they would have come with a container like my other brushes that I purchased.  </li>
            <li>All I had to do was add super glue</li>
            <li>My favorite brushes in this set are the F88 and P88 which are angled flat top brushes.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super soft and I love the way it compliments my make up application.</li>
            <li>It is very smooth and leaves a soft feeling and glows on you skin.</li>
            <li>My holy grail if brushes they are well worth the money.</li>
            <li>it is so soft and blends so much better than MAC.  </li>
            <li>I ordered ALL available SIGMA brushes and LOVE THEM ALL THE SAME!</li>
            <li>Worth the Hype in my opinion...</li>
            <li>fast shipping and the quality on sigma products is amazing.. soft to the touch..</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;ve waited this long to get these brushes</li>
            <li>When using any brush, there wasn&#x27;t any little hairs anywhere on my face-love love love Sigma brushes...</li>
            <li>Being as \\&quot;makeup-obsessed\\&quot; as I am, when I look for new sets of makeup brushes I look for brushes that are high-quality, stylish and super soft.</li>
            <li>Super soft, they blend super well with powder, creamy or liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>I love this set and find myself using them regularly to apply for foundation, concealer, contouring.</li>
            <li>I normally use my fingers to apply foundation but these brushes make it look even and more professional.</li>
            <li>The head fell off within the first 2 weeks of having them.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the tapered brushes and the flat angled brushes.</li>
            <li>However, they are soft, clean well, and put the makeup on with ease.</li>
            <li>The quality is very high.</li>
            <li>After using this set of Sigma brushes, I discovered that it was really overrated!&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>The handles are heavy, but not too heavy, a good weight, they feel very luxurious just touching them, they feel well constructed.</li>
            <li>Very well constructed, no shedding.</li>
            <li>it saves so much product..</li>
            <li>The great part is that for each big brush, there is a small brush to match it.</li>
            <li>Amazing quality brushes that have lasted a little over a year now and are easy to wash without destroying them.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>so we all know they already take a long time to clean just with the liquid and cream...</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft and I love that each of their slight differences completely change the way the brush applies, so you don&#x27;t feel like you bought 5 of the exact some brush.</li>
            <li>Being a man, I don&#x27;t know a whole lot about makeup, but these seem to do the trick as far as gift-giving goes.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and and dense and hold their shape very well.</li>
            <li>The only reason that I don&#x27;t LOVE these brushes is because they are so hard to clean...</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t washed it because its still new and and i am scared that it might shed a lot if i wash it</li>
            <li>Boa Noite,&lt;br /&gt;Gostaria de saber o que aconteceu com meu pedido,recebi apenas 5 itens do kit: Sigma New Synthetic Kit Essencial 10</li>
            <li>but because these brushes are so dense, they are even harder to clean.</li>
            <li>The synthetic fibers don&#x27;t soak up your product and blend creams or powders seamlessly!</li>
            <li>I loved it, but I thing just the 5 bigger ones would be enough, the smaller ones are not much usable on the day by day make ups.</li>
            <li>The small round angled brush is great for applying eye shadow primer.</li>
            <li>brushes...prefer real technique brushed...</li>
            <li>the brushes were surprisingly soft.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this set of brushes to any professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li>Let me say that if you&#x27;re into highlighting, contouring, and getting a flawless base...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them as a present.</li>
            <li>They are smooth and firm enough to buff liquid or cream products onto face, neck, ect.</li>
            <li>The small brushes get into all of the areas where the big brushes can&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>but I must say these are a MUST for all the ladies who loves to have their makeup look professional on a daily basis!</li>
            <li>i spent so much money on this</li>
            <li>I now use all of the brushes except for the small and big flat top kabuki and the big round angled kabuki.</li>

            <li> Being a man, I don&#x27;t know a whole lot about makeup, but these seem to do the trick as far as gift-giving goes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and and dense and hold their shape very well.</li>
            <li> The only reason that I don&#x27;t LOVE these brushes is because they are so hard to clean...</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t washed it because its still new and and i am scared that it might shed a lot if i wash it</li>
            <li> Boa Noite,&lt;br /&gt;Gostaria de saber o que aconteceu com meu pedido,recebi apenas 5 itens do kit: Sigma New Synthetic Kit Essencial 10</li>
            <li> but because these brushes are so dense, they are even harder to clean.</li>
            <li> The synthetic fibers don&#x27;t soak up your product and blend creams or powders seamlessly!</li>
            <li> I loved it, but I thing just the 5 bigger ones would be enough, the smaller ones are not much usable on the day by day make ups.</li>
            <li> The small round angled brush is great for applying eye shadow primer.</li>
            <li> brushes...prefer real technique brushed...</li>
            <li> the brushes were surprisingly soft.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this set of brushes to any professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li> Let me say that if you&#x27;re into highlighting, contouring, and getting a flawless base...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them as a present.</li>
            <li> They are smooth and firm enough to buff liquid or cream products onto face, neck, ect.</li>
            <li> The small brushes get into all of the areas where the big brushes can&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> but I must say these are a MUST for all the ladies who loves to have their makeup look professional on a daily basis!</li>
            <li> i spent so much money on this</li>
            <li> I now use all of the brushes except for the small and big flat top kabuki and the big round angled kabuki.</li>
            <li> I use this set on a daily basis and highly recommend these brushes for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Sygma is very good product just is expensive!!!</li>
            <li> I find myself reaching for every single one of these brushes all the time.</li>
            <li> but I feel like the handle is a bit loose on it</li>
            <li> It feels like all the product goes onto my face and doesn&#x27;t get wasted somewhere deep inside the brush.</li>
            <li> know these brushes are expensive but they are definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> These brushes also cut down on how long it takes to blend and contour.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy any other brushes that aren&#x27;t sigma.</li>
            <li> my mac make up liquid foundation and other cream products.</li>
            <li> i might try the other brushes from sigma but not the set.</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t leave reviews</li>
            <li> i dont wanna put it to waste,..</li>
            <li> I have owned MAC brushes in the past and these are identical for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> I talked the customer service and they were rude.</li>
            <li> these brushes are too expensive</li>
            <li> it makes me feel unhappy leaving this comments</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with these.</li>
            <li> I swear the brushes i received were fake, worst quality..</li>
            <li> Perfeitos para passar base, corretivo e primer.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> excellent, just one thing it takes along time to dry</li>
            <li> You can not beat these brushes for the price. The quality is very high. If you love MAC brushes then you will love these. I only use Sigma brushes now!</li>
            <li> Great brushes. I haven&#x27;t used all of them but I have been using F80 a lot but I feel like the handle is a bit loose on it, I&#x27;m just hoping it won&#x27;t fall apart. The other brushes are great.</li>
            <li> My holy grail if brushes they are well worth the money. Plus the do not shed! What more could I ask for?!?</li>
            <li> Too dense for me....okay brushes...prefer real technique brushed...these brushes are too expensive</li>
            <li> Love these makeup brushes! Good quality and nice packaging. Been using them for several weeks now and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Bought these brushes for my wife, and she adores them. I highly recommend them as a present. Being a man, I don&#x27;t know a whole lot about makeup, but these seem to do the trick as far as gift-giving goes.</li>
            <li> I loved it, but I thing just the 5 bigger ones would be enough, the smaller ones are not much usable on the day by day make ups. Sigma is the best in class in brushes .</li>
            <li> Packaging was very cute and nice..brushes themselves proved to be great quality, precise application worth and overall worth every sweet penny. I&#x27;ve had them for about six months now and there has been NO brush hair fallout! When using any brush, there wasn&#x27;t any little hairs anywhere on my face-love love love Sigma brushes...I would compare Sigma to MAC brushes in my opinion...good luck!</li>
            <li> After using this set of Sigma brushes, I discovered that it was really overrated!&lt;br /&gt;Plus, The &amp;#34;made in china&amp;#34; that was written on these brushes made me unsure about the quality of mine, because my sister bought a set that was made in the USA!</li>
            <li> it is so soft and blends so much better than MAC.  I have been a huge fan and collector of MAC brushes but now that I have used these SIGMA&#x27;s i just LOVE these SO MUCH MORE - I loved it so much I ordered ALL available SIGMA brushes and LOVE THEM ALL THE SAME! Don&#x27;t hesitate, BUY them you will absolutely LOVE these brushes... I typically don&#x27;t leave reviews but I must say these are a MUST for all the ladies who loves to have their makeup look professional on a daily basis!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, they are so soft, and amazing and apply my makeup flawlessly, even my boyfriend looks at me and says &amp;#34; Wow your face looks SO smooth!&amp;#34; wooohooo!  I&#x27;ve had them for two weeks-ish and I&#x27;ve washed them twice, no fall out, no bleeding, nothing. They are wonderful. Worth the Hype in my opinion... The handles are heavy, but not too heavy, a good weight, they feel very luxurious just touching them, they feel well constructed. I just wished I could say the same about the Mr.Bunny collection...</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. Very well constructed, no shedding. The small brushes get into all of the areas where the big brushes can&#x27;t fit. I now blend my foundation to perfection! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!</li>
            <li> Let me say that if you&#x27;re into highlighting, contouring, and getting a flawless base...you NEED these brushes. I am in awe at how soft they are and how beautifully they buff and blend. Honestly, I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;ve waited this long to get these brushes and I can&#x27;t stop singing their praises. i love love love these brushes. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy any other brushes that aren&#x27;t sigma. Just incredible.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very good quality and very soft on your skin.  I have owned MAC brushes in the past and these are identical for a fraction of the cost.  I highly reccomend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> My holy grail of brushes. I love this set and find myself using them regularly to apply for foundation, concealer, contouring. You name it! Amazing quality brushes that have lasted a little over a year now and are easy to wash without destroying them.</li>
            <li> I tried them last night and they are wonderful. Super soft, they blend super well with powder, creamy or liquid foundation. This is a must have if you love makeup. I normally use my fingers to apply foundation but these brushes make it look even and more professional.</li>
            <li> Sygma is very good product just is expensive!!!</li>
            <li> sigma brunches are the best!!!</li>
            <li> These are the softest brushes I&#x27;ve ever used. I have read almost nothing but good reviews about these brushes and they are all true. I love how dense these are. It feels like all the product goes onto my face and doesn&#x27;t get wasted somewhere deep inside the brush. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with these.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes, but I wish they would have come with a container like my other brushes that I purchased.  However, they are soft, clean well, and put the makeup on with ease.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and I love that each of their slight differences completely change the way the brush applies, so you don&#x27;t feel like you bought 5 of the exact some brush. They also don&#x27;t shed, so you&#x27;re not left with pieces on you face! love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!! To me it&#x27;s worth the price as it&#x27;s an investment where I would use it for years and will still be in good shape. I would def recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this kit. I think the kabuki and precision brushes are sigma&#x27;s best products.  The brushes are soft and and dense and hold their shape very well. I find myself reaching for every single one of these brushes all the time. I especially like the precision brushes. My favorite brushes in this set are the F88 and P88 which are angled flat top brushes.  They have a nice teardrop surface which is great for the areas around your nose and eyes.  The only one I don&#x27;t use as often is the tempered face brush. I would definitely buy these again.&lt;br /&gt;I know these brushes are expensive but they are definitely worth the money. If you cannot afford these I would look into royal care cosmetic brushes. I don&#x27;t own their kabuki or precision set, but they seem like a good alternative.</li>
            <li> the brushes were surprisingly soft. I now use all of the brushes except for the small and big flat top kabuki and the big round angled kabuki. The great part is that for each big brush, there is a small brush to match it. I really enjoyed the tapered brushes and the flat angled brushes. The small round angled brush is great for applying eye shadow primer. Only downfall is that my big tapered brush came apart at the wood/metal. All I had to do was add super glue and it is good as new.</li>
            <li> they are amazing , it works with contouring , highlighting and foundation</li>
            <li> I swear the brushes i received were fake, worst quality.. The head fell off within the first 2 weeks of having them. I talked the customer service and they were rude. I paid a lot for the bushes and received unauthentic brushes with stickers covering where they were made.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great quality! I own MAC brushes, real techniques and Sigma brushes. I&#x27;ve bought so much more Sigma brushes than the rest! Great quality !</li>
            <li> These brushes are absolutely amazing, they are soft and they pick up the makeup so well! They look and feel amazing, they also portray the makeup on your skin so well. These brushes are better than sephora brushes!</li>
            <li> Sigma Beauty, thanks and congratulations great job sending me this kit of brushes, that my wife wanted for her birthday.</li>
            <li> Being as \\&quot;makeup-obsessed\\&quot; as I am, when I look for new sets of makeup brushes I look for brushes that are high-quality, stylish and super soft. These brushes perfectly fit that description and are now must haves in my every day makeup routine. Each of the brushes work magic as they flawlessly blend out concealer, foundation and other liquid/cream products. The Sigma Synthetic 10 piece kabuki brush set is now a necessity in my makeup collection.</li>
            <li> I use the brushes to apply my moisturizer, liquid foundation, primer, and concealer.&lt;br /&gt;I have used sephora, bdellium and Mac Make Up brushes. These Brushes are a lot better than sephora brushes, mac is still the best for me.. sigma compare to bdellium make up brushes, i like bdellium brushes better because they don&#x27;t shed while putting products on your face. I like how the sigma brushes works with  my mac make up liquid foundation and other cream products. It is very smooth and leaves a soft feeling and glows on you skin. it is good on applying face powder and blush too. it saves so much product.. I bought these brushes because i always see my sister using sigma brushes and she told me it is the best! never shed and it gives her very good satisfaction. i like the brushes but after my 3rd time using it starts shedding not a lot but some strands were left  on my face.. i haven&#x27;t washed it because its still new and and i am scared that it might shed a lot if i wash it i spent so much money on this i dont wanna put it to waste,.. i saw all amazing reviews about this products  that&#x27;s why i purchased it. it makes me feel unhappy leaving this comments but i just have to share my experience.. maybe it is just me having this experience..  or it is not just my luck but i don&#x27;t regret trying it! :)  i might try the other brushes from sigma but not the set.</li>
            <li> Ooooooooooooo love it....</li>
            <li> I purchased the Sigmax Essencial Kit about a month ago and I am absolutely in love with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are super soft, great quality and the application: flawless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The F80 is THE perfect brush for foundation application. The P86 is perfect for concealer application. I use this set on a daily basis and highly recommend these brushes for everyday use. If you&#x27;re looking for a great set of brushes, look no further!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brushes, and these are hands down the best I&#x27;ve ever used! You can&#x27;t beat this package price, either! I&#x27;ve washed them many times and they&#x27;ve never shed a hair! SUPER soft and application is always flawless. The synthetic fibers don&#x27;t soak up your product and blend creams or powders seamlessly! I recently ordered more SIgma brushes to complement this set, but this was PERFECT for starting into Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> Beautiful brusches.&lt;br /&gt;I like to use with liquid foundation and concealer&lt;br /&gt;I recommend for who to want a beautiful and perfect skin using foundation and concealer.</li>
            <li> The only reason that I don&#x27;t LOVE these brushes is because they are so hard to clean... I use either a liquid or cream on almost all of these brushes so we all know they already take a long time to clean just with the liquid and cream... but because these brushes are so dense, they are even harder to clean.</li>
            <li> i think i really really love this kit。 and it feels really good on my face！it is a very amazing experience！</li>
            <li> I like it it is very  nice product soft and easy to use, thanks sigma keep the good work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards</li>
            <li> Simplesmente maravilhosos esses pincéis da Sigma. Perfeitos para passar base, corretivo e primer. A compra foi entregue dentro do prazo.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and the quality on sigma products is amazing.. soft to the touch.. they feel great on the face! they are much better (yet cheaper) than sephora brand face tools</li>
            <li> I bought this set about 5 months ago, and I absolutely love it. I saw one of my favorite bloggers using it and I had to get it..worth every penny! Great quality and very affordable!</li>
            <li> Boa Noite,&lt;br /&gt;Gostaria de saber o que aconteceu com meu pedido,recebi apenas 5 itens do kit: Sigma New Synthetic Kit Essencial 10 Brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aguardo um retorno.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obrigado.</li>
            <li> This product does not work well with mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes.  I bought them after seeing artists rave about them on YouTube, I use these all of the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read so many good things about these brushes that I had to try them. My hubby bought these for me for Christmas and it was just what I wanted! They&#x27;re super soft and I love the way it compliments my make up application. I have Sephora and Mac brushes and these are by far the best ones I&#x27;ve had. Definitely would recommend these brushes to any one using make-up!</li>
            <li> As soon as I got these brushes in the mail I used them right away! They are great brushes to use for flawless foundation &amp; concealer application. They are smooth and firm enough to buff liquid or cream products onto face, neck, ect. These brushes also cut down on how long it takes to blend and contour. I would recommend this set of brushes to any professional makeup artist.</li>
