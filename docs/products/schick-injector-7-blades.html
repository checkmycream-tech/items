            <li>I gave the blades four stars because the quality is not what it used to be but still happy I can still get them.</li>

            <li>Blades are good and they got to my place in good time.</li>
            <li>and they do not seem as good fas</li>
            <li>/&gt;It made him happy that we were able to get another box.</li>
            <li>good price and nice to know where i can buy them because i cannot find them in my area</li>
            <li>my husband loved having this for his favorite razor .</li>
            <li>Love this product, can&#x27;t seem to find it in the stores any longer and very glad that Amazon.com supplies it.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best pruduct I&#x27;ve used for more than twenty yearsa</li>
            <li>Received the blades in good order and quickly.  </li>
            <li>I thought for sure these would provide a closer shave.</li>
            <li>very prompt delivery and happy with product</li>
            <li>I&#x60;m just glad I can buy the blades at an affordable price through Amazon.</li>
            <li>My husband love the quality and has been using these razor for over 30 yrs glad they are still purchasable online</li>
            <li>what a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, OK, these blades are made in China.  </li>
            <li>Love these blades for my 1930s injector.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the product and will order again when I need another pack.</li>
            <li>Not only is my Schick injector mom gave me very special to me, it just does the best job shaving IMO.</li>
            <li>To be able to buy the \\&quot;Schick\\&quot; brand is especiallly great because I am assured of high quality.  </li>
            <li>He was glad to find some more of them.&lt;br /&gt;They are no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li>As most of us know, injector blades have not been available in stores for many years.  </li>
            <li>it beats all the cheap ones that are on the market that they say are better.</li>
            <li>JUST WHAT I EXPECTED, PERFECT</li>
            <li>I have a 30 year old Oliver Mat and Tangle splitter which is a great tool.....except that it required an Injector type razor blade, which I couldn&#x27;t find anymore.</li>
            <li>Over the decades, this exact style blade, with the two holes in the side for alignment with the razor housing, has remained popular.</li>
            <li>not as smooth as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>I love my PAL stainless steel shaver purchased in the 60&#x27;s and I am glad that the internet allows me to buy replacement blades for it.  </li>
            <li>And I thought the blades were like the original ones, I have, (made in the USA).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I plan to order a larger set next time - if you&#x27;re looking for good places at a good price, these fit the bill.</li>
            <li>I love it and don&#x27;t know why anyone would need these modern multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li>and it holds true to form.</li>
            <li>and I am very well satisfied with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>I have always loved the Schick injector blades and have been using the same Schick injector razor for 62 years!!!.  </li>
            <li>the new disposable razors are much more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Have worked great for over a half century</li>
            <li>Five CONSISTENT Stars!</li>
            <li>If you can find an adjustable Schick Razor, you will get the most comfortable shave possible.</li>
            <li>Exactly as I wanted and have used in the last 40 or more years!</li>
            <li>My husband has used them for many years and has found no other blades that satisfy him.  </li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t compare to the older schick blades at all!!</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>At the start, you need patience, sobriety, and care;-)  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>These are getting harder to find, so I am kind of saving them up.</li>
            <li>is the exact model this was created for.  </li>
            <li>Ok, these blades are not the quality they were when my dear mom bought me this razor back in 1972 (yes I still use it after all these years!).</li>
            <li>Just finished my first shave with one of these blades;</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE MY INJECTOR RAZOR</li>
            <li>I have quite a few packs, and that&#x27;s good, because apparently you can&#x27;t get them anymore.</li>
            <li>good value -these are very hard to find in stores</li>
            <li>I DIDN&#x27;T ORDER THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE OF THE COST AND THE HIGH RATE FOR SENDING.</li>
            <li>My first and only razor that was my dad&#x27;s and that I used while it was still his</li>
            <li>For the money, they are a great value, and last a long time, or at least have so far.</li>
            <li>The main advantage on these is price, particularly if you buy the larger quantities Amazon offers.  </li>
            <li>These are very sharp 7-count Schick Injector single-edge blades, packaged in the familiar metal container with the extended prong that allows injection of blades into a Schick safety shaving razor with handle (not included).</li>
            <li>single edge blades still do as good if not better job than multiple edge blades and are a cheaper price also!</li>
            <li>I was upset when I was not able to find them in the various stores anymore and was pleased to find them on line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to find an injector style razor for them, the old shick type, so I can go back to shaving with them.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprise to find out that these were not as sharp as the personna brand.</li>
            <li>If only I could buy a new single edge injector razor.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> For my skills, they are so far, beyond my skills  for an average shave.</li>
            <li> I recommend buying these blades as long as you have the proper razor, Schick Injector.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strange, shaving with something so sharp you barely touch your skin, and EVERYTHING IS GONE.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using these for as long as I can get them.</li>
            <li> I use to use schick blades then could not find them for a long time</li>
            <li> The blades I purchased recently have been sharp and retain their edge</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using these in a Hess barber style single edge razor.  </li>
            <li> Single edge razors do not plug up like multi-edge razors do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting the shaving the flat parts of my face down.  </li>
            <li> Other items I have purchased from Amazon in the past have also worked out to my complete satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and well packed, item was as expected.</li>
            <li> SHARP BLADES.  </li>
            <li> TOO sharp.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but this is the one I grew up with</li>
            <li> Five SHARP Stars!</li>
            <li> so I tried other razors but was never satisfied with any of them.</li>
            <li> but, so far I have used two of them and I am not impressed!!!</li>
            <li> I went through recent periods where all I could find were blades too expensive to buy</li>
            <li> These are impossible to find in local stores.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if maybe I got a couple of bad razor blades in the container</li>
            <li> Too bad you can&#x27;t find them in stores anymore.</li>

            <li> Exactly as I wanted and have used in the last 40 or more years!</li>
            <li> i have the same razor that my father gave me since i started shaving. it happens to be a schick injector and i will never change until they stop making them.</li>
            <li> pruduct does&#x27;nt seem to be on the market anymore. This is by far the best pruduct I&#x27;ve used for more than twenty yearsa it beats all the cheap ones that are on the market that they say are better.</li>

            <li> I was really surprise to find out that these were not as sharp as the personna brand. I thought for sure these would provide a closer shave. I don&#x27;t know if maybe I got a couple of bad razor blades in the container but, so far I have used two of them and I am not impressed!!! These don&#x27;t compare to the older schick blades at all!!</li>
            <li> I greatly appreciate the vendor for supplying this type of blade.  My father was going through the last stages of Lung cancer and finding this blades for him, meant a lot to me. Thanks!</li>
            <li> My husband has used them for many years and has found no other blades that satisfy him.  He was glad to find some more of them.&lt;br /&gt;They are no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li> I DIDN&#x27;T ORDER THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE OF THE COST AND THE HIGH RATE FOR SENDING. I REALLY LIKE MY INJECTOR RAZOR BUT THEY QUIT MAKING THE BLADES.</li>
            <li> not as smooth as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> What I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Love this product, can&#x27;t seem to find it in the stores any longer and very glad that Amazon.com supplies it.</li>
            <li> My step father had this razor which was his favorite.&lt;br /&gt;This was the only place we could find the blades.&lt;br /&gt;It made him happy that we were able to get another box.</li>
            <li> I have quite a few packs, and that&#x27;s good, because apparently you can&#x27;t get them anymore.</li>
            <li> These are getting harder to find, so I am kind of saving them up. Besides, using the &#x27;safety&#x27; razor shreds my skin- the new disposable razors are much more comfortable to use. They just lack style.</li>
            <li> good price and nice to know where i can buy them because i cannot find them in my area</li>
            <li> Five CONSISTENT Stars! These are very sharp 7-count Schick Injector single-edge blades, packaged in the familiar metal container with the extended prong that allows injection of blades into a Schick safety shaving razor with handle (not included). Over the decades, this exact style blade, with the two holes in the side for alignment with the razor housing, has remained popular. Some of us also use the blades for edging and trimming by hand. Each of these blades has delivered at least 10 comfortable uses for me for decades and they are very sharp and durable. The container has a compartment for used blades on the bottom. My Highest Recommendation. Five SHARP Stars! (1 injector container with 7 blades.)</li>
            <li> better than those expensive fusion at a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> single edge blades still do as good if not better job than multiple edge blades and are a cheaper price also!</li>
            <li> I recently picked up an injector razor, having used a DE for years.  I picked up a pack of blades at the local CVS drugstore, and ordered these online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the two, both provide good shaves, though I marginally prefer the Schick.  The main advantage on these is price, particularly if you buy the larger quantities Amazon offers.  I plan to order a larger set next time - if you&#x27;re looking for good places at a good price, these fit the bill.</li>
            <li> very prompt delivery and happy with product</li>
            <li> My first and only razor that was my dad&#x27;s and that I used while it was still his and he gave me when he started using the multi-blade ones is the exact model this was created for.  I love it and don&#x27;t know why anyone would need these modern multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li> Have worked great for over a half century</li>

            <li> Ok, these blades are not the quality they were when my dear mom bought me this razor back in 1972 (yes I still use it after all these years!). I&#x60;m just glad I can buy the blades at an affordable price through Amazon. I went through recent periods where all I could find were blades too expensive to buy so I tried other razors but was never satisfied with any of them. Not only is my Schick injector mom gave me very special to me, it just does the best job shaving IMO. I gave the blades four stars because the quality is not what it used to be but still happy I can still get them.</li>
            <li> Fits Schick injectable razors. These are impossible to find in local stores.  If you can find an adjustable Schick Razor, you will get the most comfortable shave possible.</li>
            <li> Single edge razors do not plug up like multi-edge razors do. If only I could buy a new single edge injector razor.</li>
            <li> For my dinosaur who still uses a Schick razor.....thanks!</li>
            <li> I like the auto schedule and savings.  My husband love the quality and has been using these razor for over 30 yrs glad they are still purchasable online</li>
            <li> As most of us know, injector blades have not been available in stores for many years.  I love my PAL stainless steel shaver purchased in the 60&#x27;s and I am glad that the internet allows me to buy replacement blades for it.  To be able to buy the \\&quot;Schick\\&quot; brand is especiallly great because I am assured of high quality.  The blades I purchased recently have been sharp and retain their edge and I am very well satisfied with the purchase.  Other items I have purchased from Amazon in the past have also worked out to my complete satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I looked for them everywhere and could not find them. Some store had never even heard of injector razers. Found these at Amazon and they work just great!</li>
            <li> Blades are good and they got to my place in good time. Very reasonably priced. I recommend buying these blades as long as you have the proper razor, Schick Injector. I had one of the best shaves with this razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using these for as long as I can get them. What can I say. I like these blades.</li>
            <li> (the part you hold in your hand) because they don&#x27;t seem to be getting made anymore.  I&#x27;d actually given up and bought some multi-blade plastic disposables before finding this product.  Just finished my first shave with one of these blades; what a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, OK, these blades are made in China.  If some manufacturers wanted to they could probably make them here.  Along with the blade holders, which is the part you hold in your hand.  Until someone in the U.S. or elsewhere does so I&#x27;ll continue to buy and use these.</li>
            <li> my husband loved having this for his favorite razor . we had looked in every store possible without any luck .</li>
            <li> good value -these are very hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> they were delived on time . These are the best razars they give me the close shave I need all the time just love.</li>
            <li> I use to use schick blades then could not find them for a long time then i found these and they do not seem as good fas i remember them.</li>
            <li> Love these blades for my 1930s injector. Too bad you can&#x27;t find them in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> It was what I have been looking for in stores for months.  They came in a resonable amount of time</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and well packed, item was as expected. I&#x27;m satisfied with the product and will order again when I need another pack.</li>
            <li> And I thought the blades were like the original ones, I have, (made in the USA).&lt;br /&gt;Should have known they came from CHINA!!!</li>
            <li> Just Awesome! Great Company!</li>
            <li> I have a 30 year old Oliver Mat and Tangle splitter which is a great tool.....except that it required an Injector type razor blade, which I couldn&#x27;t find anymore. It occured to me to look on Amazon.com Of course it was availalbe here! Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Received the blades in good order and quickly.  I have always loved the Schick injector blades and have been using the same Schick injector razor for 62 years!!!.  I was upset when I was not able to find them in the various stores anymore and was pleased to find them on line.</li>
