            <li>Smells good, however, I don&#x27;t wear much.</li>
            <li>It litteraly smells like a bouquett of flowers, and to my nose, a strong smell of roses.      </li>
            <li>Elegant, but bold.  </li>
            <li>i absolute love it !</li>
            <li>Fortunately amazon refunded me even though this item could not be returned.</li>

            <li>Light, rich fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Very sophisticated and classy smell.</li>
            <li>it is so unique</li>
            <li>I received it in the time given, it was delivered in its original box with no damage.  </li>
            <li>Christmas was the first time i got it in 2005 haven&#x27;t changed since, love it.</li>
            <li>granny&amp;#34; smell to it, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like cotton candy like some new trendy stuff.</li>
            <li>I WILL be back for more and that amazing price</li>
            <li>The scent is nothing special.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>but for special occasion go for \\&quot;Lady Million\\&quot; or Calvin Klein \\&quot;Euphoria\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>She liked it so much, she still uses it and asks for it even after finding out I originally discovered this perfume while married to my ex-wife.</li>
            <li>It took me forever to figure out how to get the corkscrew into this thing, but once I did, it aired out nicely.</li>
            <li>They kept telling me, it smells so fresh, heavenly, so smooth</li>
            <li>Its sweet and sensual...</li>
            <li>I Guess it is true when they say you get what you pay for-----specially for perfumes.</li>
            <li>Ordered for my aunt, it arrived extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>Clean, smelled just right.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much will order again!</li>
            <li>I shop here constantly and am pleased always!</li>
            <li>Thanks again, Amazon!!</li>
            <li>Same perfume as you but at the store but cheaper price love it!</li>
            <li>It has fresh, sweet, somewhat floral top notes with a slightly light musky heart mixed with hints of juniper and lily.</li>
            <li>Its my favorite perfume by far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not TOO anything, but seems to be just right..</li>
            <li>this is a great smelling perfume spicy and sweet and long lasting</li>
            <li>This is a real Versace fragance, despite the fact that there are other publications out there where the people remarks that is a fake, well this is not the case, the package was great, the product cross all the USA and arrives to Colombia without any problems, my girlfriend is happy to have this product by a fair price.</li>
            <li>She likes it very much.</li>
            <li>Omg love this, its the only one i wear !!!!!</li>
            <li>I jus received my product when I first sprayed it on me</li>
            <li>Always my first choice when deciding which fragrance to use.  </li>
            <li>It still smells the same but ten times more potent.  </li>
            <li>But I ordered it and it is not at all what my first bottle smells like.</li>
            <li>The first one was given to me by a neighbor because she didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>The first time I applied it and went to work, EVERYONE passing by, was stopping me to ask what perfume I had on.</li>
            <li>Unfortunatley I believe it has been discontinued and the mall Parfum store that sells soley parfum and amazon are the only places I have been able to find it.</li>
            <li>and I loved it a few years ago.</li>
            <li>Totally enjoying my perfume after searching for so long.</li>
            <li>It is and will be a timeless classic!</li>
            <li>I ordered a sml bottle based on reviews but was very dissapointed once I tried it.   </li>
            <li>Even the tiniest bit is too much.</li>
            <li>All ready rated this product</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li>Versace woman has been my signature perfume for years, and I was thrilled to find it at such a low price!  </li>

            <li> Light, rich fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Very sophisticated and classy smell.</li>
            <li> it is so unique</li>
            <li> I received it in the time given, it was delivered in its original box with no damage.  </li>
            <li> Christmas was the first time i got it in 2005 haven&#x27;t changed since, love it.</li>
            <li> granny&amp;#34; smell to it, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like cotton candy like some new trendy stuff.</li>
            <li> I WILL be back for more and that amazing price</li>
            <li> The scent is nothing special.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li> but for special occasion go for \\&quot;Lady Million\\&quot; or Calvin Klein \\&quot;Euphoria\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> She liked it so much, she still uses it and asks for it even after finding out I originally discovered this perfume while married to my ex-wife.</li>
            <li> It took me forever to figure out how to get the corkscrew into this thing, but once I did, it aired out nicely.</li>
            <li> They kept telling me, it smells so fresh, heavenly, so smooth</li>
            <li> Its sweet and sensual...</li>
            <li> I Guess it is true when they say you get what you pay for-----specially for perfumes.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my aunt, it arrived extremely quickly.</li>
            <li> Clean, smelled just right.</li>

            <li> It has fresh, sweet, somewhat floral top notes with a slightly light musky heart mixed with hints of juniper and lily.</li>
            <li> Its my favorite perfume by far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not TOO anything, but seems to be just right..</li>
            <li> this is a great smelling perfume spicy and sweet and long lasting</li>
            <li> This is a real Versace fragance, despite the fact that there are other publications out there where the people remarks that is a fake, well this is not the case, the package was great, the product cross all the USA and arrives to Colombia without any problems, my girlfriend is happy to have this product by a fair price.</li>

            <li> Always my first choice when deciding which fragrance to use.  </li>
            <li> It still smells the same but ten times more potent.  </li>
            <li> But I ordered it and it is not at all what my first bottle smells like.</li>
            <li> The first one was given to me by a neighbor because she didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> The first time I applied it and went to work, EVERYONE passing by, was stopping me to ask what perfume I had on.</li>
            <li> Unfortunatley I believe it has been discontinued and the mall Parfum store that sells soley parfum and amazon are the only places I have been able to find it.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this was a knock off or if Versace has changed their product, but it certainly was not what I&#x27;ve been wearing for years. :(</li>

            <li> I am 25 yr.s Old and Adore this perfume... There&#x27;s nothing like it!! No matter how old you are this perfume seem&#x27;s to turn head and have everyone asking \\&quot; Oh wow, What perfume is that\\&quot;??</li>
            <li> Yummy &amp; snugly. I don&#x27;t have a great nose for smells, but this reminds me of berries &amp; fabric softener &amp; is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> excellent service and product</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this perfume.  I ordered a sml bottle based on reviews but was very dissapointed once I tried it.   It litteraly smells like a bouquett of flowers, and to my nose, a strong smell of roses.      The scent is nothing special.  It does not last long on my skin.  A couple hours at most and for the price it should last all day long.      My bf said it was \\&quot;okay\\&quot;.  He preferes my other perfums and really likes my body lotions and sprays .  Good, it&#x27;s cheaper!      Dont waste your money on this perfume.  It&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li> The perfume was a gift and it arrived on time, as well as smelled GOOD!!</li>
            <li> I have this perfume, smells amazing. Very sophisticated and classy smell. I have the small body lotion and small shower gel. They all smell so good. My husband says I smell good. That means, it&#x27;s a like!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume and it makes every time she puts some on a sex-filled night of imagination..</li>
            <li> Versace Women is one of my favorites by Versace. It is and will be a timeless classic! Love it!!!! Also, the look of the bottle is beautiful!!! : D</li>
            <li> Seems like fake to me</li>
            <li> I have been told that it smells absolutely LOVELY, and I must agree. It&#x27;s not TOO anything, but seems to be just right.. Will purchase again !!</li>
            <li> I jus received my product when I first sprayed it on me it was kind of strong but once it settled in it was a very delicate scent. I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy!! Got it quickly and at a great price. I will be buying this product from here from now on. Everthing I expected!!</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume. Perfect price! Thank you♡</li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing.  It lasts all day and there&#x27;s just no other perfumes out there that come close to it.  Elegant, but bold.  It&#x27;s pretty close to perfect.</li>
            <li> Loved it!  Gave it as a gift and it was a hit. Would definitely purchase again.  Amazon shopping is my \\&quot;favorite\\&quot; shopping!</li>
            <li> This smelled like the bottle was old- don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance for both daytime and evening. Light, rich fragrance.  Always my first choice when deciding which fragrance to use.  Can not make a mistake when choosing Versace Woman. I can not begin to tell you how many times I have had a man or woman ask me what fragrance I have on, because they love it. Always nice to know.</li>
            <li> I sent it as a gift to my friend she just loved it and it reached her within 2 days of my order (this was through free shipping) .... I was very impressed with the service!</li>
            <li> I really love this one and not too strong so I can wear it to work</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift. It showed on time. It was brand new in the box. What else to say? Awesome</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have found this here on Amazon. I shop here constantly and am pleased always! Thanks again, Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Always get compliments on the smell</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great and i recommend it to all lady&#x27;s. I purchased this product about a year ago and i still have it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this was a knock off or if Versace has changed their product, but it certainly was not what I&#x27;ve been wearing for years. :(</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;ve changed the formula.  I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for years and have gotten TONS of compliments.  It still smells the same but ten times more potent.  Even the tiniest bit is too much. I will no longer be buying this perfume.</li>
            <li> Nice clean feminine scent.</li>
            <li> I bought two for me and my mom and we both absolutely love it! I will continue buying this for myself and others</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and was thrilled to find it online. With so many brands on the market not all stores carry it!!</li>
            <li> Ordered for my aunt, it arrived extremely quickly. She did not say anything so it must be good.</li>
            <li> Totally enjoying my perfume after searching for so long. Enjoying the compliments as well. Will definitely reorder when I run out.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  But I ordered it and it is not at all what my first bottle smells like. Fortunately amazon refunded me even though this item could not be returned.</li>
            <li> Just as I remembered it! Strong and lovely. Quick shipping, arrived in perfect condition. Awesome price! Would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.I had high hopes for this perfume. its not original...Be careful when you purchase perfume online---could be a fake one!</li>
            <li> one of my favorites and good price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for over 10 years. I found it on a fluke and haven&#x27;t fell out of love with it since.  It&#x27;s a wonderful scent, the two bottles I ordered (my back ups!) were both perfect. Clean, smelled just right. I put them in my fridge for overstock beauty products.  If you love this scent, you&#x27;ll love buying it here.</li>
            <li> Same perfume as you but at the store but cheaper price love it!</li>
            <li> love it love it love it.. i have found my smell.... finishing my third bottle..... ready to reorder</li>

            <li> Awesome even way better I got it at a spectacular price under $40!  Its not the cheap wear off or alcohol perfume either!  Thank you very much will order again!</li>
            <li> All ready rated this product</li>
            <li> I was looking for something sweet yet not too strong and this is a perfect fit. Lasts very long. People ask me about it all the time and take down the details to order it. The packing was a little too big but the perfume arrived without damage.. Would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> The wife&#x27;s favorite thing in the house...besides me, (maybe.) She has been wearing this since we met over 15 minutes ago. Seriously, how can you rate a product as subjective as perfume. I could say it has &amp;#34;floral aroma&#x27;s, with hints of spice and cinnamon&amp;#34;, but that could also be used to describe my favorite wine. I will say this is much harder to open than my favorite wine. It took me forever to figure out how to get the corkscrew into this thing, but once I did, it aired out nicely. Nice tingly sensation on the tongue when I kissed the wife on the neck where she had just sprayed. No, my wife did not spray...she sprayed this perfume on her neck, and I, probably trying to get out of the doghouse for something I did, started kissing her neck. That&#x27;s when I noticed the tingly tongue sensation. So,l if you want a tingly tongue, or need to get out of the doghouse and back into the penthouse, try this.</li>
            <li> this is a great smelling perfume spicy and sweet and long lasting</li>
            <li> There is a story behind this perfume for me. The first one was given to me by a neighbor because she didn&#x27;t like it. I sprayed it on my skin and smelled it and didn&#x27;t like it at all. So, I thought, I will use it when I go to work. The first time I applied it and went to work, EVERYONE passing by, was stopping me to ask what perfume I had on. When I say, everyone, it was everyone, at work, shops, walking by in the street!!! I was stunt!!! I couldn&#x27;t smell it on myself as nice but to others, it was heavenly. They kept telling me, it smells so fresh, heavenly, so smooth, they just couldn&#x27;t describe the beauty of that smell. My sister bought it, and no one said anything to her!!! She was very frustrated. We were walking together but were at different spots, and people would stop me and ask but not her. So, I guess, its the skin type or magic!!! I love it now.</li>
            <li> My mother brought this Parfum back to me from her trip to France and I loved it a few years ago. Unfortunatley I believe it has been discontinued and the mall Parfum store that sells soley parfum and amazon are the only places I have been able to find it. Anyway, I just recieved it three days ago and have recieved compliments on it everyday thus far without fail!</li>
            <li> great product, great delivery .</li>
            <li> I love it; not too strong; the smell stay for a while.</li>
            <li> The smelling is wonderful, I will buy again next time</li>
            <li> This is a very nice scent and it is not  to strong and over powering but just rightto wear anytime</li>
            <li> GOOD AROMA&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRICE AND QUALITY&lt;br /&gt;LIKE THE PERFUME&lt;br /&gt;Recommend them to ALL&lt;br /&gt;THANKS&lt;br /&gt;FULL my expectations&lt;br /&gt;EXCELLENT AROMA. &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This item was my favorite i absolute love it ! the smell is great, i got many complements wearing this perfume thank you!</li>
            <li> Great musky, frangipani scent!  The fragrance lasts, and I get compliments all the time.  Other fragrances that I like to wear (but that do not smell the same) are Guerlain&#x27;s Mitsouko and Lancome&#x27;s Miracle Forever.</li>
            <li> I had this perfume before and have been looking for it for a long time. The department stores no longer carries it.  When I found it on Amazon I was very excited! This is a very nice perfume.  It has a soft scent and smells great! I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Love this &amp; do not know what I will do if I ever can&#x27;t get it. I am complimented on this every day.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiancé and she loves it. She says she gets compliments on it all the time. Its my favorite perfume by far. Doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;old granny&amp;#34; smell to it, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like cotton candy like some new trendy stuff. She liked it so much, she still uses it and asks for it even after finding out I originally discovered this perfume while married to my ex-wife. And trust me...that is saying a lot.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this perfume! Its sweet and sensual...it is so unique and I receive compliments on it every time I wear it! I hope Versace never stops making this perfume, it&#x27;s my signature scent!</li>
            <li> this perfume is light and good for every day use. It&#x27;s my favorite scent and hard to find except online,</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter for Christmas, came very fast and in good condition. Smells just as stated in ad. She likes it very much.</li>
            <li> This is a real Versace fragance, despite the fact that there are other publications out there where the people remarks that is a fake, well this is not the case, the package was great, the product cross all the USA and arrives to Colombia without any problems, my girlfriend is happy to have this product by a fair price.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing!!!!! I have been wearing this fragrance for years!!!!! Love it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase of this perfume by Versace. I received it in the time given, it was delivered in its original box with no damage.  The smell is nice very light and I get complaints when I wear it.</li>
            <li> its a special gift for anyone you love!</li>
            <li> Este produto quando acabei comprando achei que seria extraordinariamente òtimo mas não foi bem isto, ele tem um cheiro num primeiro momente de perfume para pessoas velhas mas apos um tempo a fragrancia realmente aparece, e não o torna tão enjoativo</li>
            <li> I love the perfurme but I hear they stopped making it.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.  FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li> A hard find. Great fragrance for my lady!</li>
            <li> Excellent! Just as I expected.</li>
            <li> Not authentic I want my money back</li>
            <li> I have not used this yet but it was delivered as promised</li>
            <li> Bought this for my fiance and she LOVES IT!! As do i . It has fresh, sweet, somewhat floral top notes with a slightly light musky heart mixed with hints of juniper and lily.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great, not too over powering, I always get compliments on it. Christmas was the first time i got it in 2005 haven&#x27;t changed since, love it.</li>
            <li> It smells too floral kind of unsophisticated type. We expect better from Versace name but although this product is acceptable it is under no circumstances anything that a must have. For every day use it is OK but for special occasion go for \\&quot;Lady Million\\&quot; or Calvin Klein \\&quot;Euphoria\\&quot;. I Guess it is true when they say you get what you pay for-----specially for perfumes. Cheap price could be cheap watered down low quality. Go to reputable departmental store and smell the product before you buy---you might pay more but get the real product. Be careful when you purchase perfume online---could be a fake one!</li>
            <li> Great price delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Nice, strong scent that lasts.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering perfumes from online sellers is always risky so I always read reviews and check out the sellers first.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered mine through discount perfumes because they have a good track record.  No complaints here. Glad I was able to buy it on amazon for a cheaper price!</li>
            <li> Gifted it for christmas. Loved the price for the ounces. Mother in law super happy with gift. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Not my7 favorite.  Of course, perfumes give off a different fragrance on different individuals.</li>
            <li> Versace woman has been my signature perfume for years, and I was thrilled to find it at such a low price!  It arrived in a timely manner and was exactly the high quality product I expected.</li>
