            <li>So happy wife is a good life.</li>
            <li>but I love the joico much better!!!</li>
            <li>Quality of shampoo itself seems good, but it does nothing that I can tell to eliminate the brassiness of my color-treated &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li>Works good</li>
            <li>Good for brassy brunettes as well</li>
            <li>Needs to be used every day for a good look.</li>
            <li>The smell is good - a mix between cucumber and honey dew melon.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t use it very many times because I couldn&#x27;t tell a benefit</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>Will keep looking for another product that works better!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>Love it !</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the smell, but the conditioner smells good.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it lathered, smelled and rinsed.  </li>
            <li>Really nice silvery shine now.</li>
            <li>but it works pretty good!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my highlights, I was expecting better results.</li>
            <li>I get my hair dyed very light.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Made my hair look more muddy</li>
            <li>I am sure it does what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>she said the shimmer lights from Sally;s is a better product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the better Paul Mitchell products aside from the originals.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li>and I needed a better conditioner for my platinum</li>
            <li>I love the sheen and the way it leaves my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I love this product.</li>
            <li>the record, the bottle I received had a piece of shipping tape over the top, but no manufacturer&#x27;s seal.</li>
            <li>Nothing better for my hair.</li>
            <li>and there just is no place that sells it a better price that I know of, and having it delivered to my door for no shipping fees?</li>
            <li>Love this product though and will keep using it.</li>
            <li>I would suggest that sellerr suggest to buyer that product needed to be shaken and stirred to make sure it is combined.  </li>
            <li>I need to order more</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I think its a lot better then simmerlights (:</li>
            <li>I have long hair and you need to use a lot of it to get a nice foamy lather going, but otherwise it works great.</li>
            <li>I LOVED This shampoo, it smelled like watermelons, really brightened up my hair, it definitly takes out that brassy look, i used it about 1x a week and let it sit for about 3-4 minutes .it</li>
            <li>and it is the only shampoo I have found that keeps my hair healthy while keeping it bright.</li>
            <li>after one wash with this shampoo i ALREADY see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is great for platinum blonde or graying hair.  </li>
            <li>so i color it to keep it light.</li>
            <li>Great product if you want the platinum look not the brassy yellow.</li>
            <li>It works great and keeps the yellow out of my hair.</li>
            <li>I love it and as I cannot get this shampoo in local outlets I am delighted to find it at Amazon,</li>
            <li>Most people love my white hair, and I am learning to love it too.</li>
            <li>Also attaching an image of the original bottle of joico.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure at first.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair super dry and the smell isn&#x27;t really great</li>
            <li>Ive used this shampoo before I just couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere around here , it&#x27;s awesome brightens up dull blondes</li>
            <li>This shampoo keeps my grey hair light and bright in between shampooing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good enough explains it well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to keep the brassies away and blonde hair bright!</li>
            <li>Iv tried the cheap john Frieda brand which smelled amazing but does nothing compared to this, the only thing i don&#x27;t care for is the smell of this Paul mitchell one</li>
            <li>but I had to use more of it, more often and leave it on for longer to achieve what I needed for maintaining my platinum blonde.</li>
            <li>Great product..works very well to keep out that brassy yellow that some blondes get.</li>
            <li>producted arrived quickly as was a described.  </li>
            <li>Just incredibly brilliant and soft white hair.</li>
            <li>I used it once a week to keep my highlights fresh</li>
            <li>My favorite one so far is by AG Beauty</li>
            <li>better than the clear version.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have highlighted hair, and it tends to get fairly brassy between visits to the salon, so I like to use a toning shampoo or conditioner every other day.</li>
            <li>I called my hair dresser and right away she recommended this product.  </li>
            <li>and she was right.</li>
            <li>bought this at a salon inside of a major shopping store in a pinch because I was out of my favorite which is:&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast !</li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>i really couldnt tell that it was making a difference, but my friends said that after not seeing me for a couple of weeks that they could tell!</li>
            <li>it really cuts the gold out!</li>
            <li>This shampoo has the same intensity of color, but seems to be more conditioning to the hair.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it help with color it gets your hair very clean.  </li>
            <li>old standby is the original Joico Color Endure Shampoo.</li>
            <li>so if you purchase it i suggest purchasing a good deep conditioner as well (maybe forever blonde conditioner my Paul Mitchell)</li>
            <li>I guess what it comes down to the product does what it&#x27;s meant to (keeping cool tones in light hair), but I can&#x27;t say anything else positive about it really.</li>
            <li>and it really does seem to brighten up</li>
            <li>I go from light brown to all blonde</li>
            <li>Fast shipping..</li>
            <li>Had tried over brands and they really had no impact.</li>
            <li>If you want it to be effective at toning, you have to leave the shampoo in your hair for several minutes - and if I&#x27;m going to leave something in my hair for several minutes, I&#x27;d prefer that it was conditioner rather than shampoo.</li>
            <li>Other purple shampoos that I have tried  are better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of toning shampoos - Jhirmack and Clairol - and they tend to dry my hair out very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my fading blonde hair soft and shiny - I am 65 and am losing my color - eventually it will be light blonde/white</li>
            <li>The item shipped quickly and was similar to described.</li>
            <li>It actually does not tone my hair as well as Aveda&#x27;s Blue Malva conditioner, and I think Phyto&#x27;s Phytargent shampoo works better as well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This really will take the brass out of natural or chemically treated blond hair.</li>
            <li>my blonde and most importantly tone down the brassiness from my low lights.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the same conditioner with other shampoos and had better results, so I know it is this particular product.</li>
            <li>Once a week, if you shampoo everyday, will be enough to maintain nice, shiny, blond color.</li>
            <li>I noticed a much bigger difference with this product when I left it on for 20 minutes versus three minutes, but then my hair felt kind of dry</li>
            <li>i get a pretty blonde for about 2 weeks</li>
            <li>The only reason i ddidn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is because it is pretty drying</li>
            <li>and I think it keeps the white pure in color.</li>
            <li>Made my blonde so much brighter in just one wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not blonde but my wife is and she really likes it.</li>
            <li>Went into the salon very discouraged about the growing amount of yellow coming into my hair.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this product a try because from the reviews I read about it, I expected it to be better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to women (or men) who have light and dark grey hair to keep it brighter and shiny during styling.</li>
            <li>This product was used on my white/grey hair by my stylist and it took out 90% of the yellow in the first use and left my hair</li>
            <li>I really had to experiment with how long to leave it on my hair.  </li>
            <li>My light blonde hair holds color and does not turn red like it died with other shampoo.</li>
            <li>No other product comes close to delivering what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>Not sure if this is original?</li>
            <li>This shampoo brings out silvery highlights in my hair that no other shampoo does.</li>
            <li>It is ok but not good enough for me.</li>
            <li>I have used nearly the whole bottle of this product over the past six months.</li>
            <li>I have pale blonde hair and the first time I used it</li>
            <li>Pretty desperate, I used this shampoo together with the blonde conditioner and my color went from horrid to a light even blonde.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have any recommendations about purchasing from that seller good or bad.</li>

            <li> I decided to give this product a try because from the reviews I read about it, I expected it to be better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to women (or men) who have light and dark grey hair to keep it brighter and shiny during styling.</li>
            <li> This product was used on my white/grey hair by my stylist and it took out 90% of the yellow in the first use and left my hair</li>
            <li> I really had to experiment with how long to leave it on my hair.  </li>
            <li> My light blonde hair holds color and does not turn red like it died with other shampoo.</li>
            <li> No other product comes close to delivering what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is original?</li>
            <li> This shampoo brings out silvery highlights in my hair that no other shampoo does.</li>
            <li> It is ok but not good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I have used nearly the whole bottle of this product over the past six months.</li>
            <li> I have pale blonde hair and the first time I used it</li>
            <li> Pretty desperate, I used this shampoo together with the blonde conditioner and my color went from horrid to a light even blonde.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have any recommendations about purchasing from that seller good or bad.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does a decent job of keeping my heavily - highlighted hair from getting brassy.</li>
            <li> I found that the color shampoo I was using wasn&#x27;t keeping my hair blonde for as long as I thought it could</li>
            <li> It is very mild and has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> Would recommend a deep conditioner on dry hair like mine though!</li>
            <li> Usually as long as it takes me to wash my face (in the shower).  </li>
            <li> shampoo is in a grey container bottle, with a sticker around it....</li>
            <li> I have silver grey hair and my hair dresser suggested this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if Paul Mitchell products are usually sealed when new.</li>
            <li> , I think I left it on for too long (3 min), which seemed to slightly darken my hair temporarily.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t dry my hair out, which is a plus!</li>
            <li> I went from Dark Brown to Whitest, white and still had a little yellow at the tips.</li>
            <li> The bottle looked a little different from the picture, but I believe it is a newer type bottle.</li>
            <li> Had been using ShimmerLights shampoo for a year with no real appreciable results.</li>
            <li> This is the same product for alot less and it works wonders on my hair!</li>
            <li> Gave it a try when my other product was discontinued.</li>
            <li> The contents were just as the other products I have used.</li>
            <li> However, even when I use a heavy-duty conditioner with it, it leaves my hair feeling a little dry, stringy and lifeless.</li>
            <li> After using for a few weeks, no more yellow!</li>
            <li> Also, while I wouldn&#x27;t say it smells &amp;#34;bad,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s not exactly a very pretty scent, either.</li>
            <li> i have naturally blonde hair but its turning a dirty blonde</li>
            <li> You need to use it a few times before seeing results.</li>
            <li> the chlorinated swimming pool leaves behind on my white hair.</li>
            <li> I swim everyday and my hair is greenish from the chlorine.</li>
            <li> I can even mix it half and half with one of my every day shampoos and get the same effect, while stretching the product (since it&#x27;s kinda expensive).  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a product for everyday use though because it will leave your hair dull.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m not sure if this is the one she is referring to.</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair at home (yes I know - terrible idea) and my highlights turned green and my roots had a distinct copper color.</li>
            <li> This product, however, is much less expensive than these two products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a hairdresser, I would recommend it to anyone with blond hair who hates the brash, fake, brassy look.</li>
            <li> then it fades to a brassy yellow color that i hate.</li>
            <li> Seriously a savior in a bottle for us blondes !</li>
            <li> /&gt;It weighed my hair down so bad.</li>
            <li> Expensive, smelly, ineffective.</li>
            <li> link is something I randomly searched for</li>
            <li> Made it heavy and disgustingly oily..</li>
            <li> really bad ingredients.</li>
            <li> and I hate the brassyness.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was not the correct product as advertised -- they sent me a different paul mitchell shampoo. I have had a terrible time trying to return it. DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> Made my blonde so much brighter in just one wash. I swear but this stuff!</li>
            <li> I got sent the purple bottle, but I think it is the correct product based on readying the two. I use twice a week and it really does seem to brighten up my blonde and most importantly tone down the brassiness from my low lights. Will def. use this again. And it smells like you are at the salon.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and you need to use a lot of it to get a nice foamy lather going, but otherwise it works great. You need to use it a few times before seeing results.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for platinum blonde or graying hair.  It helps keep the yellowing at bay and brightens the color of hair.  I love this stuff and it is the only shampoo I have found that keeps my hair healthy while keeping it bright.</li>
            <li> Did the job of taking out the Orange, but did leave my hair straw like.  I really had to experiment with how long to leave it on my hair.  Usually as long as it takes me to wash my face (in the shower).  And only use it once a week.</li>
            <li> It makes my white hair shine. I need to get the conditioner now. Love it. Most people love my white hair, and I am learning to love it too.</li>
            <li> I get my hair dyed very light.  I go from light brown to all blonde and then even blonder highlights.  I found that the color shampoo I was using wasn&#x27;t keeping my hair blonde for as long as I thought it could and sometimes my hair looked brassy.  I called my hair dresser and right away she recommended this product.  It does keep my hair as blonde as possible.  I don&#x27;t have the problem with brassiness anymore.  It is purple.  Not only does it help with color it gets your hair very clean.  I don&#x27;t love the smell, but the conditioner smells good.</li>
            <li> 1. Irritated my scalp&lt;br /&gt;2. Made my hair look more muddy&lt;br /&gt;3.Dried out my hair&lt;br /&gt;4. No shine</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great for brightening my hair when it starts to look to yellowish! Iv tried the cheap john Frieda brand which smelled amazing but does nothing compared to this, the only thing i don&#x27;t care for is the smell of this Paul mitchell one but it works pretty good!</li>
            <li> Expensive, smelly, ineffective.</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my hair darker and grayer which I do not like.  I am sure it does what it is supposed to do but it is just not for me. I liked the way it lathered, smelled and rinsed.  I guess I need a different color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this shampoo before in salons and it was twice the amount. This is the same product for alot less and it works wonders on my hair! My blonde last alot longer.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo!! My hair look better with my highlights!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  I have blonde hair and I hate the brassyness.  This product gets rid of all that.  Since I color my hair, I use a quarter sized amount and mix it with the Paul Mitchell Strength shampoo.  This stuff lasts forever.  It&#x27;s also way cheaper here than in any salon.  If you are blonde and have been searching and haven&#x27;t found anything that works to keep it blonde and not brassy blonde, then you HAVE to give this a try.  You won&#x27;t be dissapointed!  I would recommend this to anyone with naturally white hair or colored hair.</li>
            <li> This product must not be ment for oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;It weighed my hair down so bad. Made it heavy and disgustingly oily..</li>
            <li> I just bought this shampoo tonight. i have naturally blonde hair but its turning a dirty blonde so i color it to keep it light. i get a pretty blonde for about 2 weeks then it fades to a brassy yellow color that i hate. after one wash with this shampoo i ALREADY see a huge difference. The only reason i ddidn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is because it is pretty drying so if you purchase it i suggest purchasing a good deep conditioner as well (maybe forever blonde conditioner my Paul Mitchell)</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. I love the way it makes my hair feel.I wish the conditioner would come with it.</li>
            <li> Great product if you want the platinum look not the brassy yellow. Smells amazing! You dont have to use it every day, couple times a week will work as well</li>
            <li> I have used nearly the whole bottle of this product over the past six months. I used it once a week to keep my highlights fresh but i still noticed they got brassy or yellow. My salon uses only paul mitchell products so when i told my hair dresser about my hair getting yellow she said the shimmer lights from Sally;s is a better product and she was right. Its also a lot cheaper. I would go with that instead of this. It is ok but not good enough for me.</li>
            <li> a bit on the drying side but very good for retaining color</li>
            <li> It is very mild and has a weird smell. Other purple shampoos that I have tried  are better. My favorite one so far is by AG Beauty</li>
            <li> Keeps my fading blonde hair soft and shiny - I am 65 and am losing my color - eventually it will be light blonde/white and I plan to keep using this shampoo. No other product comes close to delivering what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> It appears by color as if it is well pigmented. It isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It does the trick but I had to use more of it, more often and leave it on for longer to achieve what I needed for maintaining my platinum blonde. I actually have some left; tucked away incase I run out of my favorites. It&#x27;s good enough explains it well.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t dry my hair out, which is a plus! It&#x27;s one of the better Paul Mitchell products aside from the originals.&lt;br /&gt;Much better than the clear version.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this at a salon inside of a major shopping store in a pinch because I was out of my favorite which is:&lt;br /&gt;My old standby is the original Joico Color Endure Shampoo. I didn&#x27;t care for the conditioner but I&#x27;m providing a link to the shampoo that I&#x27;m talking about so you can see the bottle. It&#x27;s a combo pack. The conditioner also has a purple hue to it but I didn&#x27;t use it very many times because I couldn&#x27;t tell a benefit and I needed a better conditioner for my platinum hair.&lt;br /&gt;The link is something I randomly searched for and I don&#x27;t have any recommendations about purchasing from that seller good or bad. Provided to visualize the Joico product packaging. Also attaching an image of the original bottle of joico. http://amzn.com/B00112RH98</li>
            <li> Have used it for a couple of years on recommendation of hair stylist.  I love the sheen and the way it leaves my hair.  I have almost all gray/white in the front and I think it keeps the white pure in color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not blonde but my wife is and she really likes it.So happy wife is a good life.</li>
            <li> Quality of shampoo itself seems good, but it does nothing that I can tell to eliminate the brassiness of my color-treated &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; hair. Gave it a try when my other product was discontinued. Will keep looking for another product that works better!</li>
            <li> Came opened and product was all over the box.</li>
            <li> This shampoo keeps my grey hair light and bright in between shampooing.  I highly recommend to women (or men) who have light and dark grey hair to keep it brighter and shiny during styling.</li>
            <li> Ive used this shampoo before I just couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere around here , it&#x27;s awesome brightens up dull blondes makes them look just like you just highlighted them again! Delivery was fast ! Happy camper !!</li>
            <li> Great product..works very well to keep out that brassy yellow that some blondes get. I use it a couple times a week and I love this product. Great seller!! Fast shipping..</li>
            <li> This really will take the brass out of natural or chemically treated blond hair. It isn&#x27;t a product for everyday use though because it will leave your hair dull. The label should state this. Once a week, if you shampoo everyday, will be enough to maintain nice, shiny, blond color. As a hairdresser, I would recommend it to anyone with blond hair who hates the brash, fake, brassy look.</li>
            <li> Went into the salon very discouraged about the growing amount of yellow coming into my hair. Had been using ShimmerLights shampoo for a year with no real appreciable results. Seemed like it left a blueish cast on my hair. (definitely dont want to be a blue haired lady) This product was used on my white/grey hair by my stylist and it took out 90% of the yellow in the first use and left my hair w/a beautiful platinum shine! I WILL be buying this product. Would recommend a deep conditioner on dry hair like mine though!</li>
            <li> The item shipped quickly and was similar to described. The bottle looked a little different from the picture, but I believe it is a newer type bottle. The contents were just as the other products I have used.</li>
            <li> really bad ingredients.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of the yellow hue the chlorinated swimming pool leaves behind on my white hair. Really nice silvery shine now. THANKS!</li>
            <li> i like it, wish it was vegan!</li>
            <li> Seriously a savior in a bottle for us blondes !</li>
            <li> I have highlighted hair, and it tends to get fairly brassy between visits to the salon, so I like to use a toning shampoo or conditioner every other day. I decided to give this product a try because from the reviews I read about it, I expected it to be better than any other product I&#x27;ve used. It actually does not tone my hair as well as Aveda&#x27;s Blue Malva conditioner, and I think Phyto&#x27;s Phytargent shampoo works better as well. This product, however, is much less expensive than these two products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy this shampoo again. If you want it to be effective at toning, you have to leave the shampoo in your hair for several minutes - and if I&#x27;m going to leave something in my hair for several minutes, I&#x27;d prefer that it was conditioner rather than shampoo. I noticed a much bigger difference with this product when I left it on for 20 minutes versus three minutes, but then my hair felt kind of dry afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, the bottle I received had a piece of shipping tape over the top, but no manufacturer&#x27;s seal. I don&#x27;t know if Paul Mitchell products are usually sealed when new.</li>
            <li> i really couldnt tell that it was making a difference, but my friends said that after not seeing me for a couple of weeks that they could tell!</li>
            <li> Does anyone know if it helps blondes with swimmers hair? I swim everyday and my hair is greenish from the chlorine. My stylist said paul mitchell purple shampoo would be the best but i&#x27;m not sure if this is the one she is referring to.</li>
            <li> Nothing better for my hair. This is the only shampoo I buy and there just is no place that sells it a better price that I know of, and having it delivered to my door for no shipping fees? Wonderful.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure at first. I went from Dark Brown to Whitest, white and still had a little yellow at the tips. After using for a few weeks, no more yellow! Had tried over brands and they really had no impact. Love this product though and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is original? Can somebody please tell me how I can tell the difference?&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is in a grey container bottle, with a sticker around it.... Honestly, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my highlights, I was expecting better results.</li>
            <li> producted arrived quickly as was a described.  I would suggest that sellerr suggest to buyer that product needed to be shaken and stirred to make sure it is combined.  When things like this sit for a while, product has a tendency to separate.</li>
            <li> Works good but I love the joico much better!!!</li>
            <li> Easier on hair than clairol shimmer lights. Works just as well. Smells great too. Good for brassy brunettes as well</li>
            <li> I have silver grey hair and my hair dresser suggested this shampoo.  It works great and keeps the yellow out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super dry and the smell isn&#x27;t really great</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  Keeps me blond.</li>
            <li> Love it ! great for blond highlights! it really cuts the gold out!</li>
            <li> My hair is white. This shampoo brings out silvery highlights in my hair that no other shampoo does. There is no bluing and no yellowing of my hair. Just incredibly brilliant and soft white hair. I love it and as I cannot get this shampoo in local outlets I am delighted to find it at Amazon,</li>
            <li> Needs to be used every day for a good look. Very good item.</li>
            <li> I LOVED This shampoo, it smelled like watermelons, really brightened up my hair, it definitly takes out that brassy look, i used it about 1x a week and let it sit for about 3-4 minutes .it was great I need to order more</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I dyed my hair at home (yes I know - terrible idea) and my highlights turned green and my roots had a distinct copper color. Pretty desperate, I used this shampoo together with the blonde conditioner and my color went from horrid to a light even blonde. I am over the moon! Totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does a decent job of keeping my heavily - highlighted hair from getting brassy. However, even when I use a heavy-duty conditioner with it, it leaves my hair feeling a little dry, stringy and lifeless. I&#x27;ve used the same conditioner with other shampoos and had better results, so I know it is this particular product. Also, while I wouldn&#x27;t say it smells &amp;#34;bad,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s not exactly a very pretty scent, either. I guess what it comes down to the product does what it&#x27;s meant to (keeping cool tones in light hair), but I can&#x27;t say anything else positive about it really. I found a Pantene product at Walmart for around $6 that works just as well (it is labeled for silver hair and doesn&#x27;t mention blonde, but with the deep violet color it does the same thing) and leaves my hair feeling nicer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of toning shampoos - Jhirmack and Clairol - and they tend to dry my hair out very quickly.  This shampoo has the same intensity of color, but seems to be more conditioning to the hair.  I have pale blonde hair and the first time I used it, I think I left it on for too long (3 min), which seemed to slightly darken my hair temporarily.  So, now I only leave on 1 minute about 2 times a week and that does the trick perfectly.  I can even mix it half and half with one of my every day shampoos and get the same effect, while stretching the product (since it&#x27;s kinda expensive).  The smell is good - a mix between cucumber and honey dew melon.  Highly recommend this product to keep the brassies away and blonde hair bright!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the product. I would buy again. I hope it helps turn my hair platinum over time. I think its a lot better then simmerlights (:</li>
            <li> My light blonde hair holds color and does not turn red like it died with other shampoo. I highly recommend this product.</li>
