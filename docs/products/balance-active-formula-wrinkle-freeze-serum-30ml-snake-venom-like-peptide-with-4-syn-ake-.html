            <li>My husband keeps telling me my face looks awesome.</li>
            <li>just bought another bottle, this really is a great product and def the best of this type of serum, have tried others before</li>
            <li>Good product but not a miracle worker!</li>
            <li>am happy I took a chance and tried it.</li>
            <li>it has a very nice feel...</li>
            <li>Pleasantly impressed and even more so by the price.</li>
            <li>I loved the result but could not afford it.</li>
            <li>will most def keep buying!</li>
            <li>I am impressed really that it works at all and now think that if I continue I will get even better results.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>Seller was fab &amp; it arrived very quickly, so thank you &amp; order with confidence!</li>
            <li>I rub it in very lightly using about a dime-sized amount each time.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I try lots of products this one is on top of my list.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be sure</li>
            <li>Okay, didn&#x27;t freeze any wrinkles</li>
            <li>Love both items.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>great product especially used under a moisturizer</li>
            <li>but this one really does deliver and for such a great price!</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>This product has sufficiently piqued my curiosity that I am willing to purchase another bottle and perhaps the accompanying moisturizer and see if it works every better.</li>
            <li>but I feel that it works pretty well most of the day.  </li>
            <li>I apply it to the frown area then straight across the top of my eyebrows to get at all the muscles involved in frowning.</li>
            <li>This serum does not give as noticeable results, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>I wanna give it 5 stars for arriving so quickly..</li>
            <li>simply so I always will have it on hand, delivery was very quick with the first bottle, much quicker than estimated, so am very happy all round :)</li>
            <li>What I received may or may not have been fresh</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it two stars is because it seems to be a nice moisturizer</li>
            <li>As of right now, it appears to do as it claims.</li>
            <li>Just not for me, but at the same time I like organic products alot better.</li>
            <li>Temporarily freezes the muscles most especially in the forehead area.</li>
            <li>, so I can use the whole regime but see that I can order that on amazon uk (bit of a pain, prefer if seller could provide that one on amazon us, pretty please?)</li>
            <li>I previously used the eye cream from this line and really liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say for certain if my experience will be representative.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much, I just put a dab under my eyes and on my forehead and massage it in.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I really don&#x27;t look at myself in the mirror 2 hours after applying this product</li>
            <li>(free - I was in a medical study) at 3-4 month intervals.</li>
            <li>I looked for products to try at a reasonable price and found this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had REALLY wanted to like this product</li>
            <li>Definitely seen a difference and think with further use will see even better results.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and when its dry I use Vit C serum over top, both together give an unbeatable topical result in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Milky &#x27;freeze&#x27; serum/venom you think would live up to its advertised standards.  </li>
            <li>Whilst I cant say it works from the first use, definitely by the third day I started noticing results and by the end of the first week</li>
            <li>I like the product and it has a little bit of a zesty lemon scent to it but is easy to apply with your hands makes it easier to apply like about two droppers at a time</li>
            <li>The price is right but the contents looks like milk, which is strangely off-putting.</li>
            <li>I would be willing to say this probably could work because I&#x27;ve seen positive dermatological studies on the active ingredient.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>have noticed a smidgen of an improvement on my frown lines â€” not enough for anybody else to notice, which is the real test, however.</li>
            <li>, it has been 16 days and there HAS been a marked improvement.</li>
            <li>I would like to do a further update after a few more weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I would love to say that in another few weeks my forehead wrinkles &amp;#34;will reduce by up to 52% and crows feet will decrease by up to 24%&amp;#34; as it claims but we will have to wait for a further update.</li>
            <li>I am honestly surprised that it works; I certainly had my doubts that something so hyped by celebrity types would do anything other than make me feel like I was doing something.</li>
            <li>Other products out there, organic products, that really work.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Same as the Balance Active eye cream I gave this a month to give it a chance to work. Definitely seen a difference and think with further use will see even better results. Seller was fab &amp; it arrived very quickly, so thank you &amp; order with confidence! I only wish you also sold the Balance Active 8 in 1 face cream too, so I can use the whole regime but see that I can order that on amazon uk (bit of a pain, prefer if seller could provide that one on amazon us, pretty please?)</li>
            <li> I get boric twice a year. Not enough to have frozen face. This product takes me through in between times. I try lots of products this one is on top of my list.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised by this product. Whilst I cant say it works from the first use, definitely by the third day I started noticing results and by the end of the first week I was well and truly sold. You don&#x27;t need much, I just put a dab under my eyes and on my forehead and massage it in. Yes its white and milky, that doesn&#x27;t matter as it disappears as soon as you massage it in. I use it twice a day and when its dry I use Vit C serum over top, both together give an unbeatable topical result in my opinion. And the price definitely cant be beat! Have just ordered my second bottle simply so I always will have it on hand, delivery was very quick with the first bottle, much quicker than estimated, so am very happy all round :)&lt;br /&gt;update- just bought another bottle, this really is a great product and def the best of this type of serum, have tried others before but this one really does deliver and for such a great price! will most def keep buying!</li>
            <li> The price is right but the contents looks like milk, which is strangely off-putting. I can&#x27;t be sure but I *might* have noticed a smidgen of an improvement on my frown lines â€” not enough for anybody else to notice, which is the real test, however. I stuck with this two months and all I got for it was the worst breakouts I have ever had as a middle-aged person. I would be willing to say this probably could work because I&#x27;ve seen positive dermatological studies on the active ingredient. But in this case there is no decipherable expiration date. What I received may or may not have been fresh so I can&#x27;t say for certain if my experience will be representative. It&#x27;s not too expensive so it&#x27;s worth a try but for myself I will be trying another brand.</li>
            <li> Okay, didn&#x27;t freeze any wrinkles</li>
            <li> I wanna give it 5 stars for arriving so quickly.. it has a very nice feel... but I just got it today so can&#x27;t say whether or not it works. I&#x27;ll have to report back in a few weeks or so. I&#x27;m not too keen on the ingredients though. Just not for me, but at the same time I like organic products alot better.</li>
            <li> I use the Snake Venom Eye Cream from this brand as well. Love both items.</li>
            <li> Extremely overrated, rather sneaky play of words, it does not contain snake venom, just snake like venom. It is a waste of money. Other products out there, organic products, that really work.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it daily and nightly and twice a week with a derma roller. My husband keeps telling me my face looks awesome.</li>
            <li> Good product but not a miracle worker!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it two stars is because it seems to be a nice moisturizer but that&#x27;s about it. This does do nothing at all. I think if you see any results from this its like the placebo effect, meaning you think its working and you see results but the results are not coming from this product (at least that is my opinion). If you want a moisturizer in a little bottle then please order it if not then don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> great product especially used under a moisturizer</li>
            <li> Disappointed to report!  Milky &#x27;freeze&#x27; serum/venom you think would live up to its advertised standards.  Used as directed and No change...........don&#x27;t get snaked into this one.  The only &#x27;freeze&#x27; with this product should be your credit card...save your $$.</li>
            <li> You can feel it working!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few weeks. I would like to do a further update after a few more weeks of use. As of right now, it appears to do as it claims. Temporarily freezes the muscles most especially in the forehead area. I cleanse my face and then apply the Wrinkle Freeze Serum and then my regular moisturizer. This product has sufficiently piqued my curiosity that I am willing to purchase another bottle and perhaps the accompanying moisturizer and see if it works every better. Unfortunately I really don&#x27;t look at myself in the mirror 2 hours after applying this product but I feel that it works pretty well most of the day.  I would love to say that in another few weeks my forehead wrinkles &amp;#34;will reduce by up to 52% and crows feet will decrease by up to 24%&amp;#34; as it claims but we will have to wait for a further update. So far so good. Pleasantly impressed and even more so by the price.</li>
            <li> I like the product and it has a little bit of a zesty lemon scent to it but is easy to apply with your hands makes it easier to apply like about two droppers at a time</li>
            <li> I previously used the eye cream from this line and really liked it a lot. This serum does not give as noticeable results, but it&#x27;s not bad. I find I still prefer my prior serum but I am still using this occasionally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nightly for the frown lines between my brows. I apply it to the frown area then straight across the top of my eyebrows to get at all the muscles involved in frowning. Same areas as treated as with Botox for for frown lines.  I rub it in very lightly using about a dime-sized amount each time.&lt;br /&gt;Well, it has been 16 days and there HAS been a marked improvement. I am honestly surprised that it works; I certainly had my doubts that something so hyped by celebrity types would do anything other than make me feel like I was doing something. So I&#x27;ll continue and see how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;Years back I actually had a series of Botox treatments (free - I was in a medical study) at 3-4 month intervals. I loved the result but could not afford it. I was thinking of finding a way to afford it and poking around the internet read about Syn-Ake as a possible alternative.&lt;br /&gt;Then I looked for products to try at a reasonable price and found this.&lt;br /&gt;So I am impressed really that it works at all and now think that if I continue I will get even better results.&lt;br /&gt;Does it compare to Botox? No, at least not at the 16 day mark. Botox works within a couple of days and for me almost totally removed my frown lines. But I&#x27;d say I have about a 30% reduction in those lines.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy I took a chance and tried it.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any difference</li>
            <li> I had REALLY wanted to like this product however it was such a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;This has done NOTHING to change my skin in any way, shape or form.</li>
