            <li>I love Amazon.com!</li>
            <li>In my experience, best results come through exfoliating the scalp first, the product itself doesn&#x27;t do so, since it&#x27;s moisture.</li>

            <li>This is my holy grail, right now, of hair products; it&#x27;s probably-affordable, effective, and better than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>To add to that, the pump makes it really easy to put on, but the downside is that(like</li>
            <li>before I&#x27;d ever used and actually great shampoo, I never knew it could make a big difference.</li>
            <li>At school, I&#x27;ve received loads of compliments about how great my hair smells(especially on the first day of my new school).</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo I use, it is great it leaves my hair super silky</li>
            <li>My hair is so clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you want a shampoo that will moisturize your hair even on the first wash, I recommend Dove shampoo :) It will leave your hair smooth and soft, silky and shiny and even smells good and fresh whole day!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I would appreciate if they can sum up and answer my questions directly.</li>
            <li>My mother has shorter but more chaotic and unmanageable hair and her hair comes out very sleek when she uses this(and</li>
            <li>I just love this shampoo and will remain very faithful to it, so Dove:</li>
            <li>Lucky for me</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out and gets that good, thorough clean.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s hope my husband helps me use this up quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a high school student and this is great for daily use.</li>
            <li>Love this product leaves hair so soft!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo makes my hair feel super soft when used with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>The product was very gentle on my scalp and my problems with drying out disappeared</li>
            <li>I love Dove Daily Moisture Damage Therapy shampoo.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend a conditioner for those with longer hair, but as a gentle moisturizing shampoo, I couldn&#x27;t recommend this more highly.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li>It is very convenient.</li>
            <li>I think it works really well for people with unmanageable hair or people without.</li>
            <li>We recommended it to a friend of my mothers and her hair also comes out very sleek and shiny.</li>
            <li>Some people are really \\&quot;subtle\\&quot; about it like, \\&quot;Hmm.</li>
            <li>Also, using this product has really protected against breakage, though the sun should be accounted for, too; itdoesn&#x27;t have UVA OR UVB protection</li>
            <li>possible contain non-renewable, damaging/harmful, or rare ingredients</li>
            <li>Finally found the right shampoo</li>
            <li>The whole family uses it without complaint, but what I like is the pump top.</li>
            <li>Even though I recently cut it, I have a TON of hair of varying widths and amount of melanin of the individual strands(my hair&#x27;s half-Asian and half-Hispanic) and it is currently right at my hips(grows really fast).</li>
            <li>And its lasting a very ling time considering that both my niece and I use it.</li>
            <li>and my hair always feels really soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not a hair-care specialist or professional, I don&#x27;t work at Dove or Unilever, and I&#x27;m not a robot.</li>
            <li>Split ends need to be cut and are usually just unsightly very rare is the hair going to break all the way the follicle and prevent hair from growing.</li>
            <li>but I feel lazy right now.</li>
            <li>My husband is a regular guy, and he is not interested in highly scented, specialty shampoos.  </li>
            <li>so getting a high SPF sunblock is a must, especially if you want to keep your hair as dark as possible, like me.</li>

            <li> Also, if I was a fake, I would go about representing the general public much differently in a review.</li>
            <li> My friends are always endlessly messing with my hair and complimenting it.</li>

            <li> My mother, my little sister, and I use it when necessary(every day or two) and the conditioner for a few months now.</li>
            <li> soon as I switched I noticed a few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-great to help smoothing down a variety of hair(I&#x27;m not sure about ALL</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not like physics stops working when you concentrate really hard.</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re ordering something online that&#x27;s shipping to a cold climate, any product like shampoo will do that.*shrugs, just sayin&#x27;</li>

            <li> Love this product leaves hair so soft!</li>
            <li> I received a different shampoo (photo) that I ordered.</li>
            <li> My husband is a regular guy, and he is not interested in highly scented, specialty shampoos.  He also has psoriatic arthritis and needs a shampoo that won&#x27;t dry out his scalp.  This shampoo fits the bill nicely, and he loves the way his hair feels after showering.  He has been using it for quite some time, and I have had to search for it a few times, but Amazon.com came through for me!  I love Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> Finally found the right shampoo im sticking with this one amazon please don,t change the ingredients  in this shampoo its perfect.</li>
            <li> The pump makes it uber-convenient when one is in the shower and one&#x27;s eyes are closed</li>
            <li> Awesome. Does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> If you want a shampoo that will moisturize your hair even on the first wash, I recommend Dove shampoo :) It will leave your hair smooth and soft, silky and shiny and even smells good and fresh whole day! It works better if you use it with their conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love Dove Daily Moisture Damage Therapy shampoo. This works great, but it is thinner than the &#x27;squeeze&#x27; bottle you buy at the store.</li>
            <li> The box this came in was far too big and badly broken.  There was no bubble wrap or paper to stabilize the bottles during shipping and one of them had leaked quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and it&#x27;s so convenient having it in a pump bottle in the shower.  I bought a 3-pack on amazon.com and the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t shampoo my hair every day but this shampoo works great however often I use it.  It lasts a long time too because I only have to use a small amount.  I don&#x27;t need to use a conditioner with this either.  My hair is so clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find this pump bottle in any store so am very happy to get it from amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;My family uses my Dove products whenever they visit and they all like them.</li>
            <li> Do not order this if you live in a cold climate in the winter. Mine came frozen and had exploded all over. Lucky for me the person that packed it had put it in a plastic bag before shipping it out. I did loose some product and it was a mess but it could have been worse.&lt;br /&gt;I do love the shampoo. I just will shop for it and stock up before the weather gets cold next time.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo makes my hair feel super soft when used with the conditioner. Deliever time was about average. And its lasting a very ling time considering that both my niece and I use it.</li>
            <li> I constantly have to pull my hair back for work with gel and all that. it doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out and gets that good, thorough clean. I switched to dove for my hair a while a go and haven&#x27;t liked anything since.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the value, and for the pump, but I don&#x27;t care for the shampoo. I bought this also before I&#x27;d ever used and actually great shampoo, I never knew it could make a big difference. Let&#x27;s hope my husband helps me use this up quickly.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually cleans my hair!</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I use, it is great it leaves my hair super silky and I never have any problem with dry hair (I do use the conditioner at the same time).</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Always works. Convenient delivery.</li>
            <li> the box was badly broken when I received and the shampoo was all over the places. Contacted their customer care and they wrote me an academic essay of their return policy. Honestly, I would appreciate if they can sum up and answer my questions directly. It&#x27;s about $10 and I need to use the shampoo. I don&#x27;t bother to ship back and exchange</li>

I used to have a lot of breakage and dryness(that&#x27;s why I cut it; to prevent it from breaking the follicle in my scalp). Needless to say, using what I need requires a lot of product. However, this product lasts forever(in my opinion). My mother, my little sister, and I use it when necessary(every day or two) and the conditioner for a few months now. I think it works really well for people with unmanageable hair or people without. My mother has shorter but more chaotic and unmanageable hair and her hair comes out very sleek when she uses this(and the conditioner). It works for my little sister, too, who has regular hair. We recommended it to a friend of my mothers and her hair also comes out very sleek and shiny. I must say though, THE SMELL IS AMAZING. At school, I&#x27;ve received loads of compliments about how great my hair smells(especially on the first day of my new school). Some people are really \\&quot;subtle\\&quot; about it like, \\&quot;Hmm. It smells like berries. Does it smell like berries[when referring to adjacent friend]to you? Hmm. I like berries...[several minutes later]Hmm... is it you[when referring to me]who smells like berries?\\&quot; and others are out-flat, \\&quot;GIRL! YOUR HAIR SMELLS GREAT\\&quot; and one time (when walking towards friends with the wind hitting me) one of them is like, \\&quot;Oh my god, I just had a twilight moment[cringe, I hate twilight and she knows it], I LOVE HOW YOUR HAIR SMELLS!\\&quot; I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s harder to tangle with this product and my hair always feels really soft. My friends are always endlessly messing with my hair and complimenting it. It sure boosts my usually-low self-esteem :). Also, using this product has really protected against breakage, though the sun should be accounted for, too; itdoesn&#x27;t have UVA OR UVB protection so getting a high SPF sunblock is a must, especially if you want to keep your hair as dark as possible, like me. To add to that, the pump makes it really easy to put on, but the downside is that(like with all pumps) there will come a day when you have to little product to pump with, so you&#x27;ll have to unscrew it and get the product manually. In my experience, best results come through exfoliating the scalp first, the product itself doesn&#x27;t do so, since it&#x27;s moisture. I went through a bad phase of horrible products that just piled on top of my scalp and this product is not for that. I used brown sugar and honey and washed it with water and this shampoo and conditioned. It&#x27;s just, in my opinion, easier for the to absorb in the scalp. Unless you are a poor hair washer, this product does not pile on the scalp. I just love this shampoo and will remain very faithful to it, so Dove: DON&#x27;T STOP MAKING IT AND DON&#x27;T MESS WITH THE FORMULA. This is my holy grail, right now, of hair products; it&#x27;s probably-affordable, effective, and better than I was expecting. Also,  the review before mentioned that it exploded. If you&#x27;re ordering something online that&#x27;s shipping to a cold climate, any product like shampoo will do that.*shrugs, just sayin&#x27;* It&#x27;s not like physics stops working when you concentrate really hard. Anyway, you should ALWAYS(if you can) go to store to check out a product. Heck, it might be cheaper that way, you can always return it, and it&#x27;s store quality(as in: you never know with online products, but store products are usually untouched and tested and all that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Message to all you Asians with the Asian hair(from a phenotypic Asian): All of the Asian side of my family uses this and have actually sent me some for Christmas(they&#x27;re obsessed with my hair). It works for them and it works for me. IT&#x27;S LIKE IT&#x27;S MADE FOR ASIANS!!! Our tends to damage and dry if we don&#x27;t care for it, so this is perfect for us. Disclaimer: not that all Asian hair is the same, though it seems that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you&#x27;re just skimming I&#x27;ll list my pros and cons(personal)&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-smooth hair&lt;br /&gt;-soft hair&lt;br /&gt;-great scent(hence the review title)&lt;br /&gt;-great to help smoothing down a variety of hair(I&#x27;m not sure about ALL HAIR TYPES)&lt;br /&gt;-very handy pump&lt;br /&gt;-does not pile on scalp&lt;br /&gt;-moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;-protects against breakage&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Product will eventually need to be taken manually&lt;br /&gt;-does not exfoliate(not like it ever says it does*shrugs* just sayin&#x27;)&lt;br /&gt;-plastic bottle(not that it&#x27;ll ever be in a glass bottle, but product is non-renewable and pollutes and not-very-durable)&lt;br /&gt;-pump is hard-ish to...looking for the word... erm... activate, for lack of a better term,(just twist it either directions for a while to see which works)&lt;br /&gt;-not suitable for men(not that it says it is)&lt;br /&gt;-not sure about ALL hair types(though I would admonish people against buying if they have oily hair)&lt;br /&gt;-may possible contain non-renewable, damaging/harmful, or rare ingredients&lt;br /&gt;-annoying that you have to get creative to list cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredient list: Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl, Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Gycol Distearate, Dimethiconol, Fragrance, TEA-Dodecylbenzenesufonate, Tetrasodium EDTA, TEA-Sulfate, DMDM Hydantoin, Citric Acid, PEG-45M, Gluconotactone, Adipic Acid, PPG-9, Sodium Sulfate, Trehalose, Methlychloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Mica(C 77019), Titanium Dioxide(Cl 77891), Yellow 5( Cl 19140), Red 33(Cl 17200)&lt;br /&gt;Now, don&#x27;t let the ingredients and other&#x27;s opinions sway you.Just because someone told that, \\&quot;if you can&#x27;t read it, it&#x27;s bad\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it is. I mean, the abbreviations are weird, but otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t fit on the label and take all claims objectively(for example, the FDA has a different opinion on what is \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;organic\\&quot;). Research them, I would but I feel lazy right now. Excuse any misspellings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a hair-care specialist or professional, I don&#x27;t work at Dove or Unilever, and I&#x27;m not a robot. Excuse any bad grammar. Also, if I was a fake, I would go about representing the general public much differently in a review. I would also like to remind people that HAIR(and nails) IS DEAD and going bald nowadays is a vanity issue, not a survival issue; at worst, potential mates might be repelled. Split ends need to be cut and are usually just unsightly very rare is the hair going to break all the way the follicle and prevent hair from growing. Unless they make a split-end-chopping shampoo, no shampoo, including Dove *tear*, takes them away. Also, every woman is different, so no product is perfect for everyone.</li>
            <li> I am not knocking the shampoo.  I wonder how long it sat in the warehouse for it to shatter in transit?</li>
