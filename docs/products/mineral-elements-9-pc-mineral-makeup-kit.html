            <li>Nice set!</li>
            <li>the brushes are not the best brushes, but they&#x27;re pretty nice.</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice and the product is ok.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Just not my favorite starter kit.</li>
            <li>much better mineral products than this out there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and light on my face.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made knock off for better quality mineral make-ups.</li>
            <li>the bag and brush pouch makes it easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using mineral makeup, I will never buy anything else!!</li>
            <li>This is a nice starter package from Bare Minerals, but they have others that seem to be a better value.</li>
            <li>and if they are original or matte.</li>
            <li>The quality of the mineral makeup is outstanding, I like it much better than Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>pretty good replica just like bare minerals!</li>
            <li>This is a Christmas present will not be able to give a review until the grand kids have time to use this item</li>
            <li>i finally decided to buy it and it turned out pretty good.</li>
            <li>but overall, this is a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>The makeup was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>more natural looking.</li>
            <li>It was priced right, the only thing I would have liked would have been an option for quantity size.</li>
            <li>Bare minerals is so much better.</li>
            <li>Actually like the mineral veil in this better than BM...</li>
            <li>Looks good if not applied heavy</li>
            <li>I do enjoy the eye shadow brush and the colors I ordered, but I wish they would give you a little more of a choice in the colors</li>
            <li>fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I really like this makeup.</li>
            <li>It was so much cheaper</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Quality is just as good as Bare Minerals, and a lot less money!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this particular starter kit again.</li>
            <li>But I will purchase other Bare Minerals products as they are my favorite make-up with their ease of use and the way they look on my skin.</li>
            <li>the powders&#x27; shades are pretty similar if you ask me.</li>
            <li>A natural look which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I keep this in an overnight bag in my car for &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34; or if I head out unexpectedly after work and need a touch up.</li>
            <li>first i thought it was going to be very cheap and cheesy.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s decent though.</li>
            <li>thought I was ordering Bare Minerals-</li>
            <li>Thought I was buying bare minerals.</li>
            <li>Thought I was buying the real Bare mineral makeup, but we will see how it compares will be back to give my final review!</li>

            <li> Also, they include all the little zippered bags as &amp;#34;pieces&amp;#34; in the package.</li>
            <li> For example, it may say you&#x27;re receiving a 10 piece set, but three of the pieces are little bags.</li>

            <li> Cheaply made knock off for better quality mineral make-ups.</li>
            <li> thought I was ordering Bare Minerals- but this product seems to be it&#x27;s equal and works well.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> This is a Christmas present will not be able to give a review until the grand kids have time to use this item</li>

            <li> Junk. Thought I was buying bare minerals. My bad. Read wrong. No comparison.</li>
            <li> Not a fan. Bare minerals is so much better.</li>
            <li> This is a nice starter package from Bare Minerals, but they have others that seem to be a better value. I do enjoy the eye shadow brush and the colors I ordered, but I wish they would give you a little more of a choice in the colors and if they are original or matte. Also, they include all the little zippered bags as &amp;#34;pieces&amp;#34; in the package. For example, it may say you&#x27;re receiving a 10 piece set, but three of the pieces are little bags. I would rather have a lip gloss or another shade of foundation in lieu of the zippered bag. Overall, it&#x27;s decent though. Just not my favorite starter kit. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this particular starter kit again. But I will purchase other Bare Minerals products as they are my favorite make-up with their ease of use and the way they look on my skin.</li>
            <li> fast shipping.  much better mineral products than this out there.</li>
            <li> Great value!!! Quality is just as good as Bare Minerals, and a lot less money! Nice set! Actually like the mineral veil in this better than BM...more natural looking.</li>
            <li> first i thought it was going to be very cheap and cheesy.  i finally decided to buy it and it turned out pretty good. the brushes are not the best brushes, but they&#x27;re pretty nice. the powders&#x27; shades are pretty similar if you ask me. but overall, this is a pretty good deal. the bag and brush pouch makes it easy to travel with.</li>

            <li> I really like this makeup. I actually thought I was ordering Bare Minerals. It was so much cheaper and I really like it.</li>
            <li> pretty good replica just like bare minerals! small quantities though.</li>
            <li> Great products. Hope to find these in larger containers</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Did not stay on.</li>
            <li> The makeup was exactly what I was looking for! It was priced right, the only thing I would have liked would have been an option for quantity size. I like the makeup but it didn&#x27;t last long, I think roughly 2 months and I was ordering again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and light on my face.  A natural look which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Add a mascara, eyeliner and a lipstick of some sort (there is room in the pouch) and you have a &amp;#34;Face In a Bag&amp;#34;. I keep this in an overnight bag in my car for &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34; or if I head out unexpectedly after work and need a touch up. The quality of the mineral makeup is outstanding, I like it much better than Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> Perfect color. Very nice.</li>
            <li> Looks good if not applied heavy</li>
            <li> Product was as promised.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using mineral makeup, I will never buy anything else!!</li>
