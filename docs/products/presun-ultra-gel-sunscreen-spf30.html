            <li>Have a great summer and don&#x27;t get burned!!! : )</li>
            <li>Product recommended by my dermatologist as *best sunscreen for not washing off with sweat or water, and *best sunscreen for my ultra sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>He loved it.  </li>
            <li>My husband must use a sunscreen and has found Presun to be the most effective.</li>
            <li>It has a very light feel on the skin.</li>
            <li>This one provides the best protection and is the longest lasting as well.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic!</li>
            <li>there anyway or anywhere to get more?</li>
            <li>Just like you, I love Pre-sun.</li>
            <li>Why the manufacturer does not promote this product more is beyond me.</li>
            <li>Would love to know where it can</li>
            <li>I love this gel as it drys very fast and is not slick - perfect for golfers</li>
            <li>Non-greasy and clear, no scent, works great.  </li>
            <li>Everyone I have ever given this product to loved it, except my kids when they were real young.  </li>

            <li>it is not oily and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>it goes on clean (and transparent) without mess and protects great.  </li>
            <li>But if that would change the award winning formula then forget it, I&#x27;ll put it on the old fashioned way.</li>
            <li>It will cost $10-$12 but is convenient for those needing a bottle right away.</li>
            <li>For those looking for another source for purchasing: you should be able to buy it at your local HOSPITAL pharmacy.  </li>
            <li>I am really bummed!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t been able to locate PreSun Ultra suncreen in the locate area Central Ma.</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make this even better is if it came out in one of those continuous spray bottles.  </li>
            <li>A great product, but sadly, very hard to find.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I am a surfer and have gone through the full gammut of different waterproof sunscreens.  </li>

            <li> I have used this sunscreen for over 20 years and it lasts a long time even while in the water, doesn&#x27;t smell, and doesn&#x27;t have that greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, the only place I can find it is on line.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all the other sunscreens and I always come back to this one.  </li>
            <li> The lady answering the phone kept reassuring me that the product will shipped out to the public Late June, Early July.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to all other sunscreen except this one.</li>
            <li> I looked and looked with no success.</li>
            <li> I received this number from Bristol-Myers Squibb the previous owners of the product.  </li>
            <li> I gave some to my son-in-law who never wears sunscreen because of the greasy, messy feel on his skin and the discusting smells.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate the fact that you can by a \\&quot;gel\\&quot; sunscreen and not have all that thick messy cream.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would make sunscreen in the usual lotion form when you can make it as a gel!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> only problem is that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find in stores; thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have been unable to remove the stains.  </li>
            <li> I am going to be so disappointed if the Presun #30 gel is discontinued.</li>
            <li> fingers aren&#x27;t all greasy and nasty after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;It stays on well with swimming, sweating, etc.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I am allergic to all other sunscreen except this one.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the fact that you can by a \\&quot;gel\\&quot; sunscreen and not have all that thick messy cream.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen for oily skin. Won&#x27;t break you out. I recommend this sunscreen to all my clients.</li>
            <li> I am a surfer and have gone through the full gammut of different waterproof sunscreens.  This one provides the best protection and is the longest lasting as well. It doesn&#x27;t make me break out. If I apply it 15 or 20 minutes before I go in the water, it doesn&#x27;t run in my eyes.  It&#x27;s great stuff.  For those looking for another source for purchasing: you should be able to buy it at your local HOSPITAL pharmacy.  It will cost $10-$12 but is convenient for those needing a bottle right away.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would make sunscreen in the usual lotion form when you can make it as a gel!&lt;br /&gt;It soaks in and dries almost instantly.&lt;br /&gt;Your fingers aren&#x27;t all greasy and nasty after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;It stays on well with swimming, sweating, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find in stores; thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
            <li> My family loves the PreSun ultra gel-- it goes on clean (and transparent) without mess and protects great.  We took it to Hawaii and no one got burned! It is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have used Presun Ultra 30 for years and have never worried about a sunburn.  I like it&#x27;s non-greasy formula and the way it goes on and disappears</li>
            <li> I wihs I could find it in stores somewhere but since I can&#x27;t, I buy it online.  The best sunscreen around!</li>
            <li> This is a good suncreen and I have never gotten burned while using it, even where I live in Hawaii. I like to put it on my face when I go to the beach b/c it is not oily and it dries quickly. I would not put it on kids because it smells like rubbing alcohol and I could see them being fussy about it.</li>
            <li> I am going to be so disappointed if the Presun #30 gel is discontinued. For athletes it is the very best!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is also the very best sunscreen I have ever found...I am really bummed! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Is there anyway or anywhere to get more? &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This sunblock is excellent, it won&#x27;t run into your eyes when you sweat.   It goes on cool and absorbs quickly.  It has a very light feel on the skin.</li>
            <li> Just like you, I love Pre-sun. It is the best and doesn&#x27;t break me out plus I have never gotten sunburned with it. I looked and looked with no success. Every place I called said that they had it then when they went to the warehouse. They were out. I ended up called Cutix ( new owner of the product). The lady answering the phone kept reassuring me that the product will shipped out to the public Late June, Early July. I told her that I leave in 4 days for the beach and WHERE THE HECK CAN I FIND IT NOW??? She gave me a 1-800 number and said that maybe just maybe this company might have some still in stock. I called....they don&#x27;t have the lotion but they do have the gel spf 30. So, If you are like me and go to the beach early. Give this company a call. It is called Dillon Dist. and the number is 1-800-950-1955.  And just in case you want to call the company to let them know how much you love the product....The number is 1-877-755-7779. I received this number from Bristol-Myers Squibb the previous owners of the product.  I hope this is helpful to my fellow mankind. Have a great summer and don&#x27;t get burned!!! : )</li>
            <li> I just ordered PreSun Gel from Dillon Distributors 1-800-950-1955. &lt;br /&gt;For such a great product it certainly is hard to find!</li>
            <li> I love this gel as it drys very fast and is not slick - perfect for golfers</li>
            <li> How can I find this product in store&#x27;s? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t been able to locate PreSun Ultra suncreen in the locate area Central Ma. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This product has kept me from burning !!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Product recommended by my dermatologist as *best sunscreen for not washing off with sweat or water, and *best sunscreen for my ultra sensitive skin.  It works well - so far.</li>
            <li> My husband must use a sunscreen and has found Presun to be the most effective. The arms and cushions of his recliner chair are being stained from the suncreen.  I have been unable to remove the stains.  Does anyone have any suggestions that I might try?  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I understand why PreSun is Dermatologist recommended.  Works GREAT!  Protected my skin in 100 degree weather while boating in the sun for hours.</li>
            <li> I have fair and sensitive skin.  This is the best sunscreen for my face--no clogged pores or breakouts--and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> While this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;sex\\&quot; appeal of others out on the market, it is still the best.  I have used this sunscreen for over 20 years and it lasts a long time even while in the water, doesn&#x27;t smell, and doesn&#x27;t have that greasy feel.  It is the one my doctor has recommended for years and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out like others did.  Like other reviewers, the only place I can find it is on line.  The only thing that would make this even better is if it came out in one of those continuous spray bottles.  But if that would change the award winning formula then forget it, I&#x27;ll put it on the old fashioned way.</li>
            <li> A great product, but sadly, very hard to find.  Non-greasy and clear, no scent, works great.  I have tried all the other sunscreens and I always come back to this one.  I gave some to my son-in-law who never wears sunscreen because of the greasy, messy feel on his skin and the discusting smells.  He loved it.  Yet another convert.  Everyone I have ever given this product to loved it, except my kids when they were real young.  I think the short lived rubbing alcohol smell that you get when you put the product on was the problem.  But it goes away in about 5 seconds, and then you smell nothing.  Why the manufacturer does not promote this product more is beyond me.</li>
            <li> A super-great product. Told it is not mfd anymore. Would love to know where it can&lt;br /&gt;be purchased</li>
