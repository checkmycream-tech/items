            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>These Sun Globes Tanning Bed Eyewear work great when I use my tanning bed.</li>
            <li>They are great if you dont want racoon eye.</li>
            <li>These eye covers are great</li>
            <li>they worked great and protected my eyes.</li>
            <li>Good protection for my eyes without tan lines.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>They arrived very quickly as well!</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>the product itself was not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>Love these tanning goggles because they don&#x27;t leave the lines on your nose or side of your face.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t been able to find them since then.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite form of eye protection.</li>
            <li>I love the size of these.</li>
            <li>I love these because you never have to worry about tan lines across the bridge of your nose or on the side of your face if using straps.</li>
            <li>she was so excited that the 5-pack came in a variety of colors!</li>
            <li>Easy to carry in your pocket.</li>
            <li>I was looking for goggles that blocked out the light and did not make me look like a racoon.</li>
            <li>I felt like the light was getting in.</li>
            <li>Although, I&#x27;ve never purchased eye googles before, I can say either way, these are cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>The packing was great and the item was as expected.</li>
            <li>Spend a bit more and get the right product the first time.</li>
            <li>I like using these type of goggle because they provide great eye protection as well as not leaving a line across your eyebrows like the other attached goggle do.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t ever buy these, can&#x27;t use when standing up, worth about $.001</li>
            <li>I threw them out and bought the kind that are molded together with a band around the back of your head.</li>
            <li>They shipped quick and were exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The price was right, and it was shipped well too.</li>
            <li>They worked okay and will do the job for a lay-down session on a salon bed if you keep movement to a bare minimum.  </li>
            <li>so I definitely feel safe wearing these to protect my eyes.</li>
            <li>I also love how the case is small and it can easily fit in my purse.</li>
            <li>Other pairs I&#x27;ve used work 1000 times better.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li>I lost mine and just had to buy a new pair.</li>
            <li>Lay down put them on the right way and you should have no problems.</li>
            <li>Apparently, gaskets are used to help stick the globes over the eyes</li>

            <li> They work well if you can start the tanning bed after you are already lying down with these in place, otherwise you have to hold them in place or put them in after starting the bed.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing is they slide off when you perspire a lot.</li>
            <li> much less the gaskets.  </li>
            <li> They are very dark</li>

            <li> I bought a pair at a salon to avoid shipping charges.  They worked okay and will do the job for a lay-down session on a salon bed if you keep movement to a bare minimum.  The instructions for them state, \\&quot;For securing purposes SunGlobes must be used with Globe gaskets and not on their own.\\&quot;  No gaskets are included and no information on them or where to obtain them is provided.  Instructions reference the Australian Gold website but the website has no information even on SunGlobes, much less the gaskets.  Apparently, gaskets are used to help stick the globes over the eyes but I could find nothing else about them.</li>
            <li> I was not a huge fan of these. They work well if you can start the tanning bed after you are already lying down with these in place, otherwise you have to hold them in place or put them in after starting the bed. Inconvenient, but not life-threatening. Also, no choice of colors (you get what you get).</li>
            <li> These Sun Globes Tanning Bed Eyewear work great when I use my tanning bed. Good protection for my eyes without tan lines.</li>
            <li> I used them once and threw them away.They suck! I was looking for goggles that blocked out the light and did not make me look like a racoon. When I was done tanning, my eyes hurt from squinting and of course I looked like a racoon. Please dont buy these things!</li>
            <li> Used these all the time and never had a problem. Lay down put them on the right way and you should have no problems. Never had racoon eyes and never fell off unless you obviously move around a lot.</li>
            <li> Wish I could say these did the job of blocking out the sun&#x27;s glare but they don&#x27;t. Other pairs I&#x27;ve used work 1000 times better.</li>
            <li> I love them. No more line on bridge of noseðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li> I think I should have purchased goggles with the band across. When I went tanning they were constantly falling off and I felt like the light was getting in. The price was right, and it was shipped well too. the product itself was not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Perfect! They shipped quick and were exactly what I wanted. I also love how the case is small and it can easily fit in my purse.</li>
            <li> Fabulous! Bought them for my friend she was so excited that the 5-pack came in a variety of colors!</li>
            <li> Love these tanning goggles because they don&#x27;t leave the lines on your nose or side of your face. They are very dark so I definitely feel safe wearing these to protect my eyes. They arrived very quickly as well!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever buy these, can&#x27;t use when standing up, worth about $.001</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this style to use in a tannning bed, you have to balance them so they don&#x27;t fall off! I threw them out and bought the kind that are molded together with a band around the back of your head.</li>
            <li> I worked in a tanning salon that sold these years ago and I haven&#x27;t been able to find them since then. These are my favorite form of eye protection. Because they are two separate pieces - they protect your eyes without leaving you looking like a raccoon.</li>
            <li> I lost mine and just had to buy a new pair. They are great if you dont want racoon eye. I wouldnt use anything else</li>
            <li> Works well on the beach so you don&#x27;t have any marks when getting some rays.  Easy to carry in your pocket.</li>
            <li> I like using these type of goggle because they provide great eye protection as well as not leaving a line across your eyebrows like the other attached goggle do.  These eye covers are great and I would highly recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> The packing was great and the item was as expected. they worked great and protected my eyes. I could not complain</li>
            <li> The photo is misleading.  It appears as if there is a strap to keep them in place. Although, I&#x27;ve never purchased eye googles before, I can say either way, these are cheaply made.  Spend a bit more and get the right product the first time.</li>
            <li> I love the size of these. Not big and bulky like others. The only negative thing is they slide off when you perspire a lot.</li>
            <li> Good product. It protects eyes well.</li>
            <li> I worked at a tanning salon years ago that sold these and I ended up losing them. I have yet to find another salon that sells them so I took to Amazon and there they were! I love these because you never have to worry about tan lines across the bridge of your nose or on the side of your face if using straps. Obviously the only downside is having to have another pair with a strap if you want to tan in a stand up.</li>
