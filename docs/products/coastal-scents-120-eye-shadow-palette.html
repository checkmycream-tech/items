            <li>I am in love with this!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this pallette!</li>
            <li>Looks gorgeous when moistened and applied-- very bright, very opaque.</li>
            <li>Beautiful assortment of colors, highly pigmented and great price.</li>
            <li>Simply amazing.</li>
            <li>There are shimmery, glittery colors as well as some nice mattes.</li>
            <li>just mak sure to use a good primer</li>
            <li>The&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paired with some proper eyeshadow brushes, this pallette can be you best friend, it&#x27;s so great</li>
            <li>My package arrived fast, I was very happy about that.</li>
            <li>I liked it , it&#x27;s nice for a &amp;#</li>
            <li>Super is a great product.</li>
            <li>However, she wanted to use the palette for Halloween and came to me complaining that the colors rub off very easily and do not blend well at all.</li>
            <li>Pretty good!</li>
            <li>The pictures don&#x27;t do this product justice, the colors are so vibrant and expressive, yet they have a good bit of neutrals and pales to choose from.</li>
            <li>Vibrant colors and the powder is made of very good quality.</li>
            <li>In a 120 shadow palette, one should surely be able to find a suitable color for themselves.</li>
            <li>This palette is so full of gorgeous colors.</li>
            <li>Great options for being creative, so it is a good buy for summertime due to the bright colour options.&lt;br /&gt;Less</li>
            <li>Colors are bright and apply easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li>some or better than others.</li>
            <li>Love this palette and hello with this price, even popukar makeoup artist use this palette</li>
            <li>I love my palette</li>
            <li>You can create so many looks.</li>
            <li>They were a lot more pigmented than I thought they&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li>When I ordered this, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>There as so many colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li>In fact, I just purchased another one for my sister, for Christmas. &#x3D; )</li>
            <li>I love the pinks blacks blues and greens</li>
            <li>I am in love.</li>
            <li>So many choices for eyeshadow</li>
            <li>Some of the colors really don&#x27;t transfer that great.</li>
            <li>i love it....</li>
            <li>i really love the case with the Coastal scent logo on it....</li>
            <li>Of course that does not deter my love for this product and the amount i will be using it.</li>
            <li>I love Coastal Scents.</li>
            <li>Love them all.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to adding more to my collection .</li>
            <li>I love my set.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>Its still really cute</li>
            <li>the colours are perfect especially for summer looks.</li>
            <li>She was truly pleased and said the pigments are strong.</li>
            <li>Even with use of a primer, I&#x27;d prefer them to be more bold</li>
            <li>enjoy that the two sheets are stacked rather than arranged like a book as that design has caused eyeshadow to fall from their pots in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have purchased two of these palettes as gifts so far and each person has loved this palette.</li>
            <li>The colour looked really good in professional photos, blended well during application.</li>
            <li>None of the colors were damaged and it was exactly as described!!</li>
            <li>:) the colors are so vibrant I love them.</li>
            <li>Well worth the buy!</li>
            <li>It has every color i could ever want i would absolutely purchase this again! :)</li>
            <li>Great colors, use it everyday, good quality, long wear, stays on and doesn&#x27;t crease, matte colors have high pigmentation :) would have liked some matte neutral colors.</li>
            <li>The colors are good but the only way to keep them bright is using a white primer</li>
            <li>does not fade quickly when applied.</li>
            <li>I do love the hard case, it is sleek and very nice looking.</li>
            <li>give it 4 stars as the 120 colours mostly are bright shades and if it had bronze, copper shades and few more options in metallics(olive, rose, steel, grey) instead of some similar colours it would be a great set overall!</li>
            <li>Wet gives u a brilliant application with vivid colour.</li>
            <li>Use everyday, great quality for the price</li>
            <li>I did not experience any creasing with these colors, of which I&#x27;ve worn many so far, though by the end of the day</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I would really write a bunch but the product is what they say,  Comes fast with prime and love ALL the colors.</li>
            <li>It was okay for my 10 year old to play with</li>
            <li>The quality is excellent and none of shadows were broken on arrival.</li>
            <li>; because the colors are not strong (like a powder)  ,it&#x27;s good for smooth looks</li>
            <li>but I wish that it was designed more like a book, either with one set on each side and permanently in the case or one on top of the other on a hinge like turning a page in a book.</li>
            <li>The shadows are extremely pigmented and the colors are bright.</li>
            <li>This would be great for travel rather than bringing several different palettes.</li>
            <li>Few of the matte shades are chalky and not very pigmented but overall the palette is good, the shimmery shades are very good and pigmented.</li>
            <li>You have two inserts that fit inside the case, one on top of the other with all the eye shadow pans facing up.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a very wide variety of colors, both my friend and I have used it for cosplay tests and have found that the wide range provides the perfect color for any character!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of the colors and found that they last longer and look brighter with a prime.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd palette from them (I also brought thee original 88 and shimmer version of the original 88).</li>
            <li>This is the first palette I purchased when I first set on my journey experimenting with make up.</li>
            <li>Where else can you get such a variety of colors at such a good price?</li>
            <li>The colors are so pretty and very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t certain about ordering this</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a large box, and does not have a mirror.</li>
            <li>Vibrant, high quality,  exciting.</li>
            <li>There is a lot of fallout with some of the colors when they are first applied, but it doesn&#x27;t take much to get a vibrant color on your eye.</li>
            <li>Packaging was great, no pots were broken.</li>
            <li>Some colors don&#x27;t blend as I would like, but I really do like this pallette.</li>
            <li>Great colors, none came broken, got pigmented colors,</li>
            <li>fallouts onto the cheek and too much does not rub off onto the brush(unlike the Revealed 2 palette).</li>
            <li>I had to buy some intense metallics elsewhere.</li>
            <li>you have to remove whatever  set is on top to get to the second by taking it completely out.</li>
            <li>and I will be buying more products in the near future!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I first used it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s highly pigmented aray of colors.</li>
            <li>shadows themselves a little better.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time in very secure packaging, there was even bubble wrap inside of the small cardboard box/sleeve that it came</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised to find it in the mail box this morning!  </li>
            <li>You can apply them dry for a more subdued look or wet them for outrageously vibrant shades.</li>
            <li>individual color is pretty decently sized, about nickel sized just as a general comparison.</li>
            <li>I used this palette for my young cousin and her friends for their prom.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin and eyes</li>
            <li>anyone curious, this is the exact same palette as BH Cosmetic&#x27;s 120 first edition.</li>
            <li>It stated in the comment section of my invoice  &amp;#34;broken corner on outer case&amp;#34; and I kind of felt like if they knew it was broken, and wrote it on the invoice why did they ship it out?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product comes exactly as pictured, same case, same colors as you see here.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a major issue</li>
            <li>My only concern with the broken corner is breaking it more with constant and repeated use, that is the only reason for bringing it up.</li>
            <li>My friend used a wet color (red) as eyeliner and it was extremely vibrant lasting 24</li>
            <li>it is pretty faded, so not super long</li>
            <li>Very good for a makeup obsessed teen or, a makeup obsessed adult.</li>

            <li> The colors are good but the only way to keep them bright is using a white primer</li>
            <li> does not fade quickly when applied.</li>
            <li> I do love the hard case, it is sleek and very nice looking.</li>
            <li> give it 4 stars as the 120 colours mostly are bright shades and if it had bronze, copper shades and few more options in metallics(olive, rose, steel, grey) instead of some similar colours it would be a great set overall!</li>
            <li> Wet gives u a brilliant application with vivid colour.</li>
            <li> Use everyday, great quality for the price</li>
            <li> I did not experience any creasing with these colors, of which I&#x27;ve worn many so far, though by the end of the day</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I would really write a bunch but the product is what they say,  Comes fast with prime and love ALL the colors.</li>
            <li> It was okay for my 10 year old to play with</li>
            <li> The quality is excellent and none of shadows were broken on arrival.</li>
            <li> ; because the colors are not strong (like a powder)  ,it&#x27;s good for smooth looks</li>
            <li> but I wish that it was designed more like a book, either with one set on each side and permanently in the case or one on top of the other on a hinge like turning a page in a book.</li>
            <li> The shadows are extremely pigmented and the colors are bright.</li>
            <li> This would be great for travel rather than bringing several different palettes.</li>
            <li> Few of the matte shades are chalky and not very pigmented but overall the palette is good, the shimmery shades are very good and pigmented.</li>
            <li> You have two inserts that fit inside the case, one on top of the other with all the eye shadow pans facing up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a very wide variety of colors, both my friend and I have used it for cosplay tests and have found that the wide range provides the perfect color for any character!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the colors and found that they last longer and look brighter with a prime.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd palette from them (I also brought thee original 88 and shimmer version of the original 88).</li>
            <li> This is the first palette I purchased when I first set on my journey experimenting with make up.</li>
            <li> Where else can you get such a variety of colors at such a good price?</li>
            <li> The colors are so pretty and very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t certain about ordering this</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a large box, and does not have a mirror.</li>
            <li> Vibrant, high quality,  exciting.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of fallout with some of the colors when they are first applied, but it doesn&#x27;t take much to get a vibrant color on your eye.</li>
            <li> Packaging was great, no pots were broken.</li>
            <li> Some colors don&#x27;t blend as I would like, but I really do like this pallette.</li>
            <li> Great colors, none came broken, got pigmented colors,</li>
            <li> fallouts onto the cheek and too much does not rub off onto the brush(unlike the Revealed 2 palette).</li>
            <li> I had to buy some intense metallics elsewhere.</li>
            <li> you have to remove whatever  set is on top to get to the second by taking it completely out.</li>
            <li> and I will be buying more products in the near future!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I first used it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s highly pigmented aray of colors.</li>
            <li> shadows themselves a little better.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time in very secure packaging, there was even bubble wrap inside of the small cardboard box/sleeve that it came</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised to find it in the mail box this morning!  </li>
            <li> You can apply them dry for a more subdued look or wet them for outrageously vibrant shades.</li>
            <li> individual color is pretty decently sized, about nickel sized just as a general comparison.</li>
            <li> I used this palette for my young cousin and her friends for their prom.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin and eyes</li>
            <li> anyone curious, this is the exact same palette as BH Cosmetic&#x27;s 120 first edition.</li>
            <li> It stated in the comment section of my invoice  &amp;#34;broken corner on outer case&amp;#34; and I kind of felt like if they knew it was broken, and wrote it on the invoice why did they ship it out?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product comes exactly as pictured, same case, same colors as you see here.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a major issue</li>
            <li> My only concern with the broken corner is breaking it more with constant and repeated use, that is the only reason for bringing it up.</li>
            <li> My friend used a wet color (red) as eyeliner and it was extremely vibrant lasting 24</li>
            <li> it is pretty faded, so not super long</li>
            <li> Very good for a makeup obsessed teen or, a makeup obsessed adult.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this a few years ago for my daughter, and she has barely touched it.</li>
            <li> first the case was hard to open, but after opening and shutting a few times, it&#x27;s no problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought a 48 piece palette from e.l.f at Walmart and was kind of disappointed with the pigment, as well the fact that it didnt come with any pink shades.</li>
            <li> Can be applied dry or wet.</li>
            <li> Just what i expected and received it on time</li>
            <li> Just as expected...</li>
            <li> I do understand that by putting them set in one on each side that when closed the eye shadows would be facing in on each other and could cause damage this way when it comes to storing the product itself.</li>
            <li> colors are just as vibrant as they appear - I have to use very small amounts not to overdo it!</li>
            <li> This palette is comparable to any other palette I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see ordering a small palette for double the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this a few days ago and the shipping was crazy fast!!!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the design of  it itself.</li>
            <li> Mine did come with a broken corner where a piece of the plastic is missing.</li>
            <li> Inconvenient to carry around for touch ups(expected due to the 120 colours).</li>
            <li> None were broken</li>
            <li> So the design and them knowing of the broken corner on the case is why I have given a 4 star rating instead of 5.</li>
            <li> None of the eyeshadows were broken so that was a plus</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually disappointed, the colors don&#x27;t show up well..</li>
            <li> learned about primer and eyeshadow base but outcome didn&#x27;t change :(</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried this palette yet. But my shipping was great.  None were broken so im happy</li>
            <li> Love the selection of colors and how great the package/product came in. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> The colors are good but the only way to keep them bright is using a white primer</li>
            <li> Super is a great product.</li>
            <li> Good palette for beginners. Few of the matte shades are chalky and not very pigmented but overall the palette is good, the shimmery shades are very good and pigmented.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to buy more! So pigmented, like swatched on my arm and stained for a day or two good with some colors, some or better than others. No matter they&#x27;re all good! Love this palette and hello with this price, even popukar makeoup artist use this palette</li>
            <li> Great shop! I love my palette</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually disappointed, the colors don&#x27;t show up well.. I played with it immediately, wasn&#x27;t working out to good, learned about primer and eyeshadow base but outcome didn&#x27;t change :(</li>
            <li> This palette is awesome!! It has all the bright colors I wanted and it shipped properly no cracks or anything.</li>
            <li> Sooooo many colors to choose from, from matte to sparkle! I&#x27;ve tried most of the colors and found that they last longer and look brighter with a prime. Either way, this is a great buy at a fantastic price!</li>
            <li> This palette is so full of gorgeous colors. Vibrant, high quality,  exciting. You can create so many looks. Very good for a makeup obsessed teen or, a makeup obsessed adult.</li>
            <li> Vibrant colors and the powder is made of very good quality. Good choice, you won&#x27;t regret to use this make up because it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> the colors, the texture, the application and its duration in the eyes is perfect. the colors are very beautiful and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I have purchased two of these palettes as gifts so far and each person has loved this palette. The shadows are extremely pigmented and the colors are bright. I&#x27;ll probably be buying this palette a third time but for myself this time.</li>
            <li> Packaging was great, no pots were broken. They were a lot more pigmented than I thought they&#x27;d be. I used this palette for my young cousin and her friends for their prom. Just put a primer before you put on the shadow, and bam!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised when I first used it. The colors are bright and long-lasting. There as so many colors to choose from. I&#x27;ll probably never run out, but if I do, I&#x27;ll definitely order again. This palette is comparable to any other palette I&#x27;ve used. There is a lot of fallout with some of the colors when they are first applied, but it doesn&#x27;t take much to get a vibrant color on your eye.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t certain about ordering this but I&#x27;m glad that I did. Where else can you get such a variety of colors at such a good price? The colors are great and wear well. I&#x27;m going to order one for my granddaughter&#x27;s birthday in May. In this set she&#x27;ll have all the colors she needs as do I.</li>
            <li> Excellently varied palette with good quality makeup for a stellar price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first the case was hard to open, but after opening and shutting a few times, it&#x27;s no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are just as vibrant as they appear - I have to use very small amounts not to overdo it! Looks gorgeous when moistened and applied-- very bright, very opaque. There are shimmery, glittery colors as well as some nice mattes. I did not experience any creasing with these colors, of which I&#x27;ve worn many so far, though by the end of the day it is pretty faded, so not super long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product comes exactly as pictured, same case, same colors as you see here. Um, I don&#x27;t think I will ever have to buy eye shadow again....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, excellent buy, do not regret it. In fact, I just purchased another one for my sister, for Christmas. &#x3D; )</li>
            <li> bright colors and a ton of colors will get again I love the pinks blacks blues and greens my sister loves it too!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price. Surprisingly pigmented. Some colors don&#x27;t blend as I would like, but I really do like this pallette.</li>
            <li> Great colors, none came broken, got pigmented colors, well packaged, make-up are a good size (each circle about 1 1/2 inch in diameter). Colors pop and are bright does not fade quickly when applied. Mine lasted about 4-6 hours in open area. great purchase.</li>
            <li> This is officially the best eyeshadow in my makeup box, would recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> I am in love. So many choices for eyeshadow and they show on my eyes so well. If you wear a eye primer underneath it the results are even better! I am a fan of coastal scents and will be using this product all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeing the UD electric pallete. I got this as an alternative since I&#x27;m still practicing my blending. The colors are so pretty and very pigmented. just mak sure to use a good primer and u should be set. This is a great option for beginners! Also great for more the more experienced. Definitely a great deal!</li>
            <li> Some of the colors really don&#x27;t transfer that great. Even with use of a primer, I&#x27;d prefer them to be more bold</li>
            <li> It came on time and intact!! None of the colors were damaged and it was exactly as described!! This was a gift for my artist wife who can&#x27;t get enough of makeup and colors. She was truly pleased and said the pigments are strong.</li>
            <li> I would really write a bunch but the product is what they say,  Comes fast with prime and love ALL the colors.</li>
            <li> The pictures don&#x27;t do this product justice, the colors are so vibrant and expressive, yet they have a good bit of neutrals and pales to choose from. In a 120 shadow palette, one should surely be able to find a suitable color for themselves.</li>
            <li> i love it....i really love the case with the Coastal scent logo on it....5star</li>
            <li> Just what i expected and received it on time</li>
            <li> the colors are awsome and show up great when wearing them.  I use them for at burningman and the color stays on all day/night</li>
            <li> I ordered this a few days ago and the shipping was crazy fast!!! I was very pleasantly surprised to find it in the mail box this morning!  The colors are amazing!!!! So many, and they are all beautiful!! I am in love with this! My only complaint is the design of  it itself. You have two inserts that fit inside the case, one on top of the other with all the eye shadow pans facing up.  My issue is  you have to remove whatever  set is on top to get to the second by taking it completely out. This isn&#x27;t a major issue but I wish that it was designed more like a book, either with one set on each side and permanently in the case or one on top of the other on a hinge like turning a page in a book. I do understand that by putting them set in one on each side that when closed the eye shadows would be facing in on each other and could cause damage this way when it comes to storing the product itself. I feel like this would protect the eye shadows themselves a little better. I do love the hard case, it is sleek and very nice looking. Mine did come with a broken corner where a piece of the plastic is missing. It stated in the comment section of my invoice  &amp;#34;broken corner on outer case&amp;#34; and I kind of felt like if they knew it was broken, and wrote it on the invoice why did they ship it out? Of course that does not deter my love for this product and the amount i will be using it. My only concern with the broken corner is breaking it more with constant and repeated use, that is the only reason for bringing it up. So the design and them knowing of the broken corner on the case is why I have given a 4 star rating instead of 5. I absolutely love it, it was a great buy, and I will recommend this product to someone else and I will be buying more products in the near future!</li>
            <li> I love Coastal Scents. It is great quality for the price. It was exactly what I ordered. This is my 3rd palette from them (I also brought thee original 88 and shimmer version of the original 88). Love them all.</li>
            <li> I love it! It shipped very fast colors are very bright and stay on all day with a primer! Well worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Great colors, use it everyday, good quality, long wear, stays on and doesn&#x27;t crease, matte colors have high pigmentation :) would have liked some matte neutral colors. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Use everyday, great quality for the price</li>
            <li> Lot of colour options for 18$! I used it with the NARS eyeshadow primer and the Urban Decay setting spray and it lasted all evening - 5pm-11pm. I did an orangey-red eye with some highlights(a goldy-silver colour from the same palette). The colour looked really good in professional photos, blended well during application. Great options for being creative, so it is a good buy for summertime due to the bright colour options.&lt;br /&gt;Less fallouts onto the cheek and too much does not rub off onto the brush(unlike the Revealed 2 palette). Gel eyeliner goes on well over the shadow.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and eyes and I was very happy that this product did not cause any issues.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a large box, and does not have a mirror. Inconvenient to carry around for touch ups(expected due to the 120 colours). The pans are glued to the case.&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4 stars as the 120 colours mostly are bright shades and if it had bronze, copper shades and few more options in metallics(olive, rose, steel, grey) instead of some similar colours it would be a great set overall! I had to buy some intense metallics elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This eye shadow packs a punch with it&#x27;s highly pigmented aray of colors. This is the first palette I purchased when I first set on my journey experimenting with make up. Now that I&#x27;m in my mid twenties and have all sorts of options at hand, I still find myself reaching for this beauty! This would be great for travel rather than bringing several different palettes. Bottom row in one of the pans has blending colors so it has everything you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone curious, this is the exact same palette as BH Cosmetic&#x27;s 120 first edition.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors in this pallet, and the shadows go on so beautiful. I am looking forward to adding more to my collection .</li>
            <li> I bought a 48 piece palette from e.l.f at Walmart and was kind of disappointed with the pigment, as well the fact that it didnt come with any pink shades. So i got this palette instead. It is the best eyeshadow i have ever used! The pigment is great and the colors are even brighter in person. It has every color i could ever want i would absolutely purchase this again! :)</li>
            <li> I love this pallette! It arrived on time in very secure packaging, there was even bubble wrap inside of the small cardboard box/sleeve that it came in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a very wide variety of colors, both my friend and I have used it for cosplay tests and have found that the wide range provides the perfect color for any character! You can apply them dry for a more subdued look or wet them for outrageously vibrant shades. My friend used a wet color (red) as eyeliner and it was extremely vibrant lasting 24+ hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy that the two sheets are stacked rather than arranged like a book as that design has caused eyeshadow to fall from their pots in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each individual color is pretty decently sized, about nickel sized just as a general comparison. The&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paired with some proper eyeshadow brushes, this pallette can be you best friend, it&#x27;s so great</li>
            <li> My package arrived fast, I was very happy about that. None of the eyeshadows were broken so that was a plus :) the colors are so vibrant I love them. I will probably buy another palette as soon as I finish this one.</li>
            <li> I love my set.  Colors are bright and apply easily and smoothly. Definitely happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Very good for the price!</li>
            <li> I liked it , it&#x27;s nice for a &amp;#34;day use&amp;#34; because the colors are not strong (like a powder)  ,it&#x27;s good for smooth looks and you can use some colors as blusher.</li>
            <li> Beautiful assortment of colors, highly pigmented and great price. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a palette that has matte colours this is the one for you! Simply amazing. Can be applied dry or wet. Wet gives u a brilliant application with vivid colour. A must have for affordable pricing.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this a few years ago for my daughter, and she has barely touched it. However, she wanted to use the palette for Halloween and came to me complaining that the colors rub off very easily and do not blend well at all. Its still really cute and she wears some of the colors sometimes, but I&#x27;m displeased with the product. Is anyone else having this problem?</li>
            <li> It was okay for my 10 year old to play with</li>
            <li> I love these colors - they are very bright, and stay all day. I use this palette for both day and night looks.</li>
            <li> You can beat the color variety when compared to the price. They are each about a dime size. I ordered this to experiement with the color shading and schemes and also because Halloween was coming up. Pigmentation seems middle of the road but again, you get what you paid for. I couldn&#x27;t see ordering a small palette for double the price. Pretty good!</li>
            <li> Just as expected...the colours are perfect especially for summer looks. The quality is excellent and none of shadows were broken on arrival.</li>
