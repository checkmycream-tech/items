            <li>When done styling your hair looks so healthy almost as if you just walked out of the salon.</li>

            <li>and I end up with a smooth, glossy look that is polished and professional.</li>
            <li>I ordered several as this product sold out at my daughters salon where she&#x27;s a hairdresser I ordered on line as I love it and don&#x27;t want to run out,</li>
            <li>Great product especially when the weather is humid!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time</li>
            <li>I have used Outshine 01 for many years on my very dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this hair produce to anyone and all hair types.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>You can also use it after your shampoo and let your hair dry naturally for a nice soft curl.  </li>
            <li>Have tried many different products for my frizzy, curly hair and keep coming back to this one.  </li>
            <li>As nearly anything is useful in combination with a flat iron, this adds nothing to my hair care line up.</li>
            <li>Where I live in far northern califoria</li>
            <li>As a white person with naturally curly hair, I highly recommend it for humid weather it will keep your hair from frizzing!</li>
            <li>I have used this produce for about 5 years know and nothing compaires to how shine and soft</li>
            <li>In my natural state, I have 1980&#x27;s-Hair-Band Hair, that looks like I was experimenting with a home perm.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it near my scalp as my hair tends to look oily there if I do.  </li>
            <li>Only thing that&#x27;s worked on my summer frizz so far!</li>
            <li>I have curly, frizzy, and generally uncooperative hair.</li>
            <li>In between shampoos, I will work a little in, again with a little water to make it spread better on the areas that need frizz control.  </li>

            <li> Only place I could ever find it was at JCPenney&#x27;s, however they closed in our city</li>
            <li> Perhaps this is helpful if you are straightening very thick hair, but for very fine, curly/frizzy hair, it is heavy, greasy, and makes hair limp.</li>
            <li> so it is not a new item to me.  </li>

            <li> Redken Outshine Polishing Milk is amazing! A tiny (dime size) amount works through my thick long hair and controls frizzies (which I have a lot of) all day...even when it&#x27;s humid! I&#x27;ve tried several different \\&quot;anti-frizz\\&quot; product and this is the best I&#x27;ve found. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love my Redken Outshine, nothing in this world works better on my natural curly hair.  Even on the most humid days with rain, my curls hold together without the frizzies!  It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for more than 10 years and it is the best stuff on the market for controlling and taming the frizzes once your hair drys. I have used other expensive name brand salon products when I could not find this one and I was disappointed with the results. I have very thick, wavy hair and when my hair dries I get flyaway frizzes real bad. I apply Redken Outshine 01 after towel drying my hair and let my hair dry naturally and no frizzes once dried. Also there is no sticky, stiff feeling to your hair after it is dry. I hate that stiff yuk feeling. Where I live in far northern califoria none of the salons sell this product. Therefore I must buy off the internet or when I visit relatives in Sacramento.</li>
            <li> I have curly, frizzy, and generally uncooperative hair. I use the Redken Outshine 01 on my damp hair, and it tames my tresses into shape! I can apply heat and I end up with a smooth, glossy look that is polished and professional. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> As always, a wonderful product for my thin, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> This product was authentic and exactly what I wanted. I am very pleased with my overall results with this product.</li>

            <li> I use this on my dry frizzy fly aways, it works for a while. You have to reapply through out the day.</li>
            <li> I live in Texas and it works great! It fights frizz and leaves shine for days. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this at a salon and liked it very much.  I bought this when the sample ran out.  It lasts a long time because you only use a little (my hair is shoulder length).  It takes away the frizz and makes my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> Only thing that&#x27;s worked on my summer frizz so far! Just watch out for the coagulated chunk caught in the dispenser opening as it&#x27;s gives you a &amp;#34;Something About Mary&amp;#34; hair effect!</li>
            <li> Great product especially when the weather is humid!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time and I&#x27;m now on my second order!&lt;br /&gt;A must have!</li>
            <li> I love the product.  It totally controls my frizzy hair.  I use it all year round for great control and shiny hair.</li>
            <li> I love this hair product! Only place I could ever find it was at JCPenney&#x27;s, however they closed in our city so I was thrilled to see this on the website! As a white person with naturally curly hair, I highly recommend it for humid weather it will keep your hair from frizzing!</li>
            <li> Great bed head product for long hair! Separates to beach like waves.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this hair produce to anyone and all hair types. I believe this helps even when you have static in your hair. I have used this produce for about 5 years know and nothing compaires to how shine and soft it makes your hair look. I have about 14 inches of hair so medium length and I use one pump (applying it at the ends more and lightly at the roots) when my hair is damp and then blow dry and style my hair. When done styling your hair looks so healthy almost as if you just walked out of the salon. This bottle usually last about a month for me .</li>
            <li> I have used Outshine 01 for many years on my very dry hair.  It is a wonderful hair product that is light rather than sticky on your hair, yet the hair is left more manageable with a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Does not have a pleasant smell</li>
            <li> Product is too heavy. In my natural state, I have 1980&#x27;s-Hair-Band Hair, that looks like I was experimenting with a home perm. Perhaps this is helpful if you are straightening very thick hair, but for very fine, curly/frizzy hair, it is heavy, greasy, and makes hair limp. As nearly anything is useful in combination with a flat iron, this adds nothing to my hair care line up.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great !!!  Received a sample of this at my beauty salon about a year ago didn&#x27;t figure it was anything great so didn&#x27;t try it for several months .. Then tried !! Wow is the greatest ever!! Have recommend to everyone !!  It&#x27;s great !!</li>
            <li> best anti frizz product i have ever used</li>
            <li> no better or worse than others I have tried.  My frizzies are indefatigable</li>
            <li> Have tried many different products for my frizzy, curly hair and keep coming back to this one.  I use it right after a shampoo as a leave in conditioner and styling product and also in between shampoos to tame frizz and restyle.  You don&#x27;t need to use much.  I have long hair and usually just put about a quarter size glob in my palm, add a little water and then rub my palms together and work it through my hair starting with the ends and then working up.

You can also use it after your shampoo and let your hair dry naturally for a nice soft curl.  It is a great product, very versatile and it leaves your hair in great condition.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product keeps my natural curls looking fabulous! Great Stuff....</li>
            <li> Yes, it met my requirements.  I&#x27;ve used it for some time so it is not a new item to me.  I like it.</li>
