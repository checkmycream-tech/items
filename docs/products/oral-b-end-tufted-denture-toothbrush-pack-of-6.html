            <li>When YOU can smell the offensive odor yourself, that ain&#x27;t good.  </li>
            <li>Good value and price.</li>
            <li>YES, these are softer and give a good massage to the gums.  </li>
            <li>These are wonderful to help brush and clean my teacup maltese dog teeth.</li>
            <li>Use all the time great for dental care better than picks</li>
            <li>It is very important for preventing gingivitis in those area and to keep good hygiene</li>
            <li>These mini toothbrushes are amazing for cleaning the gum line.</li>
            <li>Nice size.  </li>
            <li>However, I remembered that I liked these \\&quot;end tufted\\&quot; brushes and ordered some.  </li>
            <li>It is the absolute best brush for him I have found.  </li>
            <li>The Oral-B are designed quite well, rounded and soft and perfect for your gums.</li>
            <li>She praised me how I maintain teeth in good clean condition.</li>
            <li>Since my dentist doesn&#x27;t stock these brushes, I was glad to find them on line.  </li>
            <li>Most drug stores and department stores do not carry this product, and when they do it is twice the price I paid here</li>
            <li>So glad I decided to try the internet.  </li>
            <li>The GUM brush works better for me.  </li>
            <li>, I would recommend and will order more.</li>
            <li>I like the tufted Braun ones better</li>
            <li>and I was satisfied with them</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>Ordered in error, threw away, and re-ordered the brand I like 100% better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for brushing, with pressure, certain areas particularly molars.</li>
            <li>This brush is very good at brushing back teeth.</li>
            <li>is a wonderful way to assure minimal plaque on all teeth.  </li>
            <li>I love it because it helps to really clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>I got the shipment very quickly.</li>
            <li>They are good for focusing on particular neglected areas of your teeth.</li>
            <li>She wanted to buy more of these special toothbrushes</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I found these sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li>That this is no longer available from the manufactures in this country.</li>
            <li>I used to get these in my dentist office, they are great for getting back teeth.  </li>
            <li>Great for tiny dogs teeth!</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, which my periodontist recommended for reaching upper molars.  </li>
            <li>Great product; can find on Amazon only</li>
            <li>Have ordered from another supplier which now tells me they no longer are available.  </li>
            <li>Was so fortunate to find thru Amazon.com and will continue to place my orders with a company that takes care of customers.  </li>
            <li>These work great for tiny dog tooth brushing</li>
            <li>Use the brush everyday and is especially good for brushing between implants.  </li>
            <li>This product is very useful in cleaning my dental partials.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s super easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also not as easy to use in that they don&#x27;t seem to get up under the gum line as effectively because they are so soft.  </li>
            <li>so it is well worth using every day!</li>
            <li>We use this toothbrush to clean our cats teeth.  </li>
            <li>and it gets it clean</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t keep the areas clean around the caps and bridges</li>
            <li>If you have hard to reach places when you&#x27;re brushing this is awesome.</li>
            <li>I find these both economical and very useful.</li>
            <li>these brushes are great for getting in those hard spots to clean out and massage the gums love them bought them on auto ship</li>
            <li>I got the product quickly and will use them for quite awhile.  </li>
            <li>Tried to buy these in the UK but they don&#x27;t seem to be available anymore, have used other brands but not as good as these.</li>
            <li>Very good for cleaning the back side of teeth and back gums.  </li>
            <li>and I have appreciated having them available through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Now my whole family use this and enjoy.</li>
            <li>this brush is so useful for crowns, implants, etc.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants more than just white teeth but also healthy gums</li>
            <li>you want healthy gums, no high numbers on the gum-pocket check and some awesomely clean feeling teeth, this is the brush!</li>
            <li>It can reach the area that normal tooth brush can&#x27;t easily get to.</li>
            <li>just the right tool for the job.</li>
            <li>that are not aligned right.</li>
            <li>great for my small dogs teeth.</li>
            <li>After regular brushing, this brush is good to get the plaque near the gums without damaging them.</li>
            <li>works great for getting along the gumline, since braces tend to prevent regular toothbrushes from working as well there,leaning the braces themselves, and cleaning the spaces between teeth where the wire blocks a regular toothbrush from cleaning as effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very important to my daily routine</li>
            <li>It works around crowns to keep the area around the gums clean and free of tiny particles that a toothbrush alone will not take care of.</li>
            <li>Works great for hard to reach places in mouth.</li>
            <li>I think it would be great for hard to get at places in humans too.</li>
            <li>For some reason, I can&#x27;t get my gum line clean with a regular toothbrush so after I brush with a regular toothbrush, I then brush my gum line with this brush and my gum line then feels smooth :-)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>She was given the first one by her dentist.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly the product I wanted, at the cheapest price I could find.</li>
            <li>The only brush better for those areas was an end tufted Wisdom brush which I can no longer find.</li>
            <li>The dentist gave me the first one of these and it worked.</li>
            <li>Was able to purchase these brushes in several stores until brushes were no longer stock items.</li>
            <li>Excellent tool for cleaning difficult places in your mouth.</li>
            <li>just what i needed, as i can not get them in the uk,  thanks for the good service will use you again in the near future</li>
            <li>Bristles are too soft and they wear out quickly.  </li>
            <li>They last me about 6 months and since my bottom front teeth are overlapping, I need this brush to keep the area free of Plaque.</li>
            <li>Thanks for them</li>
            <li>I care so much of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than running all over the countryside looking for these things.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for being there.</li>
            <li>wisdom tooth started to really REEK.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps not the manufacturer&#x27;s intended purpose, but the Yorkie does not care and it makes the job much easier for both of us.</li>
            <li>This size toothbrush is absolutely a must for myself and would think for any person with dental aids.  </li>
            <li>Mine happen to be stainless steel/bottom.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>misses too much.</li>
            <li>I also use this to clean the back of my teeth, where the metal bands are placed.</li>
            <li>Have small yorkie and it fits nicely in her mouth.  </li>
            <li>Tuft was to small to be effective.  </li>
            <li>Soft, easy to fit in small places.</li>
            <li>Great product, it is hard to find locally</li>
            <li>Also very gentle on gums and recommend the brush for young and old!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>The absolute best toothbrush for getting in behind and around all of the teeth, especially the  back teeth.  </li>
            <li>Love the narrow brush handle (I had looked at the GUM tufted brush - but not crazy about the big oversized handle), that these come in 6 packs, and are affordable.  </li>
            <li>Great compliment to regular brushings, goes places regular brushes just can&#x27;t due to their size - gets around the back teeth like a charm!</li>
            <li>ordered these as a last resort before considering an extraction, which I really can&#x27;t afford this very minute</li>
            <li>purchased for a friend with a very sensitive gag reflex.</li>
            <li>Use your regular brush first, then the end-tuft, and then floss.  </li>
            <li>I seem to be having better checkups since I started using this and other such products.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I need to brush around my back teeth.</li>
            <li>but they definitely do reach the area I need to focus on whereas a normal size tooth brush doesn&#x27;t so I feel certain they will accomplish the desired result.</li>
            <li>I use them to maintain cleanliness on a special splint anchoring three front teeth to abutting teeth in lieu of a bridge or other denture.</li>
            <li>I have a pocket in my gums from oral surgery that is hard to keep clean and which could potentially cause the loss of another tooth and these end tuft brushes were recommended for keeping that are clean to prevent problems.</li>
            <li>Great for cleaning tight and hard to reach spots in between my braces.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been three days since I&#x27;ve started using this brush to clean my wisdom tooth and the odor is completely gone, all day long.  </li>
            <li>bristles are too soft.</li>
            <li>My old one was worn to the handle.</li>
            <li>I have natural teeth, no dentures or partials, however, I do have an implanted tooth.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>The dental hygenist suggested one of these since I&#x27;ve had some difficulty cleaning a couple of back molars (and flossing doesn&#x27;t help that much there).  </li>
            <li>and I also use this end-tuffed brush to complete the routine.</li>
            <li>regular toothbrushes and even children&#x27;s toothbrushes give her real problems.  </li>
            <li>Even after taking extra care to clean that tooth the smell would literally come back within 10-20 minutes; it was really starting to affect my self-esteem as I didn&#x27;t want to get too close to friends/family until I got this under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase these in the future and would highly recommend them to family/friends.</li>
            <li>And the bristles really hold up for a long time</li>
            <li>I love these things - I use them after brushing with my regular toothbrush to get to the hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything that she said - small enough to get into the back of my mouth and clean areas that bigger brushes can clean properly.</li>
            <li>In order to clean them, I need this small headed toothbrush to get between the implants.  </li>
            <li>I only knew of them because my old dentist used to give them out at my cleanings, but I since have moved, and could not find them in stores.</li>
            <li>told you wind up spending as much on these as other brands simply because they&#x27;re too soft and don&#x27;t last.&lt;br</li>
            <li>odd how big the box was this shipped in but other than that, order and product are fine</li>
            <li>At first, didn&#x27;t think it would work but this little brush could reach to spots that a regular one couldn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I works very well on the back molars cleaning all the hidden surfaces.</li>

            <li> After regular brushing, this brush is good to get the plaque near the gums without damaging them.</li>
            <li> works great for getting along the gumline, since braces tend to prevent regular toothbrushes from working as well there,leaning the braces themselves, and cleaning the spaces between teeth where the wire blocks a regular toothbrush from cleaning as effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very important to my daily routine</li>
            <li> It works around crowns to keep the area around the gums clean and free of tiny particles that a toothbrush alone will not take care of.</li>
            <li> Works great for hard to reach places in mouth.</li>
            <li> I think it would be great for hard to get at places in humans too.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I can&#x27;t get my gum line clean with a regular toothbrush so after I brush with a regular toothbrush, I then brush my gum line with this brush and my gum line then feels smooth :-)</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> She was given the first one by her dentist.  </li>
            <li> This was exactly the product I wanted, at the cheapest price I could find.</li>
            <li> The only brush better for those areas was an end tufted Wisdom brush which I can no longer find.</li>
            <li> The dentist gave me the first one of these and it worked.</li>
            <li> Was able to purchase these brushes in several stores until brushes were no longer stock items.</li>
            <li> Excellent tool for cleaning difficult places in your mouth.</li>
            <li> just what i needed, as i can not get them in the uk,  thanks for the good service will use you again in the near future</li>
            <li> Bristles are too soft and they wear out quickly.  </li>
            <li> They last me about 6 months and since my bottom front teeth are overlapping, I need this brush to keep the area free of Plaque.</li>
            <li> Thanks for them</li>
            <li> I care so much of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than running all over the countryside looking for these things.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for being there.</li>
            <li> wisdom tooth started to really REEK.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps not the manufacturer&#x27;s intended purpose, but the Yorkie does not care and it makes the job much easier for both of us.</li>
            <li> This size toothbrush is absolutely a must for myself and would think for any person with dental aids.  </li>
            <li> Mine happen to be stainless steel/bottom.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> misses too much.</li>
            <li> I also use this to clean the back of my teeth, where the metal bands are placed.</li>
            <li> Have small yorkie and it fits nicely in her mouth.  </li>
            <li> Tuft was to small to be effective.  </li>
            <li> Soft, easy to fit in small places.</li>
            <li> Great product, it is hard to find locally</li>
            <li> Also very gentle on gums and recommend the brush for young and old!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> The absolute best toothbrush for getting in behind and around all of the teeth, especially the  back teeth.  </li>
            <li> Love the narrow brush handle (I had looked at the GUM tufted brush - but not crazy about the big oversized handle), that these come in 6 packs, and are affordable.  </li>
            <li> Great compliment to regular brushings, goes places regular brushes just can&#x27;t due to their size - gets around the back teeth like a charm!</li>
            <li> ordered these as a last resort before considering an extraction, which I really can&#x27;t afford this very minute</li>
            <li> purchased for a friend with a very sensitive gag reflex.</li>
            <li> Use your regular brush first, then the end-tuft, and then floss.  </li>
            <li> I seem to be having better checkups since I started using this and other such products.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I need to brush around my back teeth.</li>
            <li> but they definitely do reach the area I need to focus on whereas a normal size tooth brush doesn&#x27;t so I feel certain they will accomplish the desired result.</li>
            <li> I use them to maintain cleanliness on a special splint anchoring three front teeth to abutting teeth in lieu of a bridge or other denture.</li>
            <li> I have a pocket in my gums from oral surgery that is hard to keep clean and which could potentially cause the loss of another tooth and these end tuft brushes were recommended for keeping that are clean to prevent problems.</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning tight and hard to reach spots in between my braces.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been three days since I&#x27;ve started using this brush to clean my wisdom tooth and the odor is completely gone, all day long.  </li>
            <li> bristles are too soft.</li>
            <li> My old one was worn to the handle.</li>
            <li> I have natural teeth, no dentures or partials, however, I do have an implanted tooth.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> The dental hygenist suggested one of these since I&#x27;ve had some difficulty cleaning a couple of back molars (and flossing doesn&#x27;t help that much there).  </li>
            <li> and I also use this end-tuffed brush to complete the routine.</li>
            <li> regular toothbrushes and even children&#x27;s toothbrushes give her real problems.  </li>
            <li> Even after taking extra care to clean that tooth the smell would literally come back within 10-20 minutes; it was really starting to affect my self-esteem as I didn&#x27;t want to get too close to friends/family until I got this under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase these in the future and would highly recommend them to family/friends.</li>
            <li> And the bristles really hold up for a long time</li>
            <li> I love these things - I use them after brushing with my regular toothbrush to get to the hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything that she said - small enough to get into the back of my mouth and clean areas that bigger brushes can clean properly.</li>
            <li> In order to clean them, I need this small headed toothbrush to get between the implants.  </li>
            <li> I only knew of them because my old dentist used to give them out at my cleanings, but I since have moved, and could not find them in stores.</li>
            <li> told you wind up spending as much on these as other brands simply because they&#x27;re too soft and don&#x27;t last.&lt;br</li>
            <li> odd how big the box was this shipped in but other than that, order and product are fine</li>
            <li> At first, didn&#x27;t think it would work but this little brush could reach to spots that a regular one couldn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I works very well on the back molars cleaning all the hidden surfaces.</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier to get into small spaces to help thorough cleaning.  </li>
            <li> It should last me a long time.</li>
            <li> These brushes don&#x27;t last as long as others.  </li>
            <li> These little gum brushes are terrific and as far as I can tell, aren&#x27;t sold in stores.</li>
            <li> This is especially helpful for young kids with braces when a regular tootbrush is too big to get into small spaces.</li>
            <li> It really gets in the hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Excellent for getting into the tight places in my horrible teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely meticulous with my dental care, so you can imagine my horror when I realized my recently erupted</li>
            <li> I would recommend this not as a denture toothbrush but one that is used to dry brush the teeth.</li>
            <li> If you compare them to the \\&quot;other brand\\&quot; - you can clearly see the other brand is sharp @ the end.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does seem like a bit of an inconvenience to have two brushes for cleaning my teeth but even if I do get my wisdom tooth extracted later on down the road</li>
            <li> A few weeks later, she felt that her less-than-fresh breath was fresher in the office all day long</li>
            <li> Not brush I expected, will be returning them this week.</li>
            <li> The brush works just as I expected.</li>
            <li> you will be in big trouble.</li>
            <li> For some arcane reason, these are no available in local stores that claim to carry a wide array of oral care implements.</li>
            <li> I discovered that the ones my dentist gives me are sharp and tear up my gums.  </li>
            <li> to that small space and getting front and back sides of those teeth.</li>
            <li> I have a small jaw and a regular tooth brush</li>
            <li> Because regular tooth brush doesn&#x27;t always get the between the teeth and hard to reach bottom gums, this brush completes the cleaning.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll have to see how hard the hygienist will have to work the next time.</li>
            <li> The handle is long enough to get behind my wisdom</li>
            <li> Got the food out of hidden places.</li>
            <li> It was awkward trying to figure out how to brush with this for the first day, but now I&#x27;ve got the hang of it</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t find it gets into my tight areas as well as the GUM.  </li>
            <li> If you have tight gums</li>
            <li> Little plastic bristles that stay put and do what you would expect them to in the hands of a master oral technician.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little bit of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used at least two other makes that did not do the job as well.</li>
            <li> Apparently not good behind the very back teeth, the dentist told me as I&#x27;m brushing the gum area (ALL of it- not just around the implant area, to avoid pockets)</li>
            <li> I have issues with excessive build up on my teeth</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist got me started on this tool for getting into hard places in your teeth.  </li>
            <li> These are hard to find in the stores (not in Target, CVS, Wallgreen&#x27;s)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gets into those hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> When I get my teeth cleaned, the hygienist has to work hard in that area.</li>
            <li> He has a very small mouth.</li>
            <li> This brush head is very small.</li>
            <li> Too bad I didn&#x27;t start with these things earlier.  </li>
            <li> and I suggest everyone learn from me and not brush too hard!</li>
            <li> reaches hard  to reach places in the Mouth!</li>
            <li> They have been very hard to find</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not talking about a bout of bad breath...  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Not brush I expected, will be returning them this week.</li>
            <li> If you have hard to reach places when you&#x27;re brushing this is awesome. I got one from my dentist once and couldn&#x27;t find them at any pharmacy or dentist.</li>
            <li> bristles are too soft. I was looking for some stimulation for my gums.</li>
            <li> Since my dentist doesn&#x27;t stock these brushes, I was glad to find them on line.  Good supplement to my Sonicare.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for Oral-B end tufted toothbrushes for years. My old one was worn to the handle. It is perfect for brushing, with pressure, certain areas particularly molars. A regular toothbrush can&#x27;t do it all.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was given to me by my periodontist to brush at the gum line. I&#x27;ve had gum grafts because I&#x27;m an \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot; brusher and have caused gum recession. It&#x27;s painful oral surgery and I suggest everyone learn from me and not brush too hard! After regular brushing, this brush is good to get the plaque near the gums without damaging them.</li>
            <li> Great product, it is hard to find locally so I like ordering it from you.</li>
            <li> Bought these for wife.  She was given the first one by her dentist.  At first, didn&#x27;t think it would work but this little brush could reach to spots that a regular one couldn&#x27;t.  A few weeks later, she felt that her less-than-fresh breath was fresher in the office all day long (I&#x27;ve noticed that too).  She wanted to buy more of these special toothbrushes so she could keep it this way. But she couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in stores.  Fortunately, I found these sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Use all the time great for dental care better than picks</li>
            <li> For cleaning my teeth. I have used at least two other makes that did not do the job as well.That this is no longer available from the manufactures in this country. The only way I could get them was through AMAZON.No dislikes just the right tool for the job. Quality was excellent. As recommended by the makers.</li>
            <li> My orthodontist gave me one of these brushes, and it is WONDERFUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works great for getting along the gumline, since braces tend to prevent regular toothbrushes from working as well there,leaning the braces themselves, and cleaning the spaces between teeth where the wire blocks a regular toothbrush from cleaning as effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for anyone with braces.</li>
            <li> Excellent for getting into the tight places in my horrible teeth.</li>
            <li> These brushes work well with the permanent retainer that I have following orthodontia. They have been very hard to find and I have appreciated having them available through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> We use this toothbrush to clean our cats teeth.  It is the perfect size and works great.</li>
            <li> This was exactly the product I wanted, at the cheapest price I could find.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for those of us who don&#x27;t like to use electric brushes. I works very well on the back molars cleaning all the hidden surfaces.</li>
            <li> My dentist&#x27;s office recommended these to me. I have a pocket in my gums from oral surgery that is hard to keep clean and which could potentially cause the loss of another tooth and these end tuft brushes were recommended for keeping that are clean to prevent problems. I haven&#x27;t had a check up since I started using them so don&#x27;t know if they will achieve the desired results but they definitely do reach the area I need to focus on whereas a normal size tooth brush doesn&#x27;t so I feel certain they will accomplish the desired result.</li>
            <li> I use them because I still have my wisdom teeth, so I need a brush that can get to the very back of my mouth. It is a shame that no one knows about them. I only knew of them because my old dentist used to give them out at my cleanings, but I since have moved, and could not find them in stores.</li>
            <li> I used to get these in my dentist office, they are great for getting back teeth.  I still have one wisdom tooth left and it gets it clean</li>
            <li> I have natural teeth, no dentures or partials, however, I do have an implanted tooth.&lt;br /&gt; When the tooth was placed I was forewarned that I need to take extra care of the gum area around it.  The dentist recommended these brushes and he also did a stain test on my teeth to check how efficient I brush my teeth. Apparently not good behind the very back teeth, the dentist told me as I&#x27;m brushing the gum area (ALL of it- not just around the implant area, to avoid pockets) brush that hard-to-reach area with the tuft brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want healthy gums, no high numbers on the gum-pocket check and some awesomely clean feeling teeth, this is the brush!</li>
            <li> Great product. It really gets in the hard to reach places. Most drug stores and department stores do not carry this product, and when they do it is twice the price I paid here</li>
            <li> The brush works just as I expected. They last me about 6 months and since my bottom front teeth are overlapping, I need this brush to keep the area free of Plaque.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this tool at Walgreens or CVS.  So glad I decided to try the internet.  Found a great deal.</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning tight and hard to reach spots in between my braces. I also use this to clean the back of my teeth, where the metal bands are placed.</li>
            <li> The dental hygenist suggested one of these since I&#x27;ve had some difficulty cleaning a couple of back molars (and flossing doesn&#x27;t help that much there).  She had given me a similar product by GUM.  The GUM brush works better for me.  The bristles are nestled closer together, vs. the Oral-B&#x27;s being set in rows that are parallel.  The GUM tapers all the brush tufts to one pointed area.  Althought the Oral-B works, I don&#x27;t find it gets into my tight areas as well as the GUM.  Will be buying GUM in the future.</li>
            <li> These little gum brushes are terrific and as far as I can tell, aren&#x27;t sold in stores. Thanks for them</li>
            <li> these brushes are great for getting in those hard spots to clean out and massage the gums love them bought them on auto ship</li>
            <li> I love these things - I use them after brushing with my regular toothbrush to get to the hard to reach areas.  Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I care so much of my teeth. I floss, I brush and I also use this end-tuffed brush to complete the routine. this brush is so useful for crowns, implants, etc. Because regular tooth brush doesn&#x27;t always get the between the teeth and hard to reach bottom gums, this brush completes the cleaning.</li>
            <li> just what i needed, as i can not get them in the uk,  thanks for the good service will use you again in the near future</li>
            <li> I got the product quickly and will use them for quite awhile.  Much cheaper than running all over the countryside looking for these things.  Thanks for being there.</li>
            <li> These mini toothbrushes are amazing for cleaning the gum line. For some reason, I can&#x27;t get my gum line clean with a regular toothbrush so after I brush with a regular toothbrush, I then brush my gum line with this brush and my gum line then feels smooth :-)</li>
            <li> Great tool for getting food crumbs your regular brush misses.  Have used the end-tufted brush for years- does truly make a difference in the Dentist&#x27;s office visits.  Use your regular brush first, then the end-tuft, and then floss.  Works beautifully!</li>
            <li> Great for tiny dogs teeth!</li>
            <li> These are wonderful to help brush and clean my teacup maltese dog teeth. Training him to let me do it was a challenge but it worked. He has a very small mouth. This brush head is very small. I have several tooth brush in one package. It should last me a long time.</li>
            <li> purchased for a friend with a very sensitive gag reflex. regular toothbrushes and even children&#x27;s toothbrushes give her real problems.  These brushes solved that problem.</li>
            <li> Tried to buy these in the UK but they don&#x27;t seem to be available anymore, have used other brands but not as good as these. Even after postage costs and currency conversion still cheaper than when i could get them here! Excellent!</li>
            <li> Use this product all the time. Works great for hard to reach places in mouth.</li>
            <li> Nice size.  Have small yorkie and it fits nicely in her mouth.  I think it would be great for hard to get at places in humans too.</li>
            <li> I have used this product a number of years and it meets my needs.  Very good for cleaning the back side of teeth and back gums.  The only brush better for those areas was an end tufted Wisdom brush which I can no longer find.</li>
            <li> The dentist gave me the first one of these and it worked. I have not had sore gums since I started using it.</li>
            <li> very important to my daily routine</li>
            <li> I cannot find these anywhere locally.  My dental hygenist got me started on this tool for getting into hard places in your teeth.  This works.  My gums have improved at my check-ups so it is well worth using every day!</li>
            <li> The bristles on this Oral-B End-Tufted are a lot softer than others brand I have tried but still do an excellent job cleaning between teeth and gum line.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants more than just white teeth but also healthy gums</li>
            <li> very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so grateful to have found this toothbrush!  I&#x27;m extremely meticulous with my dental care, so you can imagine my horror when I realized my recently erupted wisdom tooth started to really REEK.  I&#x27;m not talking about a bout of bad breath...  When YOU can smell the offensive odor yourself, that ain&#x27;t good.  Even after taking extra care to clean that tooth the smell would literally come back within 10-20 minutes; it was really starting to affect my self-esteem as I didn&#x27;t want to get too close to friends/family until I got this under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these as a last resort before considering an extraction, which I really can&#x27;t afford this very minute and I am so, so, soooo happy.  It&#x27;s only been three days since I&#x27;ve started using this brush to clean my wisdom tooth and the odor is completely gone, all day long.  It was awkward trying to figure out how to brush with this for the first day, but now I&#x27;ve got the hang of it, it&#x27;s super easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does seem like a bit of an inconvenience to have two brushes for cleaning my teeth but even if I do get my wisdom tooth extracted later on down the road, I think I will continue to use these brushes as part of my regular routine.  I like the way they reach around my back molars and I like that it can reach spots that my regular brush simply can&#x27;t.  Love the narrow brush handle (I had looked at the GUM tufted brush - but not crazy about the big oversized handle), that these come in 6 packs, and are affordable.  I will continue to purchase these in the future and would highly recommend them to family/friends.</li>
            <li> Way prefer the Butler Gum end tuft.  These feel flimsy.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended the toothbrush to reach the molars-&lt;br /&gt;reaches where a regular toothbrush cannot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would recommend and will order more.</li>
            <li> This product is very useful in cleaning my dental partials.</li>
            <li> odd how big the box was this shipped in but other than that, order and product are fine</li>
            <li> Was able to purchase these brushes in several stores until brushes were no longer stock items. I use these brushes as&lt;br /&gt;I have had dental restoration work done such as caps and bridges. The brush is great to use areas in your mouth around&lt;br /&gt;teeth and dental work where a regular toothbrush presents a problem. Good value and price. As my dentist advised me&lt;br /&gt;if you don&#x27;t keep the areas clean around the caps and bridges you will be in big trouble. PS. Flossing is a must also!!!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product</li>
            <li> I find these both economical and very useful.</li>
            <li> Great product for cleaning along the gumline, to prevent gingivitis. This is especially helpful for young kids with braces when a regular tootbrush is too big to get into small spaces.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find in the stores (not in Target, CVS, Wallgreen&#x27;s)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for getting between the teeth (Interdental).</li>
            <li> I discovered that the ones my dentist gives me are sharp and tear up my gums.  However, I remembered that I liked these \\&quot;end tufted\\&quot; brushes and ordered some.  YES, these are softer and give a good massage to the gums.  If you compare them to the \\&quot;other brand\\&quot; - you can clearly see the other brand is sharp @ the end.  The Oral-B are designed quite well, rounded and soft and perfect for your gums.</li>
            <li> It gets into those hard to reach places.  I seem to be having better checkups since I started using this and other such products.  Too bad I didn&#x27;t start with these things earlier.  I might have saved a lot of money on dental bills.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my mouth. Soft, easy to fit in small places. Got the food out of hidden places. Solid purchase. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these.</li>
            <li> My hygienist recommended this product.  I have issues with excessive build up on my teeth and she recommended that I get this brush.  It&#x27;s everything that she said - small enough to get into the back of my mouth and clean areas that bigger brushes can clean properly.</li>
            <li> Periodontist recommended these toothbrushes to me. They are good for focusing on particular neglected areas of your teeth.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, which my periodontist recommended for reaching upper molars.  Great for getting&lt;br /&gt;in to that small space and getting front and back sides of those teeth.</li>
            <li> The handle is long enough to get behind my wisdom teeth so I can remove those hard-to-reach food particles. And the bristles really hold up for a long time</li>
            <li> I like the tufted Braun ones better</li>
            <li> Great product. I have used this for years.  It works around crowns to keep the area around the gums clean and free of tiny particles that a toothbrush alone will not take care of.</li>
            <li> Great product; can find on Amazon only</li>
            <li> I use the Oral-B-Tufted Toothbrush daily before regular brushing with my regular toothbrush.  It works beautifully around crowns is a wonderful way to assure minimal plaque on all teeth.  I would recommend it to everyone even if they do not have crowns</li>
            <li> The oral B Tufted denture toothbrushes, all 3 pckages arrived in very good comndition and I was satisfied with them</li>
            <li> The lady who cleans my teeth started me on this toothbrush. I love it because it helps to really clean my teeth. I would recommend this not as a denture toothbrush but one that is used to dry brush the teeth. It works.</li>
            <li> Last visit to my dentist, I asked the hygienist about a toothbrush for my 6.7 pound Yorkshire Terrier; she gave me one of these brushes.  It is the absolute best brush for him I have found.  Can get all the way to his back teeth with no problem at all.  Perhaps not the manufacturer&#x27;s intended purpose, but the Yorkie does not care and it makes the job much easier for both of us.</li>
            <li> This size toothbrush is absolutely a must for myself and would think for any person with dental aids.  Mine happen to be stainless steel/bottom.  It makes it so much easier to get into small spaces to help thorough cleaning.  Have ordered from another supplier which now tells me they no longer are available.  Was so fortunate to find thru Amazon.com and will continue to place my orders with a company that takes care of customers.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Excellent tool for cleaning difficult places in your mouth. I use them to maintain cleanliness on a special splint anchoring three front teeth to abutting teeth in lieu of a bridge or other denture. Does a great job. My wife uses them on her (problem) teeth anad as a gum-stimulator. Both of us have been commended by our dentists for our oral care. For some arcane reason, these are no available in local stores that claim to carry a wide array of oral care implements. Moreover, repeated attempts to have RiteAid order and stock them have been in vain -- some mumbo jumbo about corporate stocking policies.</li>
            <li> This brush is very good at brushing back teeth. It is very important for preventing gingivitis in those area and to keep good hygiene</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I need to brush around my back teeth. I have a small jaw and a regular tooth brush misses too much. I got the shipment very quickly. Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> Tuft was to small to be effective.  Ordered in error, threw away, and re-ordered the brand I like 100% better.</li>
            <li> Great compliment to regular brushings, goes places regular brushes just can&#x27;t due to their size - gets around the back teeth like a charm!</li>
            <li> The teeth in my lower jaw are quite crowded together along the front, and tartar buildup becomes a problem. When I get my teeth cleaned, the hygienist has to work hard in that area. I saw this brush and decided to give it a try. It gets where the regular tooth brushes can&#x27;t. We&#x27;ll have to see how hard the hygienist will have to work the next time.</li>
            <li> 1st class product and service</li>
            <li> I have dental implants that have almost 1/2 inch of tungsten post exposed.  In order to clean them, I need this small headed toothbrush to get between the implants.  Prior to these, I bought regular toothbrushes, trimmed the head and heated them to bend the shaft to get into my mouth.  These I only have to heat and bend.  The bristles are trimmed perfectly.</li>
            <li> reaches hard  to reach places in the Mouth! Great! I would recommend It to Everyone! My Dentist Recommended It Beause She Uses It  Too!</li>
            <li> great for my small dogs teeth.</li>
            <li> I just had a dentist visit. She praised me how I maintain teeth in good clean condition. It can reach the area that normal tooth brush can&#x27;t easily get to. I would recommend this product. Now my whole family use this and enjoy.</li>
            <li> These work great for tiny dog tooth brushing</li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t. Little plastic bristles that stay put and do what you would expect them to in the hands of a master oral technician.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Tufted - The absolute best toothbrush for getting in behind and around all of the teeth, especially the  back teeth.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. A must have for thorough dental care at home. I can&#x27;t go anywhere without having this toothbrush with me!</li>
            <li> These brushes don&#x27;t last as long as others.  Bristles are too soft and they wear out quickly.  They&#x27;re also not as easy to use in that they don&#x27;t seem to get up under the gum line as effectively because they are so soft.  If you have tight gums it&#x27;s a little bit of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told you wind up spending as much on these as other brands simply because they&#x27;re too soft and don&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t hate them but they&#x27;re not the best.  I might buy again.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using these for a while and they get the job done between his teeth that are not aligned right.</li>
            <li> Use the brush everyday and is especially good for brushing between implants.  Also very gentle on gums and recommend the brush for young and old!</li>
            <li> Great product....works well.</li>
