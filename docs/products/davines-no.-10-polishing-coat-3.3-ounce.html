            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is nice for a lighter hold and if you want to create some shine, or as they call it, polish.</li>
            <li>Great product, smells terrific and holds wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>I have a 50/50 rule with hair products of any kind: they must work well, and I must love the way they smell.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t quite as waxy as pomade, but it does a good job of giving hair some light hold.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair look and feel so smooth and calms the frizz!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have tried many)</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I so love this product, and I know that Davines has discontinued it -</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s also nice is that you can re-wet your hair the next day and reactivate the product to give you a continued light hold.</li>
            <li>I love Davines Polishing Coat, I have really short fine hair</li>
            <li>It works like a dream!&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>WILL give a good soft hold to naturally wavy hair without leaving a tacky residue.</li>
            <li>The 20$ price is COMPLETELY worth it.  </li>
            <li>My favorite hair product for years now, and Ive tried many other products.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First tried this product at my salon then immediately bought it here on amazon...  </li>
            <li>This Amazon retailer delivered it FAST, too!</li>
            <li>Great for finish work on long, short or in-between length hair.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much or you will end up washing hair again!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before and loved it, but the latest ones I&#x27;ve ordered (3 in total because I kept having to send them back) have clearly all been old and well passed their prime.  </li>
            <li>, it gives hair some movement and shape depending how much one uses.</li>
            <li>The product smelled off and didn&#x27;t really work, plus two of the containers had corroded into the product.  </li>
            <li>and I share it with my boyfriend who uses it to manage light frizz on his very short cut.</li>
            <li>Light never heavy on my hair but allows me to style my hair and it stays put all while remaining soft to touch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to use this, but I really do have to find a new product.</li>
            <li>Less is more here.</li>
            <li>OK, this stuff smells amazing and a little goes a long long way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terribly waxy but leaves your hair shiny and with a little hold.  </li>
            <li>Tames the fly-aways without weighing down my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Did not like on straight or big wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>whether I wear it naturally curlly or straighten.  </li>
            <li>I have a pixie cut and this product will NOT hold a nice slicked down look on the long or short side of my hair -</li>

            <li> Only negative is the packaging, the lid goes on wonky and will scrape some of the paint into the product - not annoying or gross enough to remove a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This little tin of magic gives my baby-fine, plantinum-bleached definition without weighing it down, and a subtle amount of shine.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.  </li>

            <li> The last time I ordered it, the cap didn&#x27;t fit properly and eventually got funky and rusted (annoying, but not a huge deal).</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount</li>
            <li> The only cons are that it smells like cotton candy which can be a little cloying and doesn&#x27;t mix well with other fragrances, and it can be a little heavy in your hair if not used sparingly.</li>
            <li> That said, I was hoping that the earlier reviews saying the product they received was past its prime, off color, and off smell were not true, but that was the case with mine too.</li>
            <li> Smooths my unruly thick coarse curls.</li>
            <li> Polishes, shines, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> A little dab will do ya.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser used this on my short,fine,streight and going gray hair, it give&#x27;s it a little shine</li>
            <li> A little goes along way</li>
            <li> that gives my hair texture, withouth weighing it down!</li>
            <li> This time, there&#x27;s dried gunk all around the container</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a few years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this texturizer for a few years now and like the way it texturizes</li>
            <li> It was heavy and made my ends look greasy.</li>
            <li> but mostly it&#x27;s not weighing it down</li>
            <li> I will be seriously upset if this product is ever discontinued.</li>
            <li> Hard to figure out this product!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Davines no longer makes this product.  </li>
            <li> i just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so desperate since they stopped making it!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. The last time I ordered it, the cap didn&#x27;t fit properly and eventually got funky and rusted (annoying, but not a huge deal). This time, there&#x27;s dried gunk all around the container and what looks like rusty bits inside the produc (upon arrival). It&#x27;s disgusting. For the money, I&#x27;ll be looking for a different hair product.</li>
            <li> Great product but the container was dented.</li>
            <li> OK, this stuff smells amazing and a little goes a long long way. It works like a dream!&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love this.  A little dab will do ya.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair look and feel so smooth and calms the frizz!  It&#x27;s now something I will always have on hand!</li>
            <li> My hairstylist turned me on to Davine&#x27;s line of products.  I have a 50/50 rule with hair products of any kind: they must work well, and I must love the way they smell. This little tin of magic gives my baby-fine, plantinum-bleached definition without weighing it down, and a subtle amount of shine. A little goes a long way. And it smells like cake! I will be seriously upset if this product is ever discontinued.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser used this on my short,fine,streight and going gray hair, it give&#x27;s it a little shine but mostly it&#x27;s not weighing it down, it gives hair some movement and shape depending how much one uses. Like the product.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a few years. Does best job smoothing out hair and smells good, too.  Love it, but was too expensive at salon. Buying online saved me money. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been using this texturizer for a few years now and like the way it texturizes (piecey look) yet provides nice shine so hair doesn&#x27;t look dirty.  You only need a small amount so it lasts a long time.  Unfortunately Davines no longer makes this product.  Since I can no longer get it at the salon I go to I was happy to be able to get it through Amazon.  It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Ah! It&#x27;s ok... Hard to figure out this product! Still have to try to use on my waves to see if it helps to separate.  Did not like on straight or big wavy hair.  It was heavy and made my ends look greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Light never heavy on my hair but allows me to style my hair and it stays put all while remaining soft to touch. The local salon I had been buying from said they could no longer order and carry in stock. Soooo happy to be able to buy through Amazon!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terribly waxy but leaves your hair shiny and with a little hold.  I started using it initially, but now I have to keep a stockpile for the wife as well.</li>
            <li> Just like the description says. Great stuff. Polishes, shines, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. Love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;A must have for long hair - don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s heavy enough for short hair.</li>
            <li> adds fullness, shine, and makes my hair &amp;#34;piece-y.&amp;#34; i just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. i used to use bedhead&#x27;s manipulator but it&#x27;s formula has changed. i will go back to it if it is ever improved.</li>
            <li> I believe this product is for a different texture hair.  it has not given me the same results other products do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and loved it, but the latest ones I&#x27;ve ordered (3 in total because I kept having to send them back) have clearly all been old and well passed their prime.  The product smelled off and didn&#x27;t really work, plus two of the containers had corroded into the product.  There must be something going on with their manufacturer, so beware!</li>
            <li> Excellent product....have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product for years now, and Ive tried many other products.  Smooths my unruly thick coarse curls. Try it! Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Great control for my curly hair whether I wear it naturally curlly or straighten.  Doesn&#x27;t look greasy.  Gives good shine.</li>
            <li> I love Davines Polishing Coat, I have really short fine hair and it is the only product (and I have tried many) that gives my hair texture, withouth weighing it down!</li>
            <li> Only negative is the packaging, the lid goes on wonky and will scrape some of the paint into the product - not annoying or gross enough to remove a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is nice for a lighter hold and if you want to create some shine, or as they call it, polish. I have a pixie cut and this product will NOT hold a nice slicked down look on the long or short side of my hair - for that you&#x27;ll need something stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This WILL give a good soft hold to naturally wavy hair without leaving a tacky residue. What&#x27;s also nice is that you can re-wet your hair the next day and reactivate the product to give you a continued light hold. This is my second can of this product and I share it with my boyfriend who uses it to manage light frizz on his very short cut.</li>
            <li> First tried this product at my salon then immediately bought it here on amazon...  The 20$ price is COMPLETELY worth it.  Love this product!!! LOVE!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the list of chemicals and the smell is very strong and artificial.</li>

            <li> Best hair coat ever. I&#x27;ve been so desperate since they stopped making it!</li>
            <li> Tames the fly-aways without weighing down my fine hair.  Love the scent!!  I&#x27;ve been using for years and am very happy.  This Amazon retailer delivered it FAST, too!</li>
            <li> Great product- add&#x27;s texture and shine! A little goes along way, my last container lasted me over a year. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> Great for finish work on long, short or in-between length hair.  Just don&#x27;t use too much or you will end up washing hair again!</li>
            <li> The container corroded into the product.  It didn&#x27;t smell or feel as it should.  Disgusting.</li>
            <li> Great product, smells terrific and holds wonderfully.  Put it on dry hair though. I am about to order another jar.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t quite as waxy as pomade, but it does a good job of giving hair some light hold. The only cons are that it smells like cotton candy which can be a little cloying and doesn&#x27;t mix well with other fragrances, and it can be a little heavy in your hair if not used sparingly. Less is more here.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  I have short hair and I&#x27;m fussy about putting product on my hair, but this product does the job.  It gives your hair the hold you need without being sticky or flaky.</li>
            <li> I so love this product, and I know that Davines has discontinued it - why, I&#x27;ll never know... That said, I was hoping that the earlier reviews saying the product they received was past its prime, off color, and off smell were not true, but that was the case with mine too. The container was a bit corroded as well. Such a bummer. I&#x27;m going to use this, but I really do have to find a new product. I&#x27;ll gladly take suggestions if anyone who loved this product has found something equally effective!</li>
