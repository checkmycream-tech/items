            <li>It is a bit greasy to be honest, but it makes a great pomade for guys and conditions your hair and makes it super soft.</li>
            <li>Large volume of product for the price paid - good bargain.  </li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, the texture is amazing melts easily and not hard but more pasty.</li>

            <li>Just got it and so far works great.</li>
            <li>when its chopped and weight its more precise and 2.</li>
            <li>Great natural product.</li>

            <li>, it is perfect for babies since its pure and natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: feels great on your skin and doesn&#x27;t smell unpleasant on its own, but maybe not the best choice if using in a project.</li>
            <li>you are looking for an easy &amp;#34;butter creme&amp;#34; for hand and foot creme, shea butter works well.  </li>
            <li>It mixes easily with the oils I use with it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this product at such a great price.</li>
            <li>melts easily and blends with whatever I add to it</li>
            <li>Smell doesn&#x27;t linger once applied and melts easily when rubbed between palms.</li>
            <li>and I got this as an ingredient, but the smell is so strong that you can&#x27;t even cover it up at all.</li>
            <li>It also had a fairly strong odor.  </li>
            <li>strong overbearing smell&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>Some review says the smell is strong but to me it doesnt.</li>
            <li>The smell was pleasant and although solid in the tub, the shea butter spread very easily after it came in contact with the warmth of my hand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure Shea butter very smooth and it works wonders for your skin and hair!</li>
            <li>Love this shea butter, it adds that something special to my soap.</li>
            <li>I use it on my stretchmarks, they are not gone but they are lightening and becoming smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a pretty nice size container for the price.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still more than halfway full.</li>
            <li>That works fine, but I don&#x27;t always feel like doing that.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fine</li>
            <li>I recvd this and the box it came in was fine.</li>
            <li>everything was fine,  </li>
            <li>Works fine</li>
            <li>so I am perfectly fine with this too.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t strong and the shea butter is smooth.  </li>
            <li>I also researched many places and decided to buy from this seller as the product seemed correct and the packaging adequate.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping!</li>
            <li>and it was fine, again the product was good but the service was less than good</li>
            <li>new seasons and whole foods sell like 1 oz to 8 oz of this for $22 and this is just as good for 32 oz of $11!</li>
            <li>I especially love how soft my natural hair feels after using the Shea Butter to seal.  </li>
            <li>This came in a huge block.</li>
            <li>I can feel a huge difference in my skin using this product.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product.</li>
            <li>Those who melt it and pour it gets a smooth surface.</li>
            <li>But anyways ,I was looking for something smooth to arrive.</li>
            <li>My husband and son use it also, and we can&#x27;t say enough about how great it is.</li>
            <li>Exspecially if you want to acheive a even and smooth skin tone.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I also will be using it for skin purposes, as it makes your skin smooth and moisturised.  </li>
            <li>this is important.</li>
            <li>It blends well and is quite smooth.  </li>
            <li>For the price this stuff is a great bargain and I will definitely buy from them again!!</li>
            <li>Great texture and color, definitely legit Shea butter.</li>
            <li>it was so smooth no grainy feel too it at all.</li>
            <li>Grainy onced scooped out of the container but once rubbed in,very smooth consistency and absorbs in the skin so well.</li>
            <li>It is a great facial cream and friends</li>
            <li>My skin feels baby butt smooth</li>
            <li>The lid didn&#x27;t even fit the tub.</li>
            <li>The quality and quantity made this a great deal for the low price.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; shea butter products, and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve come</li>
            <li>Im not a fan of greasy products or the smell of the shea butter even though there are such great reviews on the product.</li>
            <li>The tub is filled to the rim and the butter is moist and melts when you rub it between you hands.  </li>
            <li>and it was well packed in packing peanuts and seemed secure</li>
            <li>have bought shea butter before for THREE TIMES as much money and am more satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>fast delivery  !!!</li>
            <li>And, again, the rancid smell was very distinct.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and was exactly like seen on website.</li>
            <li>best raw shea butter I have bought on amazon</li>
            <li>This has a strong buttery, nutty scent which does not seem overwhelming on its own, but overpowered the essential oils I added to it.</li>
            <li>quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Glad that I could fine pure Shea Butter online.  </li>
            <li>Upon opening the box I could immediately smell the rich scent of the Shea butter.</li>
            <li>so it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the container and very pleased with the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li>I was already familiar with Shea butter and all its wonder.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>It keeps it all fresh when I am not working with it.&lt;br /&gt;thanks!</li>
            <li>have said it is better then the higher priced cosmetic creams they were using.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try the Ivory</li>
            <li>I was so excited about getting this and using it.</li>
            <li>Great product for dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li>It also works great to smooth out rough feet.</li>
            <li>Seam fairly clean.</li>
            <li>Now with that I said I have order this product of shea butter (2 of them) and was all excited to receive them, as I am a person of making my own hair products and am natural!</li>
            <li>I may order more be it that I am a shea butter fanatic,this is by far my favorite one out of the bunch that I have tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and has no odor.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin, lasts all winter.</li>
            <li>The granulation is a real downer esp when you are expecting a very smooth buttery cream for your self indulgence.</li>
            <li>if your going to do business then do your business right as a seller!</li>
            <li>To my joyful surprise, it melts right in my hand!</li>
            <li>It is high quality and easy to use in my balms!</li>
            <li>My inexperienced opinion is that this is probably great quality, but I was not prepared for some of the differences between refined/unrefined.</li>
            <li>Myself and my daughters are all fair skined and need extra moisture.</li>
            <li>I really like it and will purchase again :-)</li>
            <li>The shipper was able to have product shipped within a reasonable timeframe</li>
            <li>I will be ordering two order this week because I love this stuff so much.</li>
            <li>Shea butter stays on my skin so much better than coconut oil and is also very healing.</li>
            <li>Returning for a full refund.</li>
            <li>Odor is good and last for a year+.</li>
            <li>and I love it, my hair really takes to it.</li>
            <li>You need good quality essential oils to minimize it.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>its still the same stuff and works just as good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m letting it cool in the fridge, but</li>
            <li>The color of the shea butter I received gives me confidence that it is true, unrefined shea butter</li>
            <li>and I am still able to use it without having the hassle of returning it and going through that whole deal.</li>
            <li>The perfect solution for my 5yr old&#x27;s eczema and my severly dry skin....</li>
            <li>I love the consistency of this Shea Butter, it&#x27;s soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>I was a little leery after reading about the smell of unrefined shea butter, but I like the mild nutty aroma, and the soap I made from it smells good even without adding fragrances!</li>
            <li>Had a strong smoky odor when first opened but it dissipated fairly quickly when applied and an earthy fragrance remained.  </li>
            <li>I used it to make a shaving cream (heated it with other things, then refrigerated it and whipped with mixer) and it worked great.</li>
            <li>This seems like a good shea butter-smells good and feels good, but I was really disappointed that it came in a bag not a carton.</li>
            <li>Made a wonderful whip with coconut oil (solid) and almond oil....then going to add essential oils to make &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; creams!</li>
            <li>Quick service from the seller.</li>
            <li>There is A mild smell of Shea.</li>
            <li>It melts on your skin fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I used to use vaseline on his skin, but he still had a mild case of exzema.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s chunky; you just have to pick up a chunk and rub it in your hands for it to quickly melt.  </li>
            <li>Super value for the price.</li>
            <li>It also quickly absorbs in your skin.</li>
            <li>My skin has seen a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li>Mild scent.</li>
            <li>Appreciate the quality of the butter and quick shipment.  </li>
            <li>The order came quick</li>
            <li>Luckily it was plastic because if it were glass, I would have cut myself on all of the pieces that I had to take out of the butter.</li>
            <li>Received quickly.</li>
            <li>It smells mildly of Play-Doh or crayon.</li>
            <li>This Shea butter is the best quality compared to more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with the high quality product.</li>
            <li>It has cleared up my dark spots a great deal</li>
            <li>The sides have developed significant cracks and the top has just come apart in my hands as I opened it.</li>
            <li>one day later I experienced the most healing I&#x27;ve seen in the last months...</li>
            <li>The product is grainy when you first pull some out, but it immediately melted with my body heat and was amazingly smooth.</li>
            <li>Very creamy, clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Can be mixed with all the wonderful essential oils that you love and still be completely natural.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily as a full body lotion as is and love how soft my skin is (eve my heals).</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for making quality home beauty products!</li>
            <li>I have used many different Shea butters in the past and this is excellent.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>I put it in my hair and absolutely love how soft it feels!</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona where maintaining smooth, hydrated skin is a huge challenge.</li>
            <li>Mine arrived in a heavy-duty sealed bag with a &amp;#34;ziplock&amp;#34; closure in crumbled pieces, I am able to easily get the amount I need without having to cut hunks off a big block.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this product, it is very smooth and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The Shea butter is very grainy, and it is supposed to be smooth.  </li>
            <li>It is very creamy and it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I can see a reduction in the lines around my eyes and my skin feels soft and more elastic.  </li>
            <li>It is so nice not having to do anything but whip the butter and add my essential oils!  </li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>Economical through this resource.</li>
            <li>Fresh and well sealed.</li>
            <li>I just transferred it to another container, the product seems to be ok and not dried out.</li>
            <li>No disappointment with it in any of the areas.</li>
            <li>Still fresh.</li>
            <li>I prefer the white shea butter for making body butter in fragrances like rose and lavender.  </li>
            <li>The yellow just doesn&#x27;t look as nice.  </li>
            <li>You can whip some up, put it into a container and add a few drops of your favorite scented oil for a nice body cream.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a more natural way to take care of my hands.</li>
            <li>Soft and creamy, and Light!</li>
            <li>I love it for my natural hair products</li>
            <li>I actually love the nutty natural smell.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this real soon and will continue to buy at this reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The color is an ivory color rather than the yellow kind...</li>
            <li>I rarely give 5 stars to anything.</li>
            <li>it is worth it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>This is real Ivory Shea Butter and very well packed!!!</li>
            <li>It breaks down and easily rinses off with warm water.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best batch of raw, unrefined, ivory Shea Butter that I have ever purchased online.</li>
            <li>Good butter, I used it to make body butter by mixing with other oils.</li>
            <li>3.18.15 - I made hot processed soap for the very first time yesterday</li>
            <li>This stuff is awsome and priced right.</li>
            <li>We use it for after-sport muscle rubs, and it does the job at the right price for us.</li>
            <li>we use it to make soap, it works, and the price is right</li>
            <li>It was in a gigantic tub with chunks (that&#x27;s right CHUNKS) of shea butter.</li>
            <li>to use right out of the jar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is creamy and melts right in your hands.</li>
            <li>I live in Michigan and it got here very quickly.</li>
            <li>I used this many times a day for 3 weeks and still have almost a full container left.</li>
            <li>Smooth as always with all the products I buy from this particular name.</li>
            <li>very large container.  </li>
            <li>It did have a light fragrance, but it was easily covered with essential oil.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so impressed with their shea butter, that I am going to try out their african black soap.</li>
            <li>When I opened the box and saw the huge 32 oz container filled with shea a big smile appeared on my face.</li>
            <li>There is also a fair amount of dark grit (I&#x27;m assuming pieces of shell) throughout the butter which then ended up settling at the bottom of my lotion</li>
            <li>Very nice organic raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li>I was already using oils on my hair and skin, but the addition of the shea butter has certainly made both my hair and skin more moist, supple, and soft.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve had it melt right on my fingertip) and leaves it feeling very moist and nourished!</li>
            <li>I have used regular Shea Butter before but this one is so much easier to use, nice &amp; creamy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and is easily removable form the container.</li>
            <li>Great price, but definitely going to order from somewhere else next time.</li>
            <li>This shea butter had an almost brown color,  and the smell was so strong I nearly gagged.  </li>
            <li>Great product and the size will last several months.  </li>
            <li>I mix the shea butter with various oils and it makes a great after wash moisturizer as well as a daily moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li>this is a nice portion that will last a long time and the shipping time was okay.</li>
            <li>When I weighed it on a very accurate chemical scale, noticed only 28.6 ounces and not 32.</li>
            <li>It arrived very fast (2 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>very light scent prior to putting on the skin.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>It smelled good, like fresh raw shea butter.  </li>
            <li>good, wish was a little cheaper though or gave wholesale deals.</li>
            <li>It works better than just lotion for super dry skin</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This variety, this product from this seller, is much better than the yellow variety of shea butter or Kpang.</li>
            <li>I would think they would be willing to accommodate a customer if they are asking to place additional orders.</li>
            <li>I would also think it would melt and be more solidly &amp;#34;packed&amp;#34; in the container, instead of looking &amp;#34;hand</li>
            <li>Will be ordering again very soon!</li>
            <li>Recommending it to all who are interested to try it.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve worked with this product.  </li>
            <li>we first thought that it shouldn&#x27;t come in clumps in the container</li>
            <li>it is not even funny.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t exactly what I thought I was getting.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ordered from this company.</li>
            <li>Exactly what it says...</li>
            <li>the chucks and make sure I didnt see any hairs or such and its fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>when my shea butter arrived, it was exactly what is shown in the picture and as described.</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased, as some cocoa butter I ordered from another seller fell short on ounces (and was listed by weight, so</li>
            <li>so it was exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>This Shea butter cleared it up pretty well.</li>
            <li>She did break out though when I first applied it to her chest and nose area.</li>
            <li>I also use it for my 3yr old son-for his light case of ezcema...</li>
            <li>I boiled it first</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted to make deodorant with.</li>
            <li>Might be ok for someone else&#x27;s basic use, just didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li>Thanks for helping take care of my winter skin!</li>
            <li>One time a plastic tub and the most recent a plastic</li>
            <li>It smells funky and doesn&#x27;t last more than about an hour.</li>
            <li>Make sure you aren&#x27;t allergic, obviously.</li>
            <li>All around this has many uses and I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>Will be using more in the future.</li>
            <li>And I found the shea butter to be very moisturizing and hydrating!</li>
            <li>so I was pretty pissed about that</li>
            <li>I purchased the 32 oz amount and you can tell us higher quality.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for holding up to your description!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s soft and smooth on my skin</li>
            <li>I put it on, I can never seem to stop ;)</li>
            <li>I love ivory African shea butter better then the yellow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently experimenting with a copy cat recipe of a deodorant I love...</li>
            <li>This was my first time ordering or using Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>so Ive only used it as an ingredient for lip balm, but I have more plans for using Shea butter.</li>
            <li>I most definitely would recommend it to anyone in the Shea Butter users community!</li>
            <li>My first order wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;Ivory&amp;#34; though.</li>
            <li>No worries, it was my first order</li>
            <li>then when i opened it to smell (im from Africa and know exactly what she butter smells like, and looks like)</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing shea butter, but from everything I&#x27;ve researched about shea butter (I researched for months before I decided to make a purchase), the shea butter sent to me by the currently-listed seller, smellgood, is the real deal!</li>
            <li>What I received is exactly what is pictured in the product listing&#x27;s picture.</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase more when I run out.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the ivory and there is a difference.</li>
            <li>I will buy more shea butter from another seller.&lt;br /&gt;The 5 stars are for the shea butter ONLY!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered it twice now and both times I received it quickly, it was packaged very well, had a wonderful faint scent and works very well in my homemade lotions.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is very greasy but it also tones my skin nicely and eliminates dry skin.</li>
            <li>texture of the butter is very grainy in its natural state, but it melts very quickly when it comes in contact with skin</li>
            <li>I most certainly sent it back since it was RANCID</li>
            <li>I like to mix it with other ingredients to make a nice moisturizing cream.   </li>
            <li>This shea butter is great for keeping rough, scaly skin at bay, and helps blend in pasty white sunscreen so that it&#x27;s unnoticeable.</li>
            <li>It is ivory as stated because I really didn&#x27;t want the yellow one, Ivory shea butter is always better.</li>
            <li>item pure and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>my guess is that if it has been stored in a hot place, either in Africa or here in the US, it could very well turn rancid.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ever bought shea butter, but I have a feeling this may not be real shea.</li>
            <li>Long lasting&lt;br /&gt;and could not ask for more.</li>
            <li>but when you first put it on it may be a bit shiny or greasy if you use too much</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take long for my order to come in, I love this shea butter, it has a nutty smell and is grainy, rubs in my skin with no problems.</li>
            <li>The Shea butter I received was not ivory, but the same regular, yellow kind you can find at most beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li>pretty much the whole body..</li>
            <li>But I use it anyway, and just like some reviewers say its soft and melts quickly into your hand at room temperature..</li>
            <li>butter has a somewhat strong nutty smell, its different.</li>
            <li>, i.e. it was very old, not at all fresh.</li>
            <li>When I received my product, I noticed that there was a large hole on the side of the container.</li>
            <li>I like how the skin become after using pure Shia butter</li>
            <li>pure shea</li>
            <li>Needless to say the person reply right back (for that great on answering me back) and said \\&quot;you have a good point.</li>
            <li>Also, the container has a large crack across the bottom.</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t use too much it soaks completely in to your skin and it feels amazing.</li>
            <li>Super soft and absorbs well..would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Packaging is very plain but who cares since the price is so good.  </li>
            <li>This way I get the pure butter and can use as much as I want to get the effect that i want.</li>
            <li>In fact, better, as some people complained, but I find it just fine.  </li>
            <li>am I just supposed to leave a huge plastic bag of what looks like lard on my bathroom counter next to my tooth brush??</li>
            <li>, it is natural works on contact for soft and smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li>Rubbing it in my palms heats it up enough to go on smooth.  </li>
            <li>It REALLY softens my skin.</li>
            <li>Water repellant, but very greasy.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>so is it really 32oz</li>
            <li>Since I have been using this my skin is much softer and creamier.</li>
            <li>i cracked the side so be gentle.</li>
            <li>Now even those there is no way of knowing if the product is 100% real quality, until you get in your hands you have to trust the seller response and loyalty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The picture shows smooth and solid consistency when I opened it up</li>
            <li>some sellers tell you their shea butter is the real one</li>
            <li>Ghana is where to find the real shea butter</li>
            <li>so i know what a real shea butter looks like</li>
            <li>very disappointing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is a very milk smelling, creaming product.  </li>
            <li>Instead of the smooth texture I was expecting it had a gritty texture.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I also use it as a lip balm straight.   </li>
            <li>This container was filled with the yellow shea butter and not ivory.</li>
            <li>This is real shea butter</li>
            <li>Add essential oils and carrier oils to make fantastic skin creams</li>
            <li>and it really has helped me to lock in the moisture when I use the LOC (Liquid, Oil then Cream) method.</li>
            <li>It arrived fast.</li>
            <li>My hands have been so much happier with me since i started useing this shea butter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shipping is always fast, &amp; packed well.  </li>
            <li>I really like this body butter</li>
            <li>Will absolutely be repurchasing, cant beat the price or product.</li>
            <li>oh well, it is the real stuff</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really my fault.</li>
            <li>Lots more than I expected.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m actually starting to enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent to it once it is on the skin...</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t really turn out</li>
            <li>Really look it up.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>it moisturizes and softens the skin very well.</li>
            <li>I have been telling and showing everyone how this worked so fast on my psoriasis on my hands.</li>
            <li>Shipped and delivered fast</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>but I much prefer my shea butter in a package that makes it easier to handle or scoop out.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I like it and believe it is the real deal, but the color is very greenish.</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>This is 100℅ REAL Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>and it melts really fast when rubbed between the palm of your hands.</li>
            <li>I placed the whole container inside of a ziplock bag</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t want the butter to be deep or mustard yellow, either, because I believe that this kind of butter is either Kpagnan butter</li>
            <li>/&gt;this IS NATURAL STUFF right here..</li>
            <li>Love this so much better than the yellow raw shea butter.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my face and body leaves my face soft and moisturized and helps with bumps, rashes, dark spots, and much more!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect after reading other reviews.</li>
            <li>(please see other post on shea butter for more details)  </li>
            <li>I will order more of this when I run out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not oily like other things that I used to use..</li>
            <li>Better than other lotions.</li>
            <li>I prefer raw since I mix with my own oils</li>
            <li>Overall happy with the seller but not sure the product is what I was looking for</li>
            <li>It will really make your skin smooth and relieve it from being dry.</li>
            <li>The bucket it came in is quite adequate, so perhaps they fixed the problems that early reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li>I reduced my review to 3 stars - despite storing the container in a cool darks space it has totally come apart.  </li>
            <li>my guests complain that it leaves white flakes in their hair,which is true</li>
            <li>I mix it with coconut oil, sweet almond oil, and essential oils.</li>
            <li>so far,  this ranks higher in quality, fragrance, texture and presentation.  </li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s on the skin, it does feel greasy/oily at first, but it eventually absorbs completely into the skin and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>Clear packing tape was used to hold the lid on tightly in shipment but the lid was well secured on its own.</li>
            <li>but that is because the seller doesn&#x27;t melt it down (which can take away some of the shea butter&#x27;s properties) so that it looks better in the container.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it was a little soft when I opened the package, kind of like a dough consistency.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>Works great, for all my uses, everyday, sunblock, hair conditioning, on my feet, on my rough elbows and joint pains</li>
            <li>My skin is feeling better with the use of  jojaba oil and black soap.</li>
            <li>I had previously used refined shea butter but wanted to switch to unrefined because it is even better for your skin.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly as an after shower cream.</li>
            <li>The person understood and helped me more then what the person did over the phone, they issued my money back that night and it hit my account the next business, I also got the seller email</li>
            <li>In the picture its white but what I got was yellow and smells more like cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the extraordinary price for something this big!  </li>
            <li>I use this shea butter for moisturizing skin but mainly in my hair.</li>
            <li>and I like it better than the more expensive brand offered by the Body Works.</li>
            <li>I tried to take the lid off the second container and the entire top of the tub came off with it, spraying shea butter everywhere.</li>
            <li>Luckily shea butter is a solid product so there was no leaking.</li>
            <li>I saw the results the next day and had relief the very first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Great product, smells as expected, leaves the skin feeling soft and  versatile for various recipes and using it all over my body + hair as swimming in chlorinated pool daily.</li>
            <li>This was high quality butter without the grainy texture</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it</li>
            <li>The texture is somewhat grainy which might be the result of heating it at a high temperature.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those that have eczema.</li>
            <li>It was fresh, with a minimally detectable scent, light yellow in color and readily melted in my hands.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels very light and moisturized without a heavy feel.</li>
            <li>This shea butter seemed a bit grittier than the other kind we are used to, but once it&#x27;s on the skin, it worked just the same.</li>
            <li>Since I started useing this product his skin has not only become clear &amp; even toned, it is also very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It came in a plastic container and its nice and hard.</li>
            <li>The product is good needless to say and very fast shipping</li>
            <li>I understand that accidents happen and no one is perfect BUT to send out a product that has been damaged BEFORE it&#x27;s shipped is just bad business.</li>
            <li>(it was mixed with coconut oil and essential oil fragrance), and the finished product was smooth, and very moisturizing to the skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s solid when cool, so it must be heated to become soft.</li>
            <li>This shea butter is okay just messy.  </li>
            <li>This was not smooth and creamy , it was more like clay</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not completely ivory, more of a off white beige color.</li>
            <li>It softens even the most dried, calloused skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was very gritty and made my homemade body butter not set up right.</li>
            <li>I used to use this right out of the jar but now whip this up with coconut, olive, almond and neem oils with lavender and tea tree essential oils for a DIY body, hair, and face</li>
            <li>The technical difference between the two is that the yellow has the shell mixed into it and the white doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>It came in a large plastic bag that was much too big for the amount sent, so it looked like mashed potatoes smeared all over the bag.</li>
            <li>I really like how smooth this is and how it will last for so long.  </li>
            <li>But once I put the Shea butter with other oils, it was fabulous and the roughness went away.</li>
            <li>This one isn&#x27;t as smooth as the other one going on.</li>
            <li>Packaging was lacking,  Other than that, it&#x27;s a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>But this brand was sticky compared to the other brand&#x27;s smooth feel.  </li>
            <li>The shea butter was still usable, but I had to transfer it to a new container in order to use and store it.</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve returned it, but couldn&#x27;t have gotten a new one by the time I needed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And according to the address it was coming from NY which is where I live.</li>
            <li>This seems to be just as good of quality as other Shea butters I have purchased yet I paid less for this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been ordering and using raw shea butter for years and many of those orders were from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want the butter to be stark white, as that indicates that it&#x27;s refined and has lost some of the properties that make shea butter so amazing.</li>
            <li>The itching stopped almost completely and the healing process was accelerated by moisurizing my skin with this natural product (I know this because I did not apply it to my legs &amp; they took much longer to heal).</li>
            <li>It does make my feet look at feel better but by the next morning they look rough again.</li>
            <li>Yesterday I tried it on my hands (which are super dry in the winter).</li>
            <li>but I would most definitely recommend to people with dry skin!!</li>
            <li>The packaging was a little sloppy but the Shea Butter was awesome!</li>
            <li>It make my skin very soft and smoth.</li>
            <li>It comes with a very low price tag and has a whole lot of quality and quantity!</li>
            <li>I have purchased shea butter many times in the past.</li>
            <li>but I kept it professional and emailed the person back) and said something like \\&quot;I did not ask you about the different methods of shea butter and its process of coming smooth or staying in chucks.</li>
            <li>Skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>One thing to be aware of is that since it is unrefined, it ought to be melted and filtered with a coffee filter or cheesecloth otherwise there will be impurities in your final product.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my skin so soft all day!</li>
            <li>This Shea Butter is definitely the real deal!</li>
            <li>This is my third time ordering from Amazon but first time buying this brand/seller.</li>
            <li>its worth for long term .</li>
            <li>I bought this Shea butter specifically because it promised to be soft &amp; creamy; it was not!  </li>
            <li>My first tub was definitely yellow, which indicative of a presence of dye.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I did microwave it a little so that i can apply it easily .</li>
            <li>I am not sure the scent would be considered nutty, but it was not off putting and pleasant even (though not mouthwatering like some other oils/butters).</li>
            <li>what a trip how it is gritty at first but warms to the heat of your hand and rubs in completely.</li>
            <li>gave this 4 stars only because the tub it came in was cracked all around the top and down on side.  </li>
            <li>Dont get me wrong, shea butter is one of the best ingredients you can get for your skin, but it needs to be mixed with other quality ingredients to make it a little more spreadable.  </li>
            <li>I paid way too much for the exact same thing at a conference last year.</li>
            <li>Needless to say I was less than impressed with the customer service, or lack of.</li>
            <li>My dry, cracked hands were left with a light layer of a earthy smelling</li>
            <li>I love that this one doesn&#x27;t leave her skin with a slight tint of yellow to it.</li>
            <li>it took me forever and was a big mess on top of that after being whipped there</li>
            <li>This was such a large amount that I may never have to guy it again.</li>
            <li>However, when I received it the container it came in (like a large chinese soup container)</li>
            <li>The product comes in a quart-size plastic container and the Shea butter is very yellow which leads me to doubt the claim that it is 100% pure organic.</li>
            <li>I also have fragrance oils (largely synthetic), but I only use these with friends who can tolerate synthetic  fragrances  (people with multiple chemical sensitivities can really be affected by scents in colgnes, perfumes, soaps, CANDLES, laundry</li>
            <li>This raw Shea Butter is easy to apply on skin.  </li>
            <li>It is clearly hand-packed.</li>
            <li>Clearly I did not get what I paid.</li>
            <li>, This product is soft enough to control being messaged into skin gently.</li>
            <li>It does NOT come in any container to be clear.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t make my skin as soft as this one.</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t be surprised when you get</li>
            <li>Came four days early.</li>
            <li>definitely natural shea butter.</li>
            <li>This is some chemical mixture that is so far from Shea Butter</li>
            <li>It is soft and creamy as described.  </li>
            <li>It says it is soft and creamy</li>
            <li>I use it on my body and on my natural locs.</li>
            <li>Natural, unrefined.</li>
            <li>a real shea butter is suppose to be white.</li>
            <li>I bought this to help seal my natural curls hair do.  </li>
            <li>it has a smell but guys its natural shea butter</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the icing on the cake that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>This Ivory Shea butter has done wonders for my 1 year old sons sensative skin.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 11month old infant&#x27;s sinus congestion and runny nose.</li>
            <li>but she&#x27;s not messy around the nose area.</li>
            <li>Your skin feels so soft, &amp; there is no residue left.&lt;br</li>
            <li>People are mistaking the \\&quot;soft and creamy\\&quot; for actually soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny and retains moisture for 2-3 days w/o reapplying.</li>
            <li>Also use this after the shower on my bf&#x27;s and my skin and me stay soft all day.</li>
            <li>I am usually very senstive to smells, but I found that this one is bearable, especially if you do what I do and mix it with some coconut oil.</li>
            <li>My skin was sooooooo soft.</li>
            <li>Your hands have never been so soft since you were a baby.  </li>
            <li>This Shea Butter was soft and creamy, as advertised.</li>
            <li>We all have sensitive skin and have had no irritations.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve melted some with some coconut oil n</li>
            <li>I scooped some into an old Rx pill container to scoop out for my hands every once in a while, and gave the remaining &#x27;bricks&#x27; to my wife for what ever she will use them for.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hands and feet soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that everything turned out as well as it did and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, creamy, and it melts in my palm when I rub it in.</li>
            <li>The smell is very earthy and it&#x27;s very reminiscent of olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The ivory is smoother in texture and just as advertised, it&#x27;s REALLY soft and creamy.</li>
            <li>I love that Shea butter is noncomedogenic, it is one of the only heavy duty moisturizers I can use on my face without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li>Perfect base for making beauty products.</li>
            <li>so of course its not going to smell all good like the fake shea butter they sell in some stores&lt;</li>
            <li>I did not get the fish odor complained about by another reviewer, but I may experiment with some light essential oil like orange or vanilla because the fragrance is not strong but kind of \\&quot;earthy\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The seller also sent me a free gift of black soap...Will be buying again!</li>
            <li>At first I was worried at how had and crumbly it was, but, after I slow warmed and added my other oils and fragrance it became pretty smooth.</li>
            <li>This tub will last me more than 3 months since you only need very little to cover a large area.</li>
            <li>I make knives and many other crafts and get multiple cuts, bangs and bruises to my hands on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>so luckily I had saved a previous container.</li>
            <li>I found it very dry and had a funny smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I normally use yellow shea butter mixes.i tried mixes with</li>
            <li>After reading many of the reviews on other shea butter listings, I was expecting to receive a big lump of butter in a plastic bag, which is pretty tacky if you ask me, since storing it that way can be messy due to the fact that it starts melting at a certain temperature.</li>
            <li>By the way, if your shea butter purchase is yellow (not ivory) or light green, it has been modified - it is not unrefined.  </li>
            <li>the real shea butter is a white color not the yellow color.</li>
            <li>people say ivory shea butter smells less strong than yellow, but I think they smell the same.</li>
            <li>But a few drops of essential peppermint oil fixed that right up!</li>
            <li>Needless to say--I love it!  </li>
            <li>this product has made a MAJOR improvement on my feet...</li>
            <li>It moisturizes like no other.</li>
            <li>thing moisturizes like no other.</li>
            <li>I have bought shea butter from a few other companies and this has been my favorite.</li>
            <li>I had been using the &amp;#34;gold shea&amp;#34; butter, which was ok, but very thick.</li>
            <li>It took away the dry itchiness on my pregnant belly, and immediately cured my dry skin!!</li>
            <li>Looks pure to me from what I know, kind of a dirty white.</li>
            <li>Delivery was adequate to pretty average, not very quick but not taking too long.</li>
            <li>that is my general opinion.</li>
            <li>This product is very gritty in texture but makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>You will have no regrets.</li>
            <li>It is soft enough to scoop out into a mixing bowl and mix with oils.</li>
            <li>So apparently amazon has a warehouse where the seller 1.</li>
            <li>I spent a lot of time on amazon hoping and trying to find the real shea butter from sellers.</li>
            <li>but only a couple of days of using this directly from the tub....</li>
            <li>So far we&#x27;ve had no problems with this product, we&#x27;re using it in our solid lotion bars.  </li>
            <li>It arrived much faster than I expected</li>
            <li>People ask if I&#x27;m glowing, I use the shea butter on my face occasionally at night as a part of my regimen and when I wake in the morning my skin is soft and supple.</li>
            <li>It really has softened the rough skin on my feet that has come from a sumer of going barefoot at the pool.</li>
            <li>I use this regularly for body moisturizer and natural hair care.</li>
            <li>and I use the same on my kids sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>And is soft enough that I can stir with a popsicle stick!</li>
            <li>I am certain this batch was not very fresh.</li>
            <li>Smells worse than vaseline, and couldn&#x27;t even cover it up with peppermint essential oil (which is really strong!)</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for any one suffering from dry skin/acne scarring/natural hair.</li>
            <li>I mix my shea butter with natural oils for my hair as am in a hair transitioning (from relax to natural hair) and I can say this shea butter will last me for a long time.</li>
            <li>Plus some pieces were so big I had to break or cut them into smaller pieces getting it all over my hands which is not easy to clean off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe I received a bad package, but it really looked nothing like the nice ivory chunks in the picture.</li>
            <li>I did not like how this product smelled, it smelled like dead fish and the consistency was grainy and not smooth as many may claim.</li>
            <li>It is great and you will not be disappointed if you invest in this product.  </li>
            <li>you feel soft all day long.</li>
            <li>It arrived in big free-formed blobs in a plastic bag and  not nice and tidy in a round container as pictured.  </li>
            <li>and I use hot water and shampoo twice and then condition and my hair comes out so thick and soft!</li>
            <li>After trying calamine lotion, vinegar, baking soda, cortaid &amp; allegra anti-allergy creams, I finally decided to apply this shea butter to calm my raw, sore, swollen arms.</li>
            <li>shea butter is supposed to be an ivory color, but the one i received was pure white, and had a dark brown tint at the bottom from where it spilled out.</li>
            <li>I never got the Ivory shea butter why am not sure what going on but please make it right</li>
            <li>far as the difference between yellow and white, having used them both the white feels and smells the same, and the quality is equal as well.</li>
            <li>It came in large chunks with little ones filling the gaps.</li>
            <li>I kept melting it back down and adding more oils, but they had a really hard time coming through the shea butter smell.</li>
            <li>It IS shea butter and has a slight nutty scent but not as much as the yellow shea butter does.</li>
            <li>I dont know if its shea butter because I know the smell of raw shea butter is pretty foul.</li>
            <li>Pretty raw and course</li>
            <li>But I will say on the first day of using some of the Shea butter with nothing else, it felt very rough on my skin and it took time for the rough texture to blend.</li>
            <li>a 30 year old single girl and an item like that on ones bathroom counter will do nothing but insure that one remains single...retuning it promptly!</li>

            <li> when its chopped and weight its more precise and 2.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Overall: feels great on your skin and doesn&#x27;t smell unpleasant on its own, but maybe not the best choice if using in a project.</li>
            <li> you are looking for an easy &amp;#34;butter creme&amp;#34; for hand and foot creme, shea butter works well.  </li>
            <li> It mixes easily with the oils I use with it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this product at such a great price.</li>
            <li> melts easily and blends with whatever I add to it</li>
            <li> Smell doesn&#x27;t linger once applied and melts easily when rubbed between palms.</li>
            <li> and I got this as an ingredient, but the smell is so strong that you can&#x27;t even cover it up at all.</li>
            <li> It also had a fairly strong odor.  </li>
            <li> strong overbearing smell&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> Some review says the smell is strong but to me it doesnt.</li>
            <li> The smell was pleasant and although solid in the tub, the shea butter spread very easily after it came in contact with the warmth of my hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure Shea butter very smooth and it works wonders for your skin and hair!</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter, it adds that something special to my soap.</li>
            <li> I use it on my stretchmarks, they are not gone but they are lightening and becoming smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a pretty nice size container for the price.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still more than halfway full.</li>
            <li> That works fine, but I don&#x27;t always feel like doing that.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fine</li>
            <li> I recvd this and the box it came in was fine.</li>
            <li> everything was fine,  </li>
            <li> Works fine</li>
            <li> so I am perfectly fine with this too.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t strong and the shea butter is smooth.  </li>
            <li> I also researched many places and decided to buy from this seller as the product seemed correct and the packaging adequate.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> and it was fine, again the product was good but the service was less than good</li>
            <li> new seasons and whole foods sell like 1 oz to 8 oz of this for $22 and this is just as good for 32 oz of $11!</li>
            <li> I especially love how soft my natural hair feels after using the Shea Butter to seal.  </li>
            <li> This came in a huge block.</li>
            <li> I can feel a huge difference in my skin using this product.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product.</li>
            <li> Those who melt it and pour it gets a smooth surface.</li>
            <li> But anyways ,I was looking for something smooth to arrive.</li>
            <li> My husband and son use it also, and we can&#x27;t say enough about how great it is.</li>
            <li> Exspecially if you want to acheive a even and smooth skin tone.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I also will be using it for skin purposes, as it makes your skin smooth and moisturised.  </li>
            <li> this is important.</li>
            <li> It blends well and is quite smooth.  </li>
            <li> For the price this stuff is a great bargain and I will definitely buy from them again!!</li>
            <li> Great texture and color, definitely legit Shea butter.</li>
            <li> it was so smooth no grainy feel too it at all.</li>
            <li> Grainy onced scooped out of the container but once rubbed in,very smooth consistency and absorbs in the skin so well.</li>
            <li> It is a great facial cream and friends</li>
            <li> My skin feels baby butt smooth</li>
            <li> The lid didn&#x27;t even fit the tub.</li>
            <li> The quality and quantity made this a great deal for the low price.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; shea butter products, and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve come</li>
            <li> Im not a fan of greasy products or the smell of the shea butter even though there are such great reviews on the product.</li>
            <li> The tub is filled to the rim and the butter is moist and melts when you rub it between you hands.  </li>
            <li> and it was well packed in packing peanuts and seemed secure</li>
            <li> have bought shea butter before for THREE TIMES as much money and am more satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> fast delivery  !!!</li>
            <li> And, again, the rancid smell was very distinct.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and was exactly like seen on website.</li>
            <li> best raw shea butter I have bought on amazon</li>
            <li> This has a strong buttery, nutty scent which does not seem overwhelming on its own, but overpowered the essential oils I added to it.</li>
            <li> quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Glad that I could fine pure Shea Butter online.  </li>
            <li> Upon opening the box I could immediately smell the rich scent of the Shea butter.</li>
            <li> so it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the container and very pleased with the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li> I was already familiar with Shea butter and all its wonder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> It keeps it all fresh when I am not working with it.&lt;br /&gt;thanks!</li>
            <li> have said it is better then the higher priced cosmetic creams they were using.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try the Ivory</li>
            <li> I was so excited about getting this and using it.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li> It also works great to smooth out rough feet.</li>
            <li> Seam fairly clean.</li>
            <li> Now with that I said I have order this product of shea butter (2 of them) and was all excited to receive them, as I am a person of making my own hair products and am natural!</li>
            <li> I may order more be it that I am a shea butter fanatic,this is by far my favorite one out of the bunch that I have tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clean and has no odor.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin, lasts all winter.</li>
            <li> The granulation is a real downer esp when you are expecting a very smooth buttery cream for your self indulgence.</li>
            <li> if your going to do business then do your business right as a seller!</li>
            <li> To my joyful surprise, it melts right in my hand!</li>
            <li> It is high quality and easy to use in my balms!</li>
            <li> My inexperienced opinion is that this is probably great quality, but I was not prepared for some of the differences between refined/unrefined.</li>
            <li> Myself and my daughters are all fair skined and need extra moisture.</li>
            <li> I really like it and will purchase again :-)</li>
            <li> The shipper was able to have product shipped within a reasonable timeframe</li>
            <li> I will be ordering two order this week because I love this stuff so much.</li>
            <li> Shea butter stays on my skin so much better than coconut oil and is also very healing.</li>
            <li> Returning for a full refund.</li>
            <li> Odor is good and last for a year+.</li>
            <li> and I love it, my hair really takes to it.</li>
            <li> You need good quality essential oils to minimize it.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> its still the same stuff and works just as good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m letting it cool in the fridge, but</li>
            <li> The color of the shea butter I received gives me confidence that it is true, unrefined shea butter</li>
            <li> and I am still able to use it without having the hassle of returning it and going through that whole deal.</li>
            <li> The perfect solution for my 5yr old&#x27;s eczema and my severly dry skin....</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of this Shea Butter, it&#x27;s soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I was a little leery after reading about the smell of unrefined shea butter, but I like the mild nutty aroma, and the soap I made from it smells good even without adding fragrances!</li>
            <li> Had a strong smoky odor when first opened but it dissipated fairly quickly when applied and an earthy fragrance remained.  </li>
            <li> I used it to make a shaving cream (heated it with other things, then refrigerated it and whipped with mixer) and it worked great.</li>
            <li> This seems like a good shea butter-smells good and feels good, but I was really disappointed that it came in a bag not a carton.</li>
            <li> Made a wonderful whip with coconut oil (solid) and almond oil....then going to add essential oils to make &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; creams!</li>
            <li> Quick service from the seller.</li>
            <li> There is A mild smell of Shea.</li>
            <li> It melts on your skin fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I used to use vaseline on his skin, but he still had a mild case of exzema.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s chunky; you just have to pick up a chunk and rub it in your hands for it to quickly melt.  </li>
            <li> Super value for the price.</li>
            <li> It also quickly absorbs in your skin.</li>
            <li> My skin has seen a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li> Mild scent.</li>
            <li> Appreciate the quality of the butter and quick shipment.  </li>
            <li> The order came quick</li>
            <li> Luckily it was plastic because if it were glass, I would have cut myself on all of the pieces that I had to take out of the butter.</li>
            <li> Received quickly.</li>
            <li> It smells mildly of Play-Doh or crayon.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is the best quality compared to more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with the high quality product.</li>
            <li> It has cleared up my dark spots a great deal</li>
            <li> The sides have developed significant cracks and the top has just come apart in my hands as I opened it.</li>
            <li> one day later I experienced the most healing I&#x27;ve seen in the last months...</li>
            <li> The product is grainy when you first pull some out, but it immediately melted with my body heat and was amazingly smooth.</li>
            <li> Very creamy, clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Can be mixed with all the wonderful essential oils that you love and still be completely natural.</li>
            <li> I use it primarily as a full body lotion as is and love how soft my skin is (eve my heals).</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for making quality home beauty products!</li>
            <li> I have used many different Shea butters in the past and this is excellent.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair and absolutely love how soft it feels!</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona where maintaining smooth, hydrated skin is a huge challenge.</li>
            <li> Mine arrived in a heavy-duty sealed bag with a &amp;#34;ziplock&amp;#34; closure in crumbled pieces, I am able to easily get the amount I need without having to cut hunks off a big block.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this product, it is very smooth and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The Shea butter is very grainy, and it is supposed to be smooth.  </li>
            <li> It is very creamy and it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I can see a reduction in the lines around my eyes and my skin feels soft and more elastic.  </li>
            <li> It is so nice not having to do anything but whip the butter and add my essential oils!  </li>
            <li> Worth a try.</li>
            <li> Economical through this resource.</li>
            <li> Fresh and well sealed.</li>
            <li> I just transferred it to another container, the product seems to be ok and not dried out.</li>
            <li> No disappointment with it in any of the areas.</li>
            <li> Still fresh.</li>
            <li> I prefer the white shea butter for making body butter in fragrances like rose and lavender.  </li>
            <li> The yellow just doesn&#x27;t look as nice.  </li>
            <li> You can whip some up, put it into a container and add a few drops of your favorite scented oil for a nice body cream.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more natural way to take care of my hands.</li>
            <li> Soft and creamy, and Light!</li>
            <li> I love it for my natural hair products</li>
            <li> I actually love the nutty natural smell.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this real soon and will continue to buy at this reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The color is an ivory color rather than the yellow kind...</li>
            <li> I rarely give 5 stars to anything.</li>
            <li> it is worth it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This is real Ivory Shea Butter and very well packed!!!</li>
            <li> It breaks down and easily rinses off with warm water.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best batch of raw, unrefined, ivory Shea Butter that I have ever purchased online.</li>
            <li> Good butter, I used it to make body butter by mixing with other oils.</li>
            <li> 3.18.15 - I made hot processed soap for the very first time yesterday</li>
            <li> This stuff is awsome and priced right.</li>
            <li> We use it for after-sport muscle rubs, and it does the job at the right price for us.</li>
            <li> we use it to make soap, it works, and the price is right</li>
            <li> It was in a gigantic tub with chunks (that&#x27;s right CHUNKS) of shea butter.</li>
            <li> to use right out of the jar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is creamy and melts right in your hands.</li>
            <li> I live in Michigan and it got here very quickly.</li>
            <li> I used this many times a day for 3 weeks and still have almost a full container left.</li>
            <li> Smooth as always with all the products I buy from this particular name.</li>
            <li> very large container.  </li>
            <li> It did have a light fragrance, but it was easily covered with essential oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so impressed with their shea butter, that I am going to try out their african black soap.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box and saw the huge 32 oz container filled with shea a big smile appeared on my face.</li>
            <li> There is also a fair amount of dark grit (I&#x27;m assuming pieces of shell) throughout the butter which then ended up settling at the bottom of my lotion</li>
            <li> Very nice organic raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I was already using oils on my hair and skin, but the addition of the shea butter has certainly made both my hair and skin more moist, supple, and soft.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve had it melt right on my fingertip) and leaves it feeling very moist and nourished!</li>
            <li> I have used regular Shea Butter before but this one is so much easier to use, nice &amp; creamy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and is easily removable form the container.</li>
            <li> Great price, but definitely going to order from somewhere else next time.</li>
            <li> This shea butter had an almost brown color,  and the smell was so strong I nearly gagged.  </li>
            <li> Great product and the size will last several months.  </li>
            <li> I mix the shea butter with various oils and it makes a great after wash moisturizer as well as a daily moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li> this is a nice portion that will last a long time and the shipping time was okay.</li>
            <li> When I weighed it on a very accurate chemical scale, noticed only 28.6 ounces and not 32.</li>
            <li> It arrived very fast (2 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> very light scent prior to putting on the skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> It smelled good, like fresh raw shea butter.  </li>
            <li> good, wish was a little cheaper though or gave wholesale deals.</li>
            <li> It works better than just lotion for super dry skin</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This variety, this product from this seller, is much better than the yellow variety of shea butter or Kpang.</li>
            <li> I would think they would be willing to accommodate a customer if they are asking to place additional orders.</li>
            <li> I would also think it would melt and be more solidly &amp;#34;packed&amp;#34; in the container, instead of looking &amp;#34;hand</li>
            <li> Will be ordering again very soon!</li>
            <li> Recommending it to all who are interested to try it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve worked with this product.  </li>
            <li> we first thought that it shouldn&#x27;t come in clumps in the container</li>
            <li> it is not even funny.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t exactly what I thought I was getting.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ordered from this company.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says...</li>
            <li> the chucks and make sure I didnt see any hairs or such and its fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> when my shea butter arrived, it was exactly what is shown in the picture and as described.</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased, as some cocoa butter I ordered from another seller fell short on ounces (and was listed by weight, so</li>
            <li> so it was exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> This Shea butter cleared it up pretty well.</li>
            <li> She did break out though when I first applied it to her chest and nose area.</li>
            <li> I also use it for my 3yr old son-for his light case of ezcema...</li>
            <li> I boiled it first</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted to make deodorant with.</li>
            <li> Might be ok for someone else&#x27;s basic use, just didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li> Thanks for helping take care of my winter skin!</li>
            <li> One time a plastic tub and the most recent a plastic</li>
            <li> It smells funky and doesn&#x27;t last more than about an hour.</li>
            <li> Make sure you aren&#x27;t allergic, obviously.</li>
            <li> All around this has many uses and I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Will be using more in the future.</li>
            <li> And I found the shea butter to be very moisturizing and hydrating!</li>
            <li> so I was pretty pissed about that</li>
            <li> I purchased the 32 oz amount and you can tell us higher quality.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for holding up to your description!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s soft and smooth on my skin</li>
            <li> I put it on, I can never seem to stop ;)</li>
            <li> I love ivory African shea butter better then the yellow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently experimenting with a copy cat recipe of a deodorant I love...</li>
            <li> This was my first time ordering or using Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> so Ive only used it as an ingredient for lip balm, but I have more plans for using Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I most definitely would recommend it to anyone in the Shea Butter users community!</li>
            <li> My first order wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;Ivory&amp;#34; though.</li>
            <li> No worries, it was my first order</li>
            <li> then when i opened it to smell (im from Africa and know exactly what she butter smells like, and looks like)</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing shea butter, but from everything I&#x27;ve researched about shea butter (I researched for months before I decided to make a purchase), the shea butter sent to me by the currently-listed seller, smellgood, is the real deal!</li>
            <li> What I received is exactly what is pictured in the product listing&#x27;s picture.</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase more when I run out.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the ivory and there is a difference.</li>
            <li> I will buy more shea butter from another seller.&lt;br /&gt;The 5 stars are for the shea butter ONLY!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered it twice now and both times I received it quickly, it was packaged very well, had a wonderful faint scent and works very well in my homemade lotions.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is very greasy but it also tones my skin nicely and eliminates dry skin.</li>
            <li> texture of the butter is very grainy in its natural state, but it melts very quickly when it comes in contact with skin</li>
            <li> I most certainly sent it back since it was RANCID</li>
            <li> I like to mix it with other ingredients to make a nice moisturizing cream.   </li>
            <li> This shea butter is great for keeping rough, scaly skin at bay, and helps blend in pasty white sunscreen so that it&#x27;s unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> It is ivory as stated because I really didn&#x27;t want the yellow one, Ivory shea butter is always better.</li>
            <li> item pure and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> my guess is that if it has been stored in a hot place, either in Africa or here in the US, it could very well turn rancid.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever bought shea butter, but I have a feeling this may not be real shea.</li>
            <li> Long lasting&lt;br /&gt;and could not ask for more.</li>
            <li> but when you first put it on it may be a bit shiny or greasy if you use too much</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long for my order to come in, I love this shea butter, it has a nutty smell and is grainy, rubs in my skin with no problems.</li>
            <li> The Shea butter I received was not ivory, but the same regular, yellow kind you can find at most beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> pretty much the whole body..</li>
            <li> But I use it anyway, and just like some reviewers say its soft and melts quickly into your hand at room temperature..</li>
            <li> butter has a somewhat strong nutty smell, its different.</li>
            <li> , i.e. it was very old, not at all fresh.</li>
            <li> When I received my product, I noticed that there was a large hole on the side of the container.</li>
            <li> I like how the skin become after using pure Shia butter</li>
            <li> pure shea</li>
            <li> Needless to say the person reply right back (for that great on answering me back) and said \\&quot;you have a good point.</li>
            <li> Also, the container has a large crack across the bottom.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t use too much it soaks completely in to your skin and it feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Super soft and absorbs well..would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Packaging is very plain but who cares since the price is so good.  </li>
            <li> This way I get the pure butter and can use as much as I want to get the effect that i want.</li>
            <li> In fact, better, as some people complained, but I find it just fine.  </li>
            <li> am I just supposed to leave a huge plastic bag of what looks like lard on my bathroom counter next to my tooth brush??</li>
            <li> , it is natural works on contact for soft and smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> Rubbing it in my palms heats it up enough to go on smooth.  </li>
            <li> It REALLY softens my skin.</li>
            <li> Water repellant, but very greasy.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> so is it really 32oz</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this my skin is much softer and creamier.</li>
            <li> i cracked the side so be gentle.</li>
            <li> Now even those there is no way of knowing if the product is 100% real quality, until you get in your hands you have to trust the seller response and loyalty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The picture shows smooth and solid consistency when I opened it up</li>
            <li> some sellers tell you their shea butter is the real one</li>
            <li> Ghana is where to find the real shea butter</li>
            <li> so i know what a real shea butter looks like</li>
            <li> very disappointing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a very milk smelling, creaming product.  </li>
            <li> Instead of the smooth texture I was expecting it had a gritty texture.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I also use it as a lip balm straight.   </li>
            <li> This container was filled with the yellow shea butter and not ivory.</li>
            <li> This is real shea butter</li>
            <li> Add essential oils and carrier oils to make fantastic skin creams</li>
            <li> and it really has helped me to lock in the moisture when I use the LOC (Liquid, Oil then Cream) method.</li>
            <li> It arrived fast.</li>
            <li> My hands have been so much happier with me since i started useing this shea butter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shipping is always fast, &amp; packed well.  </li>
            <li> I really like this body butter</li>
            <li> Will absolutely be repurchasing, cant beat the price or product.</li>
            <li> oh well, it is the real stuff</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really my fault.</li>
            <li> Lots more than I expected.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m actually starting to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent to it once it is on the skin...</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t really turn out</li>
            <li> Really look it up.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> it moisturizes and softens the skin very well.</li>
            <li> I have been telling and showing everyone how this worked so fast on my psoriasis on my hands.</li>
            <li> Shipped and delivered fast</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> but I much prefer my shea butter in a package that makes it easier to handle or scoop out.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like it and believe it is the real deal, but the color is very greenish.</li>
            <li> This works very well.</li>
            <li> This is 100℅ REAL Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> and it melts really fast when rubbed between the palm of your hands.</li>
            <li> I placed the whole container inside of a ziplock bag</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t want the butter to be deep or mustard yellow, either, because I believe that this kind of butter is either Kpagnan butter</li>
            <li> /&gt;this IS NATURAL STUFF right here..</li>
            <li> Love this so much better than the yellow raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my face and body leaves my face soft and moisturized and helps with bumps, rashes, dark spots, and much more!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect after reading other reviews.</li>
            <li> (please see other post on shea butter for more details)  </li>
            <li> I will order more of this when I run out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not oily like other things that I used to use..</li>
            <li> Better than other lotions.</li>
            <li> I prefer raw since I mix with my own oils</li>
            <li> Overall happy with the seller but not sure the product is what I was looking for</li>
            <li> It will really make your skin smooth and relieve it from being dry.</li>
            <li> The bucket it came in is quite adequate, so perhaps they fixed the problems that early reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I reduced my review to 3 stars - despite storing the container in a cool darks space it has totally come apart.  </li>
            <li> my guests complain that it leaves white flakes in their hair,which is true</li>
            <li> I mix it with coconut oil, sweet almond oil, and essential oils.</li>
            <li> so far,  this ranks higher in quality, fragrance, texture and presentation.  </li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s on the skin, it does feel greasy/oily at first, but it eventually absorbs completely into the skin and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> Clear packing tape was used to hold the lid on tightly in shipment but the lid was well secured on its own.</li>
            <li> but that is because the seller doesn&#x27;t melt it down (which can take away some of the shea butter&#x27;s properties) so that it looks better in the container.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it was a little soft when I opened the package, kind of like a dough consistency.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Works great, for all my uses, everyday, sunblock, hair conditioning, on my feet, on my rough elbows and joint pains</li>
            <li> My skin is feeling better with the use of  jojaba oil and black soap.</li>
            <li> I had previously used refined shea butter but wanted to switch to unrefined because it is even better for your skin.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly as an after shower cream.</li>
            <li> The person understood and helped me more then what the person did over the phone, they issued my money back that night and it hit my account the next business, I also got the seller email</li>
            <li> In the picture its white but what I got was yellow and smells more like cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the extraordinary price for something this big!  </li>
            <li> I use this shea butter for moisturizing skin but mainly in my hair.</li>
            <li> and I like it better than the more expensive brand offered by the Body Works.</li>
            <li> I tried to take the lid off the second container and the entire top of the tub came off with it, spraying shea butter everywhere.</li>
            <li> Luckily shea butter is a solid product so there was no leaking.</li>
            <li> I saw the results the next day and had relief the very first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Great product, smells as expected, leaves the skin feeling soft and  versatile for various recipes and using it all over my body + hair as swimming in chlorinated pool daily.</li>
            <li> This was high quality butter without the grainy texture</li>
            <li> i highly recommend it</li>
            <li> The texture is somewhat grainy which might be the result of heating it at a high temperature.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those that have eczema.</li>
            <li> It was fresh, with a minimally detectable scent, light yellow in color and readily melted in my hands.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels very light and moisturized without a heavy feel.</li>
            <li> This shea butter seemed a bit grittier than the other kind we are used to, but once it&#x27;s on the skin, it worked just the same.</li>
            <li> Since I started useing this product his skin has not only become clear &amp; even toned, it is also very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It came in a plastic container and its nice and hard.</li>
            <li> The product is good needless to say and very fast shipping</li>
            <li> I understand that accidents happen and no one is perfect BUT to send out a product that has been damaged BEFORE it&#x27;s shipped is just bad business.</li>
            <li> (it was mixed with coconut oil and essential oil fragrance), and the finished product was smooth, and very moisturizing to the skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solid when cool, so it must be heated to become soft.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is okay just messy.  </li>
            <li> This was not smooth and creamy , it was more like clay</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not completely ivory, more of a off white beige color.</li>
            <li> It softens even the most dried, calloused skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was very gritty and made my homemade body butter not set up right.</li>
            <li> I used to use this right out of the jar but now whip this up with coconut, olive, almond and neem oils with lavender and tea tree essential oils for a DIY body, hair, and face</li>
            <li> The technical difference between the two is that the yellow has the shell mixed into it and the white doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> It came in a large plastic bag that was much too big for the amount sent, so it looked like mashed potatoes smeared all over the bag.</li>
            <li> I really like how smooth this is and how it will last for so long.  </li>
            <li> But once I put the Shea butter with other oils, it was fabulous and the roughness went away.</li>
            <li> This one isn&#x27;t as smooth as the other one going on.</li>
            <li> Packaging was lacking,  Other than that, it&#x27;s a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> But this brand was sticky compared to the other brand&#x27;s smooth feel.  </li>
            <li> The shea butter was still usable, but I had to transfer it to a new container in order to use and store it.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve returned it, but couldn&#x27;t have gotten a new one by the time I needed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And according to the address it was coming from NY which is where I live.</li>
            <li> This seems to be just as good of quality as other Shea butters I have purchased yet I paid less for this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering and using raw shea butter for years and many of those orders were from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want the butter to be stark white, as that indicates that it&#x27;s refined and has lost some of the properties that make shea butter so amazing.</li>
            <li> The itching stopped almost completely and the healing process was accelerated by moisurizing my skin with this natural product (I know this because I did not apply it to my legs &amp; they took much longer to heal).</li>
            <li> It does make my feet look at feel better but by the next morning they look rough again.</li>
            <li> Yesterday I tried it on my hands (which are super dry in the winter).</li>
            <li> but I would most definitely recommend to people with dry skin!!</li>
            <li> The packaging was a little sloppy but the Shea Butter was awesome!</li>
            <li> It make my skin very soft and smoth.</li>
            <li> It comes with a very low price tag and has a whole lot of quality and quantity!</li>
            <li> I have purchased shea butter many times in the past.</li>
            <li> but I kept it professional and emailed the person back) and said something like \\&quot;I did not ask you about the different methods of shea butter and its process of coming smooth or staying in chucks.</li>
            <li> Skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> One thing to be aware of is that since it is unrefined, it ought to be melted and filtered with a coffee filter or cheesecloth otherwise there will be impurities in your final product.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my skin so soft all day!</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is definitely the real deal!</li>
            <li> This is my third time ordering from Amazon but first time buying this brand/seller.</li>
            <li> its worth for long term .</li>
            <li> I bought this Shea butter specifically because it promised to be soft &amp; creamy; it was not!  </li>
            <li> My first tub was definitely yellow, which indicative of a presence of dye.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I did microwave it a little so that i can apply it easily .</li>
            <li> I am not sure the scent would be considered nutty, but it was not off putting and pleasant even (though not mouthwatering like some other oils/butters).</li>
            <li> what a trip how it is gritty at first but warms to the heat of your hand and rubs in completely.</li>
            <li> gave this 4 stars only because the tub it came in was cracked all around the top and down on side.  </li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong, shea butter is one of the best ingredients you can get for your skin, but it needs to be mixed with other quality ingredients to make it a little more spreadable.  </li>
            <li> I paid way too much for the exact same thing at a conference last year.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was less than impressed with the customer service, or lack of.</li>
            <li> My dry, cracked hands were left with a light layer of a earthy smelling</li>
            <li> I love that this one doesn&#x27;t leave her skin with a slight tint of yellow to it.</li>
            <li> it took me forever and was a big mess on top of that after being whipped there</li>
            <li> This was such a large amount that I may never have to guy it again.</li>
            <li> However, when I received it the container it came in (like a large chinese soup container)</li>
            <li> The product comes in a quart-size plastic container and the Shea butter is very yellow which leads me to doubt the claim that it is 100% pure organic.</li>
            <li> I also have fragrance oils (largely synthetic), but I only use these with friends who can tolerate synthetic  fragrances  (people with multiple chemical sensitivities can really be affected by scents in colgnes, perfumes, soaps, CANDLES, laundry</li>
            <li> This raw Shea Butter is easy to apply on skin.  </li>
            <li> It is clearly hand-packed.</li>
            <li> Clearly I did not get what I paid.</li>
            <li> , This product is soft enough to control being messaged into skin gently.</li>
            <li> It does NOT come in any container to be clear.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make my skin as soft as this one.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t be surprised when you get</li>
            <li> Came four days early.</li>
            <li> definitely natural shea butter.</li>
            <li> This is some chemical mixture that is so far from Shea Butter</li>
            <li> It is soft and creamy as described.  </li>
            <li> It says it is soft and creamy</li>
            <li> I use it on my body and on my natural locs.</li>
            <li> Natural, unrefined.</li>
            <li> a real shea butter is suppose to be white.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help seal my natural curls hair do.  </li>
            <li> it has a smell but guys its natural shea butter</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the icing on the cake that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> This Ivory Shea butter has done wonders for my 1 year old sons sensative skin.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 11month old infant&#x27;s sinus congestion and runny nose.</li>
            <li> but she&#x27;s not messy around the nose area.</li>
            <li> Your skin feels so soft, &amp; there is no residue left.&lt;br</li>
            <li> People are mistaking the \\&quot;soft and creamy\\&quot; for actually soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and shiny and retains moisture for 2-3 days w/o reapplying.</li>
            <li> Also use this after the shower on my bf&#x27;s and my skin and me stay soft all day.</li>
            <li> I am usually very senstive to smells, but I found that this one is bearable, especially if you do what I do and mix it with some coconut oil.</li>
            <li> My skin was sooooooo soft.</li>
            <li> Your hands have never been so soft since you were a baby.  </li>
            <li> This Shea Butter was soft and creamy, as advertised.</li>
            <li> We all have sensitive skin and have had no irritations.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve melted some with some coconut oil n</li>
            <li> I scooped some into an old Rx pill container to scoop out for my hands every once in a while, and gave the remaining &#x27;bricks&#x27; to my wife for what ever she will use them for.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hands and feet soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that everything turned out as well as it did and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, creamy, and it melts in my palm when I rub it in.</li>
            <li> The smell is very earthy and it&#x27;s very reminiscent of olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The ivory is smoother in texture and just as advertised, it&#x27;s REALLY soft and creamy.</li>
            <li> I love that Shea butter is noncomedogenic, it is one of the only heavy duty moisturizers I can use on my face without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> Perfect base for making beauty products.</li>
            <li> so of course its not going to smell all good like the fake shea butter they sell in some stores&lt;</li>
            <li> I did not get the fish odor complained about by another reviewer, but I may experiment with some light essential oil like orange or vanilla because the fragrance is not strong but kind of \\&quot;earthy\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The seller also sent me a free gift of black soap...Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> At first I was worried at how had and crumbly it was, but, after I slow warmed and added my other oils and fragrance it became pretty smooth.</li>
            <li> This tub will last me more than 3 months since you only need very little to cover a large area.</li>
            <li> I make knives and many other crafts and get multiple cuts, bangs and bruises to my hands on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> so luckily I had saved a previous container.</li>
            <li> I found it very dry and had a funny smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I normally use yellow shea butter mixes.i tried mixes with</li>
            <li> After reading many of the reviews on other shea butter listings, I was expecting to receive a big lump of butter in a plastic bag, which is pretty tacky if you ask me, since storing it that way can be messy due to the fact that it starts melting at a certain temperature.</li>
            <li> By the way, if your shea butter purchase is yellow (not ivory) or light green, it has been modified - it is not unrefined.  </li>
            <li> the real shea butter is a white color not the yellow color.</li>
            <li> people say ivory shea butter smells less strong than yellow, but I think they smell the same.</li>
            <li> But a few drops of essential peppermint oil fixed that right up!</li>
            <li> Needless to say--I love it!  </li>
            <li> this product has made a MAJOR improvement on my feet...</li>
            <li> It moisturizes like no other.</li>
            <li> thing moisturizes like no other.</li>
            <li> I have bought shea butter from a few other companies and this has been my favorite.</li>
            <li> I had been using the &amp;#34;gold shea&amp;#34; butter, which was ok, but very thick.</li>
            <li> It took away the dry itchiness on my pregnant belly, and immediately cured my dry skin!!</li>
            <li> Looks pure to me from what I know, kind of a dirty white.</li>
            <li> Delivery was adequate to pretty average, not very quick but not taking too long.</li>
            <li> that is my general opinion.</li>
            <li> This product is very gritty in texture but makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> You will have no regrets.</li>
            <li> It is soft enough to scoop out into a mixing bowl and mix with oils.</li>
            <li> So apparently amazon has a warehouse where the seller 1.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time on amazon hoping and trying to find the real shea butter from sellers.</li>
            <li> but only a couple of days of using this directly from the tub....</li>
            <li> So far we&#x27;ve had no problems with this product, we&#x27;re using it in our solid lotion bars.  </li>
            <li> It arrived much faster than I expected</li>
            <li> People ask if I&#x27;m glowing, I use the shea butter on my face occasionally at night as a part of my regimen and when I wake in the morning my skin is soft and supple.</li>
            <li> It really has softened the rough skin on my feet that has come from a sumer of going barefoot at the pool.</li>
            <li> I use this regularly for body moisturizer and natural hair care.</li>
            <li> and I use the same on my kids sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> And is soft enough that I can stir with a popsicle stick!</li>
            <li> I am certain this batch was not very fresh.</li>
            <li> Smells worse than vaseline, and couldn&#x27;t even cover it up with peppermint essential oil (which is really strong!)</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for any one suffering from dry skin/acne scarring/natural hair.</li>
            <li> I mix my shea butter with natural oils for my hair as am in a hair transitioning (from relax to natural hair) and I can say this shea butter will last me for a long time.</li>
            <li> Plus some pieces were so big I had to break or cut them into smaller pieces getting it all over my hands which is not easy to clean off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe I received a bad package, but it really looked nothing like the nice ivory chunks in the picture.</li>
            <li> I did not like how this product smelled, it smelled like dead fish and the consistency was grainy and not smooth as many may claim.</li>
            <li> It is great and you will not be disappointed if you invest in this product.  </li>
            <li> you feel soft all day long.</li>
            <li> It arrived in big free-formed blobs in a plastic bag and  not nice and tidy in a round container as pictured.  </li>
            <li> and I use hot water and shampoo twice and then condition and my hair comes out so thick and soft!</li>
            <li> After trying calamine lotion, vinegar, baking soda, cortaid &amp; allegra anti-allergy creams, I finally decided to apply this shea butter to calm my raw, sore, swollen arms.</li>
            <li> shea butter is supposed to be an ivory color, but the one i received was pure white, and had a dark brown tint at the bottom from where it spilled out.</li>
            <li> I never got the Ivory shea butter why am not sure what going on but please make it right</li>
            <li> far as the difference between yellow and white, having used them both the white feels and smells the same, and the quality is equal as well.</li>
            <li> It came in large chunks with little ones filling the gaps.</li>
            <li> I kept melting it back down and adding more oils, but they had a really hard time coming through the shea butter smell.</li>
            <li> It IS shea butter and has a slight nutty scent but not as much as the yellow shea butter does.</li>
            <li> I dont know if its shea butter because I know the smell of raw shea butter is pretty foul.</li>
            <li> Pretty raw and course</li>
            <li> But I will say on the first day of using some of the Shea butter with nothing else, it felt very rough on my skin and it took time for the rough texture to blend.</li>
            <li> a 30 year old single girl and an item like that on ones bathroom counter will do nothing but insure that one remains single...retuning it promptly!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nothing aggravates me more than false advertising!  </li>
            <li> Product appears to be pure raw shea butter from youtube video descriptions.</li>
            <li> other than not being satisfied with the container being broken.</li>
            <li> And I have heard the color of real 100% (unrefined) raw Shea Butter is off white or beige.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it has kept my skin really soft and my hair moisturized.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny and soft and moisturized longer than any other store bought product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as some of the other claims of helping reduce pain?</li>
            <li> its a lot of shea butter in a big container and can last me for a long time.</li>
            <li> When I get a small dallop to rub in my hands, the shea butter INSTANTLY melts and it has a cool sensation for a slight moment.</li>
            <li> It did leave a slightly sticky feeling on the skin for about 10 minutes, but this goes away and leaves your skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> ; I didn&#x27;t return the container although I really really should have :/.</li>
            <li> it was very affordable compared to the people i usually order from.</li>
            <li> Eventually, this tub is going to last a long while</li>
            <li> Even though the color stained his socks yellow, it does keep his skin moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> This product will last a long time and can be added to oils for fragrance.</li>
            <li> wait a long time to get the same results.</li>
            <li> I find this product to be just as it was described, firm yet creamy, not hard at all.</li>
            <li> Having only known yellow shea butter, I was never particularly fond of the smell and texture.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and after trying so many things from expensive to inexpensive, this product has been incredibile.</li>
            <li> I heard raw shea butter is hard and that you have to melt it in order to use and mix it easily.</li>
            <li> It will last me a long time!</li>
            <li> I will be coming back for this shea butter for as long as the quality continues!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this especially to those women that have natural black hair!</li>
            <li> but it is hard and doesn&#x27;t rub on very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than any artificial fragrance.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I dislike is that it verys from the ivory color that it claims to sometimes dark yellow.</li>
            <li> It even arrived at my home earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> It was grainy &amp; a mix of colors from ivory to grey (marbled).</li>
            <li> the product was not soft and the one container was cracked.</li>
            <li> not surprised at all as I have used shea butter before.</li>
            <li> The product looked like it was exposed to the air for a long time and they just scraped the bottom of a barrel to send out.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> and it was all broken up in really small pieces (not chunks although there was a bug chunk on top</li>
            <li> I know about shea butter and the process of melting it down (if your not careful.)</li>
            <li> other oil to make it soft at room temperature, and add a few essential oils.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think this was shea butter, had a different color and aroma than other shea butters I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have tons of experience with these types of products, only one other brand of Shea butter.  </li>
            <li> Plenty of shea butter for a long time!</li>
            <li> Based on the comments of other reviewers of shea butter, I was prepared to smell a somewhat stinky, nutty scent when I opened the container, but the smell didn&#x27;t actually bother me.</li>
            <li> Or not for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It has cleared up patches of dry skin that I have struggled with for years.</li>
            <li> I use this on my dry hair and the hair loves it.</li>
            <li> but I still use it because my skin is so dry.</li>
            <li> DRY CRACKED FEET....  </li>
            <li> I have severe dry</li>
            <li> In the winter time they get so dry they will crack and bleed.</li>
            <li> Shea butter nourishes and perks up dry crusted skin.</li>
            <li> I also use this product all over my body to repair dark blemishes from previous acne scarring, which has worked well-the blemishes have improved thus far but hope to continue fading as long as I use this...</li>
            <li> It was smooth and creamy, the continer was brittle and a little difficult to open for me</li>
            <li> I use to have a big dark spot on my two arms</li>
            <li> However, when I received my Shea butter it came in a plastic container, similar to chinese take out food containers, and the lid was completely smashed in and the side of the container was broken.  </li>
            <li> Mixed with raw coconut oil and extra virgin olive oil.</li>
            <li> I broke it down in smaller tin containers and added some lavender.</li>
            <li> This is not a high end overly refined product.</li>
            <li> When I opened the container it had chunks of gold shea butter mixed in as well as odd colored pieces.</li>
            <li> However the packaging is nothing like the picture..instead of coming in those tall containers it comes in these black chinese takeout type tupperware looking things.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made lots of lotions and balms and still have half of the container left.  </li>
            <li> After adding a few other minor ingredients and using this on his skin daily after bathing, for the first time in years his skin cleared completely and showed zero signs of eczema the rest of a VERY long cold season.</li>
            <li> It is beneficial for moisturizing the body and can be used on the hair as well especially very dry or damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> So I know it just needs to melt a little or just be mixed with an oil.</li>
            <li> It works especially well with Raw African Black Soap from Ghana.</li>
            <li> ,I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t be too bad for the skin though because it melts</li>
            <li> I use it everyday for my entire body.  </li>
            <li> The service was prompt and it was a lot of product  for the money spent.</li>
            <li> I have not really test the butter out as I am waiting for my oils (Iherbs.com it</li>
            <li> Lotion just dries out your skin a few hours later, but shea butter moisturizes all day.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected after reading lots of reviews.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too much trouble to send back!).</li>
            <li> It was not really refined like we were expecting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this one quite a few times and always got a different result.  </li>
            <li> Especially during the harsh winter months.</li>
            <li> I received the shea butter just as expected in a plastic container that held it well, wrapped with a rubber band for reinforcement.</li>
            <li> just what i expected</li>
            <li> That seems unprocessed to me.</li>
            <li> I mixed in a few oils and let it solidify overnight.</li>
            <li> The shipping was faster than expected.  </li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is thick.</li>
            <li> The smell is not as heavy as the yellow, much harder variety.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what they mean by soft and creamy.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin, and she usually complains about her skin being itchy,&amp; over dried  after bathing.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not strong at all and blends well with essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Which the person emailed me right back and said \\&quot;sorry for the inconvenience, but appearance of shea butter depends on packaging technique!</li>
            <li> It was a deep and almost passionate scent, hard to describe.</li>
            <li> This raw shae butter has the proper color, smell, and consistency.</li>
            <li> Future orders for raw shae butter will be from this company.</li>
            <li> And you do it the same way you can also add some scented oil SPECIFICALLY FOR YOUR BODY and heat it in the microwave and keep it in a separate dish a little GOES A LOOOOOONG WAY!</li>
            <li> Plus a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way).</li>
            <li> I am not very familiar with Shea butter in person so I cannot compare scents or texture but this seemed as expected.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t mix it with other oils to use for my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my hair and body and mix it with a variety of other oils and conditioners for hair and body, or I use it alone for both.  </li>
            <li> However, after responding to the email and sending several other emails regarding completing the transaction, the seller never responded and I was not able to add the additional product to the order.</li>
            <li> the only thing i disliked was that it came in a plastic bag!</li>
            <li> and I got 3 other family members hooked on it.</li>
            <li> I also use it to make lotion, lip balm, and other items with.</li>
            <li> This had a sharp, rancid smell that I couldn&#x27;t stand.</li>
            <li> Like I said I was all excited to get my shea butter only to be disappointed that is</li>
            <li> Excuse me, (My few choice words was rising</li>
            <li> I planned on using to help my teenage daughters ,One of whom  has Juvenile Arthritis and it affect her Feet and Hands.</li>
            <li> Other than that I&#x27;d probably buy again, because its affordable</li>
            <li> It truly does soften up/melt once you rub it on your hand...and a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> I do not use any other creams other than the Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> but they usually only us a small amount so it can be on the list.   </li>
            <li> I mix it with other oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered Shea butter from other companies through the years.</li>
            <li> THAT I DIDNT STICK TO OTHER SHEA BUTTER</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s grittier than other times, but I&#x27;ve never had any</li>
            <li> making lip balm this is the prefect mix with our other items.</li>
            <li> this was not rotten shea butter like some of the other amazon stuff i&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
            <li> one container was way larger than the other, so I&#x27;m not sure I got 32 oz as stated each time</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not extremely oily&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li> I used this for my afro-textured hair with a mix of other oils.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a small bar or jar but the product I received was alot bigger.</li>
            <li> #34;lotion bars&amp;#34; with a variety of other ingredients, and</li>
            <li> Not too stinky or rancid like from some other lower price sellers.</li>
            <li> Butter\\&quot;) or shea butter that contains dyes or other additives.</li>
            <li> Other reviews of this product led me to believe that it would have a nuttier smell...</li>
            <li> but when I removed it from the box I discovered that a large chunk of plastic had been broken off and was missing from the bottom of the container.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this several times before from a different vendor and never experienced any issues with shipping.</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of a rough texture.</li>
            <li> My other Daughter with her Eczema .But shuffers from Juvenile Diabetes and her skin is always extremely dry.</li>
            <li> I only have 1 complaint....</li>
            <li> My only problem was that I had to pay for the 3-5 days shipping and it came like four days late.</li>
            <li> Keep rubbing them for at least 5 minutes or longer if possible.  </li>
            <li> I have a complaint about the actual company that ships it out &amp;#34;Halaleveryday&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> you just have to temper it  to remove the graininess ( just slowly melt it )  and re- package  for later use.</li>
            <li> and I had to melt it down and let it solidify again.</li>
            <li> It is a butter, it melted down accordingly.</li>
            <li> Smells like chemicals, green and extremely greasy.</li>
            <li> Has a slight nutty smell and does not seem to have any debris in it.</li>
            <li> but it was half way off when I opened the box</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;ve never smelled it before then it probably smells funny at first but its not an awful smell like others posted.</li>
            <li> Product cakes with lots of black specs inside bottom of container.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d  previously used another brand-yellow shea butter).  </li>
            <li> It is a little gritty and a little hard</li>
            <li> Now I have a broken up block of butter that has to be cleaned and transferred to several other containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have seen little black specks from time to time.</li>
            <li> every lotion bar that I&#x27;ve made with this has little black specks in it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When i rub it in my hands it feels slightly grainy i suppose.. there are just little shea butter &amp;#34;granule-like&amp;#34; bits that melt a little slower or something.</li>
            <li> As a side note, while visiting my sis I had a little of this in a travel jar.</li>
            <li> I used to use this stuff all the time as a little kid</li>
            <li> I have bought other shea butter products in the past</li>
            <li> I fel a little ripped off.</li>
            <li> And since I know little about melting this without destroying the butter.</li>
            <li> Some dirty spots but not big enough to have to &amp;#34;treat&amp;#34; the butter before use.  </li>
            <li> It arrived in  2 heavy duty zipped baggies.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is when I opened the box, the container that it came in is plastic and the lid was cracked and broken.</li>
            <li> out\\&quot; after a few seconds it registered what he said.</li>
            <li> Now, if I was close by the seller I would have had a few choice words for him.</li>
            <li> I put it on everyday regardless but my skin hasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;changed&amp;#34; since using it.</li>
            <li> This batch of Shea Butter was definitely not smooth and creamy like Shea Butter should be.</li>
            <li> It may not be this products fault, but my husband&#x27;s itching became 10 times worse immediately following application.  </li>
            <li> Heavily medicinal odor.</li>
            <li> I had to melt this and sift it a few times to get some sediment out.</li>
            <li> Every time I looked at the big unnecessary plastic container I literally shake my head.</li>
            <li> Add a few drops of water and begin rubbing your hands with this solution.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this a few times and the packaging varies</li>
            <li> tub was completely cracked, broken, and falling apart when I received it!</li>
            <li> I just got my order a few minutes ago</li>
            <li> The butter arrived in clumps and in a round container instead of what is pictured on the website&#x27;s description.</li>
            <li> It is a rancid smell, not a smooth nutty smell.</li>
            <li> Only problem I&#x27;ve had were the tubs they came in, they were both already broken by the time they arrived, they were wrapped in plastic</li>
            <li> Im not a huge fan of putting all those chemicles on my skin</li>
            <li> The only things annoying me is , whenever I ask my wife where did she hide the butter she start to telling me how much I used.</li>
            <li> It is very thick so if using in the hair use only a small amount.</li>
            <li> not cool!</li>
            <li> The packaging is poor, but it doesn&#x27;t matter in the long run.</li>
            <li> It is raw</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t like the raw product.  </li>
            <li> Do your homework concerning raw shae butter</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews and was skeptical about purchasing because a lot of people complained about the smell or the tub it came in was old and cracked.</li>
            <li> it was a mess to say the least</li>
            <li> It is a little hard when you receive it</li>
            <li> The Shea butter itself was grainy and did not seem like the raw Shea butter I usually purchase.</li>
            <li> But there is something that states it on a few seller pages I have been too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure it is what I asked for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with odoriferous shea purchases in the past so to me</li>
            <li> This is very gritty and smells stale.</li>
            <li> I made one batch of lotion bars with it and no more...</li>
            <li> In the interim, I have been taking small amounts, melting it between my hands and applying it to my feet.</li>
            <li> This is greasier than any shea butter I&#x27;ve purchased from any seller in the past.</li>
            <li> It smelled like usual shea butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was this brand</li>
            <li> Being lazy and settling for &amp;#34;that&#x27;s what I get for taking a chance on amazon&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I ended up giving small amounts to friends and family.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, there was product all over the outside of the tub and all over the box by the time it got to my house.</li>
            <li> Maybe my mistake in ordering this particure product but in the past the Shea Butter I have ordered came in a plastic container.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to put cream or lotion on my hands every time after I was them</li>
            <li> not sure what I would be getting</li>
            <li> i am not satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I am now a firm believer in shea butter!</li>
            <li> Very messy.</li>
            <li> Just disappointed in the fact that its just saran wrapped and placed in a large ziploc bag.</li>
            <li> Packaging was awful but product was fine.</li>
            <li> but it was hard like the hardest Shea butter I&#x27;ve ever ordered and since that&#x27;s all I use to moisturize my everything</li>
            <li> it was SOOOO hard like cocoa butter hard</li>
            <li> were still chunks of unmelted unwhipped hard to rub on my body</li>
            <li> but I hate the smell of it, organic and pure</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and solid in the cold and even room temperature, maybe even a bit hard</li>
            <li> There are several recipes online for making homemade cold cream.</li>
            <li> disappointing and I likely will not buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment was that is didn&#x27;t come in a plastic container as the picture suggests.</li>
            <li> I was desperate enough to duct tape</li>
            <li> And that it, so the base is Shea butter it dose so much for your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is extremely thick...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li> Oh my....I live in desert like conditions and my skin is SO dry it is horrible.</li>
            <li> mean it&#x27;s shea butter</li>
            <li> This on my skin and at a pool is heaven if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> So I give it four stars only because of the gritty texture and awful smell</li>
            <li> Seriously, buy something else.</li>
            <li> It wasted a lot because the tubs were so thin and poorly made.</li>
            <li> It smells awful, but I&#x27;m pregnant</li>
            <li> Its not greasy, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and is obviously not over processed.  </li>
            <li> That was definitely a bad batch, got into the middle of it and the smell was unbearable.</li>
            <li> It is harder when it&#x27;s cold than the one I had before</li>
            <li> The smell is not good but it works wonder and does its job.</li>
            <li> He no longer suffers from those dry, itchy patches behind his knee.</li>
            <li> This particular shea butter had an awful smell, not sure what it was</li>
            <li> The smell is not pleasant, all all.</li>
            <li> Needless to day after getting off the phone, I was still not satisfied and was searching for the seller contact information</li>
            <li> Looks like dirty oil after melting it down.</li>
            <li> so they weren&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s been a pain since I can&#x27;t go through 32 oz in a single shot.</li>
            <li> This winter has been tough on the East Coast and I never go out in the weather without a layer of this Shea Butter on all exposed skin.</li>
            <li> Upon some research I found that this is very common.</li>
            <li> I got tired of putting petroleum jelly on my feet (chemicals).  </li>
            <li> when the product arrived the container was broken.....</li>
            <li> This caused the shea butter to be broken into chunks with plastic shards embedded in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thanks are jus disgusting.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter came in a unnecessary sized container.</li>
            <li> but when I got it the container was broken.</li>
            <li> Container was broken when I got it.</li>
            <li> I thought it must have broken during the shipping but the broken off piece of the plastic container was not even in the box which means that this was dropped and damaged BEFORE it was sent to me.</li>
            <li> It was shipped out already broken.</li>
            <li> I emailed him stating what he has up is false advertisement and</li>
            <li> the issue at hand is you did not state it on the page of advertisement and there for its false and</li>
            <li> This is NOT a good product!</li>
            <li> So, my son and I were a little disappointed about this matter.</li>
            <li> Either way, while it&#x27;s not a pleasant scent, I don&#x27;t think it stinks, either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> yes its hard but when its in the hands of rubbed into the skin it does melt, and it has the shea butter smell which is not too bad</li>
            <li> I ordered the 32oz option and even though it arrived on time &amp; in a usable condition the container it arrived in wasn&#x27;t just cracked, but broken!</li>
            <li> Not Cool at all!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have no reason to believe anything is wrong with the product.</li>
            <li> Difficult to spread without crumbling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed because in the past 4 orders it&#x27;s always been in a container,  but I received 32 ounces of Shea Butter in a ziploc bag.</li>
            <li> I AM SO SORRY</li>
            <li> Cannot go wrong if looking for Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> and the color was wrong as well.</li>
            <li> Also, the packaging was very poor and busted up during shipping.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this because I do not want my product to dry up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know...but either way, I am disappointed in this broken container.</li>
            <li> ITS FEELS HORRIBLE, I BLENDED IT, MELTED IT DOWN AND WHISK IT</li>
            <li> It is dirty and needed filtering.</li>
            <li> I was unhappy with the container because the rim cracked in to shards when I opened it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s dirty,</li>
            <li> I will be using it in my cold process soaps.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> There is a VERY faint smell which doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> but it is annoying that the lid is useless.</li>
            <li> The container it came in was a very thin plastic one that was cracked--DID NOT affect the product whatsoever!</li>
            <li> The scent also fades and becomes very faint on the skin.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and a waste of my money!!!</li>
            <li> I suspect not all ivory shea butter smells this bad; there was probably a problem with this sample.</li>
            <li> i need it for my bad skin</li>
            <li> Since this does not go bad I plan on buying another batch asap...</li>
            <li> I like the generous sized tub, and the smell isn&#x27;t bad like I&#x27;d read elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to any one with bad skin</li>
            <li> in the end product, it wasn&#x27;t bad--</li>
            <li> which I thought the price wasn&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> HARD AS A ROCK!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing from this company for years now, and I have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, would not purchase again, should have gone for the organic.</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> It just wasn&#x27;t what I was wanting/needing :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Try it for yourselves, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Can not use to make my body creams. : (</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate to just throw it away</li>
            <li> I hate this</li>
            <li> I hate this</li>
            <li> Smell awful and looks dirty brown.</li>
            <li> Ever wonder what you need in the base for a Homemade Whipped body Butter?  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> The packaging is awful.</li>
            <li> Really disgusting.</li>
            <li> This happened to arrive the day after I had been cleaning overgrown brush from a vacant lot &amp; came in contact with cedar resin which caused a horrible itchy rash all over my arms &amp; legs.</li>
            <li> Smells awful!</li>
            <li> It did not have any scent at all but the packaging containers are TERRIBLE they literally crumbled</li>
            <li> I HATE this!</li>
            <li> so everything smells awful</li>
            <li> BUT THIS ONE IS HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> Too greasy, it felt like a glop of lard, came in a take-out food container with no official label, and it smelled real bad, I threw it out!!!</li>
            <li> This is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this stuff! Great product, smells as expected, leaves the skin feeling soft and  versatile for various recipes and using it all over my body + hair as swimming in chlorinated pool daily.</li>
            <li> Made a wonderful whip with coconut oil (solid) and almond oil....then going to add essential oils to make &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; creams! This stuff whipped up beautifully, might just use it without the smell goods! Would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter I now make some of my own natural hair products, also great price !</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t mix it with other oils to use for my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is very gritty in texture but makes my skin so soft. Recently I purchase scented shea butter (mango peach)from Butters-n-Bars while the smell is sooo delicious it doesn&#x27;t make my skin as soft as this one. So I give it four stars only because of the gritty texture and awful smell but I would most definitely recommend to people with dry skin!!</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my face and arms.  I haven&#x27;t had to microwave it as some have recommended.  Rubbing it in my palms heats it up enough to go on smooth.  I can see a reduction in the lines around my eyes and my skin feels soft and more elastic.  I will buy it again....Eventually, this tub is going to last a long while</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described. This variety, this product from this seller, is much better than the yellow variety of shea butter or Kpang. butter being sold has shea butter. I find this product to be just as it was described, firm yet creamy, not hard at all. Has a slight nutty smell and does not seem to have any debris in it. I have seen little black specks from time to time. I use this product for my hair and body and mix it with a variety of other oils and conditioners for hair and body, or I use it alone for both.  It REALLY softens my skin. The yellow variety of this, does not moisturize as well. The price was an excellent price, even with the shipping for the amount received.  As for the seller, I contacted him shortly after placing the order, as I forgot to that I wanted to add cocoa butter to the same order, and the seller responded that I could update the order. However, after responding to the email and sending several other emails regarding completing the transaction, the seller never responded and I was not able to add the additional product to the order. I sent an email to him/them expressing my irritation at being ignored, and again I was ignored. Needless to say I was less than impressed with the customer service, or lack of. I would think they would be willing to accommodate a customer if they are asking to place additional orders. I would probably hesitate to purchase again, even though I just sent my sister the link to purchase the shea butter.</li>
            <li> Great value. Perfect base for making beauty products. I used it to make a shaving cream (heated it with other things, then refrigerated it and whipped with mixer) and it worked great. Came in gallon bag.</li>
            <li> I had been using the &amp;#34;gold shea&amp;#34; butter, which was ok, but very thick. This is slighly smoother, and lighter, with a milder scent than the gold shea butter and fits my needs perfectly. Plus a little goes a long way so I feel like this is a great value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this TWICE and have been VERY happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Very low odor ... no odor at all after being melted and mixed with beeswax and coconut oil. I&#x27;m using it to make body butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This arrives in a tall plastic container... very basic. It is clearly hand-packed. Not fancy at all. So don&#x27;t be surprised when you get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those who say it has been rancid ... my guess is that if it has been stored in a hot place, either in Africa or here in the US, it could very well turn rancid. I would also think it would melt and be more solidly &amp;#34;packed&amp;#34; in the container, instead of looking &amp;#34;hand scooped.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my experience with this brand and Amazon Prime&#x27;s wonderful low price has been excellent and I purchased my first order during warm Fall weather. It arrived very fast (2 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a THIRD order of this coming ...</li>
            <li> This is such a great product. It is really great on our skin. Myself and my daughters are all fair skined and need extra moisture. This works great!</li>
            <li> I bought this Shea Butter to make my own lotion and I was very happy with the amount, the packaging and the way the Shea Butter reacted in my recipe.</li>
            <li> Best Shea Butter I have ever used</li>
            <li> Great product highly recommend it</li>
            <li> the only thing i disliked was that it came in a plastic bag! not cool!</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter!  I had to switch all my homemade lotions to shea butter after finding I was allergic to beeswax.  It is so nice not having to do anything but whip the butter and add my essential oils!  I have never used a better moisturizer!  Will be ordering again very soon!</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter has everything I could possibly ask for! It comes with a very low price tag and has a whole lot of quality and quantity! This tub will last me more than 3 months since you only need very little to cover a large area. Fantastic! If you are looking for shea butter I believe this is the one to get!</li>
            <li> best raw shea butter I have bought on amazon I plan on purchasing more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;great product and great price I lovvvvve itvery happy costumer thank you please keep selling this one</li>
            <li> The packaging is awful. The container was split open when I received it. I finally made some shaving cream using the shea butter and when I use it, it smells like cigarette smoke. Really disgusting.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Came four days early. The packaging is poor, but it doesn&#x27;t matter in the long run.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product.  Quick service from the seller.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and very nice product. I made some lotion bars with just this shea butter, coconut oil and beeswax and they are perfection- soothing and nourishing to hands, lips, anywhere needed!</li>
            <li> I really like how smooth this is and how it will last for so long.  The smell isn&#x27;t strong and the shea butter is smooth.  I use it on my skin and hair for extra conditioning.  I really like it and will purchase again :-)</li>
            <li> how come its called Smell Good product when there is nothing about it that smells good.It is just the regular Shea butter,just harnessed.</li>
            <li> Great so far! Recommending it to all who are interested to try it. You will have no regrets. I have proven this product.</li>
            <li> very large container.  Beautiful and Soft shea butter!! im in heaven and my skin is too!! The shipper was able to have product shipped within a reasonable timeframe</li>
            <li> The Shea butter I received was not ivory, but the same regular, yellow kind you can find at most beauty supply stores. I could&#x27;ve just made a 5 minute trip to my local beauty supply instead of ordering this &amp;#34;ivory&amp;#34; Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Good stuff..definitely natural shea butter. Worth a try.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best batch of raw, unrefined, ivory Shea Butter that I have ever purchased online. Upon opening the box I could immediately smell the rich scent of the Shea butter. It was a deep and almost passionate scent, hard to describe. To touch, this stuff was like silk. A tiny amount was taken and I spread it on both hands. There was no greasy film left, at all. My dry, cracked hands were left with a light layer of a earthy smelling felt.&lt;br /&gt;I used this to make lip balm as well as body butter for my son who has severe eczema. After adding a few other minor ingredients and using this on his skin daily after bathing, for the first time in years his skin cleared completely and showed zero signs of eczema the rest of a VERY long cold season.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering and using raw shea butter for years and many of those orders were from Amazon.  This was high quality butter without the grainy texture I&#x27;ve sometimes gotten which I don&#x27;t mind since it melts so easily into warm skin.  It smelled good, like fresh raw shea butter.  It&#x27;s color was a mild yellowish beige and of course the benefits to my skin are amazing. It arrived in  2 heavy duty zipped baggies.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> I love this product, working well for my baby bump... my hair... pretty much the whole body.. i highly recommend it</li>
            <li> As always the perfect consitancy for incorporating into your body butter recipes. However, I have found all shea butters take on a granular consitancy after being heated. I don&#x27;t know how to get around this. The granulation is a real downer esp when you are expecting a very smooth buttery cream for your self indulgence.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awsome and priced right. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I had a recipe for homemade Foot Balm, the shea butter was one of the ingredients.  I was pleased with the product and the way my recipe turned out. What more could you ask for.  It even arrived at my home earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> When I received my product, I noticed that there was a large hole on the side of the container. At the bottom of the container, there were cracks on it as if someone had dropped it on the ground or on something pointy (hence the hole in the side). The hole was taped over by some packaging tape. I am very disappointed in this because I do not want my product to dry up. Could they not have given me another container? Or maybe it was shipping. I don&#x27;t know...but either way, I am disappointed in this broken container.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry winter skin.  Water repellant, but very greasy.  I only use this before bedtime as it&#x27;s too greasy to wear during the day in order to avoid accidentally getting it in your hair or on clothes.  It&#x27;s solid when cool, so it must be heated to become soft.</li>
            <li> I got this and they put It in the mailbox in Arizona in the summer, so it was a mess to say the least but I put it in the freezer and it was fine, again the product was good but the service was less than good</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve worked with this product.  Since purchasing it I found out alot of sellers deliver refined or modified shea butter and try to pass them off as unrefined.  Not the case with this purchase.  It did have a light fragrance, but it was easily covered with essential oil.  It worked wonderfully with the recipes I tried (it was mixed with coconut oil and essential oil fragrance), and the finished product was smooth, and very moisturizing to the skin.  It did leave a slightly sticky feeling on the skin for about 10 minutes, but this goes away and leaves your skin very soft.  it can also be used as a shower scrub when mixed with shower gel (or coconut or olive oil), along with some sugar or salt.  It breaks down and easily rinses off with warm water.  Great as a moisturizing finish at the end of a shower.  By the way, if your shea butter purchase is yellow (not ivory) or light green, it has been modified - it is not unrefined.  Just a heads up  :&#x27;)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect after reading other reviews. This product is great. There is a VERY faint smell which doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It was packaged in a resealable plastic bag. I took it out and put in Tupperware. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product...we first thought that it shouldn&#x27;t come in clumps in the container but that is because the seller doesn&#x27;t melt it down (which can take away some of the shea butter&#x27;s properties) so that it looks better in the container.&lt;br /&gt;We absolutely love this product as it is just great for any skin type!</li>
            <li> I love ivory shea butter. This has been the only thing to help with my son&#x27;s severe eczema. He no longer suffers from those dry, itchy patches behind his knee. I bought it for my son, but my husband and I use it too and I got 3 other family members hooked on it. It also works great to smooth out rough feet. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because when I received the product, the conainer was busted on both sides with the shea butter oozing out. I have purchased this several times before from a different vendor and never experienced any issues with shipping. Amazon is great and made it all better by refunding my money. So still a great product and we will see how shipping goes next time.</li>
            <li> The best Shea butter I have ever had. Fast delivery. Great Price.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 2 lb offer from XTREMEK and got 2lbs + 2 oz. I wanted Ivory &amp; that&#x27;s what I received. There is A mild smell of Shea. I have used the yellow but couldn&#x27;t stand the over powering smell. This is a very nice product and it goes on smooth and silky on your skin. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. It is just as discribed and I will order again from you when I run low. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I love my Shea butter!  I not only use it in my hair mixture, but also on my face. It has cleared up my dark spots a great deal</li>
            <li> Use it on skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Shea butter for four months and am perfectly happy with it. I use it primarily as a full body lotion as is and love how soft my skin is (eve my heals). It&#x27;s also good in recipes for both skin and hair. As a side note, while visiting my sis I had a little of this in a travel jar. I was using it, turned my back and when I turned back around my pit bull nephew was licking it up like ice cream! Even he loves the stuff.</li>
            <li> Worked great to make body butter!</li>
            <li> The product is good. people say ivory shea butter smells less strong than yellow, but I think they smell the same.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 32oz option and even though it arrived on time &amp; in a usable condition the container it arrived in wasn&#x27;t just cracked, but broken! Also, what i received was not 32oz, but 28oz. Although the product works well, what I paid for and received is not what was advertised.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shea butter in it&#x27;s unrefined form. Fabulous price for such a wonderful product. Will definitely be purchasing from them again. Their service was wonderful, delivery was super fast and the prices can&#x27;t be beat. Definite Recommend!! A+++</li>
            <li> Perfect for making my bath &amp; beauty products - very light color and no strong aroma :)</li>
            <li> I had to return this. Smells like chemicals, green and extremely greasy. Smells worse than vaseline, and couldn&#x27;t even cover it up with peppermint essential oil (which is really strong!) Plus the container was damaged and it had spilled all over the box that it was shipped in. This is not Shea Butter. This is some chemical mixture that is so far from Shea Butter it is not even funny.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t exactly what I thought I was getting. It was yellow. It seems to work well for my purposes. I use it mainly as an after shower cream.</li>
            <li> It is soft and creamy as described.  I use it everyday for my entire body.  I use it in my hair my children&#x27;s hair too.  I have been purchasing from this company for years now, and I have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> This happened to arrive the day after I had been cleaning overgrown brush from a vacant lot &amp; came in contact with cedar resin which caused a horrible itchy rash all over my arms &amp; legs. After trying calamine lotion, vinegar, baking soda, cortaid &amp; allegra anti-allergy creams, I finally decided to apply this shea butter to calm my raw, sore, swollen arms. The relief was wonderful! The itching stopped almost completely and the healing process was accelerated by moisurizing my skin with this natural product (I know this because I did not apply it to my legs &amp; they took much longer to heal). The smell was pleasant and although solid in the tub, the shea butter spread very easily after it came in contact with the warmth of my hand. I used this many times a day for 3 weeks and still have almost a full container left. I will definitely purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> I use this shea butter along with coconut oil and almond oil to make my own body butter, and it has been the best moisturizer I have ever used. It has cleared up patches of dry skin that I have struggled with for years.</li>
            <li> I ordered Ivory shea butter. When I opened the container it had chunks of gold shea butter mixed in as well as odd colored pieces. Could not tell the color (ivory or gold). This was about 1/4 of my 32 oz. I did not appreciate that at all. I could have waited (if asked) for them to get enough IVORY shea butter to ship me. I did not want anything else. So basically I paid for 32 oz, but received (can only use) 24oz. Not Cool at all!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t arrive by the date it was said(+2 days) without notice. product is good.</li>
            <li> Came as advertised and was just what I was looking for. Shea Butter works well in my mustache wax formula.</li>
            <li> Wonderful quality with a wide range of uses  I reduced my review to 3 stars - despite storing the container in a cool darks space it has totally come apart.  The sides have developed significant cracks and the top has just come apart in my hands as I opened it. It is now unusable.  If you buy it make a point of transferring the contents into a different container.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The only problem is when I opened the box, the container that it came in is plastic and the lid was cracked and broken. It didn&#x27;t harm the shea butter at all but it is annoying that the lid is useless. The shea butter is amazing and smells wonderful. It just needs to be in a better container.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is okay just messy.  Don&#x27;t have a good smell. Will cause you to use more than you need because&lt;br /&gt;its form.</li>
            <li> I use these to make  hand and foot creams.  I got tired of putting petroleum jelly on my feet (chemicals).  These work well.  I mix  (I use a hand mixer)  one part carrier oil (coconut, jojoba, aloe vera) to 3-5 parts of room temp shea, and voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unrefined shea butter has a musky odor--some people don&#x27;t like it.  You can get the refined butter without the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t have the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the shea odor, it takes A LOT (like 50 drops) of essential oil to scent a 4 oz container.  I also have fragrance oils (largely synthetic), but I only use these with friends who can tolerate synthetic  fragrances  (people with multiple chemical sensitivities can really be affected by scents in colgnes, perfumes, soaps, CANDLES, laundry detergent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an easy &amp;#34;butter creme&amp;#34; for hand and foot creme, shea butter works well.  It melts on your skin fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this form of shea butter becauseof the price and quantity. I read tons of wonderful reviews on this product.  It says it is soft and creamy but it is hard and doesn&#x27;t rub on very well.  Dont get me wrong, shea butter is one of the best ingredients you can get for your skin, but it needs to be mixed with other quality ingredients to make it a little more spreadable.  I recommend Shea Touch, but it is a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the hubby to treat his psoriasis with. It smells good for shea butter and was filled right to the top of the container.</li>
            <li> I like how the skin become after using pure Shia butter but I hate the smell of it, organic and pure that&#x27;s why I tried to mix it with cacao butter and I like it</li>
            <li> This is an excellent buy! For the price and the amount it was great. But I will say on the first day of using some of the Shea butter with nothing else, it felt very rough on my skin and it took time for the rough texture to blend. But once I put the Shea butter with other oils, it was fabulous and the roughness went away. So I know it just needs to melt a little or just be mixed with an oil.</li>
            <li> My sister loves it...</li>
            <li> It came in clumps in the tub so is it really 32oz</li>
            <li> Just got it and so far works great. My skin is feeling better with the use of  jojaba oil and black soap.</li>
            <li> I do wish it smelt better but love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is the best! It is unscented so I have the opportunity to add the scented oils of my choice. There are several recipes online for making homemade cold cream. It is soft enough to scoop out into a mixing bowl and mix with oils. I added Argan oil to it and blended it. Since I have been using this my skin is much softer and creamier. I definitely will be buying this Shea Butter again.</li>
            <li> I am very familiar with butters for my product line.  This is the first time I ordered from this company. The product photo showed a plastic container, and instead this shea came in plastic bags.  The product is great, I admit.  But the photo is deceiving to buyers.</li>
            <li> Well, it is an amazing product. Exactly what it says...color and size are legit. I&#x27;ve already recommended it to a friend!!</li>
            <li> My hands would be cracked and bleeding if not for this stuff</li>
            <li> Mix it with 40% shea, 40% coconut oil, and 20% olive/other oil to make it soft at room temperature, and add a few essential oils.  This is my go-to product for diaper creme, hair conditioning oil, skin and foot lotion, wound salve, etc.</li>
            <li> Did not come in container as shown.  At first I was worried at how had and crumbly it was, but, after I slow warmed and added my other oils and fragrance it became pretty smooth. Good value!</li>
            <li> this is a great product! i bought this awhile ago but decided id stop by to write a review. this shea butter is great for hair, it makes it more manageable and makes hair very soft. i use this in almost all my skin and hair products, its a must have! the packaging is great and so is the quality. you cant beat the price and thats why im sure to buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> This is a super great product.  It is the best I have tried for dry skin.  I have tried many others but this is a winner.</li>
            <li> I have purchased shea butter many times in the past. I use it on my body and on my natural locs. This is fresh, has good scent, and was a great value for the price. Will purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Amazing shea butter! This is awesome stuff and such a great price too. Natural, unrefined. Does amazing things for my skin. I also use it to make lotion, lip balm, and other items with. I will be ordering two order this week because I love this stuff so much.</li>
            <li> This product is great for anyone wanting to make their own lotions.  It has a great consistency and is easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Love this. Using the shea butter in massage and for personal skin care. Economical through this resource. Thank you! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great quality product at a great price! I will definitely purchase again. Exactly what I needed for making quality home beauty products!</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this shea butter and will be purchasing again in a couple days just to stock up. The smell is amazing, the texture is amazing melts easily and not hard but more pasty. I use this on my dry hair and the hair loves it. I also use this on my skin, I don&#x27;t add anything else to it as I feel it doesn&#x27;t need it. The amount is generous considering the amount you pay so it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Smooth as always with all the products I buy from this particular name. This is the product I look for rather it&#x27;s ivory or regular Shea butter.</li>
            <li> This was my first time ever buying shea butter, and I am 100% happy with what I received. No bad smell, everything is perfect , and i&#x27;m sure this volume will last me for a while:D</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the smell, overpowered my homemade body butter. Disappointed, would not purchase again, should have gone for the organic.</li>
            <li> It was smooth and creamy, the continer was brittle and a little difficult to open for me i cracked the side so be gentle. Overall, I would purchase this product again.  I love it.</li>
            <li> worked great for my lip glosses I made</li>
            <li> The product is slightly gritty, but it all rubs in eventually. We use it for after-sport muscle rubs, and it does the job at the right price for us.</li>
            <li> The packaging was a little sloppy but the Shea Butter was awesome! Don&#x27;t mind the packaging for the price I paid!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s delivered on time, good smell and i do like it.. Just thought it will come in plastic container rather than plastic bag..</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance and unrefined.  Seam fairly clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying the yellow shea butter and thought I&#x27;d try the white one. This had a sharp, rancid smell that I couldn&#x27;t stand. I didn&#x27;t even use it. Threw it out and purchased the yellow, which has the nutty aroma I am used to. I suspect not all ivory shea butter smells this bad; there was probably a problem with this sample. But I&#x27;ll stick to the yellow and won&#x27;t take any chances!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing like Shea butter to keep the winter dryness away. Keeps hands from cracking and bleeding. Also prevents chapped lips. Great stuff. This was such a large amount that I may never have to guy it again. Or not for a very long time.</li>
            <li> This shea butter did not come as pictured. It is dirty and needed filtering. Looks like dirty oil after melting it down.</li>
            <li> It does not feel or smell like shea butter to me. Perhaps it is not the 100 %  pure shea I am used to.  The service was prompt and it was a lot of product  for the money spent. I don&#x27;t think I will purchase again though.</li>
            <li> Every now and again I will order something from amazon (dont like their method of shipping) but I stick 99% with Ebay. Ebay gives more options of free shipping and there descriptions of product is way better. Now with that I said I have order this product of shea butter (2 of them) and was all excited to receive them, as I am a person of making my own hair products and am natural! When using or buying shea butter, I always email the seller and ask them questions such as: Is this 100% organic butter unrefined? Are there add chemicals in this products to make it refined? Now even those there is no way of knowing if the product is 100% real quality, until you get in your hands you have to trust the seller response and loyalty.&lt;br /&gt;  Like I said I was all excited to get my shea butter only to be disappointed that is was not as stated in the description (or shown in the picture display!) The picture shows smooth and solid consistency when I opened it up I was expecting just that, but I got 32 0z of chucks. Clearly I did not get what I paid. Upon opening the package up the quality of the shea butter is good Ivory color and yes its hard but when its in the hands of rubbed into the skin it does melt, and it has the shea butter smell which is not too bad, im use too the smell. I have not really test the butter out as I am waiting for my oils (Iherbs.com it the best I found for oils) to come so I can make my hair product but I have looked though the chucks and make sure I didnt see any hairs or such and its fine.&lt;br /&gt;  I also called amazon customer service and complain and after stated what the issue was amazon emailed me a label to send it back and then I would get my return money, the guy said \\&quot;amazon shipped it out\\&quot; after a few seconds it registered what he said. So apparently amazon has a warehouse where the seller 1. either ships there products to this warehouse and when a buyer pays for it amazon ships it out. 2. or amazon has the product and package it and ship it too you, which Im sure its number 1. But there is something that states it on a few seller pages I have been too! Needless to day after getting off the phone, I was still not satisfied and was searching for the seller contact information and I didnt see it so i did a chat to amazon. Once again I explained and I stated too the person \\&quot;I dont think its fair I have to wait again to send this back to the seller and wait for them to refund my money, they sure didnt wait to take the money out my account\\&quot;. The person understood and helped me more then what the person did over the phone, they issued my money back that night and it hit my account the next business, I also got the seller email address.&lt;br /&gt;  Now, if I was close by the seller I would have had a few choice words for him. I emailed him stating what he has up is false advertisement and no where do it states it may or will come in chucks, and I doubled check to make sure i didnt over look it. Which the person emailed me right back and said \\&quot;sorry for the inconvenience, but appearance of shea butter depends on packaging technique! Those who melt it and pour it gets a smooth surface. However, healing properties may be destroyed during  heating.....1. when its chopped and weight its more precise and 2. all healing properties are preserved as the butter was not heated\\&quot;. Excuse me, (My few choice words was rising but I kept it professional and emailed the person back) and said something like \\&quot;I did not ask you about the different methods of shea butter and its process of coming smooth or staying in chucks. I know about shea butter and the process of melting it down (if your not careful.) your not telling me anything I dont already know. the issue at hand is you did not state it on the page of advertisement and there for its false and if your going to do business then do your business right as a seller! All you stated to me about shea butter you need to add that on the page for those who dont know.\\&quot; Needless to say the person reply right back (for that great on answering me back) and said \\&quot;you have a good point. I&#x27;ll recommend adding more details to the product description as well as updating images.\\&quot; My job was finished and ended with a thank you for your time and speedy response on the matter :)! The product is good needless to say and very fast shipping I got it a day early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Yes I will be stick with Ebay Im happier over there and never have problems!</li>
            <li> Still my favorite.  I used it on my skin. Fresh and well sealed. Great for soaps and lotions.  Great instructions too. Give it a try you will like it.l my favorite. Good for the hair too.</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter. I spent a lot of time on amazon hoping and trying to find the real shea butter from sellers. some sellers tell you their shea butter is the real one but when you buy it and it reaches you, it&#x27;s totally different from what they said. am an African, born in Ghana, west Africa. Ghana is where to find the real shea butter it&#x27;s the best. so i know what a real shea butter looks like and you can&#x27;t fool me. the real shea butter is a white color not the yellow color. (although the yellow is picked in different season and sometimes some people add palm oil to it) a real shea butter is suppose to be white. when my shea butter arrived, it was exactly what is shown in the picture and as described. I was very happy. its a lot of shea butter in a big container and can last me for a long time. I mix my shea butter with natural oils for my hair as am in a hair transitioning (from relax to natural hair) and I can say this shea butter will last me for a long time. I will definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I am not very familiar with Shea butter in person so I cannot compare scents or texture but this seemed as expected. A bit tacky and greasy, but soaks in really nice on your skin. I am not sure the scent would be considered nutty, but it was not off putting and pleasant even (though not mouthwatering like some other oils/butters). I am very pleased with it&#x27;s quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emptied the contents into a bowl that was tared at zero on my scale, and I received a full 32 ounces which is great. Listing (from seller Practical Magic) did not state if it was by weight or volume, but it was 32oz by weight and was packed to the brim in the container. I am quite pleased, as some cocoa butter I ordered from another seller fell short on ounces (and was listed by weight, so very disappointing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints! It came in large chunks with little ones filling the gaps. No seal but with hand packed items I don&#x27;t scoff as I buy stuff like that from locals and Etsy, it is part of being a smaller business. I have no reason to believe anything is wrong with the product. Clear packing tape was used to hold the lid on tightly in shipment but the lid was well secured on its own. I am happy with my purchase so far!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this butter. I use it in my products and my customers love it. Will be ordering  again.</li>
            <li> Use it to make bodybutter and its great</li>
            <li> I have used regular Shea Butter before but this one is so much easier to use, nice &amp; creamy. Shea butter stays on my skin so much better than coconut oil and is also very healing. Great for sunning too :-)</li>
            <li> I bought this to help seal my natural curls hair do.  So far, its working GREAT!  Its not greasy, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and is obviously not over processed.  Packaging was good, no cracks in my container.</li>
            <li> The top of the plastic container cracked when I opened it, so it can&#x27;t be sealed.  The Shea butter is very grainy, and it is supposed to be smooth.  I won&#x27;t buy more from this seller.</li>
            <li> It mixes easily with the oils I use with it. I use it in skin and hair preparations. I&#x27;m very happy with it. I gave some to someone who added it to her scalp treatment. She (a beautician) was so pleased with it that she ordered her own.</li>
            <li> I read reviews and decided to go ahead an try The Ivory Shea Butter.Well Deliverer was great. Product was in 2 separted  Plastic containers. I have never actually seen any type of Ivory shea butter before. So I relied on reviews .Both Containers of Ivory Shea Butter Chucks.I planned on using to help my teenage daughters ,One of whom  has Juvenile Arthritis and it affect her Feet and Hands.My other Daughter with her Eczema .But shuffers from Juvenile Diabetes and her skin is always extremely dry.But anyways ,I was looking for something smooth to arrive.And since I know little about melting this without destroying the butter. I guess I have to Chunk it Out.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product ; plan to melt and whip up for appropriate skin care product with essential oil scent.  Can&#x27;t wait and will Order more.</li>
            <li> I tried this at a friend&#x27;s house and loved it so it was exactly what I ordered.  It works better than just lotion for super dry skin and it&#x27;s great on feet.</li>
            <li> This shea butter delivered what it promised. Shea butter is the best skin moisturizer for the skin. Lotion just dries out your skin a few hours later, but shea butter moisturizes all day. I put in on my baby&#x27;s skin. She has eczema and none of the lotions worked. This did!</li>
            <li> My wife wanted this shea butter, and i orderedd it for her.  She swears by it.  I do not like its smell when she puts it on, but then the smell fades away.</li>
            <li> Upon receipt of this product, i noticed that it had a ring of gray substance on the solid Shea butter, as if it had been overheated /burned then allowed to resolidify... The Shea butter itself was grainy and did not seem like the raw Shea butter I usually purchase. I was highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I only have 1 complaint....when the product arrived the container was broken.....I just transferred it to another container, the product seems to be ok and not dried out.</li>
            <li> I love shea butter.  The ivory is the best and most pure. (please see other post on shea butter for more details)  It is beneficial for moisturizing the body and can be used on the hair as well especially very dry or damaged hair.  It is very thick so if using in the hair use only a small amount.</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 star&#x27;s because it was grainy and I had to melt it down and let it solidify again. Other than that I&#x27;d probably buy again, because its affordable</li>
            <li> This was not smooth and creamy , it was more like clay and I bought 2 I still have it not using it and would never buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> I also researched many places and decided to buy from this seller as the product seemed correct and the packaging adequate.  However, when I received my Shea butter it came in a plastic container, similar to chinese take out food containers, and the lid was completely smashed in and the side of the container was broken.  This caused the shea butter to be broken into chunks with plastic shards embedded in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing aggravates me more than false advertising!  I actually chose this seller partly based on the packaging in the picture.  Nice, manageable cylindrical containers with a lid.  Now I have a broken up block of butter that has to be cleaned and transferred to several other containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing and I likely will not buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone told me this product was good for moisturizing your skin.  I found it very dry and had a funny smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several months now and it&#x27;s ok. It does make my feet look at feel better but by the next morning they look rough again. I put it on everyday regardless but my skin hasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;changed&amp;#34; since using it.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to get a container as the picture seemed but I didn&#x27;t.. instead I got a container that&#x27;s like a Chinese to-go bowl..&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I love it. I used to use this stuff all the time as a little kid mom always said \\&quot;Use this its good for your skin\\&quot;.. Bleh&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptic about it lol. But I use it anyway, and just like some reviewers say its soft and melts quickly into your hand at room temperature..&lt;br /&gt;Yes it has a smell but guys its natural shea butter so of course its not going to smell all good like the fake shea butter they sell in some stores&lt;br /&gt;this IS NATURAL STUFF right here.. I will order more of this when I run out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not oily like other things that I used to use..&lt;br /&gt;it leaves my skin feeling really good. I could have&lt;br /&gt;just bought this from the health store that&#x27;s close to me&lt;br /&gt;but they don&#x27;t have this size of it so I ordered it from amazon..&lt;br /&gt;GLAD I did!</li>
            <li> I never got the Ivory shea butter why am not sure what going on but please make it right i need it for my bad skin please</li>
            <li> Use it for my feet, hands, elbows and hair.  No disappointment with it in any of the areas. Good product</li>
            <li> This product is good for your skin, your whole body.  Great price tool</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this product at such a great price. I paid way too much for the exact same thing at a conference last year. The product is smooth and a perfect moisturizer for hair, nails and skin. My husband and son use it also, and we can&#x27;t say enough about how great it is. I especially love how soft my natural hair feels after using the Shea Butter to seal.  It&#x27;s just the icing on the cake that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> I have to give 5 stars because the seller was great to work with in fixing the address once my package was shipped. It arrived expediently. I&#x27;m just not sure it is what I asked for. In the picture its white but what I got was yellow and smells more like cocoa butter. I dont know if its shea butter because I know the smell of raw shea butter is pretty foul. Overall happy with the seller but not sure the product is what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Smells awful! Not like good quality shea butter should smell. Also, the packaging was very poor and busted up during shipping. Returning for a full refund. I have no use for this product.</li>
            <li> This Ivory Shea butter has done wonders for my 1 year old sons sensative skin. I used to use vaseline on his skin, but he still had a mild case of exzema. Since I started useing this product his skin has not only become clear &amp; even toned, it is also very soft and smooth. I would recommend this product to anyone. Exspecially if you want to acheive a even and smooth skin tone.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic moisturizer. I recently learned that I can whip it and create a heavenly moisturizer.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased shea butter before this, but bought it based on recommendations. Needless to say--I love it!  I can&#x27;t believe the extraordinary price for something this big!  It truly does soften up/melt once you rub it on your hand...and a little goes a long way!  It took away the dry itchiness on my pregnant belly, and immediately cured my dry skin!!</li>
            <li> This is not a high end overly refined product. Pretty raw and course but to make a hair conditioner with coconut oil it cc works great</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is thick. Wish it smelled better but I still use it because my skin is so dry. I mix it with coconut oil sometimes. It is very greasy but it also tones my skin nicely and eliminates dry skin. The size is great 2. Lasts me about 3 -4 months. I use it all over.</li>
            <li> I use this shea butter for soaping.  It is a very milk smelling, creaming product.  I also use it for lotion</li>
            <li> Bought this from the seller Halaleveryday. Instead of the smooth texture I was expecting it had a gritty texture. It also smells really, really similar to cocoa butter. It&#x27;s also not completely ivory, more of a off white beige color. This is the first time I ever bought shea butter, but I have a feeling this may not be real shea. On the other hand, it has kept my skin really soft and my hair moisturized. Doubt I&#x27;ll be buying from this seller anytime soon, however. Next time I&#x27;m buying from Coastal Scents or my local vitamin shop even if it&#x27;s a bit pricier.</li>
            <li> I have had this since 2013. Still have it and I use lotion a lot. Tons of shea butter in this container. Still fresh. Love it. Better than other lotions. I recommend this product. Very inexpensive. Great quality.</li>
            <li> It smells like shea butter is supposed to smell. It&#x27;s soft and is easily removable form the container. Great for hair and body mixes.</li>
            <li> I bought this expecting the &amp;#34;ivory&amp;#34; shea butter shown in the picture. I figured between the word &amp;#34;ivory&amp;#34; and the picture of white shea it would be white in color. It is not white in color at all but a yellowish color. I&#x27;m just trying to figure out why it was listed as ivory shea butter.</li>
            <li> This one isn&#x27;t as smooth as the other one going on. It has a little bit of a rough texture.</li>
            <li> Since this does not go bad I plan on buying another batch asap...&lt;br /&gt;Cold winters &#x3D; DRY CRACKED FEET....  but only a couple of days of using this directly from the tub....I&#x27;m very happy with how it works...&lt;br /&gt;I think it smells great...and I&#x27;m so glad i gave it a shot...</li>
            <li> I ordered this shea butter to make lotion bars and lip balms for Christmas presents. I had previously used refined shea butter but wanted to switch to unrefined because it is even better for your skin. My inexperienced opinion is that this is probably great quality, but I was not prepared for some of the differences between refined/unrefined. This has a strong buttery, nutty scent which does not seem overwhelming on its own, but overpowered the essential oils I added to it. I kept melting it back down and adding more oils, but they had a really hard time coming through the shea butter smell. There is also a fair amount of dark grit (I&#x27;m assuming pieces of shell) throughout the butter which then ended up settling at the bottom of my lotion bars.&lt;br /&gt;Overall: feels great on your skin and doesn&#x27;t smell unpleasant on its own, but maybe not the best choice if using in a project.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  I like that it&#x27;s chunky; you just have to pick up a chunk and rub it in your hands for it to quickly melt.  Kind of stinky, but I only use it at nite anyway.</li>
            <li> good, wish was a little cheaper though or gave wholesale deals. It did not have any scent at all but the packaging containers are TERRIBLE they literally crumbled</li>
            <li> So far we&#x27;ve had no problems with this product, we&#x27;re using it in our solid lotion bars.  It melts in both microwave and on stove top, and we&#x27;ve seen no graininess.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the container and very pleased with the quality of the product.  It makes an excellent moisturizer.  I combined it with coconut oil and olive oil and made a terrific body butter.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> We love shea butter in our home!  Whether it&#x27;s for DIY deoderant, DIY conditioner, DIY hand lotion....the list could go on.  :)</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product!  Glad that I could fine pure Shea Butter online.  Awesome moisturizer for my face and body.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I usein home made lotions and hair products. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I do hair,dreadlocks specifically and I normally use yellow shea butter mixes.i tried mixes with these n my guests complain that it leaves white flakes in their hair,which is true so I won&#x27;t be using this again in hair,I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t be too bad for the skin though because it melts</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think this was shea butter, had a different color and aroma than other shea butters I&#x27;ve purchased. Oh well...</li>
            <li> great price, does the job!</li>
            <li> Feels amazing!!! Will purchase again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I know the &#x27;packaging may differ&#x27;, but I did not expect it to be in a zippy bag.  Just saying.  I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product before and am very satisfied.  I do not use any other creams other than the Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> Great natural product. Smells and feels great. Super value for the price. I am so happy discovering this amazing product.</li>
            <li> I combined it with coconut oil and essential oils to make body butter. I split it up into several different batches and store them in canning jars.</li>
            <li> I use this shea butter for moisturizing skin but mainly in my hair. It is a bit greasy to be honest, but it makes a great pomade for guys and conditions your hair and makes it super soft.</li>
            <li> I melt it in the microwave. That works fine, but I don&#x27;t always feel like doing that. I like the generous sized tub, and the smell isn&#x27;t bad like I&#x27;d read elsewhere. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great product! Very smooth and was exactly like seen on website.I will order more soon as this one is finished.</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome, very good for makin soap with and hair products. can&#x27;t live without it! love it !</li>
            <li> this is the real deal. It has multi-purpose use. I bought it for my 11month old infant&#x27;s sinus congestion and runny nose. She always had runny nose. This Shea butter cleared it up pretty well. She is still congested but she&#x27;s not messy around the nose area. She did break out though when I first applied it to her chest and nose area. But it cleared after I used desitin and also by itself. I use it for massage therapy when I had muscle pain and it helped relax and decrease the pain.  I also will be using it for skin purposes, as it makes your skin smooth and moisturised.  Wonder butter from nature, Almighty God&#x27;s gift to mankind!!!</li>
            <li> The whipped butter I make from this is a hit in my family and with my friends. They call it creamy crack because they can&#x27;t get enough. We use it on hair and skin. The amount has lasted us a while and as I say in the heading I will buy, buy, and buy more of this to ensure I don&#x27;t run out. The smell is not strong at all and blends well with essential oils.  I&#x27;ve had issues with odoriferous shea purchases in the past so to me this is important. Delivery was adequate to pretty average, not very quick but not taking too long.</li>
            <li> Great. Product as described.</li>
            <li> Packaging was lacking,  Other than that, it&#x27;s a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected after reading lots of reviews.  In fact, better, as some people complained, but I find it just fine.  I like to mix it with other ingredients to make a nice moisturizing cream.   I also use it as a lip balm straight.   There are a l to of uses for this shea butter.   it&#x27;s a popular ingredient in a lot of cosmetics but they usually only us a small amount so it can be on the list.   This way I get the pure butter and can use as much as I want to get the effect that i want.</li>
            <li> It blends well and is quite smooth.  Odor is great, I am expecting great thing for my skin and hair.  I will use and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Well I used the yellow shea butter now I am using the ivory shea butter it is ok I like it</li>
            <li> The item arrived in a plastic bag....what am I supposed to do with a plastic bag of Shea butter? I use it as my lotion....am I just supposed to leave a huge plastic bag of what looks like lard on my bathroom counter next to my tooth brush?? I&#x27;m a 30 year old single girl and an item like that on ones bathroom counter will do nothing but insure that one remains single...retuning it promptly!</li>
            <li> My order came in on time..and I&#x27;ve been using this Shea Butter for almost two weeks now...I have severe dry skin(cracked/calus) on my feet... this product has made a MAJOR improvement on my feet...I also use this product all over my body to repair dark blemishes from previous acne scarring, which has worked well-the blemishes have improved thus far but hope to continue fading as long as I use this...I also use it for my 3yr old son-for his light case of ezcema...I would highly recommend this product for any one suffering from dry skin/acne scarring/natural hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is very creamy and it goes on smooth. I have bought other shea butter products in the past and I think this one is the best so far!</li>
            <li> This batch of Shea Butter was definitely not smooth and creamy like Shea Butter should be. It was very gritty and made my homemade body butter not set up right. It would probably be ok to use in soap though (I hope... we&#x27;ll see. I&#x27;d hate to just throw it away and it&#x27;s too much trouble to send back!). Great price, but definitely going to order from somewhere else next time.</li>
            <li> we use it to make soap, it works, and the price is right</li>
            <li> This is good quality shea butter. I used it alone and to mix in cosmetics. I was unhappy with the container because the rim cracked in to shards when I opened it. I wish the container was a bit sturdier but the product is great.</li>
            <li> Great for my skin I mix it with other oils.</li>
            <li> This container was filled with the yellow shea butter and not ivory. So, my son and I were a little disappointed about this matter. However, I had bought it for my younger son, and he uses it to moisturize his skin because he has psoriasis. Even though the color stained his socks yellow, it does keep his skin moisturized all day long. So, he likes it, but still prefer the ivory color. :)</li>
            <li> It may not be this products fault, but my husband&#x27;s itching became 10 times worse immediately following application.  Difficult to spread without crumbling.  Very messy.</li>
            <li> Good deal.  I use this to make my own shea butter.  Very easy to do.  Whips up nicely to form a smooth lotion.</li>
            <li> I mix this with coconut butter for my face/skin.&lt;br /&gt;ts wonderful and would highly reccomend it.&lt;br /&gt;for your skin. I use it on my face. Long lasting&lt;br /&gt;and could not ask for more.</li>
            <li> I love the Shea butter. I&#x27;m disappointed because in the past 4 orders it&#x27;s always been in a container,  but I received 32 ounces of Shea Butter in a ziploc bag.</li>
            <li> I am so grateful that I don&#x27;t have to melt this Shea butter whenever I have to use it. I would have rated it five stars but every time I use it, it makes my hair itch. I&#x27;ll try mixing it with some of my oils and see if that helps. over all, best quality Shea butter I have used.</li>
            <li> Good quality shea butter.</li>
            <li> Good quality, well packaged but a bit too pungent, not a surprise though.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend hates the smell, I love it lol OOPS&lt;br /&gt;Anywayyyyss I boiled it first and I think you should too just in case but I use it on my hair. before I wash it out I melt it with a blow dryer and I use hot water and shampoo twice and then condition and my hair comes out so thick and soft! It also quickly absorbs in your skin. I live in Michigan and it got here very quickly. I WILL BE BUYING AGAIN!!!</li>
            <li> I have used many different Shea butters in the past and this is excellent. It arrived much faster than I expected so that was great. It is raw ( so it is yellow) and exactly what I wanted to make deodorant with. I immediately put it into different containers which I had planned to do anyway so I could share it with my daughter. The container it came in was a very thin plastic one that was cracked--DID NOT affect the product whatsoever! For the price this stuff is a great bargain and I will definitely buy from them again!!</li>
            <li> This is real shea butter and it is great and inexpensive  Get it if shea butter is what you need.</li>
            <li> The container was cracked in transit. I purchased it to combat eczema and dryness around a tattoo. It is a little gritty and a little hard but if you rub it between your hands to warm it up it goes on well and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Not as we were expecting. It was not really refined like we were expecting. Might be ok for someone else&#x27;s basic use, just didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li> This particular shea butter had an awful smell, not sure what it was but I don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> This product was okay. The shipping was fine it came in double bags in a box. The problem with this product was it was like a brownish tanish color. I don&#x27;t know if it was supposed to look like or what. But it&#x27;s not white like it is in the picture.</li>
            <li> Would order this item again....just what I needed</li>
            <li> This shea butter had an almost brown color,  and the smell was so strong I nearly gagged.  I am certain this batch was not very fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this one quite a few times and always got a different result.  The only thing that I dislike is that it verys from the ivory color that it claims to sometimes dark yellow.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF..... This stugg works so good for my skin...I would recommend to any one with bad skin</li>
            <li> What can I say, I fell in love with Shea Butter years ago for my skin and hair and i&#x27;ve never gone back. Can be mixed with all the wonderful essential oils that you love and still be completely natural. I love the earthy smell or mix with coconut oil/almond oil/tea tree. You name it i&#x27;ve tried the mix.</li>
            <li> great stuff. Add essential oils and carrier oils to make fantastic skin creams</li>
            <li> I HATE this! I make handmade lotion and I got this as an ingredient, but the smell is so strong that you can&#x27;t even cover it up at all. Not only that, but it&#x27;s dirty, every lotion bar that I&#x27;ve made with this has little black specks in it thanks are jus disgusting. I hate this I hate this I have this. Seriously, buy something else. This is NOT a good product!</li>
            <li> Love this Shea Butter. Got it to make my homemade lotion. It will last me a long time! Smells good too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for soap making and it worked great. However, when I received it the container it came in (like a large chinese soup container) there was a big chunk of plastic that had been cracked and chipped off. The shea butter was in-tact though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m making a daily moisturizer out of Shea butter and 3other ingredient And that it, so the base is Shea butter it dose so much for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend thus for everyone.</li>
            <li> This shea butter has a nice nutty smell. I&#x27;ve used it to create a shea butter whipped moisturizer. When i rub it in my hands it feels slightly grainy i suppose.. there are just little shea butter &amp;#34;granule-like&amp;#34; bits that melt a little slower or something. It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s sandy shell pieces that stay on my skin or anything.</li>
            <li> I have used this in liquid soap and in bar soap and it turns out beutifully every time.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great, unrefined shea butter.  There are so many uses for it!  Hair, skin, lips, face - I use it everywhere.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Some dirty spots but not big enough to have to &amp;#34;treat&amp;#34; the butter before use.  Great value for the money.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I prefer the white shea butter for making body butter in fragrances like rose and lavender.  The yellow just doesn&#x27;t look as nice.  It would be great if you are making lemon scented body butter.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and after trying so many things from expensive to inexpensive, this product has been incredibile.</li>
            <li> Love this for eczema and after sun.</li>
            <li> I was already familiar with Shea butter and all its wonder. It&#x27;s everything I thought it would be. Thanks for helping take care of my winter skin!</li>
            <li> It came with a very yellow color. I was looking for more of an ivory one as pictured. Nonetheless, it is shea, does lean toward the cocoa smell though (side eye). It is a butter, it melted down accordingly. I won&#x27;t be buying it again from this seller though b/c I like to receive what I see.</li>
            <li> Very good product, a more yellow shade than the image shows. I&#x27;ve ordered twice and each time the packaging is different. One time a plastic tub and the most recent a plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered for my wife to use during her pregnancy and she loves it.  37 weeks, 40lbs gained and no stretch marks..</li>
            <li> The real deal here !!!! I use it for my skin &amp; Hair ! it&#x27;s thick and a little goes a long way. Love this Shea Butter</li>
            <li> It smells funky and doesn&#x27;t last more than about an hour. I either have to constantly reapply or use with a regular lotion. Gritty consistency. Goes on way too greasy and clogs my pores. Not happy with this.</li>
            <li> Great quality. It comes in a plastic bag so luckily I had saved a previous container.</li>
            <li> I love this. I use it on my skin &amp; in my hair as a sealant. I whipped mine up into a softer texture and you can do that to using a hand-held blender. My hair is 4b/4c and it really has helped me to lock in the moisture when I use the LOC (Liquid, Oil then Cream) method. For me it is more like LCO, but whatever works for you. You can whip some up, put it into a container and add a few drops of your favorite scented oil for a nice body cream. Make sure you aren&#x27;t allergic, obviously. You can do the same for your hair by adding essential oil(s) that your hair favors. I use this also to help my skin tone even out. It works especially well with Raw African Black Soap from Ghana. My skin has seen a tremendous difference. People ask if I&#x27;m glowing, I use the shea butter on my face occasionally at night as a part of my regimen and when I wake in the morning my skin is soft and supple. All around this has many uses and I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> The Shea butter (from Home and Beyond) smelled like rancid oil, NOT at all &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; like Shea Butter should smell. It was grainy &amp; a mix of colors from ivory to grey (marbled). It came in a large plastic bag that was much too big for the amount sent, so it looked like mashed potatoes smeared all over the bag. Had I not returned it, I would have had to scrape the Shea butter off the sides of the bag to use it. I most certainly sent it back since it was RANCID, i.e. it was very old, not at all fresh. I went ahead and replaced the (returned) rancid Shea butter with Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice Organic Shea butter from a different Amazon vendor, and OHHHH the difference. Yes, it was more expensive, but it seems you get what you pay for when purchasing unrefined Shea butter off Amazon. Maybe I received a bad package, but it really looked nothing like the nice ivory chunks in the picture. And, again, the rancid smell was very distinct.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful. I have never ordered shea butter before. I was looking for a more natural way to take care of my hands. In the winter time they get so dry they will crack and bleed. Im not a huge fan of putting all those chemicles on my skin especially when i have open cracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, i ordered this not knowing what to expect. It arrived fast. It came in a plastic container and its nice and hard. It does not smell amazing but i mixed it with some coco butter and coconut oil and i cant smell the shea butter at all just the chocolate coconut mix. Love that!  My hands have been so much happier with me since i started useing this shea butter. I feel its a good product.</li>
            <li> Thank you!! I make my own hair products and this is just what I need. It&#x27;s also very light! I would recommend this especially to those women that have natural black hair!</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a bucket in clumps.  Nothing like the photo.  It also had a fairly strong odor.  I think it is actually cocoa butter.  I have been able to use it but will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hands on a regular basis.  It seems to promote healing and reduce scaring.  I make knives and many other crafts and get multiple cuts, bangs and bruises to my hands on a daily basis.  I swear this stuff is great for me.  Odor is good and last for a year+.</li>
            <li> Came exactly as described, happy with purchase</li>
            <li> Love it Love it....The perfect solution for my 5yr old&#x27;s eczema and my severly dry skin....The seller also sent me a free gift of black soap...Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> It smells awful, but I&#x27;m pregnant so everything smells awful lol. I mixed it up and made a peppermint body butter and it smells wonderful now! Skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> The photograph used to advertise this product is deceiving. The product comes in a quart-size plastic container and the Shea butter is very yellow which leads me to doubt the claim that it is 100% pure organic. I&#x27;ve purchased Shea butter from Ghanaian market in Kumasi that did look or smell like this product. The texture is somewhat grainy which might be the result of heating it at a high temperature. Heavily medicinal odor. I won&#x27;t purchase again from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product at all. suppose to be ivory and it is yellow container cracked when it arrived</li>
            <li> I have used this product for awhile. I use it in my hair on my skin, and I continue to receive wonderful results.</li>
            <li> I love love love this! It&#x27;s pure Shea butter very smooth and it works wonders for your skin and hair! Happy that I bought and will be buying again when I run out</li>
            <li> This winter has been tough on the East Coast and I never go out in the weather without a layer of this Shea Butter on all exposed skin. It offers great protection and superior mositurizing.</li>
            <li> This is very gritty and smells stale. It has not helped with moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li> Soft and creamy, and Light! I can tell it doesn&#x27;t have additives of lard or shortening as some others. My only disappointment was that is didn&#x27;t come in a plastic container as the picture suggests. But its good stuff.</li>
            <li> Loved the product as it works perfectly for some of my homemade bath recipes.</li>
            <li> excellent for soap making  you just have to temper it  to remove the graininess ( just slowly melt it )  and re- package  for later use.</li>
            <li> nice product.  melts easily and blends with whatever I add to it</li>
            <li> Just as described. I&#x27;ve ordered Shea butter from other companies through the years. This one is legitimate. I was pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great texture and color, definitely legit Shea butter. Just disappointed in the fact that its just saran wrapped and placed in a large ziploc bag. Not the best way to store something.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product! I don&#x27;t have tons of experience with these types of products, only one other brand of Shea butter.  But this brand was sticky compared to the other brand&#x27;s smooth feel.  I made one batch of lotion bars with it and no more... in the end product, it wasn&#x27;t bad--I just didn&#x27;t like the raw product.  I gave it away to someone else who did use it and like it.  It just wasn&#x27;t what I was wanting/needing :(</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best ivory&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried yet.&lt;br /&gt; It instantly absorbs into the skin immediately. Your skin feels so soft, &amp; there is no residue left.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping is always fast, &amp; packed well.  Love that it is in a container so you do not have to heat &amp; transfer it into a jar yourself.&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered two more b4 writing this review.  That should say something about the product.</li>
            <li> very good product I love it for my natural hair products it was so smooth no grainy feel too it at all. [...]</li>
            <li> I really like this body butter and I like it better than the more expensive brand offered by the Body Works. Shea butter works wonders.  It really has softened the rough skin on my feet that has come from a sumer of going barefoot at the pool. Easy to put the butter in your palm and rub hands together to soften and warm it up.  I&#x27;m now using this shea butter to make body butter mixed with coconut oil and it&#x27;s definitely yummy. Packaging is very plain but who cares since the price is so good.  I think next time, however, I will spring to get \\&quot;organic\\&quot; which I&#x27;m assuming this product is not since it doesn&#x27;t say organic on it.</li>
            <li> This came in a huge block. I used it to make homemade body butter for Christmas presents. It came out amazing and all of my friends and family just loved it. Would definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note. This is definitely an ivory or bone color. If you are looking to make a solid white lotion this will tint the color. I thought it gave it a very unique homemade feel but if you want it solid white then this isnt the product for you</li>
            <li> Having only known yellow shea butter, I was never particularly fond of the smell and texture. I love this Ivory butter. It doesn&#x27;t have that cloying scent, melts beautifully, and super moisturizing. I made some gorgeous body butters for Christmas presents and got rave reviews!</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter, it adds that something special to my soap.</li>
            <li> They send you a lot. I wasn&#x27;t able to use it all. Good butter though. I used it on my face and body.</li>
            <li> I recvd this and the box it came in was fine. when I opened the box the actual container was cracked to pieces. other than not being satisfied with the container being broken. everything was fine,  mean it&#x27;s shea butter</li>
            <li> Product was very yellow. Works fine but I was expecting Ivory as the description says. Also, the container has a large crack across the bottom.</li>
            <li> I have purchased three times and I must say this is the best ivory Shea butter, thank you.</li>
            <li> Good quality. One thing to be aware of is that since it is unrefined, it ought to be melted and filtered with a coffee filter or cheesecloth otherwise there will be impurities in your final product.</li>
            <li> Worked well in the recipe I needed it for.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It is great for making your own lotion.</li>
            <li> Lots of nice quality shea butter.  Mild scent.</li>
            <li> This shea butt is very smooth. It is harder when it&#x27;s cold than the one I had before but it melts on your skin within seconds. I actually love the nutty natural smell. It&#x27;s much better than any artificial fragrance. It&#x27;s also a pretty nice size container for the price. If you are looking for shea butter this is the one you should go with!</li>
            <li> Perfect for  my needs.</li>
            <li> Perfect for lip and body butters.</li>
            <li> wonderful product..great price..fast delivery  !!!</li>
            <li> Mine hadn&#x27;t leaked out but then again it wasn&#x27;t in the sun. The lid had a seal thing but it was half way off when I opened the box but that wasn&#x27;t a problem because the shea was still inside and solid, none had leaked out. People are mistaking the \\&quot;soft and creamy\\&quot; for actually soft. I ordered shea butter from a different seller before but I got it in chunks and it was grainy even after I melted it in my hands then melted it in the microwave it was still grainy. This one wasn&#x27;t in chunks it was whipped and put in the container and it&#x27;s not grainy at all and doesn&#x27;t come in chunks. That&#x27;s what they mean by soft and creamy. Shea butter is as it says, a butter. It&#x27;s thick and solid in the cold and even room temperature, maybe even a bit hard but it definitely does melt in your hands! It is ivory as stated because I really didn&#x27;t want the yellow one, Ivory shea butter is always better. It has that &#x27;nutty smell&#x27; as people like to say. I use this on my skin and hair and I love it, my hair really takes to it. It absorbs after a while but when you first put it on it may be a bit shiny or greasy if you use too much but after twenty minutes it absorbs. This on my skin and at a pool is heaven if you know what I mean. When I opened the box and saw the huge 32 oz container filled with shea a big smile appeared on my face. My only problem was that I had to pay for the 3-5 days shipping and it came like four days late. I bought this to mix with cocoa butter and coconut oil, when all runs out I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good, and it&#x27;s the quality that I want! I want to buy some more shea butter in this kind of quality, is that ok?</li>
            <li> I plan to use this to make homemade skin cream and I&#x27;m sure it will work quite well. In the interim, I have been taking small amounts, melting it between my hands and applying it to my feet. It softens even the most dried, calloused skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heartily recommend this Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. mixes well with the Coconut Oil and essential oils for body-butter. I prefer this variety to the &#x27;yellow-tinted&#x27; versions..</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! Purchased for diy hair and skin conditioner. Mixed with raw coconut oil and extra virgin olive oil. Its amazing! My hair is so soft and shiny and retains moisture for 2-3 days w/o reapplying. Also use this after the shower on my bf&#x27;s and my skin and me stay soft all day. Will absolutely be repurchasing, cant beat the price or product.</li>
            <li> the product was not soft and the one container was cracked. but i still love the product. quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I love shea butter, I use it for everything and curerntly using it in my shop products.  The smell... oh well, it is the real stuff so yes, it is smelly.  You need good quality essential oils to minimize it.&lt;br /&gt;But the quality is good and it does the work</li>
            <li> This raw Shea Butter is easy to apply on skin.  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> ITS NOTHING BUT GRIT....ITS FEELS HORRIBLE, I BLENDED IT, MELTED IT DOWN AND WHISK IT AND ITS STILL FEEL THE SAME LIKE GRIT. I THREW THE STUFF AWAY. I CNT BELIEVE IT. SHEA BUTTER SUPPOSE TO FEEL LIKE THAT, I TRIED TO WORK WITH IT BUT I JUST COULDNT GET IT TO WORK. I AM SO SORRY THAT I DIDNT STICK TO OTHER SHEA BUTTER I ORDER PRIOR, BUT THIS ONE IS HORRIBLE. MY ONIPION IT DIDNT WORK FOR ME...</li>
            <li> I just needed to buy shea butter for my hair without having to pay an arm and a leg, and this was the perfect answer.&lt;br /&gt;For what shea butter is, the quality is great.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the difference between yellow and white, having used them both the white feels and smells the same, and the quality is equal as well. The technical difference between the two is that the yellow has the shell mixed into it and the white doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product. I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Appreciate the quality of the butter and quick shipment.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Highly recommended for those that have eczema. Especially during the harsh winter months. Provides a better layer of protection than any lotion can.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a good price...I incorporate it into all of my soaps and body products...I am...thesoapmaker.net</li>
            <li> This seems like a good shea butter-smells good and feels good, but I was really disappointed that it came in a bag not a carton. Another reviewer had said she was so happy it came in a carton instead of a plastic bag. I did read the info on it and it did say packaging would vary so it&#x27;s really my fault.</li>
            <li> Nice for moisturizing</li>
            <li> Wowee! Lots more than I expected. Very nice. Thanks.</li>
            <li> good stuff use it every day</li>
            <li> It seems to me there may be oil added. This is greasier than any shea butter I&#x27;ve purchased from any seller in the past. I&#x27;ve been using shea butter for years and know what the consistency should be. Sometimes it&#x27;s grittier than other times, but I&#x27;ve never had any that&#x27;s gritty + oily. I think the ingredients should be listed on the Amazon listing and on the container. If you simply say &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34; that leads buyers to believe there&#x27;s nothing else in it.</li>
            <li> I really like it a lot. Been using it over a year now. Will be using more in the future.</li>
            <li> The scent of this doesn&#x27;t bother me one bit. Yes, it&#x27;s a sort of nutty smell but I&#x27;ve been using shea butter for quite awhile now and I&#x27;m actually starting to enjoy it. If you don&#x27;t like it, I would suggest putting this on and then a lotion or cream over it that has a scent you do like. It outweighs the nutty smell. This stuff makes my skin so soft all day! I put it on every morning and I just love it! It&#x27;s such a bigger bang for your buck too! I&#x27;m pretty sure new seasons and whole foods sell like 1 oz to 8 oz of this for $22 and this is just as good for 32 oz of $11! Will definitely buy again and again and again!</li>
            <li> Oh my....I live in desert like conditions and my skin is SO dry it is horrible. My husband, who is a farmer, has really nice skin. It is so embarrassing to me when I feel like sandpaper next to him at night. I have tried every lotion and oil. Nothing worked. My feet cracked and I couldn&#x27;t get them to heal. THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!! I can feel a huge difference in my skin using this product. I was desperate enough to duct tape the bottom of the cracked pad of my feet after applying this product for one day and one day later I experienced the most healing I&#x27;ve seen in the last months...yes they&#x27;ve been cracked for 2 mos. And I have been trying everything. I am purchasing two more of these to share with family and I will be keeping this product in stock!! Great seller...I had not problems receiving this product in a timely manner. It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent to it once it is on the skin...very light scent prior to putting on the skin.</li>
            <li> just a big lump in a bag not a container as advertised.had to find a container for it</li>
            <li> Awesome Product, Super Fast Delivery</li>
            <li> Very nice product. I am usually very senstive to smells, but I found that this one is bearable, especially if you do what I do and mix it with some coconut oil. I love the combination! And I found the shea butter to be very moisturizing and hydrating! Next time I will try cocoa butter, but I would definitely repurchase this again in the future.</li>
            <li> This stuff is greats. It smelled like usual shea butter. I used it to make some whipped shea for myself and my mom. She loves it as well. I also use it as is and rub it on my body and face. My skin was sooooooo soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was this brand but I tried to make soap with it and it didn&#x27;t really turn out goo.d</li>
            <li> Love it. Wished the bag would have a better closing or tigher closing system. But I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Good butter, I used it to make body butter by mixing with other oils. I had to melt this and sift it a few times to get some sediment out. Overall everyone has like the body butter made with this.</li>
            <li> Its Shea butter, it works great on everything. Really look it up. Good price. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> making lip balm this is the prefect mix with our other items.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter came in a unnecessary sized container. The grade was ivory I&#x27;ll give them that but it was hard like the hardest Shea butter I&#x27;ve ever ordered and since that&#x27;s all I use to moisturize my everything I order A LOT. The container didn&#x27;t even look like 32 oz. of Shea butter let alone 16 oz. so I was pretty pissed about that and it was all broken up in really small pieces (not chunks although there was a bug chunk on top but what is that doing for me that&#x27;s not what I paid for -_-). Every time I looked at the big unnecessary plastic container I literally shake my head. Being lazy and settling for &amp;#34;that&#x27;s what I get for taking a chance on amazon&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t return the container although I really really should have :/. Being in a dorm that doesn&#x27;t allow anything but my body and crappy mattresses I had to blow the Shea butter it was SOOOO hard like cocoa butter hard it took me forever and was a big mess on top of that after being whipped there were still chunks of unmelted unwhipped hard to rub on my body wasn&#x27;t even going to put in my hair Shea butter......everywhere. Overall this order sucked and was not 32 oz.</li>
            <li> Love this Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Smell awful and looks dirty brown. I am returning it.</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is definitely the real deal! I purchased the 32 oz amount and you can tell us higher quality. The texture is excellent and exactly how it should be. It&#x27;s not fully solid but yet it has a solid cream like texture that starts to melt when you rub into your skin from your body heat.  This works great in my body butters, body bars and hair masks. Thank you so much for holding up to your description!</li>
            <li> The order came quick but when I got it the container was broken. Luckily it was plastic because if it were glass, I would have cut myself on all of the pieces that I had to take out of the butter.</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of this Shea Butter, it&#x27;s soft and easy to work with. I use it to make homemade hair butters and my husband uses it on his skin.</li>
            <li> That was definitely a bad batch, got into the middle of it and the smell was unbearable. So thats what they call rancid.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is absoultely wonderful. Grainy onced scooped out of the container but once rubbed in,very smooth consistency and absorbs in the skin so well. Alot of your product for your money as well,this will surely last me for the year..I may order more be it that I am a shea butter fanatic,this is by far my favorite one out of the bunch that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Cannot go wrong if looking for Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> It was not as described it was a deep yellow gold color not the white creamy look as pictured. I&#x27;m NOT please at all!</li>
            <li> Misleading.  Do not buy!</li>
            <li> Too greasy, it felt like a glop of lard, came in a take-out food container with no official label, and it smelled real bad, I threw it out!!!</li>
            <li> I have bought shea butter from a few other companies and this has been my favorite. I have been making my own lotion for awhile and this worked wonderful! It is a little hard when you receive it but it scoops out nicely and I was able to melt and make a wonderful cream. The color, smell and consistency are how shea butter should be. Wonderful product. Will order again!</li>
            <li> I love it. I was a little leery after reading about the smell of unrefined shea butter, but I like the mild nutty aroma, and the soap I made from it smells good even without adding fragrances!</li>
            <li> This product was a great value and it was the type of Shea butter I had been searching for a while now. Will order from them again in the future.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff, it&#x27;s soft and smooth on my skin and I add it to some of the soaps I make. Yummy. The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for (which is really no big deal) is that it came in a plastic bag. I would have preferred a container.</li>
            <li> It is extremely thick...</li>
            <li> I made some great lotion with almond oil and lavender oil.</li>
            <li> Try this.  Place 1/2 teaspoon of shea butter in you hand.  Add 1 teaspoon of SeaSalt to the butter.  Add a few drops of water and begin rubbing your hands with this solution.  Keep rubbing them for at least 5 minutes or longer if possible.  Then rinse and wash you hands with soap.  Your hands have never been so soft since you were a baby.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Packaging was awful but product was fine. When I weighed it on a very accurate chemical scale, noticed only 28.6 ounces and not 32.</li>
            <li> Great product and the size will last several months.  I&#x27;m satisfied with the product and the prompt delivery. I love the multi use of Shea butter.</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter was soft and creamy, as advertised. I will be ordering more when this runs out to be sure.</li>
            <li> This product is great ... it moisturizes and softens the skin very well. I need to buy another one because my husband uses it daily also and I don&#x27;t want to run out of it. It&#x27;s a keeper!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Received quickly. item pure and exactly as described. This product will last a long time and can be added to oils for fragrance. Thx!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shea butter I&#x27;ve purchased. When I get a small dallop to rub in my hands, the shea butter INSTANTLY melts and it has a cool sensation for a slight moment. I use this regularly for body moisturizer and natural hair care. Very easy to mix the shea butter with a selection of natural veggie/fruit oils for a great conditioner, both hair and body!</li>
            <li> Works great, for all my uses, everyday, sunblock, hair conditioning, on my feet, on my rough elbows and joint pains</li>
            <li> I received the shea butter just as expected in a plastic container that held it well, wrapped with a rubber band for reinforcement. The butter has been working wonderfully for my family during this brisk New England winter! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Cant beat the price . It&#x27;s packed in all the way to the top. This will last forever. It&#x27;s thick so you only need a dab. Penetrates deep and moisturizes perfectly , keeps you feel soft all day long.</li>
            <li> Very nice organic raw Shea butter. It is high quality and easy to use in my balms! I will continue to buy from this supplier.</li>
            <li> My Shea Butter came as pictured. The quality of this Shea butter is amazing. I wanted to wait a week or so before I did a review... but my oh my, its been only a week.... I have seen such a difference in my skin! This is top of the line shea butter and LEGIT.... I&#x27;m so impressed with their shea butter, that I am going to try out their african black soap. I currently buy from another vendor.. but I&#x27;m going to try theirs out to see how well it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Smellgood</li>
            <li> This is wonderful shea butter and so creamy.  I will be buying more of this real soon and will continue to buy at this reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Using it already! Works great, love the container. It keeps it all fresh when I am not working with it.&lt;br /&gt;thanks!</li>
            <li> Good for magnesium body butter. Smells a bit, was hoping for it to be milder when I made the body butter but it&#x27;s quite earthy smelling. I might need some essential oils to mask it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good deal for the amount of shea butter. I read a lot of reviews and was skeptical about purchasing because a lot of people complained about the smell or the tub it came in was old and cracked. I received mine in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;Shea butter has a somewhat strong nutty smell, its different. if you&#x27;ve never smelled it before then it probably smells funny at first but its not an awful smell like others posted. I use it in my homemade deodorant and lotions and loooove it.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought shea butter before for THREE TIMES as much money and am more satisfied with this product. 32oz is a lot and this will last me a while but if I DO run out I wont hesitate to buy again.</li>
            <li> this was not rotten shea butter like some of the other amazon stuff i&#x27;ve ordered. it was very affordable compared to the people i usually order from. I would definitely buy again. it comes in a plastic container with a lid thank goodness. i ordered from someone who sent me the stuff in a baggie which wouldn&#x27;t have been an issue if it hadn&#x27;t been melting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is nice and thick-it works great for my hair and my skin and also work for some scars, as well. I do recommend this product-I&#x27;ve had it for 4months and it&#x27;s still more than halfway full. I do use it a lot, as well- so, the duration is great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 3 based on the fact that I got 1.5 pounds of shea butter and not 2 as advertised. The quality is a 5 in my opinion. It is very moisturizing and of good quality. I will be using it in my cold process soaps. It came packaged well and is labeled 32 oz which it isn&#x27;t. I would like to order this product again but I want to pay for what is advertised. I fel a little ripped off.</li>
            <li> The product is awesome!  It is great and you will not be disappointed if you invest in this product.  Will order again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SB/Texas</li>
            <li> Best Shea butter I have ever purchased just wish it was more affordable for large orders</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase in two weeks, (I gave one as a gift)and despite the fact that it did not come in the container pictured...one container was way larger than the other, so I&#x27;m not sure I got 32 oz as stated each time (hence the 4 stars)but the stuff&#x27;s good! It&#x27;s clean and has no odor. I was really impressed, that&#x27;s why I bought it a second time! And will buy again soon as I run low, you got yourself a customer.</li>
            <li> Ahh shea butter. Improving the appearance of your ksin one application at a time. What can I say..it works. not surprised at all as I have used shea butter before. However the packaging is nothing like the picture..instead of coming in those tall containers it comes in these black chinese takeout type tupperware looking things. It wasnt really a big deal to me. its still the same stuff and works just as good.</li>
            <li> love it.  Smells funky. More like  a woody nutty earthy smell.  Like Breadfruit.  Great consistency, I put it on my lips and they came out sooo soft.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> good quality product. just what i expected</li>
            <li> I use this to make my own lotion. It has a nice creamy texture and not too strong of a smell. I mix it with coconut oil, sweet almond oil, and essential oils. I have purchased this a few times and the packaging varies but the product is always good.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is superior quality! Smells nutty, like it&#x27;s supposed to and comes in a creamy consistency. The color is an ivory color rather than the yellow kind... I prefer the ivory shea butter! I use this in my hair and skin mixtures. I sometimes use it alone as well. The properties of shea butter are healing and amazing. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is very good but to me it has no smell, it does come in a tub and is NOT THIN AND SMOOTH like lotion you have to rub it in your hands or on your body and that is what  \\&quot;melts\\&quot; it I have the \\&quot;unrefined\\&quot; yellow color also. And you do it the same way you can also add some scented oil SPECIFICALLY FOR YOUR BODY and heat it in the microwave and keep it in a separate dish a little GOES A LOOOOOONG WAY!</li>
            <li> I use shea butter daily for both my hair and body. This is my third time ordering from Amazon but first time buying this brand/seller. The quality and consistency of the shea butter is good however I dont like the container the product arrived in. No big deal because I switched it into a different container so it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> Every winter I search for the perfect product to stop the moisture from being sucked out of my skin. Ivory Shea Butter is the first product I&#x27;ve found that works and doesn&#x27;t cost a small fortune. The bucket it came in is quite adequate, so perhaps they fixed the problems that early reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> Great price and it paid to shop around on Amazon to find the best value to quantity.  I ended up giving small amounts to friends and family.  They love it and I love it.  It is a great facial cream and friends have said it is better then the higher priced cosmetic creams they were using.  It is a top 5 things to have in your house according to Dr. Oz</li>
            <li> I love shea butter, i use it everytime i get out of the shower. Shea butter nourishes and perks up dry crusted skin. My skin feels baby butt smooth, i get alot of compliments about the healthy look and feel of my skin. You must try this product asap!!! :)</li>
            <li> I have been telling and showing everyone how this worked so fast on my psoriasis on my hands. I saw the results the next day and had relief the very first time I used it.  I wish I found out about this years ago. I used to try to hide my hands because I was so embarased. NOW no one would ever know I have psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I use this product in my  home made shea mixture, nice ivory color, great moister, smells great, true to description, and not grainy, melts in your hand like shea butter should.</li>
            <li> The shea butter itself is great. The packaging, however, is a different story...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tub was completely cracked, broken, and falling apart when I received it! The shea butter was still usable, but I had to transfer it to a new container in order to use and store it. I would&#x27;ve returned it, but couldn&#x27;t have gotten a new one by the time I needed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally unacceptable! I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered the shea butter only for my my wife, then after while we started to use it ,all the family. It is perfect as an aftershave ( for men), moisturise lips , rough areas .Also, it is perfect for babies since its pure and natural. The only things annoying me is , whenever I ask my wife where did she hide the butter she start to telling me how much I used.</li>
            <li> I just got my order a few minutes ago and I&#x27;m already sending it back. It was not at all like the picture. It was in a gigantic tub with chunks (that&#x27;s right CHUNKS) of shea butter. The product looked like it was exposed to the air for a long time and they just scraped the bottom of a barrel to send out. The lid didn&#x27;t even fit the tub. They tried to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; the lid to the tub w/ what  looks like Scotch tape. Needless to say, there was product all over the outside of the tub and all over the box by the time it got to my house. The only good thing I can say is that delivery timing was excellent. I guess it&#x27;s good to find out how crappy your order is right a way then wait a long time to get the same results.</li>
            <li> I bought the 32oz. tub and I love it! I have used shea butter before and I can say that this one is very good quality and worth every penny. It&#x27;s a great skin moisturizer for the winter weather. I used it to make body and hair butter which turned out really great for my 4c natural hair. Even on its own, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer for hair and body. Smell doesn&#x27;t linger once applied and melts easily when rubbed between palms. Shipped and delivered fast enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave 4 stars coz I rarely give 5 stars to anything.</li>
            <li> Its a product the the skin care providers should use, it is natural works on contact for soft and smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;Keep the dryness off your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Natural feeling and no after effect.&lt;br /&gt;WORKS GREAT !!!&lt;br /&gt;Ed</li>
            <li> its a Lot of Shea Butter for the price:) . The smell is not good but it works wonder and does its job.I did microwave it a little so that i can apply it easily . its worth for long term .</li>
            <li> This raw shae butter has the proper color, smell, and consistency. Do your homework concerning raw shae butter and you will agree. Future orders for raw shae butter will be from this company.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long for my order to come in, I love this shea butter, it has a nutty smell and is grainy, rubs in my skin with no problems. I broke it down in smaller tin containers and added some lavender. Will be purchasing the 5lbs soon. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I have bought ivory shea butter before from various sellers so I know  what I should receive. The butter arrived in clumps and in a round container instead of what is pictured on the website&#x27;s description.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be sure how &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; the product is. It came in plastic bags, and that is it. No label, no brand name, nothing. The smell is not pleasant, all all. It is overwhelming when you try to make product with it. I used coconut oil and bees wax along with essential oils and all I can smell is the shea butter. It is a rancid smell, not a smooth nutty smell. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Good quality and great price</li>
            <li> Great Product.  Works very well.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this product, it is very smooth and well worth the price. Try it for yourselves, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Maybe my mistake in ordering this particure product but in the past the Shea Butter I have ordered came in a plastic container.  This came in a tall zip-lock bag in various sized pieces and chunks like the picture shows which made it a pain to remove from the bag as it gets all over your hands.  Plus some pieces were so big I had to break or cut them into smaller pieces getting it all over my hands which is not easy to clean off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It still worked for making the homemade lotion I make but I much prefer my shea butter in a package that makes it easier to handle or scoop out.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with the high quality product. The quality and quantity made this a great deal for the low price. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great Item-Great Seller</li>
            <li> I LIKE TO USED THIS PRODUCT ALL THE TIME THE ONLY THING I DISLIKE IS THE SMELLING BUT IT O.K.</li>
            <li> I bought this Shea butter specifically because it promised to be soft &amp; creamy; it was not!  I gave it two stars because it is Shea butter.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; shea butter products, and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve come across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Creamy texture&lt;br /&gt;Not extremely oily&lt;br /&gt;Makes the skin glow&lt;br /&gt;No strong overbearing smell&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use right out of the jar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Once I put it on, I can never seem to stop ;)</li>
            <li> Order arrived on time and I love the quality of this shea butter. It is creamy and melts right in your hands. Will order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Works great in my lotions.  Packaged appropriately.  I had no issues with the product or seller.</li>
            <li> It is amazing product. I use it for my body skin and my hair( spicialy the edges). It make my skin very soft and smoth.</li>
            <li> Smells ok. This isn&#x27;t the best Shea butter I have gotten, but it feels great on my skin which is more important</li>
            <li> This shea butter is excellent! I used this for my afro-textured hair with a mix of other oils.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try to make this short, the some parts of the shea butter were soft and manageable and others were grainy which is why I gave this only 4 stars, which is expected since you are paying cheapest price for shea butter. This shea butter came in a tub container. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY! I had this since February and I still have plenty left.</li>
            <li> Worked great in soap. Added firmness to the soap and seemed like very good quality. Recommended for Shea butter!</li>
            <li> I used to use this right out of the jar but now whip this up with coconut, olive, almond and neem oils with lavender and tea tree essential oils for a DIY body, hair, and face moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered from the same company and always like the quality. I prefer raw since I mix with my own oils and I use the same on my kids sensitive skin. We all have sensitive skin and have had no irritations.</li>
            <li> Great!!! Container was broken when I got it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month now and I love how smooth my skin looks. I use to have a big dark spot on my two arms and now they are fading, This product is soft enough to control being messaged into skin gently. It desolves quite well between the palms of hands. I use it on my stretchmarks, they are not gone but they are lightening and becoming smooth. I love it. Some review says the smell is strong but to me it doesnt. There is a smell but it fades away after aplication. I will buy this product again it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Product cakes with lots of black specs inside bottom of container. Also didn&#x27;t like the color as it is mustard yellow. Sent it back</li>
            <li> It does NOT come in any container to be clear. It was in a box wrapped in 2 plastic bags. The product is excellent for your skin, but it does NOT smell good. I do not put it on when my family is around because they do not like the smell. If you want it to smell good, you can mix it with some rose water toner or coconut oil, etc.</li>
            <li> GJust perfect.  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a small bar or jar but the product I received was alot bigger. I&#x27;ll probably have it for years! It&#x27;s really warm out so it was a little soft when I opened the package, kind of like a dough consistency. So far I&#x27;ve melted some with some coconut oil n I&#x27;m letting it cool in the fridge, but I can&#x27;t wait to use it on my hair n skin : ) I couldn&#x27;t find Shea Butter anywhere in my area, and I looked at Ulta, Target, and Sephora so I gave up n bot it on Amazon which I thought the price wasn&#x27;t too bad and I got it within 2 days of ordering.</li>
            <li> Love this Shea butter. I&#x27;ve ordered it twice now and both times I received it quickly, it was packaged very well, had a wonderful faint scent and works very well in my homemade lotions.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to order from this seller. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love ivory African shea butter better then the yellow. I make DIY hair and body butter with this stuff its absolutely amazing! Makes my hair shiny and soft and moisturized longer than any other store bought product. I also use it on my face and body leaves my face soft and moisturized and helps with bumps, rashes, dark spots, and much more!</li>
            <li> Lots of butter. Qty 2: 1/2 &#x27;bricks&#x27; of the stuff. Looks pure to me from what I know, kind of a dirty white. No frills, two bricks in a ziplock bag! :) That seems unprocessed to me. (a good thing - I presume). I scooped some into an old Rx pill container to scoop out for my hands every once in a while, and gave the remaining &#x27;bricks&#x27; to my wife for what ever she will use them for.</li>
            <li> This is terrible. It smells rancid. ! Can not use to make my body creams. : (</li>
            <li> This seems to be just as good of quality as other Shea butters I have purchased yet I paid less for this. I am very happy! I love that Shea butter is noncomedogenic, it is one of the only heavy duty moisturizers I can use on my face without clogging my pores. I use it on my hands, legs, neck, chest, arms, anywhere I feel like I need a good moisture boost. I also make face cream for my mom using Shea butter and avocado oil, she loves it. Shea butter is wonderful for your skin and I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product. Mine arrived in a heavy-duty sealed bag with a &amp;#34;ziplock&amp;#34; closure in crumbled pieces, I am able to easily get the amount I need without having to cut hunks off a big block. I do think I received more than 32 oz which was a welcome surprise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently experimenting with a copy cat recipe of a deodorant I love...we&#x27;ll see how it goes...</li>
            <li> I used this for soapmaking and body butter,love the color of it. Product is a great quality at a great price!</li>
            <li> I purchased this shea butter to put into lotion and soaps.  The quality seems very good.  Very nice consistance and mild fragrance.  The shipping was quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 4 stars only because the tub it came in was cracked all around the top and down on side.  I had to pick bits of plastic out of the sides of the shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably order again because of the shea butter quality.</li>
            <li> Im not a fan of greasy products or the smell of the shea butter even though there are such great reviews on the product. that is my general opinion. I dont feel like it made my hair better or that it made my skin softer. so This will be my last purchase. But if you are a fan of shea butter this is a nice portion that will last a long time and the shipping time was okay. Product appears to be pure raw shea butter from youtube video descriptions.</li>
            <li> This shea butter seemed a bit grittier than the other kind we are used to, but once it&#x27;s on the skin, it worked just the same. And for this low price, we&#x27;ll take it!</li>
            <li> The price and quality are great. I use this to make a variety of things for body and hair. It moisturizes like no other.</li>
            <li> I make lotions &amp; lip balms and this Shea Butter is the best I have found!  It is a great value.</li>
            <li> I like it and believe it is the real deal, but the color is very greenish. Not the creamy color I was expecting. Upon some research I found that this is very common.</li>
            <li> One of a kind this smells good and it&#x27;s great for making body butter and whipped hair butter order this shea butter you won&#x27;t regret it .. It comes in a plastic container that has all 32oz</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s grainy. Doesn&#x27;t smell. But the graininess (sp).  I tried making a crème with it and could not whip out the grainy consistency. I&#x27;ll try another brand.</li>
            <li> My shea  arrived safe and exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping! Great Price! Plenty of shea butter for a long time! The tub is filled to the rim and the butter is moist and melts when you rub it between you hands.  I don&#x27;t mind the smell, I actually like the nutty scent. I like to use my shea butter as a all over body and hair.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as shown in picture. It IS shea butter and has a slight nutty scent but not as much as the yellow shea butter does.</li>
            <li> Amazing. I use this in every product I make from moisturizer to deodorant. S*** is the bomb.</li>
            <li> This was my first time ordering or using Shea Butter. I found the product to be of excellent quality. Large volume of product for the price paid - good bargain.  I would use this company again for sure.</li>
            <li> Ever wonder what you need in the base for a Homemade Whipped body Butter?  Well this is it.  This Shea butter comes clumped up in a plastic baggy and is the perfect ingredients for Homemade Body Butter as well as lip balms.  I absolutely love shea butter and this is top quality.  Granted it smells a bit but that&#x27;s just the product itself.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> Applies well to my skin and gives my skin a healthy glow. Keeps my hands and feet soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I believe this is a authentic shea butter. And best of all it came in a container and has a lot of product that will carry me for well over atleast 2-3 months. Warm it up in my hand and smooth it on.</li>
            <li> It arrived in big free-formed blobs in a plastic bag and  not nice and tidy in a round container as pictured.  However, it seems to be a very good product.  It was fresh, with a minimally detectable scent, light yellow in color and readily melted in my hands.  I just got it a couple of days ago so Ive only used it as an ingredient for lip balm, but I have more plans for using Shea butter. I will update this review as I make more balms as well as lotions but I do think  it&#x27;s very good quality and there is nothing about it to make me think it&#x27;s inferior in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3.18.15 - I made hot processed soap for the very first time yesterday and I used a lot of this Shea butter.  I was surprised that everything turned out as well as it did and the soap is terrific!!  I already ordered another 2 pounds of it. Great stuff!!</li>
            <li> This shea butter lived up to it&#x27;s review-hype!  It looks exactly like it does in the photo, and has a wonderful scent and texture.  I will definitely be ordering this again, and am VERY impressed with the product!  I&#x27;ve made lots of lotions and balms and still have half of the container left.  GREAT PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> I only received the product two days ago. Yesterday I tried it on my hands (which are super dry in the winter). The product is grainy when you first pull some out, but it immediately melted with my body heat and was amazingly smooth. I usually have to put cream or lotion on my hands every time after I was them but I did not have to do that, even after only one application.  I did not get the fish odor complained about by another reviewer, but I may experiment with some light essential oil like orange or vanilla because the fragrance is not strong but kind of \\&quot;earthy\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as some of the other claims of helping reduce pain? I will have to wait and see and then update this review.</li>
            <li> Making my own lotios, creams and body butters this was perfect</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona where maintaining smooth, hydrated skin is a huge challenge. This shea butter is great for keeping rough, scaly skin at bay, and helps blend in pasty white sunscreen so that it&#x27;s unnoticeable. A must have!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this Ivory Shea Butter purchase.  I was so excited to try the Ivory, I purchased 2 not sure what I would be getting (I&#x27;d  previously used another brand-yellow shea butter).  Happily, I&#x27;m quite pleased... so far,  this ranks higher in quality, fragrance, texture and presentation.  The product arrived quickly, in perfect condition and just as it was pictured online. I most definitely would recommend it to anyone in the Shea Butter users community!</li>
            <li> Love this so much better than the yellow raw shea butter. I have about 8 oz. of the yellow stuff left and I don&#x27;t even want it anymore after trying this one!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter loves her lotion bars made with shea butter because she loves the smell. I love that this one doesn&#x27;t leave her skin with a slight tint of yellow to it. Might be mind over matter but this one doesn&#x27;t feel as grainy as the yellow one either.</li>
            <li> Love the way this butter melts on body heat. This is actually my second tub ordered. My first order wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;Ivory&amp;#34; though. And I have heard the color of real 100% (unrefined) raw Shea Butter is off white or beige. My first tub was definitely yellow, which indicative of a presence of dye. No worries, it was my first order and I totally enjoyed every bit of it. And it looks like the dye is no longer an ingredient so I am perfectly fine with this too. I went au naturel with my hair last year and had great results keeping it moisturized with Shea Butter, not to mentions, my nails look great also. I simply Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Been using this for DIY stretch mark prevention cream, working great thus far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this shea butter!!!! It&#x27;s soft, creamy, and it melts in my palm when I rub it in. I mix the shea butter with various oils and it makes a great after wash moisturizer as well as a daily moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Take a leap of faith and try it. It&#x27;s an amazing product and it&#x27;s a well worth the cost. It lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve had it since February and it looks like I didn&#x27;t use any at all. :-)</li>
            <li> Very creamy, clean and smooth.  Arrived packaged in a resealable bag.  Had a strong smoky odor when first opened but it dissipated fairly quickly when applied and an earthy fragrance remained.  Very good quality. Would have been 5 stars with better packaging/container.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin, and she usually complains about her skin being itchy,&amp; over dried  after bathing.  This works very well.</li>
            <li> This is real Ivory Shea Butter and very well packed!!! I used to buy it at African stores and festivals when I lived in Chicago, but since I moved to a different city needed to purchase it online. I am extremely happy with the quality, price and service. Will definitely be coming back!!!</li>
            <li> when i got the &#x27;&#x27;shea butter&#x27;&#x27; the container was broke at the bottom and the butter had leaked out. then when i opened it to smell (im from Africa and know exactly what she butter smells like, and looks like) it smelled NOTHING like shea butter. Nothing at all like shea butter. and the color was wrong as well. shea butter is supposed to be an ivory color, but the one i received was pure white, and had a dark brown tint at the bottom from where it spilled out. i am not satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> great product, arrived quickly.  I use this to make &amp;#34;lotion bars&amp;#34; with a variety of other ingredients, and this was a good price.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try making my own shea butter cream for my hair. I heard raw shea butter is hard and that you have to melt it in order to use and mix it easily. To my joyful surprise, it melts right in my hand! And is soft enough that I can stir with a popsicle stick! I mixed in a few oils and let it solidify overnight. I put it in my hair and absolutely love how soft it feels! The only downside about it was the smell. It was a very, very strong playdoh kind of smell. But a few drops of essential peppermint oil fixed that right up! I will definitely purchase again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I use Shea in my hair and on my skin, as well as a homemade diaper cream for my daughter. The texture of this Shea is almost foamy. The smell is not as heavy as the yellow, much harder variety. I love this stuff! I may never go back to the yellow again.</li>
            <li> I made some great lotion with it...</li>
            <li> Great product, great price! Not too stinky or rancid like from some other lower price sellers. This stuff is a bag of miracles. Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, great price.</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter, smells wonderfully fresh and nutty and a beautiful ivory color. I&#x27;ve made the best soaps and hand moisturizers with it. Only problem I&#x27;ve had were the tubs they came in, they were both already broken by the time they arrived, they were wrapped in plastic so they weren&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s been a pain since I can&#x27;t go through 32 oz in a single shot. I tried to take the lid off the second container and the entire top of the tub came off with it, spraying shea butter everywhere. It wasted a lot because the tubs were so thin and poorly made.</li>
            <li> I love Shea Butter for so many reasons...homemade soaps, lotions, lipstick, etc.  This is great quality stuff, and at a very good price.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin, lasts all winter.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shea butter to use on my hair and skin. This was my first time purchasing shea butter, but from everything I&#x27;ve researched about shea butter (I researched for months before I decided to make a purchase), the shea butter sent to me by the currently-listed seller, smellgood, is the real deal! What I received is exactly what is pictured in the product listing&#x27;s picture. It is a whitish/yellow-tinged butter. The color was very important to me. I didn&#x27;t want the butter to be stark white, as that indicates that it&#x27;s refined and has lost some of the properties that make shea butter so amazing. I also didn&#x27;t want the butter to be deep or mustard yellow, either, because I believe that this kind of butter is either Kpagnan butter/African butter (which is often sold here in the West as \\&quot;Yellow Shea Butter\\&quot;) or shea butter that contains dyes or other additives. Not what I&#x27;m looking for! The color of the shea butter I received gives me confidence that it is true, unrefined shea butter (though there&#x27;s no way to know if it&#x27;s truly \\&quot;organic\\&quot; as claimed, since it isn&#x27;t certified organic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was especially happy to see that my butter came in a plastic container. After reading many of the reviews on other shea butter listings, I was expecting to receive a big lump of butter in a plastic bag, which is pretty tacky if you ask me, since storing it that way can be messy due to the fact that it starts melting at a certain temperature. I can store this shea butter in the container in which it arrived. I was also very happy with the quality of the shea butter itself. Based on the comments of other reviewers of shea butter, I was prepared to smell a somewhat stinky, nutty scent when I opened the container, but the smell didn&#x27;t actually bother me. It smells mildly of Play-Doh or crayon. My niece said it smelled like dog treats. Either way, while it&#x27;s not a pleasant scent, I don&#x27;t think it stinks, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the butter is very grainy in its natural state, but it melts very quickly when it comes in contact with skin (I&#x27;ve had it melt right on my fingertip) and leaves it feeling very moist and nourished! Once it&#x27;s on the skin, it does feel greasy/oily at first, but it eventually absorbs completely into the skin and leaves no residue. The scent also fades and becomes very faint on the skin. (Note: The key to avoiding greasy/oily skin with shea butter is to avoid being heavy-handed. A little goes a long way). I do not use the shea butter alone, though. I make it into a cream using carrier and essential oils, which I then use as a skin and hair cream. (I use it on my face, as well. Shea butter is not comedogenic and ranks 0 on a scale of 0 to 5 - with a ranking of 0 meaning that a substance will not clog pores). I was already using oils on my hair and skin, but the addition of the shea butter has certainly made both my hair and skin more moist, supple, and soft. I will be coming back for this shea butter for as long as the quality continues!</li>
            <li> Other reviews of this product led me to believe that it would have a nuttier smell...it smells almost rancid. Its not an overwhelming scent, its just not what I was expecting. As a lotion its amazing...what a trip how it is gritty at first but warms to the heat of your hand and rubs in completely. The grit just disappears! As long as you don&#x27;t use too much it soaks completely in to your skin and it feels amazing. I bought some essential oils to mix with it to change the scent. Will definitely purchase more when I run out.</li>
            <li> The shipping was faster than expected.  This Shea butter is the best quality compared to more expensive brands. I melted the Shea butter with two tablespoons of coconut oil and two table spoons of grape seed oil and wiped with a blender. My hair feels very light and moisturized without a heavy feel. I will only buy this product from smell goods.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and easy to apply. Great moisturizer makes your skin feel great and moisturized. Has a refreshing cocoa butter smell!</li>
            <li> This is 100℅ REAL Shea Butter. It came in a plastic container with a sealed lid. The consistency is like clay at room temperature and it melts really fast when rubbed between the palm of your hands. The smell is very earthy and it&#x27;s very reminiscent of olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;This thing moisturizes like no other. I use it all over my body and also as a moisturizer for myneck and face. It will really make your skin smooth and relieve it from being dry. I am now a firm believer in shea butter! Wow!</li>
            <li> I did not like how this product smelled, it smelled like dead fish and the consistency was grainy and not smooth as many may claim. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on February 27, 2013. And according to the address it was coming from NY which is where I live. But for some reason it was in PA for 6 days and then I still didnt get it til March 8. I was so excited about getting this and using it. Soft &amp; creamy.....NOT!!!!!!!! HARD AS A ROCK!!!! Can even get any out to use it. It smells ok but WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN!!!! Very disappointed and a waste of my money!!!</li>
            <li> I received this shea butter and I have to say this is a wonderful product. I have used shea butter for years but I&#x27;ve only used the yellow one. This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the ivory and there is a difference. The ivory is smoother in texture and just as advertised, it&#x27;s REALLY soft and creamy. I use it for my hair, face and body. If you haven&#x27;t tried the ivory shea butter yet, give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;BUT...I have a complaint about the actual company that ships it out &amp;#34;Halaleveryday&amp;#34;. I received this and it was well packed in packing peanuts and seemed secure but when I removed it from the box I discovered that a large chunk of plastic had been broken off and was missing from the bottom of the container. I thought it must have broken during the shipping but the broken off piece of the plastic container was not even in the box which means that this was dropped and damaged BEFORE it was sent to me. It was shipped out already broken. Luckily shea butter is a solid product so there was no leaking. I placed the whole container inside of a ziplock bag and I am still able to use it without having the hassle of returning it and going through that whole deal. I understand that accidents happen and no one is perfect BUT to send out a product that has been damaged BEFORE it&#x27;s shipped is just bad business. I will not purchase any more products from this company. I will buy more shea butter from another seller.&lt;br /&gt;The 5 stars are for the shea butter ONLY!!</li>
            <li> This is truly the best Shea butter that I&#x27;ve encountered!  I love and use Shea butter for its properties: anti-aging, acne scars, moisturizer, pregnancy stretch marks, etc.  This is by far the best Shea butter that I&#x27;ve used and being that it is non- comedogenic it does not break the skin out.  Super soft and absorbs well..would highly recommend!</li>
