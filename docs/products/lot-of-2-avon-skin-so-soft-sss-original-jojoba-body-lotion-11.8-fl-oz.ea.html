            <li> Nice lotion and nice scent..Reccomend for a nice light lotion. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been using for Mosquitos for about 20 years now. Nothing, NOTHING I SAY, works better. Great for kids</li>
            <li> The wife likes----not my kinda thing.</li>
            <li> the scent made me sick.</li>
            <li> This lotion keeps spiders and mosquitos at bay, along with moisturizing skin. My kids have always used it when they want to sleep outside under the stars, like on the trampoline. Without it they are simply spider dinner!!!!  With it they wake virtually untouched.  Love the stuff!!!!  Used the oil/mixed with water in a spray bottle when we went to the islands where mosquitoes reign, and the little ones barely got bitten. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Got this lotion to wear during the hummer months in FL. Helps keep the bugs away.</li>
            <li> Always a great product, using to help with mosquito control outdoors with 2 year old.</li>
            <li> Love love love...wonderful smell...not greasy...feel the hydration</li>
            <li> It works as a bug repellent and the scent is light, and I like how soft it makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I heard it repelled mosquito&#x27;s.  Well, not sure what happened, but they still got to me after slathering myself with Skin so Soft + bug spray.  I currently live in NW Glendale AZ, I&#x27;m 1/2 Asian 1/2 Caucasian, so I choose to believe it&#x27;s my sweet blood.  Also, didn&#x27;t like the scent if I was to just use it for body lotion.</li>
            <li> Actually makes your skin so soft</li>
            <li> Nice softening lotion, pleasant scent, not over powering and keeps the bugs away!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, makes my skin feel so soft! I&#x27;ve been using skin so soft for many many years.</li>
            <li> Lotion arrived quickly and is as described (according to my wife).</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t take very much to lotion my hands. BTW, it&#x27;s somewhat of an insect repellant, especially when just applied.</li>
            <li> Better than any bug spray and softens too!!</li>
            <li> I swim three days a week and the community pool is chlorine overdose for my skin.  I have tried many lotions and I believe that this one works best for me to combat the drying effects of both winter and the pool.  The scent is very nice.</li>
            <li> Perfect insect repellant!!  Love the lotion. All 9 grandchildren wear it!</li>
            <li> Lotion actually absorbs into your skin for a soft, silky skin surface.  Other lotions leave a greasy feeling - not this one!  My husband has dry sensitive skin - he uses this lotion daily especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> This product has served my family well for years. Always a wonderful mosquito deterrent and moisturizer. Non-greasy. Will purchase again once we run out!</li>
