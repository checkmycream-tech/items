            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, these aren&#x27;t very effective.</li>

            <li>I SO love this product!</li>
            <li>Good mask very comfortable my daughter loves it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 sleep masks around Dec. 2009 for my own use.</li>
            <li>They block out light as they should, they are comfortable and best of all, they are cute.</li>
            <li>Very strong smell.</li>
            <li>It has a nice fit!</li>
            <li>This sleep mask is much better than the kind you can get at CVS or Walgreens, and at a cheaper price.  </li>
            <li>I have a semi large nose and they fit over my eyes perfectly!</li>
            <li>And love the bright cheerful colors.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li>Good coverage....stretched out quickly</li>
            <li>So comfortable and cute!</li>
            <li>So i guess it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>These masks the way they perform better than any others that I have bought in stores and at a better price.  </li>
            <li>so I ordered 3 more.</li>
            <li>I should be able to figure out how to keep the rubber bands that keep them in place from stretching out, perhaps hand washing in woolite would keep them like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>CAN&#x27;T FIND A BETTER SLEEP MASK</li>
            <li>ANYWHERE FOR SLEEPING ON TRAIN OR AIRPLANE OR IN YOUR OWN BED TO KEEP ALL THE LIGHT OUT</li>
            <li>I was quite pleased with the masks.  </li>
            <li>It was an okay purchase for the price.</li>
            <li>so she could sleep better when her roomates are up all night in the dorm at college.</li>
            <li>zzzzzzz love this mask.</li>
            <li>8-)</li>
            <li>I did:)</li>
            <li>thank you :)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s comfortable!</li>
            <li>Buy this one for sure.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Am able to sleep longer.</li>
            <li>I love this mask.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought two of these and though they were stretched out over the course of two years, they&#x27;re perfect for blocking out light!</li>
            <li>On top of that, it stretches out very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Fit my daughter&#x27;s head just fine!</li>
            <li>Keeps the light out and is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I love that mask, it&#x27;s light-weight and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I purchased this night mask because of its elastic straps, hoping for a more comfortable mask than the one I have.</li>
            <li>Yes, thicker ones block the light better</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job of keeping the light out of my eyes so I can sleep.</li>
            <li>Satin is much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It does the job perfectly, I haven&#x27;t ever had any issues with it blocking light like some other reviewers have claimed and it is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>But the quest to find something that would block out light effectively while also being comfortable was worth the effort, and sometimes an inexpensive product can be better than a higher-priced item.</li>
            <li>My daughter likes it, because her room is very light and sister is going to school very early,it&#x27;s her favorite color,smooth and very comfortable,</li>
            <li>it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>It is cheap and feels good can&#x27;t tell your very wearing it</li>
            <li>The mask looks like it&#x27;s designed very well and would be extremely comfortable and effective.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definately cheap.</li>
            <li>is more expense at 5.99 but definately worth it,</li>
            <li>I saw a review that said they could see day light because the sunlight came in around the nose area.  </li>
            <li>, IF YOU ARE LIGHT SLEEPER PERHAPS SOME EAR PLUGS MIGHT BE NEEDED IN TRAVEL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This sleep mask does NOT block out light.</li>
            <li>I wanted a cheep eye mask for when the light comes in through my blinds in the morning.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a thicker mask that blocks light.</li>
            <li>The product was cheap</li>
            <li>But it did block out some light, so</li>
            <li>Fit snug and stayed in place.</li>
            <li>I tried one on myself and they would fit adults, too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and does what it&#x27;s designed to do.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t reply I&#x27;m sleeping soundly</li>
            <li>It is still useable but doesn&#x27;t fell as secure.</li>
            <li>it is Comfortable to sleep with.</li>
            <li>so if there is any light in the room you will not be sleeping.  </li>
            <li>and it is lightweight and comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li>and it does block out the light</li>
            <li>And honestly, at 3 bucks I didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s light.</li>
            <li>A bit slippery on the face, but the elastic straps are comfortable.</li>
            <li>Blocks light</li>
            <li>Blocks the light out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten where I can&#x27;t sleep with any light.</li>
            <li>My face would get sweaty but I could still see light through the mask-</li>
            <li>I tried it repeatedly with and without the nose flap in use, and no matter what I did, it made no progress on keeping out a significant amount of light and viewable area below the eyes, no matter how I positioned it.</li>
            <li>As with most masks, it particularly allows space below the eyes where light and vision can easily and unavoidably seep through.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when this came through the mail.</li>
            <li>First night I tried it out and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I could get a full nights sleep without having to wake periodically at night from the glare of my TV or the light from my window at 7 in the morning.</li>
            <li>it is very lovely and  soft</li>
            <li>but it blocks out the light adequately.</li>
            <li>the straps do get a bit stretched out pretty easily, but, for the price, it&#x27;s a great mask.</li>
            <li>this item is special</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just right!</li>
            <li>It is nice and silky soft against my face.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed sleeping with my new sleep cover, def comfortable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and not to right.</li>
            <li>I will spend more to buy better quality next time.</li>
            <li>I do have a large head, and if the straps were any smaller, it would not have fit, but otherwise a good purchase.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t keep light out that well, and the straps broke pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The unique design is perfect for the dark room sleep even in the middle of the day.</li>
            <li>It is a great item for the price, PINK, and very silky.</li>
            <li>Regardless, it still won&#x27;t do very well at blocking light or vision unless it&#x27;s okay for it to only block some of the light and view, but not all of it.</li>
            <li>Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t use this mask or give it away even if they were free of charge in unlimited quantity and each one used saved a cute puppy&#x27;s life.  </li>
            <li>Worth it for price.</li>
            <li>Not only were they a good value, but they held up very well.  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s comfortable, soft and keeps all the light out...</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and promptly and looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable, less than twice the cost of the one reviewed here (about $5.00 more when I bought them), and it&#x27;s actually useful (unlike this Dream Essentials one).</li>
            <li>But when the strap broke right away, I realized it truly was junk</li>
            <li>so if your looking for a eye mask this one is the right one</li>
            <li>But you get what you pay for, right?</li>
            <li>Fits great though, so it was definitely what I was looking for, minus the fact it&#x27;s cheaply made.</li>
            <li>This product was good, but the cover over the nose is EXTREMELY bothersome... if you feel that way, just cut it off!</li>
            <li>It also isn&#x27;t very good at keeping the light out, which makes this an extremely useless product.</li>
            <li>First off you can see right through it</li>
            <li>The straps are elastic and could stretch for adult easily.</li>
            <li>The nose just tends to make it difficult to get something that&#x27;ll lay flat and seal out light below the eyes, even if the top and sides can more easily be sealed up in many models.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how durable the straps are--they are just fine so far.  </li>
            <li>Extremely fast shipping!</li>
            <li>While this mask is pretty to look at</li>
            <li>i will definitely be ordering more for myself and friends.</li>
            <li>The mask is pretty transparent and the fabric is not blackout like described.    </li>
            <li>One of them broke the strap within the first hour that they had it.</li>
            <li>In fact I would love to have received a white one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patricia</li>
            <li>but they are so hot.  </li>
            <li>Soft, silky, and fits comfortably</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>So I got exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I ordered soft sleet mask, cause I sleep with the light on in our room</li>
            <li>Still, it is soft and comfortable and keeps nearly all light out.  </li>
            <li>Really like this one!</li>
            <li>Thin material, which is ideal.  </li>
            <li>Soft, comfortable and so inexpensive.</li>
            <li>first impression.</li>
            <li>might* be worth it, but frankly the free masks I&#x27;ve been given on international flights have been higher quality than this.</li>
            <li>Best night&#x27;s sleep without annoying light flashes and TV!</li>
            <li>But once asleep it does block out light which wakes me up generally.</li>
            <li>The only problem was one of the straps easily came off.</li>
            <li>She loves wearing it with certain &amp;#34;outfits&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Mask is a little darker in colour than shown, but it&#x27;s still pretty vibrant and nice.</li>
            <li>If you want the mask just to block out vision or light, but not when sleeping, then comfort might not matter as much but likely still matters to you.</li>
            <li>I think it has real lavendar in it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice it as much.</li>
            <li>Blocks out light that my niece&#x27;s roommate turns on in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice I have it on while sleeping.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not that much of a hassle.</li>
            <li>thank you so much for this product.  </li>
            <li>Very darkening.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a fold by the nose that is used for extra light coverage</li>
            <li>Not too much to it,</li>
            <li>The mask isn&#x27;t worth enough to make it worth the cost and time of returning it, assuming that&#x27;s allowed for this product after you&#x27;ve tried it on.</li>
            <li>My reading light has been the subject of many discussions with my girlfriend since she goes to bed earlier than I do</li>
            <li>With this sleep mask on and my eyes closed, light still bothers me, even if the light is only from the TV.</li>
            <li>That proves that once you have these little marvels on your face you won&#x27;t see any light until you get up and push it up over your forhead to go to the bathroom.</li>
            <li>So if you don&#x27;t find it useful, as I imagine just about anyone is likely not to, you might find that you just have to eat the cost and get absolutely nothing you can use or even give away for your money.</li>
            <li>Only a tiny speck on light on the left side of my nose lets in the finest amount of light which I do not find to be any problem.  </li>
            <li>I would not waste your money on it even though it doesn&#x27;t cost much...</li>
            <li>They are not completely blackout, which is actually a bit better for young girls at a sleepover, too!</li>
            <li>The material is so thin you can see light through it, it does darken the light that you&#x27;d normally see through your eyelids.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recently I ordered 3 more of these little marvels, the rubber bands after using them for 6 months it began not to huge the face as tightly as I wanted</li>
            <li>The quality of the product is just too poor to make it useful or worthwhile at any cost.</li>
            <li>Great help in helping me get to sleep when my wife has her reading lamp on and find that even that little bit of light makes it difficult to drift off.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t possibly fall asleep with this thing on, and wouldn&#x27;t even be able to leave on my face if NOT trying to sleep due to the discomfort it creates.</li>
            <li>I LOOOOVE the added &#x27;nose flap&#x27; to block out the little slivers of light.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the matter of light leaking through and the ability to see out the bottom of a mask may be partially due to the inherently-difficult shape of the typical human face when trying to block eyesight and light.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, this is not the mask for you (try the Bath and Body Works Sweetest Softest Mask).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also soft and comfy.</li>
            <li>No one wants this feeling from mask such as this, I would expect.</li>
            <li>Essentials Snooz Silky Soft Sleep Mask</li>
            <li>I ordered this sleep mask for my two year old for a road trip.</li>
            <li>I got these for my 9 year old&#x27;s sleepover party.  </li>
            <li>Its really soft.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t fall asleep fast enough  the mask is distracting the way it digs into your skin.</li>
            <li>i have a couple sleep masks, and this is my fave so far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a wild sleeper</li>
            <li>The fabric is so thin that light goes right through it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very thin, made of cheap fabric that lets a lot of light through yet doesn&#x27;t breath well.</li>
            <li>will have to see how long it lasts since its very cheap; if you have a wide face this may not be for you, it is not very big.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s silky, hot pink, stays on well</li>
            <li>This mask isn&#x27;t heavy or thick, but blocks light adequately</li>
            <li>, it is snug fitting, but unfortunetly there is some plastic across the top and nose area that dig in slightly and it becomes uncomfortable after a long period of  time.</li>
            <li>This is a funny story that happen to me, I put my eye drops in and put the mask on and lay down and forgot to turn the little bedside flash light on all night, needless to say the batteries aren&#x27;t able to run all night without going out.  </li>
            <li>complaint is that when on back,&lt;br /&gt;some light comes up through the nose area.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise</li>
            <li>If sleep requires sleep aids such as this, then any source of additional discomfort introduced by those sleep aids is counter-productive and not worthwhile even if it were free of charge.</li>
            <li>I bought a number of different sleep masks at the same time in an effort to find even one that&#x27;d work well in blocking out light while not feeling uncomfortable, and I thought this was cheap enough to warrant a shot at it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clearly made for people with giant heads.  </li>
            <li>It presses something that isn&#x27;t soft (as the surface isn&#x27;t) into a good-sized portion of my eyelids constantly!</li>
            <li>In fairness, I&#x27;ll note that I&#x27;ve found that that most, perhaps all that I&#x27;ve tried, of low-cost sleep masks such as this one allow for light and vision below the eyes, are uncomfortable, and are ultimately not useful at all to me.</li>
            <li>While the straps are comfortable, I found the flimsy material of the mask itself rough and not very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Most tend to get quickly added to the \\&quot;useless things I wasted money on and now need to give or throw away\\&quot; pile.</li>
            <li>One of its two thin straps came out at the seam the first time I slipped it gently on, and it&#x27;s not designed to do that.</li>
            <li>In addition to pressing in on the eyelids, which I haven&#x27;t had ANY other mask do like this (and I&#x27;ve tried many), it has the more common problem of pressing on my eyelashes, which I experience as uncomfortable as well.  </li>
            <li>Sorry honey, either you have a very huge nose</li>
            <li>It was just too  uncomfortable to wear at all, flimsy and very cheap</li>
            <li>The only real issue is having to mess with my hair to get it in a position that it will stay on in</li>
            <li>i was lookin for one with a cooling effect to ease tired burned out eyes at night, but this works just fine.  </li>
            <li>I will try other methods, but that&#x27;s a lot of effort for a brand new product.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, these aren&#x27;t very effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For my money nothing can match the design or the lovely feel of them on your face and huging the nose so that you get a perfect night</li>

            <li> I SO love this product!</li>
            <li> Good mask very comfortable my daughter loves it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 sleep masks around Dec. 2009 for my own use.</li>
            <li> They block out light as they should, they are comfortable and best of all, they are cute.</li>
            <li> Very strong smell.</li>
            <li> It has a nice fit!</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is much better than the kind you can get at CVS or Walgreens, and at a cheaper price.  </li>
            <li> I have a semi large nose and they fit over my eyes perfectly!</li>
            <li> And love the bright cheerful colors.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li> Good coverage....stretched out quickly</li>
            <li> So comfortable and cute!</li>
            <li> So i guess it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li> These masks the way they perform better than any others that I have bought in stores and at a better price.  </li>
            <li> so I ordered 3 more.</li>
            <li> I should be able to figure out how to keep the rubber bands that keep them in place from stretching out, perhaps hand washing in woolite would keep them like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> CAN&#x27;T FIND A BETTER SLEEP MASK</li>
            <li> ANYWHERE FOR SLEEPING ON TRAIN OR AIRPLANE OR IN YOUR OWN BED TO KEEP ALL THE LIGHT OUT</li>
            <li> I was quite pleased with the masks.  </li>
            <li> It was an okay purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> so she could sleep better when her roomates are up all night in the dorm at college.</li>
            <li> zzzzzzz love this mask.</li>
            <li> 8-)</li>
            <li> I did:)</li>
            <li> thank you :)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s comfortable!</li>
            <li> Buy this one for sure.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Am able to sleep longer.</li>
            <li> I love this mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these and though they were stretched out over the course of two years, they&#x27;re perfect for blocking out light!</li>
            <li> On top of that, it stretches out very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Fit my daughter&#x27;s head just fine!</li>
            <li> Keeps the light out and is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I love that mask, it&#x27;s light-weight and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I purchased this night mask because of its elastic straps, hoping for a more comfortable mask than the one I have.</li>
            <li> Yes, thicker ones block the light better</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job of keeping the light out of my eyes so I can sleep.</li>
            <li> Satin is much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> It does the job perfectly, I haven&#x27;t ever had any issues with it blocking light like some other reviewers have claimed and it is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> But the quest to find something that would block out light effectively while also being comfortable was worth the effort, and sometimes an inexpensive product can be better than a higher-priced item.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes it, because her room is very light and sister is going to school very early,it&#x27;s her favorite color,smooth and very comfortable,</li>
            <li> it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> It is cheap and feels good can&#x27;t tell your very wearing it</li>
            <li> The mask looks like it&#x27;s designed very well and would be extremely comfortable and effective.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definately cheap.</li>
            <li> is more expense at 5.99 but definately worth it,</li>
            <li> I saw a review that said they could see day light because the sunlight came in around the nose area.  </li>
            <li> , IF YOU ARE LIGHT SLEEPER PERHAPS SOME EAR PLUGS MIGHT BE NEEDED IN TRAVEL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This sleep mask does NOT block out light.</li>
            <li> I wanted a cheep eye mask for when the light comes in through my blinds in the morning.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a thicker mask that blocks light.</li>
            <li> The product was cheap</li>
            <li> But it did block out some light, so</li>
            <li> Fit snug and stayed in place.</li>
            <li> I tried one on myself and they would fit adults, too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and does what it&#x27;s designed to do.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t reply I&#x27;m sleeping soundly</li>
            <li> It is still useable but doesn&#x27;t fell as secure.</li>
            <li> it is Comfortable to sleep with.</li>
            <li> so if there is any light in the room you will not be sleeping.  </li>
            <li> and it is lightweight and comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> and it does block out the light</li>
            <li> And honestly, at 3 bucks I didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s light.</li>
            <li> A bit slippery on the face, but the elastic straps are comfortable.</li>
            <li> Blocks light</li>
            <li> Blocks the light out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten where I can&#x27;t sleep with any light.</li>
            <li> My face would get sweaty but I could still see light through the mask-</li>
            <li> I tried it repeatedly with and without the nose flap in use, and no matter what I did, it made no progress on keeping out a significant amount of light and viewable area below the eyes, no matter how I positioned it.</li>
            <li> As with most masks, it particularly allows space below the eyes where light and vision can easily and unavoidably seep through.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when this came through the mail.</li>
            <li> First night I tried it out and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I could get a full nights sleep without having to wake periodically at night from the glare of my TV or the light from my window at 7 in the morning.</li>
            <li> it is very lovely and  soft</li>
            <li> but it blocks out the light adequately.</li>
            <li> the straps do get a bit stretched out pretty easily, but, for the price, it&#x27;s a great mask.</li>
            <li> this item is special</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just right!</li>
            <li> It is nice and silky soft against my face.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed sleeping with my new sleep cover, def comfortable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and not to right.</li>
            <li> I will spend more to buy better quality next time.</li>
            <li> I do have a large head, and if the straps were any smaller, it would not have fit, but otherwise a good purchase.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep light out that well, and the straps broke pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The unique design is perfect for the dark room sleep even in the middle of the day.</li>
            <li> It is a great item for the price, PINK, and very silky.</li>
            <li> Regardless, it still won&#x27;t do very well at blocking light or vision unless it&#x27;s okay for it to only block some of the light and view, but not all of it.</li>
            <li> Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t use this mask or give it away even if they were free of charge in unlimited quantity and each one used saved a cute puppy&#x27;s life.  </li>
            <li> Worth it for price.</li>
            <li> Not only were they a good value, but they held up very well.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s comfortable, soft and keeps all the light out...</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and promptly and looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable, less than twice the cost of the one reviewed here (about $5.00 more when I bought them), and it&#x27;s actually useful (unlike this Dream Essentials one).</li>
            <li> But when the strap broke right away, I realized it truly was junk</li>
            <li> so if your looking for a eye mask this one is the right one</li>
            <li> But you get what you pay for, right?</li>
            <li> Fits great though, so it was definitely what I was looking for, minus the fact it&#x27;s cheaply made.</li>
            <li> This product was good, but the cover over the nose is EXTREMELY bothersome... if you feel that way, just cut it off!</li>
            <li> It also isn&#x27;t very good at keeping the light out, which makes this an extremely useless product.</li>
            <li> First off you can see right through it</li>
            <li> The straps are elastic and could stretch for adult easily.</li>
            <li> The nose just tends to make it difficult to get something that&#x27;ll lay flat and seal out light below the eyes, even if the top and sides can more easily be sealed up in many models.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how durable the straps are--they are just fine so far.  </li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping!</li>
            <li> While this mask is pretty to look at</li>
            <li> i will definitely be ordering more for myself and friends.</li>
            <li> The mask is pretty transparent and the fabric is not blackout like described.    </li>
            <li> One of them broke the strap within the first hour that they had it.</li>
            <li> In fact I would love to have received a white one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patricia</li>
            <li> but they are so hot.  </li>
            <li> Soft, silky, and fits comfortably</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> So I got exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I ordered soft sleet mask, cause I sleep with the light on in our room</li>
            <li> Still, it is soft and comfortable and keeps nearly all light out.  </li>
            <li> Really like this one!</li>
            <li> Thin material, which is ideal.  </li>
            <li> Soft, comfortable and so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> first impression.</li>
            <li> might* be worth it, but frankly the free masks I&#x27;ve been given on international flights have been higher quality than this.</li>
            <li> Best night&#x27;s sleep without annoying light flashes and TV!</li>
            <li> But once asleep it does block out light which wakes me up generally.</li>
            <li> The only problem was one of the straps easily came off.</li>
            <li> She loves wearing it with certain &amp;#34;outfits&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Mask is a little darker in colour than shown, but it&#x27;s still pretty vibrant and nice.</li>
            <li> If you want the mask just to block out vision or light, but not when sleeping, then comfort might not matter as much but likely still matters to you.</li>
            <li> I think it has real lavendar in it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice it as much.</li>
            <li> Blocks out light that my niece&#x27;s roommate turns on in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice I have it on while sleeping.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> thank you so much for this product.  </li>
            <li> Very darkening.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a fold by the nose that is used for extra light coverage</li>
            <li> Not too much to it,</li>
            <li> The mask isn&#x27;t worth enough to make it worth the cost and time of returning it, assuming that&#x27;s allowed for this product after you&#x27;ve tried it on.</li>
            <li> My reading light has been the subject of many discussions with my girlfriend since she goes to bed earlier than I do</li>
            <li> With this sleep mask on and my eyes closed, light still bothers me, even if the light is only from the TV.</li>
            <li> That proves that once you have these little marvels on your face you won&#x27;t see any light until you get up and push it up over your forhead to go to the bathroom.</li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t find it useful, as I imagine just about anyone is likely not to, you might find that you just have to eat the cost and get absolutely nothing you can use or even give away for your money.</li>
            <li> Only a tiny speck on light on the left side of my nose lets in the finest amount of light which I do not find to be any problem.  </li>
            <li> I would not waste your money on it even though it doesn&#x27;t cost much...</li>
            <li> They are not completely blackout, which is actually a bit better for young girls at a sleepover, too!</li>
            <li> The material is so thin you can see light through it, it does darken the light that you&#x27;d normally see through your eyelids.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently I ordered 3 more of these little marvels, the rubber bands after using them for 6 months it began not to huge the face as tightly as I wanted</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is just too poor to make it useful or worthwhile at any cost.</li>
            <li> Great help in helping me get to sleep when my wife has her reading lamp on and find that even that little bit of light makes it difficult to drift off.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t possibly fall asleep with this thing on, and wouldn&#x27;t even be able to leave on my face if NOT trying to sleep due to the discomfort it creates.</li>
            <li> I LOOOOVE the added &#x27;nose flap&#x27; to block out the little slivers of light.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the matter of light leaking through and the ability to see out the bottom of a mask may be partially due to the inherently-difficult shape of the typical human face when trying to block eyesight and light.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, this is not the mask for you (try the Bath and Body Works Sweetest Softest Mask).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also soft and comfy.</li>
            <li> No one wants this feeling from mask such as this, I would expect.</li>
            <li> Essentials Snooz Silky Soft Sleep Mask</li>
            <li> I ordered this sleep mask for my two year old for a road trip.</li>
            <li> I got these for my 9 year old&#x27;s sleepover party.  </li>
            <li> Its really soft.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t fall asleep fast enough  the mask is distracting the way it digs into your skin.</li>
            <li> i have a couple sleep masks, and this is my fave so far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a wild sleeper</li>
            <li> The fabric is so thin that light goes right through it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very thin, made of cheap fabric that lets a lot of light through yet doesn&#x27;t breath well.</li>
            <li> will have to see how long it lasts since its very cheap; if you have a wide face this may not be for you, it is not very big.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s silky, hot pink, stays on well</li>
            <li> This mask isn&#x27;t heavy or thick, but blocks light adequately</li>
            <li> , it is snug fitting, but unfortunetly there is some plastic across the top and nose area that dig in slightly and it becomes uncomfortable after a long period of  time.</li>
            <li> This is a funny story that happen to me, I put my eye drops in and put the mask on and lay down and forgot to turn the little bedside flash light on all night, needless to say the batteries aren&#x27;t able to run all night without going out.  </li>
            <li> complaint is that when on back,&lt;br /&gt;some light comes up through the nose area.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise</li>
            <li> If sleep requires sleep aids such as this, then any source of additional discomfort introduced by those sleep aids is counter-productive and not worthwhile even if it were free of charge.</li>
            <li> I bought a number of different sleep masks at the same time in an effort to find even one that&#x27;d work well in blocking out light while not feeling uncomfortable, and I thought this was cheap enough to warrant a shot at it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clearly made for people with giant heads.  </li>
            <li> It presses something that isn&#x27;t soft (as the surface isn&#x27;t) into a good-sized portion of my eyelids constantly!</li>
            <li> In fairness, I&#x27;ll note that I&#x27;ve found that that most, perhaps all that I&#x27;ve tried, of low-cost sleep masks such as this one allow for light and vision below the eyes, are uncomfortable, and are ultimately not useful at all to me.</li>
            <li> While the straps are comfortable, I found the flimsy material of the mask itself rough and not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Most tend to get quickly added to the \\&quot;useless things I wasted money on and now need to give or throw away\\&quot; pile.</li>
            <li> One of its two thin straps came out at the seam the first time I slipped it gently on, and it&#x27;s not designed to do that.</li>
            <li> In addition to pressing in on the eyelids, which I haven&#x27;t had ANY other mask do like this (and I&#x27;ve tried many), it has the more common problem of pressing on my eyelashes, which I experience as uncomfortable as well.  </li>
            <li> Sorry honey, either you have a very huge nose</li>
            <li> It was just too  uncomfortable to wear at all, flimsy and very cheap</li>
            <li> The only real issue is having to mess with my hair to get it in a position that it will stay on in</li>
            <li> i was lookin for one with a cooling effect to ease tired burned out eyes at night, but this works just fine.  </li>
            <li> I will try other methods, but that&#x27;s a lot of effort for a brand new product.</li>
            <li> It does this to a very significant degree and is extremely uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> For flat and lightweight sleep masks, I recommend trying the following instead.</li>
            <li> However back straps will not last long..they will get loose within several weeks.</li>
            <li> Further, it does NOT block out light or vision, and the nose flap mentioned above is useless in this endeavor.</li>
            <li> The elastic is also very thin and flimsy, so the mask slips out of position easily, and I doubt if it would hold up well to multiple washings.</li>
            <li> I bought my wife 3 sleep masks, two that were padded and a little more expensive, and this on - simple, light, and thin.</li>
            <li> No light comes thru and they are soft and the ties do not irritate.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re buying them for a one time use like a long flight they *</li>
            <li> I ended up ordering a satin mask from another Amazon seller that was less expensive and better quality.</li>
            <li> ON THE OTHER HAND, there&#x27;s no point in paying even a low price for something not functional at all.</li>
            <li> The other is still going strong so I may have just received a flawed one....</li>
            <li> I have dry eyes</li>
            <li> It left markings all over the sheets (like wet ink) and the strap is very loose.</li>
            <li> Also, one of the elastic straps already came loose.</li>
            <li> who would not love it, if your gf or wife is shy about using some thing in the bedroom this is cheap enough she shoudnt complain about putting on, or vise versa..</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a piece of black fabric that goes across the bridge of your nose, and the color of the item actually received is a lighter shade of pink.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sleep mask for my little girl because she wanted one like her big sister.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint was that I ordered four masks and they only sent me two.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the purple and pink.  </li>

            <li> Given the low price and higher-quality products out there, it may seem odd to buy such a cheap item and then be disappointed in the results.</li>
            <li> I guess it wasn&#x27;t a complete failure of a purchase.</li>
            <li> It is extremely uncomfortable--it even scratched my skin.  </li>
            <li> Second of all it&#x27;s made of some slick material that is not at all silky as they claimed and the tag is on the inside up against your face.  </li>
            <li> , it arrived quik as scheduled and are in my fave color pink and black and does feel silky</li>
            <li> However, when I contacted them about the error, even though they never responded by phone or email to my complaint, I did receive the other two masks in the mail a couple days later.  </li>
            <li> Thought it was a little small for my big head</li>

            <li> Not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> but you get what you pay for as they say...way too tight with its elastic &#x27;string&#x27; band?</li>
            <li> I thought the elastic was a little tight but have been working on stretching it out.  </li>

            <li> My only complaint is that I feel like it is crunching my eyelashes down which can be uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I now don&#x27;t usually sleep without a mask.</li>

            <li> Keeps the light out and is very comfortable.  I am going to purchase an extra one !! Helps me go to sleep a lot sooner!  I have dry eyes and I sleep with a fan on.  This mask protects my eyes also.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Good mask...a bit transparent in really bright environment but would purchase again.  Extremely fast shipping!</li>
            <li> For the price this worked great!  I work over nights and have to sleep during the day and it does a great job!</li>
            <li> It works great! The only problem was one of the straps easily came off.</li>
            <li> While this mask is pretty to look at it&#x27;s definately cheap. The material is so thin you can see light through it, it does darken the light that you&#x27;d normally see through your eyelids. So i guess it&#x27;s okay, will have to see how long it lasts since its very cheap; if you have a wide face this may not be for you, it is not very big. I did purchase a second sleep mask it was a DREAM ZONE-EARTH THERAPEUTICS SLEEP MASK, is more expense at 5.99 but definately worth it, now that one is a great sleep mask.</li>
            <li> I used this product at a sleepover for my daughter 13th birthday.  We played 3 blind fold games and even ended the night with a constructive arts and craft with glitter and glue.  The kids loved it.  I ordered the purple and pink.  They were very beautiful colors.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 sleep masks around Dec. 2009 for my own use. I am a person who needs a black room to sleep. These masks the way they perform better than any others that I have bought in stores and at a better price.  The unique design is perfect for the dark room sleep even in the middle of the day. There is a added piece that hugs the nose and keep sunlight out. I saw a review that said they could see day light because the sunlight came in around the nose area.  Sorry honey, either you have a very huge nose are you are wearing them in correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my money nothing can match the design or the lovely feel of them on your face and huging the nose so that you get a perfect night sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I ordered 3 more of these little marvels, the rubber bands after using them for 6 months it began not to huge the face as tightly as I wanted so I ordered 3 more. I should be able to figure out how to keep the rubber bands that keep them in place from stretching out, perhaps hand washing in woolite would keep them like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU CAN&#x27;T FIND A BETTER SLEEP MASK ANYWHERE FOR SLEEPING ON TRAIN OR AIRPLANE OR IN YOUR OWN BED TO KEEP ALL THE LIGHT OUT, IF YOU ARE LIGHT SLEEPER PERHAPS SOME EAR PLUGS MIGHT BE NEEDED IN TRAVEL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This is a funny story that happen to me, I put my eye drops in and put the mask on and lay down and forgot to turn the little bedside flash light on all night, needless to say the batteries aren&#x27;t able to run all night without going out.  That proves that once you have these little marvels on your face you won&#x27;t see any light until you get up and push it up over your forhead to go to the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I love that mask, it&#x27;s light-weight and comfortable. it arrived very quickly. the straps do get a bit stretched out pretty easily, but, for the price, it&#x27;s a great mask. i will definitely be ordering more for myself and friends.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sleep mask a couple of weeks ago, and I am completely disappointed in it.  It is extremely uncomfortable--it even scratched my skin.  If you have sensitive skin, this is not the mask for you (try the Bath and Body Works Sweetest Softest Mask).  It also isn&#x27;t very good at keeping the light out, which makes this an extremely useless product.</li>
            <li> I LOOOOVE the added &#x27;nose flap&#x27; to block out the little slivers of light. Best one of these I&#x27;ve EVER used.</li>
            <li> color bleeds onto skin</li>
            <li> This sleep mask does NOT block out light. With this sleep mask on and my eyes closed, light still bothers me, even if the light is only from the TV. The mask is pretty transparent and the fabric is not blackout like described.    The product pictured is not the item I received. The fabric on both sides is like the fabric they use in tracksuits or tents, and not silky like in the picture. There&#x27;s a piece of black fabric that goes across the bridge of your nose, and the color of the item actually received is a lighter shade of pink.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted! It has a nice fit!</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my little girls. One of them broke the strap within the first hour that they had it. The other is still going strong so I may have just received a flawed one....</li>
            <li> Works like a charm!! Got extra sleep this morning, almost made men late for work lol. Mask is a little darker in colour than shown, but it&#x27;s still pretty vibrant and nice. It&#x27;s also soft and comfy.</li>
            <li> I ordered a pick sleep mask, but was sent a red one. In fact I would love to have received a white one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patricia</li>
            <li> Blocks out light very good!</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that I ordered four masks and they only sent me two.  However, when I contacted them about the error, even though they never responded by phone or email to my complaint, I did receive the other two masks in the mail a couple days later.  The girls loved them!</li>
            <li> These were everything I hoped they would be.  They block out light as they should, they are comfortable and best of all, they are cute.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this sleep mask at all, not for anyone with any intended use for it!  For one thing, and this is enough reason not to buy it, IT BROKE IMMEDIATELY!!! One of its two thin straps came out at the seam the first time I slipped it gently on, and it&#x27;s not designed to do that. There&#x27;s no way to reattach it into a buckle or snap or anything like that. The quality of the product is just too poor to make it useful or worthwhile at any cost. I actually felt like it was a low-quality product the moment I held it in my hands and looked at it. But when the strap broke right away, I realized it truly was junk and I couldn&#x27;t even give it away.  For another thing, it is TOO SMALL! It must have been designed for very tiny people or children. I have a small head, narrow face, and am thin as well as small-boned. I tried this thing both with and without its useless nose flap deployed (and who wants their nostrils covered while sleeping, being forced to mouth breathe?). This mask presses in on my eyelids (the skin itself, not just the eyelashes) on the outside parts of them. It does this to a very significant degree and is extremely uncomfortable to wear. I couldn&#x27;t possibly fall asleep with this thing on, and wouldn&#x27;t even be able to leave on my face if NOT trying to sleep due to the discomfort it creates. It presses something that isn&#x27;t soft (as the surface isn&#x27;t) into a good-sized portion of my eyelids constantly! No one wants this feeling from mask such as this, I would expect. In addition to pressing in on the eyelids, which I haven&#x27;t had ANY other mask do like this (and I&#x27;ve tried many), it has the more common problem of pressing on my eyelashes, which I experience as uncomfortable as well.  Further, it does NOT block out light or vision, and the nose flap mentioned above is useless in this endeavor. As with most masks, it particularly allows space below the eyes where light and vision can easily and unavoidably seep through. I tried it repeatedly with and without the nose flap in use, and no matter what I did, it made no progress on keeping out a significant amount of light and viewable area below the eyes, no matter how I positioned it. Of course, once the strap broke (within a minute or two tops), the point was moot as I realized it was useless junk. Plus, just because of the pressing feeling against my eyelids, neither of those issues mattered. If not for one reason, then for another, this mask is useless.  In fairness, I&#x27;ll note that I&#x27;ve found that that most, perhaps all that I&#x27;ve tried, of low-cost sleep masks such as this one allow for light and vision below the eyes, are uncomfortable, and are ultimately not useful at all to me. Most tend to get quickly added to the \\&quot;useless things I wasted money on and now need to give or throw away\\&quot; pile. Perhaps the matter of light leaking through and the ability to see out the bottom of a mask may be partially due to the inherently-difficult shape of the typical human face when trying to block eyesight and light. The nose just tends to make it difficult to get something that&#x27;ll lay flat and seal out light below the eyes, even if the top and sides can more easily be sealed up in many models.  ON THE OTHER HAND, there&#x27;s no point in paying even a low price for something not functional at all. The mask isn&#x27;t worth enough to make it worth the cost and time of returning it, assuming that&#x27;s allowed for this product after you&#x27;ve tried it on. So if you don&#x27;t find it useful, as I imagine just about anyone is likely not to, you might find that you just have to eat the cost and get absolutely nothing you can use or even give away for your money. If sleep requires sleep aids such as this, then any source of additional discomfort introduced by those sleep aids is counter-productive and not worthwhile even if it were free of charge. If you want the mask just to block out vision or light, but not when sleeping, then comfort might not matter as much but likely still matters to you. Who wantsto have something on that doesn&#x27;t feel good? Regardless, it still won&#x27;t do very well at blocking light or vision unless it&#x27;s okay for it to only block some of the light and view, but not all of it. That may be all you want from it for all I know. Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t use this mask or give it away even if they were free of charge in unlimited quantity and each one used saved a cute puppy&#x27;s life.  Given the low price and higher-quality products out there, it may seem odd to buy such a cheap item and then be disappointed in the results. But the quest to find something that would block out light effectively while also being comfortable was worth the effort, and sometimes an inexpensive product can be better than a higher-priced item. I bought a number of different sleep masks at the same time in an effort to find even one that&#x27;d work well in blocking out light while not feeling uncomfortable, and I thought this was cheap enough to warrant a shot at it. I was wrong this time!  For flat and lightweight sleep masks, I recommend trying the following instead. It&#x27;s very comfortable, less than twice the cost of the one reviewed here (about $5.00 more when I bought them), and it&#x27;s actually useful (unlike this Dream Essentials one). I got one with a lavender scent that&#x27;s beautiful and comforting to smell as well. I think it has real lavendar in it. Here it is:  [[ASIN:B003Q6T7KY Aroma Home Silk Eye Mask Black]].

            <li> I wanted a cheep eye mask for when the light comes in through my blinds in the morning. My only complaint is that I feel like it is crunching my eyelashes down which can be uncomfortable. However, if I&#x27;m tired enough I don&#x27;t notice it as much.</li>
            <li> They are just what i wanted.  No light comes thru and they are soft and the ties do not irritate.</li>
            <li> Great help in helping me get to sleep when my wife has her reading lamp on and find that even that little bit of light makes it difficult to drift off.</li>
            <li> Terrific product. Blocks out light that my niece&#x27;s roommate turns on in the middle of the night. She loved it.I gave it to my niece for Christmas! Great gift</li>
            <li> While \\&quot;cute\\&quot;, I was really disappointed with this sleep mask. I purchased this night mask because of its elastic straps, hoping for a more comfortable mask than the one I have. While the straps are comfortable, I found the flimsy material of the mask itself rough and not very comfortable. The fabric is so thin that light goes right through it. I was hoping for a thicker mask that blocks light. Why else would you be purchasing a sleep mask?</li>
            <li> I was quite pleased with the masks.  Yes, thicker ones block the light better but they are so hot.  I like how slim these are.  If you wash them, it softens the material.  I thought the elastic was a little tight but have been working on stretching it out.  And love the bright cheerful colors.</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend as a surprise since she always has a pair of pants over her eyes when she sleeps. She loves it. Soft, silky, and fits comfortably</li>
            <li> Great product. Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> The product was cheap so I didn&#x27;t expect anything fancy but I didn&#x27;t want anything fancy. So I got exactly what I wanted. It arrived quickly and promptly and looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> It was an okay purchase for the price. It doesn&#x27;t keep light out that well, and the straps broke pretty quickly. But it did block out some light, so I guess it wasn&#x27;t a complete failure of a purchase. I will spend more to buy better quality next time.</li>
            <li> I had to buy this when I was working overnights and would sleep during daylight hours. It is nice and silky soft against my face. It does a pretty good job of keeping the light out of my eyes so I can sleep. I do have a large head, and if the straps were any smaller, it would not have fit, but otherwise a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when this came through the mail. First night I tried it out and fell in love with it. I could get a full nights sleep without having to wake periodically at night from the glare of my TV or the light from my window at 7 in the morning.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the elastic strap.  It lost the elasticity after 2 washings in cold water.  I will not order again.</li>
            <li> We used these for a community theater show and they held up well. I would reccomend them to anyone...It is a good product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this sleep mask for my two year old for a road trip. Fit snug and stayed in place. The straps are elastic and could stretch for adult easily. Color was same as pictured and everything.</li>
            <li> I make glasses protectors out of these and it works great. I can carry them in my purse and have them protecting my glasses all over the house. they make great gifts too.</li>
            <li> I ordered soft sleet mask, cause I sleep with the light on in our room my other half likes to sleep in a dark room.    Good product</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t use it for a &amp;#34;sleep mask&amp;#34; though.  It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;blindfold&amp;#34; for our purposes!  She loves wearing it with certain &amp;#34;outfits&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I got these for my 9 year old&#x27;s sleepover party.  They were perfect.  I tried one on myself and they would fit adults, too.  They are not completely blackout, which is actually a bit better for young girls at a sleepover, too!</li>
            <li> I needed an additional sleep mask &#x27;cause the one I got at Claire&#x27;s was falling apart. I now don&#x27;t usually sleep without a mask. It&#x27;s just amazing. I tried it on and it fits perfectly</li>
            <li> My daughter likes it, because her room is very light and sister is going to school very early,it&#x27;s her favorite color,smooth and very comfortable,recommend to buy.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred only one headband, but engineers have their reasons I suppose.  Still, it is soft and comfortable and keeps nearly all light out.  Only a tiny speck on light on the left side of my nose lets in the finest amount of light which I do not find to be any problem.  Really like this one!</li>
            <li> I loved how it feels. Its really soft. The only problem is that my elastic string detached within two days.</li>
            <li> standard inexpensive mask.&lt;br /&gt;only complaint is that when on back,&lt;br /&gt;some light comes up through the nose area.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise great for travel&lt;br /&gt;(when sleeping while still a bit vertical)</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is much better than the kind you can get at CVS or Walgreens, and at a cheaper price.  It&#x27;s comfortable and does what it&#x27;s designed to do.</li>
            <li> it is a good sleep mask, it does  not break and do its work. not fancy but for the price it is perfect</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, great price,  love the color.</li>
            <li> I bought this mask for my daughter so she could sleep better when her roomates are up all night in the dorm at college. She loves it and now all of her friends want to borrow hers.</li>
            <li> The sleep mask works well enough, it is snug fitting, but unfortunetly there is some plastic across the top and nose area that dig in slightly and it becomes uncomfortable after a long period of  time. If you don&#x27;t fall asleep fast enough  the mask is distracting the way it digs into your skin. But once asleep it does block out light which wakes me up generally.</li>
            <li> I have a streetlight outside of my house that always bothers me through my blinds, so I ordered this awhile back. It does the job perfectly, I haven&#x27;t ever had any issues with it blocking light like some other reviewers have claimed and it is very comfortable. I don&#x27;t really notice I have it on while sleeping. The only real issue is having to mess with my hair to get it in a position that it will stay on in but it&#x27;s not that much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t reply I&#x27;m sleeping soundly zzzzzzz love this mask. Had others not as good. I bought several of them for friends</li>
            <li> Good coverage....stretched out quickly</li>
            <li> no good but you get what you pay for as they say...way too tight with its elastic &#x27;string&#x27; band? and i have a tiny head. It was just too  uncomfortable to wear at all, flimsy and very cheap</li>
            <li> I never wore it and always forgot it was in my drawer next to the bed....</li>
            <li> Thin material, which is ideal.  This mask isn&#x27;t heavy or thick, but blocks light adequately</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t see anything when it&#x27;s on tho&#x27;.  I&#x27;m like, blinded or something.  maybe it&#x27;s defective?  8-)</li>
            <li> This product was good, but the cover over the nose is EXTREMELY bothersome... if you feel that way, just cut it off! I did:)</li>
            <li> It comes with two elastic straps. I hadn&#x27;t even had it a week and one of the straps broke. It is still useable but doesn&#x27;t fell as secure.</li>
            <li> So comfortable and cute! I love it, Now I can sleep perfectly</li>
            <li> Items were just as described.  Very comfortable to wear.  We&#x27;ll see how durable the straps are--they are just fine so far.  Would happily buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> It is cheap and feels good can&#x27;t tell your very wearing it so if your looking for a eye mask this one is the right one</li>
            <li> Works great and great color</li>
            <li> First night the straps broke off very disappointed</li>
            <li> thank you so much for this product.  i have a couple sleep masks, and this is my fave so far.  i was lookin for one with a cooling effect to ease tired burned out eyes at night, but this works just fine.  i cannot sleep unless there is just about total darkness, and this helps a LOT.  thank you :)</li>
            <li> it is Comfortable to sleep with. However back straps will not last long..they will get loose within several weeks. Worth it for price.</li>
            <li> I like the material. Thought it was a little small for my big head but it blocks out the light adequately. I&#x27;m a wild sleeper so it comes off in the middle of the night. Bought it for an overnight plane ride. will see how it fares then.</li>
            <li> I bought my wife 3 sleep masks, two that were padded and a little more expensive, and this on - simple, light, and thin. By a wide margine, the Snooz Silky Soft Sleep Mask is the winner.</li>
            <li> The mask looks like it&#x27;s designed very well and would be extremely comfortable and effective.  However, there is a faint chemical odor not unlike gasoline and the smell you get on some clothes that are dry-clean only.  I tried hand washing it, then washing it in the laundry with fabric softeners, and the odor lingers, though it is fainter.  I&#x27;m hoping it will dissipate, but until then, I can&#x27;t wear it.  I&#x27;d get a headache from trying to sleep with it on.  I will try other methods, but that&#x27;s a lot of effort for a brand new product.</li>
            <li> This product is a good product and gets the job done. Very darkening. I wish it was made a softer material.</li>
            <li> Received on time. Love the product! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> i do not used this for sleeping, i use it for my bdsm lifestyle.  it does what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li> First off you can see right through it so if there is any light in the room you will not be sleeping.  Second of all it&#x27;s made of some slick material that is not at all silky as they claimed and the tag is on the inside up against your face.  I would not waste your money on it even though it doesn&#x27;t cost much...it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> Black dye rubbed off on our pillows and sheets.  It took several washes to get it out.  Not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> I decorated and used these for a girls weekend.  Not only were they a good value, but they held up very well.  I use mine all the time and it is lightweight and comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> this item is special it is very lovely and  soft and I have been using it every night, I am very happy with it</li>
            <li> Good mask very comfortable my daughter loves it and it does block out the light</li>
            <li> I give this 2 stars because it&#x27;s soft and it&#x27;s pink.  It&#x27;s clearly made for people with giant heads.  On top of that, it stretches out very quickly.  I had to tie a knot in the straps just to keep it on my face.  But you get what you pay for, right?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these and though they were stretched out over the course of two years, they&#x27;re perfect for blocking out light! I have a semi large nose and they fit over my eyes perfectly! There&#x27;s a fold by the nose that is used for extra light coverage and it&#x27;s comfortable! The only con is like I said earlier, the elastic stretching, otherwise the masks last for quite a while!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed sleeping with my new sleep cover, def comfortable and I have no complaints, it arrived quik as scheduled and are in my fave color pink and black and does feel silky</li>
            <li> It is what it is..! Not too much to it, but it&#x27;s silky, hot pink, stays on well..bought for my daughter who is 5. It stays on her eyes, and mine.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sleep mask for my little girl because she wanted one like her big sister.  It is a great item for the price, PINK, and very silky. Fit my daughter&#x27;s head just fine!</li>
            <li> this product works great and is very comfortable to sleep with. i would buy it again for myself or a gift.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the fabric of this at all.  Satin is much more comfortable.  It also does not fit well around the nose.  Never had one night of good sleep with this.  I ended up ordering a satin mask from another Amazon seller that was less expensive and better quality.</li>
            <li> Soft, comfortable and so inexpensive. My reading light has been the subject of many discussions with my girlfriend since she goes to bed earlier than I do and I read until the wee hours. This was the solution... And honestly, at 3 bucks I didn&#x27;t expect much. However, it&#x27;s comfortable, soft and keeps all the light out... Plus it&#x27;s light. Totally worth the money. Buy this one for sure.</li>
            <li> A bit slippery on the face, but the elastic straps are comfortable. Best night&#x27;s sleep without annoying light flashes and TV!</li>
            <li> first impression. i like it. then, a little bit dissapointment. the rubber broke up. so, i sew. not perfect anymore. next, because not cotton, this not absorb my sweat when sleep.</li>
            <li> who would not love it, if your gf or wife is shy about using some thing in the bedroom this is cheap enough she shoudnt complain about putting on, or vise versa..</li>
            <li> It is already coming apart, And I haven&#x27;t washed it yet. Fits great though, so it was definitely what I was looking for, minus the fact it&#x27;s cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Blocks light but I wish I had gotten a mask with indentation for my nose.  Also, one of the elastic straps already came loose.</li>
            <li> Love it. Am able to sleep longer. Blocks the light out. Good quality for price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten where I can&#x27;t sleep with any light. I bought this to sleep in at night and during travel. We travel allot and sure this will come in handy this summer on vacation!</li>
            <li> I bought several of these in different colors because I work night shift, and don&#x27;t like to wear the same sleep mask night after night, as that can cause breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, these aren&#x27;t very effective. They&#x27;re very thin, made of cheap fabric that lets a lot of light through yet doesn&#x27;t breath well. My face would get sweaty but I could still see light through the mask- the worst of both worlds. The elastic is also very thin and flimsy, so the mask slips out of position easily, and I doubt if it would hold up well to multiple washings. If you&#x27;re buying them for a one time use like a long flight they *might* be worth it, but frankly the free masks I&#x27;ve been given on international flights have been higher quality than this. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> too thin to keep all the light out.</li>
            <li> Just opened it - smells like chemicals!! Very strong smell. I am not going to put that on my face! Throwing out.</li>
            <li> This thing is stupid. It left markings all over the sheets (like wet ink) and the strap is very loose.</li>
            <li> Daughter was happy with it.</li>
            <li> I SO love this product! I want one for myself, as this is for a friend. It was on time &amp; of great quality.</li>
            <li> I love this mask. It is my bed time bff. It&#x27;s comfortable and not to right. It&#x27;s just right!</li>
