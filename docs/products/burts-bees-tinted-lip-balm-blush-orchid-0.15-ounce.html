            <li>Perfect shade.</li>
            <li>Anything Burt&#x27;s Bees makes is wonderful; this lip balm is great for chapped lips or just sitting in the sun.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes great</li>
            <li>good products.www.herebbs.com</li>
            <li>It feels good on the lips, but don&#x27;t buy this if you&#x27;re looking for lots of hydration.</li>
            <li>Perfect for a lightly tinted lip balm.</li>
            <li>the color is good.</li>
            <li>awesome product...just too light for my skin tone (olive)</li>
            <li>Very nice balm for the price and better then some of my pricier balms.</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Great, light tint for summer ...</li>
            <li>The color was not as represented, but I still love Burt&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>You get more color from their lip shimmer.  </li>
            <li>Most tinted lip balms out there are not what they should be.</li>
            <li>Goes on comfortably, and for a balm has staying power</li>
            <li>It has pretty good staying power and is also very soothing.</li>
            <li>Blush Orchid is a very light pink (think cotton candy) shade that compliments my fair skin tone.</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about the Blush Orchid color.</li>
            <li>I liked the packaging of this one and wanted a shimmery light pink color.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the $.</li>
            <li>It softens lips, and it deposits just the right amount of color.</li>
            <li>My favorite color is still Pink Blossom, it looks the most natural.</li>
            <li>I really like this lip balm.</li>
            <li>When I saw this at the story I really wanted it.</li>
            <li>but if you want any color on your lips you have to go for the much darker ones.</li>
            <li>This is a great color, especially if you have pale skin.</li>
            <li>It might as well be clear.</li>
            <li>The color is soft and it keeps my lips from getting chapped.</li>
            <li>This gives a nice shine to my lips and the colors are very vibrant, unlike other tinted lip balms which hardly show up at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty, although the color doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>When I put it on my lips, there is barely any color that I can tell.  </li>
            <li>This barely shows up on my lips.</li>

            <li> But in the dry winter, it seems to be a little too dry to just use it.</li>
            <li> I received and empty cardboard tube !</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this product smells like beeswax.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely pale, and creates a bit of a &amp;#34;frosted&amp;#34; look, which does not work for me at all and makes me look like a ghost.</li>
            <li> Walgreen&#x27;s sold it for $6.99 for a little tube!  </li>
            <li> The color is very shallow, not like it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so bad that I wouldn&#x27;t continue buying this product, but a little added fragrance wouldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> but it was too expensive.</li>
            <li> It just looks terrible.  </li>

            <li> good products.www.herebbs.com/thread-4028-1-1.html</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t know how to rate it.  I received and empty cardboard tube !</li>
            <li> This product looks like creamy crayon when smeared on.  It just looks terrible.  I used it once and haven&#x27;t touched it since.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this. The color was not as represented, but I still love Burt&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees makes the best lip balms in the business.  This is a great color, especially if you have pale skin.</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about the Blush Orchid color. It&#x27;s extremely pale, and creates a bit of a &amp;#34;frosted&amp;#34; look, which does not work for me at all and makes me look like a ghost. My favorite color is still Pink Blossom, it looks the most natural.</li>
            <li> Burt ªs Bees products for lips and hands are my go-to default for lip balm and hands.</li>
            <li> Anything Burt&#x27;s Bees makes is wonderful; this lip balm is great for chapped lips or just sitting in the sun.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a regular sized lip balm like Chapstick but 3 times the price. Walgreen&#x27;s sold it for $6.99 for a little tube!  What color?  I got the Red Dahlia color looking for the darkest color I could find. Basically, the tube material is colored, is what you&#x27;re paying for. When I put it on my lips, there is barely any color that I can tell.  You get more color from their lip shimmer.  Don&#x27;t plan to buy this again, may as well just pay $3 for their regular non-colored lip balm</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, although the color doesn&#x27;t last long. It feels good on the lips, but don&#x27;t buy this if you&#x27;re looking for lots of hydration.</li>
            <li> Great, light tint for summer ... Wish it had SPF though.</li>
            <li> This is  wonderful lip balm.  It&#x27;s Burt&#x27;s Bees!  They are known for their quality products, and this is no different.  I love them!</li>
            <li> Very nice balm for the price and better then some of my pricier balms.</li>
            <li> This gives a nice shine to my lips and the colors are very vibrant, unlike other tinted lip balms which hardly show up at all.  It has pretty good staying power and is also very soothing.</li>
            <li> When I saw this at the story I really wanted it. I was going to buy Baby Lips but it was too expensive. I liked the packaging of this one and wanted a shimmery light pink color. This barely shows up on my lips. It might as well be clear. It moisturizes great but if you want any color on your lips you have to go for the much darker ones.</li>
            <li> Love it! Definitely worth the $. Perfect shade.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a lightly tinted lip balm. Goes on comfortably, and for a balm has staying power</li>
            <li> The color is very shallow, not like it</li>
            <li> Most tinted lip balms out there are not what they should be. When I am shopping for tinted lip balm, I want a lip balm (read: moisturizing) that gives my lip a pop of color (read: not invisible, but not as opaque as lipstick either.) This is a tinted lip balm that fits the bill. It softens lips, and it deposits just the right amount of color. Blush Orchid is a very light pink (think cotton candy) shade that compliments my fair skin tone. My only complaint is that this product smells like beeswax. I know that as a Burt&#x27;s Bees product, it&#x27;s a given, but I&#x27;m not fond of the smell. It&#x27;s not so bad that I wouldn&#x27;t continue buying this product, but a little added fragrance wouldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> the color is good. But in the dry winter, it seems to be a little too dry to just use it.</li>
            <li> awesome product...just too light for my skin tone (olive)</li>
