            <li>I received this to review and love it.</li>

            <li>Really light scent from what I am used to.</li>
            <li>They include a cheap plastic disposable dropper but it is not sanitary.</li>
            <li>I was given this product for free for an exchange of my review.  </li>
            <li>Grapefruit Best Essential Oil is by far my favorite of all of the citrus oils.</li>
            <li>Grapefruit essential oil is very nice to use in cleaning and for scents.</li>
            <li>Sure the price is great, but there is little to no scent at all.</li>
            <li>I love the large size bottles.</li>
            <li>Love it, fast shipping</li>
            <li>Also when I use this oil, I feel like I am more active and energetic and I can pay better attention in class without my mind wandering everywhere.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this little bottle of the best smelling citus there is.</li>
            <li>They were quick to respond to my inquiries.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!  </li>
            <li>The smell was OK, not as strong as I thought it would be, definitely blended with a carrier oil.</li>
            <li>It comes with some cheap plastic thing but who wants to store that?</li>
            <li>The opinion above is my own</li>
            <li>As for this particular scent was my favorite personally, and has so many uses.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>After cleaning up those bottles, I noticed that those caps didnâ€™t screw back on very securely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased it is organic, but the strength of product seems very diluted and can barely smell the product.</li>
            <li>Nice aroma but after putting into my diffuser, there was not much smell...</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t drop exact amounts.</li>
            <li>First off, it had leaked in the box during shipment.</li>
            <li>and I love my essential oils!  </li>
            <li>A far as the quality of the oils, the smells were pure and strong.</li>
            <li>I dont think its pure at all.</li>
            <li>Although I am relatively new to the world of essential oils, I have bought many brands.</li>
            <li>First time using this particular brand, I like it</li>
            <li>This item arrived packaged very well and on time.  </li>
            <li>I was absolutely ecstatic when I received this grapefruit oil.  </li>
            <li>It is even nice to put a few drops on your hand and then use some unscented lotion and rub that into your skin.</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for this particular brand.</li>
            <li>Pure essential oils shouldn&#x27;t be cloudy.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is the size of the bottles, or the fact the entire top is open rather than the usual stopper in other brands, but some are overwhelming when opened.</li>
            <li>It can also be used for stiffness in muscles and keeping skin clear.</li>
            <li>but I believe it to be all natural zest like oil from grapefruit.</li>
            <li>Just know it does not have a fixed dropper on the bottle, it comes with a separate plastic dropper.</li>
            <li>You can use this product as an all purpose cleaner, just add a few drops to a spray bottle filled with water.</li>
            <li>I have been a rep for young living for a year now</li>
            <li>This is artificial, but it smells so good.</li>
            <li>I have poured way to much not thinking this does not have one and to be very careful.</li>
            <li>The smell is not strong at all and even if you add a little or lot more it just never gets to where you can fully smell the product.</li>
            <li>My son was sick last week and i mixed up some of this with warm water and spritzed it on his bed (test an area first) to kill the germs.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but my understanding of pure essential oils is that they should never turn cloudy if stored properly.</li>
            <li> and i find new uses for it everyday.</li>
            <li> When inhaled, grapefruit oil can help curb hunger, headaches, mental fatigue, and depression.</li>
            <li> All other products some with some sort of stopper or flow control in the bottle.</li>
            <li> There is so much propaganda regarding essential oils that it is hard to determine what is fact or fiction.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say what they sell is much more expensive.</li>
            <li> The package was huge--at least 5 times as big as my expensive young living oil.  </li>
            <li> I use several different essential oils, and this by far is the worst.</li>
            <li> I purchased multiple oils and they all seem very faint in comparison to other organic essential oils.</li>
            <li> add a few drops of this to your water each day to help your body burn that fat.</li>
            <li> I was however upset when receiving my box that at least half of the dozen oils had leaked during shipping.</li>
            <li> Just a regular large bottle opening makes it difficult or impossible to drop in small amounts of oil.</li>
            <li> the top 2 worst</li>
            <li> I am sorry, but as a massage therapist, both this essential oil and the lavender one are of a low essential oil (therapeutic) grade and seem to be diluted with an oily filler that doesn&#x27;t sink into the skin, VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something definitely wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt suggest this product unfortunately.</li>
            <li> The very frustrating thing is there is not stopper in the bottle.</li>
            <li> It can eliminate unpleasant odors in kitchens and bathrooms.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This oils smells nothing like grapefruit, it smells chemically.</li>
            <li> Does not taste like grapefruit but I believe it to be all natural zest like oil from grapefruit.</li>
            <li> Great product! Will buy it again!</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> excellent for oily skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased it is organic, but the strength of product seems very diluted and can barely smell the product. I purchased multiple oils and they all seem very faint in comparison to other organic essential oils.</li>
            <li> Nice size bottle for the price. Just know it does not have a fixed dropper on the bottle, it comes with a separate plastic dropper.</li>
            <li> I received several Sun Essentials oils to review. I love the large size bottles. I was however upset when receiving my box that at least half of the dozen oils had leaked during shipping. After cleaning up those bottles, I noticed that those caps didnâ€™t screw back on very securely. I did like the dropper that came with each bottle, especially since it had measurements, but since they were separate from the bottles, cleaning them out after use and storing them was not as convenient had they been incorporated in each bottle. A far as the quality of the oils, the smells were pure and strong. Maybe it is the size of the bottles, or the fact the entire top is open rather than the usual stopper in other brands, but some are overwhelming when opened. As for this particular scent was my favorite personally, and has so many uses. I made Bath Bombs withit that smelled wonderful, and are great for erasing the stress of the day along with the mental fatigue that brings.</li>
            <li> I am sorry, but as a massage therapist, both this essential oil and the lavender one are of a low essential oil (therapeutic) grade and seem to be diluted with an oily filler that doesn&#x27;t sink into the skin, VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> Prefect smell for the summer everyone will Leave asking &amp;#34;where can I buy that oil&amp;#34; I received this to review at no cost to give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> You cant even smell it. I dont think its pure at all.</li>
            <li> This item arrived packaged very well and on time.  I am a nursing student so I am always looking for something to help my body without taking a pill.  This stuff is has many great qualities.  It is an antioxidant so it protects the body from toxins.  I also used some of this as a disinfectant.  My son was sick last week and i mixed up some of this with warm water and spritzed it on his bed (test an area first) to kill the germs. :) Also when I use this oil, I feel like I am more active and energetic and I can pay better attention in class without my mind wandering everywhere.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t even tell this is grapefruit. I use several different essential oils, and this by far is the worst. I have put in in different carrier oils, tried it in the diffuser, etc, and nothing. No Smell. I had really high hopes for this particular brand. Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money on this one.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand how anyone could think this is good oil. There was maybe, MAYBE 1% grapefruit scent and 99% something artificual and gross. I can&#x27;t even place it, it was like some sort of used industrial substance. Nothing pleasant at all. I bought a NOW FOODS bottle to replace it, and that one is what this should have smell like. Never buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> Smells great and is a preservitive for cosmetics. (face creams, detanglers ect.)</li>
            <li> Really light scent from what I am used to. First time using this particular brand, I like it but I don&#x27;t think I will go with it again.</li>
            <li> Great in sugar scrubs</li>
            <li> Repeat after me ladies...FAT BURNER!! That&#x27;s right add a few drops of this to your water each day to help your body burn that fat. I received this to try and review and my mother who is a &amp;#34;young living&amp;#34; rep was impressed by the size for the price. Needless to say what they sell is much more expensive. You will love this. I am also told you can rub it on your problem areas of your body and it can burn fat that way as well but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
            <li> This bottle is not an essential oil. The ingredients read: Grapefruit Oil. The instructions read: For use in an aromatherapy difuser. It has an oil texture, and cannot be used for treatment. I did use it to oil my chopping block...</li>
            <li> Grapefruit essential oil is very nice to use in cleaning and for scents. I use it in my cleaning solutions. I have to make my own b/c of my allergies and asthma. It makes me feel good to be able to clean my house well, and make it  smell clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Nice aroma but after putting into my diffuser, there was not much smell... The more expensive oils seemed to last longe and smell stronger. Also there is no dropper in the cap so you can&#x27;t drop exact amounts. Just a regular large bottle opening makes it difficult or impossible to drop in small amounts of oil. They include a cheap plastic disposable dropper but it is not sanitary.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil to have around the house, it smells so good! Lots of uses for just one oil. It&#x27;s great for helping battle oily skin, diffusers, rubbing into sore muscles. You can use this product as an all purpose cleaner, just add a few drops to a spray bottle filled with water. Use it homemade detergents, deodorants and toothpastes. Great purchase price for this amazing stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN.</li>
            <li> The size is great, but the top broke upon opening. So now it is permanently open.</li>
            <li> This is not for internal use!! Essential oils should not be orange. This is artificial, but it smells so good. I love it in my diffuser. When inhaled, grapefruit oil can help curb hunger, headaches, mental fatigue, and depression. Grapefruit oil can suppress your appetite by adding just a couple of drops of oil on the abdomen. The effects can be intensified when it&#x27;s mixed with patchouli essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;Also, its fragrance is similar to citrus fruits like oranges and lemons. It can eliminate unpleasant odors in kitchens and bathrooms.&lt;br /&gt;Hair Tonic. Grapefruit essential oil can be used to treat dandruff. It is also an effective treatment for oily hair. Just add a couple of drops of Grapefruit essential oil to your shampoo.I am grateful to the Sun Organics for providing me their grapefruit oil at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I received this to review and love it. It smells great and i find new uses for it everyday. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> It smells like grapefruit although I&#x27;ve smelled better.</li>
            <li> I liked it ,it smelled just like grapefruit, use it for aromatherapy  and in my diffuser, loved the smell.I HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK</li>
            <li> Pure essential oils shouldn&#x27;t be cloudy. I bought this a couple weeks ago. First off, it had leaked in the box during shipment. When I opened the bottle yesterday I noticed the oil had turned cloudy. I&#x27;m not sure why, but my understanding of pure essential oils is that they should never turn cloudy if stored properly. There&#x27;s something definitely wrong with this product. The smell was OK, not as strong as I thought it would be, definitely blended with a carrier oil. Would not buy this again</li>
            <li> The grapefruit scent is wonderful. It isn&#x27;t too overpowering.</li>
            <li> Excellent Quality!  Excellent Company!  This particular oil was great.  I made a lotion and added this oil for it&#x27;s prevention of oily skin and acne.  Great scent.  Highly recommend!!!  I was given this product for free for an exchange of my review.  The opinion above is my own and I was not instructed on what to write.</li>
            <li> The smell is not strong at all and even if you add a little or lot more it just never gets to where you can fully smell the product. The very frustrating thing is there is not stopper in the bottle. It comes with some cheap plastic thing but who wants to store that? All other products some with some sort of stopper or flow control in the bottle. I have poured way to much not thinking this does not have one and to be very careful. I wouldnt suggest this product unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I would have liked a stronger more pure scent, but this oil was okay.</li>
            <li> Although I am relatively new to the world of essential oils, I have bought many brands. This is one of the top 2 worst I&#x27;ve purchased. Sure the price is great, but there is little to no scent at all. I will not buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> Love it, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have been a rep for young living for a year now and I love my essential oils!  There is so much propaganda regarding essential oils that it is hard to determine what is fact or fiction.  I was absolutely ecstatic when I received this grapefruit oil.  The package was huge--at least 5 times as big as my expensive young living oil.  And the quantity doesn&#x27;t effect the quality.  I have diffused this oil and have been using it for all kinds of things.  It comes with a great pipette for measuring.  Customer service is also amazing.  They were quick to respond to my inquiries.  The price can not be beat.  I recommend Sun Essential Oils for anyone getting into essential oils!</li>
            <li> Grapefruit Best Essential Oil is by far my favorite of all of the citrus oils. I started using this oil back in December in sugar scrubs and my room diffuser. It is even nice to put a few drops on your hand and then use some unscented lotion and rub that into your skin. Such an uplifting scent. I love it! Grapefruit essential oil is an antioxidant, disinfectant, antiseptic, stimulant, diuretic and as a tonic. It can also be used for stiffness in muscles and keeping skin clear. I absolutely recommend this little bottle of the best smelling citus there is. I received a bottle of this oil for review and was not monetarily compensated.</li>
