            <li>Wonderful!!</li>
            <li>Hair feels great!</li>
            <li>Matrix started this ULTRA line and added SILICONES to an otherwise perfect conditioner and shampoo.</li>
            <li>should the makers ever discontinue the BEST CONDITIONER ON THE PLANET.  </li>
            <li>ive always been searching for a product that would turn my lifeless hair into gorgeous hair that hair models have, and now ive found it!</li>
            <li>The seller was great</li>
            <li>As I said this is a great conditioner.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a great product.</li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>Why change a great thing?  </li>
            <li>i dont know what else to say about this product since you&#x27;ve read all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>but it is not as good as it use to be.</li>
            <li>And not in a good way.</li>
            <li>my hair felt so very smooth!</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and it needs the moisture I find very satisfying from this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this conditioner!</li>
            <li>The seller shipped exactly what was advertised, so I am very happy with my purchase and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>The nice thing is that you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it.</li>
            <li>Somebody is replacing the good stuff with a cheap knock off and selling it for bank!</li>
            <li>Biolage Conditioning Balm is worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li>great at untangling long hair and smells wonderful</li>
            <li>(and gorgeous) now, and tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>Shipping perfect too!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much for the easy, smooth transaction!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s very exciting :) Try it!</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love the stuff and received complements at work after using ...</li>
            <li>Nothing softens and shines my hair better.</li>
            <li>I always make sure I have it on hand and use it each time I shampoo my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure it was biolage.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you zoom in on the product and make sure you get which one you want.</li>
            <li>To top it off</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>My sons favorite also.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My hair feels better than before</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have used this conditioner for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>This product is fabulous!</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner</li>
            <li>Ive used the originals for over 20 years and have had day dreams winning the lottery and stockpiling this stuff by the gallon in an underground bunker ...</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than 10 years and it is my absolute favorite!!</li>
            <li>This arrived really fast!!!!  </li>
            <li>I can count on the balm to keep my long hair looking great!</li>
            <li>The product is so fantastic that I quickly started using it every day, and my hair has never been in better condition!     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>But it does do a great job of making hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>This is a very good moisturizer for dry hair.</li>
            <li>My hair feels fabulous when I use this.</li>
            <li>Smells fabulous too.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy to have come across this after trying so many other conditioners that did nothing for me.   </li>
            <li>My hair is curly and long and this product help my hair look great, soft, hydrate and smell good.</li>
            <li>I have been using this conditioner for years, and am quite familiar with it.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the original biolage.</li>
            <li>It lacks the familiar balm-like appearance, texture, and feel.</li>
            <li>If youve never used these products before, please look up my reviews of the original formula BIOLAGE CONDITIONING BALM or their MOISTURIZING SHAMPOO.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair super silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>I felt difference right when i was putting it on and washing it off!</li>
            <li>product kept my hair shiny and glowing for almost a full week without a need to shampoo in between.</li>
            <li>I used again today, leaving  a palm full of conditioner in for one hour.</li>
            <li>But overall, it is a good conditioner.</li>
            <li>Not only do I feel I got ripped off once but twice because the price was good</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a good price and no shipping charges if you buy enough.</li>
            <li>It works decently but you need a lot more and it just doesn&#x27;t compare.  </li>
            <li>I love love this product and will only use it, I am on well water</li>
            <li>very hot and humid area in the summer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used the shampoo and conditioner duo for over a year and a half with great results.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a rich conditioner, this really may be the answer for you!  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I began to think that my hair was naturally so soft, and voluminous, and healthy, and forgot to attribute anything to the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, the conditioner costs far more than the shampoo but is used faster.  </li>
            <li>I bought this expecting \\&quot;soft and silky\\&quot; hair after reading many reviews.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that the shampoo in this line is anything out of the ordinary, but I use it in conjunction with the conditioner, and my hair looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li>I have very soft, fine, somewhat wavy hair that I straighten and have semi-permanent colored.</li>
            <li>At first I thought that the product wasn&#x27;t rinsing all the way out, but I soon realized that it rinses out fine, it just leaves my hair so soft that it seems that the conditioner must still be in!  </li>
            <li>At $25, I&#x27;m careful about spillage, but most of it ends up running out of my hands before it even gets to my head!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair incredibly soft, tangle free and shiny and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair like many other conditioners do.  </li>
            <li>For my naturally dry, slightly wavy hair this is the BEST product I have ever found.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many and this works instantly on my hair.</li>
            <li>omg it really works!</li>
            <li>Well they were more like questions such as, &amp;#34;did</li>
            <li>I have tried many, and I always come back to this.  </li>
            <li>so its not really expensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands, and this is one I keep coming back to.</li>
            <li>I have never used Matrix products before, so this is my first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>used the Matrix conditioner for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li>This one felt \\&quot;thinner\\&quot; and more like the generic (off label but compare to brand).  </li>
            <li>Two smaller jar appears to be a better value than one large one.</li>
            <li>If you want the regular, old, tried and true conditioning balm all you have to do is make sure it doesnt say ULTRA on the label.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time in my life that my hair detangled well and felt super soft!  </li>
            <li>It smells different, and is a subpar product, designed only to give the illusion of more conditioning through more instant \\&quot;slip\\&quot; right after using.  </li>
            <li>Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li>My hair feels amazing even if I shampoo everyday.</li>
            <li>I just figured that was how my hair was going to feel since I had it through so much chemical turmoil.  </li>
            <li>note: if you dont have really damaged hair like i do (now), you dont even need to use much or leave it in for forever.</li>
            <li>I bought mine from a salon and after reading some of these reviews, I have to wonder if the some of these on here are real.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s not meant to do magic on my rough and voluminous hair.</li>
            <li>Works great on thin hair.  </li>
            <li>and it is very runny.</li>
            <li>Very watery.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t cheap, but I&#x27;m tossing it and buying another jar from a different seller.</li>
            <li>If you used the real product before don&#x27;t buy this  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it esp if you have curly and damaged hair!</li>
            <li>For a conditioner that cost 10x as much as the store bought brand, I really expected better results.</li>
            <li>I use about 4x as much on my thick, curly hair and still don&#x27;t get good results.  </li>
            <li>My hair has a bit more body and smoothness than usual and am more motivated to try different styles.</li>
            <li>It was pretty gross and right where my hair laid.  </li>
            <li>This is not the real conditioning balm that is normally purchased.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite conditioners; never lets me down.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different combinations of products and what finally works?</li>
            <li>This product is watery and runny, not thick and creamy like when I buy it at a store.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and looks very shiny every time I use it.  </li>
            <li>Normally, my hair is frizzy but with Biolage, the frizziness disappears.</li>
            <li>Plus, it did not come with the protective paper layer that is normally under the cap, so you know it has been opened before.</li>
            <li>I still had my old container of conditioner and sure enough the ingredients are different.</li>
            <li>Whenever I get cheap and think, \\&quot;Oh, I should try this other shampoo because it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li>And I live in NY --</li>
            <li>To clear up any confusion, this is the \\&quot;Ultra-hydrating balm\\&quot; and if you want the amazing thick stuff, you want the \\&quot;Conditioning Balm.\\</li>
            <li>I tried a lot of hair products and they all were just the same, didnt do much to my hair, but this one really does what it promises.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>hair doesn&#x27;t feel as rich when I have the product in my hair, as the other one, but I do like the results.</li>
            <li>and when I opened this product it is NOT the same as the real thing!</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft but it gives me dandruff!</li>
            <li>I have really dry, brittle, frizzy, curly, Jewish hair that breaks off really easily.</li>
            <li>but as many of the other reviewers, I was hoping for the thick conditioning balm that is amazing and makes your hair so incredibly soft even with long hair.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing special with this as opposed to other moisturizing conditioners.</li>
            <li>He lived abroad many years and was definitely a button down bespoke kinda man.  </li>
            <li>Guess it&#x27;s time to go back to the drawing board and try to find in new line that will work for long thick hair that is fine and tangles easily.</li>
            <li>It was clearly my mistake</li>
            <li>I use this with the detangling lotion and my hair is soft and I can get a brush through it again.  </li>
            <li>my hair feels SOFT and SILKY and tames almost all of my fly-aways.</li>
            <li>Actually the whole family loves it.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>Leaves my damaged hair feeling really soft.</li>
            <li>And no need to stockpile yet, as the old version is still being produced.  </li>
            <li>and my hair becomes so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I wet and towel dried my hair and applied a generous amount of product (like a full palm full).</li>
            <li>The previous review is right!</li>
            <li>and I could barely tell if my hair was done being rinsed because I had never felt my hair that soft before in my life!</li>
            <li>Have always loved it for my long, coarse, thick hair, and will continue to use it...</li>
            <li>it turns out this last time that I hadn&#x27;t ordered the exact same product.</li>
            <li>My hair is still a little dry after washing but more manageable.</li>
            <li>It took me a long time, but I finally found the right routine to help my hair grow out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got less issues with dryness than with most other conditioners I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can blow-dry it straight without it frizzing out and making me look like a 1990&#x27;s single Cher.</li>
            <li>( the old formula has the last ingredient as wheat germ oil, the new one the last is amyl cinnamal)</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey, but every cent is worth it.  </li>
            <li>It is very runny and not very conditioning.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, the regular conditioning balm and matching shampoo are still alive and well, and unchanged.</li>
            <li>My hair was not soft after using this like it normally is.  </li>
            <li>No longer creamy and thick, I&#x27;d now compare it to cheap grocery store products.</li>
            <li>But when I run out of this I&#x27;ll make sure to re-order the one that doesn&#x27;t have Ultra-Hydrating in the name as I don&#x27;t like to waste product going down the drain.</li>
            <li>It doesnt make wonders and i need to put some other products on my hair after shower, like stay-on conditioner and hairsilk, because my hair is very lightweight</li>
            <li>When my hair dried it was so much softer and shinier and the ends curled up naturally, which hadn&#x27;t happened in forever.  </li>
            <li>i have stick straight asian hair (long) and it could do with some volume, but this doesnt make my hair flat, greasy, frizzy, or coarse-feeling.</li>
            <li>have color treated, shoulder length hair that is blowdryed a few times a week, and I use hot rollers daily.</li>

            <li> This is a very good moisturizer for dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair feels fabulous when I use this.</li>
            <li> Smells fabulous too.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy to have come across this after trying so many other conditioners that did nothing for me.   </li>
            <li> My hair is curly and long and this product help my hair look great, soft, hydrate and smell good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for years, and am quite familiar with it.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the original biolage.</li>
            <li> It lacks the familiar balm-like appearance, texture, and feel.</li>
            <li> If youve never used these products before, please look up my reviews of the original formula BIOLAGE CONDITIONING BALM or their MOISTURIZING SHAMPOO.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair super silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I felt difference right when i was putting it on and washing it off!</li>
            <li> product kept my hair shiny and glowing for almost a full week without a need to shampoo in between.</li>
            <li> I used again today, leaving  a palm full of conditioner in for one hour.</li>
            <li> But overall, it is a good conditioner.</li>
            <li> Not only do I feel I got ripped off once but twice because the price was good</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a good price and no shipping charges if you buy enough.</li>
            <li> It works decently but you need a lot more and it just doesn&#x27;t compare.  </li>
            <li> I love love this product and will only use it, I am on well water</li>
            <li> very hot and humid area in the summer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo and conditioner duo for over a year and a half with great results.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a rich conditioner, this really may be the answer for you!  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I began to think that my hair was naturally so soft, and voluminous, and healthy, and forgot to attribute anything to the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the conditioner costs far more than the shampoo but is used faster.  </li>
            <li> I bought this expecting \\&quot;soft and silky\\&quot; hair after reading many reviews.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that the shampoo in this line is anything out of the ordinary, but I use it in conjunction with the conditioner, and my hair looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li> I have very soft, fine, somewhat wavy hair that I straighten and have semi-permanent colored.</li>
            <li> At first I thought that the product wasn&#x27;t rinsing all the way out, but I soon realized that it rinses out fine, it just leaves my hair so soft that it seems that the conditioner must still be in!  </li>
            <li> At $25, I&#x27;m careful about spillage, but most of it ends up running out of my hands before it even gets to my head!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair incredibly soft, tangle free and shiny and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair like many other conditioners do.  </li>
            <li> For my naturally dry, slightly wavy hair this is the BEST product I have ever found.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many and this works instantly on my hair.</li>
            <li> omg it really works!</li>
            <li> Well they were more like questions such as, &amp;#34;did</li>
            <li> I have tried many, and I always come back to this.  </li>
            <li> so its not really expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands, and this is one I keep coming back to.</li>
            <li> I have never used Matrix products before, so this is my first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> used the Matrix conditioner for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li> This one felt \\&quot;thinner\\&quot; and more like the generic (off label but compare to brand).  </li>
            <li> Two smaller jar appears to be a better value than one large one.</li>
            <li> If you want the regular, old, tried and true conditioning balm all you have to do is make sure it doesnt say ULTRA on the label.  </li>
            <li> This was the first time in my life that my hair detangled well and felt super soft!  </li>
            <li> It smells different, and is a subpar product, designed only to give the illusion of more conditioning through more instant \\&quot;slip\\&quot; right after using.  </li>
            <li> Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My hair feels amazing even if I shampoo everyday.</li>
            <li> I just figured that was how my hair was going to feel since I had it through so much chemical turmoil.  </li>
            <li> note: if you dont have really damaged hair like i do (now), you dont even need to use much or leave it in for forever.</li>
            <li> I bought mine from a salon and after reading some of these reviews, I have to wonder if the some of these on here are real.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s not meant to do magic on my rough and voluminous hair.</li>
            <li> Works great on thin hair.  </li>
            <li> and it is very runny.</li>
            <li> Very watery.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t cheap, but I&#x27;m tossing it and buying another jar from a different seller.</li>
            <li> If you used the real product before don&#x27;t buy this  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it esp if you have curly and damaged hair!</li>
            <li> For a conditioner that cost 10x as much as the store bought brand, I really expected better results.</li>
            <li> I use about 4x as much on my thick, curly hair and still don&#x27;t get good results.  </li>
            <li> My hair has a bit more body and smoothness than usual and am more motivated to try different styles.</li>
            <li> It was pretty gross and right where my hair laid.  </li>
            <li> This is not the real conditioning balm that is normally purchased.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite conditioners; never lets me down.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different combinations of products and what finally works?</li>
            <li> This product is watery and runny, not thick and creamy like when I buy it at a store.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and looks very shiny every time I use it.  </li>
            <li> Normally, my hair is frizzy but with Biolage, the frizziness disappears.</li>
            <li> Plus, it did not come with the protective paper layer that is normally under the cap, so you know it has been opened before.</li>
            <li> I still had my old container of conditioner and sure enough the ingredients are different.</li>
            <li> Whenever I get cheap and think, \\&quot;Oh, I should try this other shampoo because it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li> And I live in NY --</li>
            <li> To clear up any confusion, this is the \\&quot;Ultra-hydrating balm\\&quot; and if you want the amazing thick stuff, you want the \\&quot;Conditioning Balm.\\</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of hair products and they all were just the same, didnt do much to my hair, but this one really does what it promises.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> hair doesn&#x27;t feel as rich when I have the product in my hair, as the other one, but I do like the results.</li>
            <li> and when I opened this product it is NOT the same as the real thing!</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft but it gives me dandruff!</li>
            <li> I have really dry, brittle, frizzy, curly, Jewish hair that breaks off really easily.</li>
            <li> but as many of the other reviewers, I was hoping for the thick conditioning balm that is amazing and makes your hair so incredibly soft even with long hair.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing special with this as opposed to other moisturizing conditioners.</li>
            <li> He lived abroad many years and was definitely a button down bespoke kinda man.  </li>
            <li> Guess it&#x27;s time to go back to the drawing board and try to find in new line that will work for long thick hair that is fine and tangles easily.</li>
            <li> It was clearly my mistake</li>
            <li> I use this with the detangling lotion and my hair is soft and I can get a brush through it again.  </li>
            <li> my hair feels SOFT and SILKY and tames almost all of my fly-aways.</li>
            <li> Actually the whole family loves it.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> Leaves my damaged hair feeling really soft.</li>
            <li> And no need to stockpile yet, as the old version is still being produced.  </li>
            <li> and my hair becomes so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I wet and towel dried my hair and applied a generous amount of product (like a full palm full).</li>
            <li> The previous review is right!</li>
            <li> and I could barely tell if my hair was done being rinsed because I had never felt my hair that soft before in my life!</li>
            <li> Have always loved it for my long, coarse, thick hair, and will continue to use it...</li>
            <li> it turns out this last time that I hadn&#x27;t ordered the exact same product.</li>
            <li> My hair is still a little dry after washing but more manageable.</li>
            <li> It took me a long time, but I finally found the right routine to help my hair grow out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got less issues with dryness than with most other conditioners I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can blow-dry it straight without it frizzing out and making me look like a 1990&#x27;s single Cher.</li>
            <li> ( the old formula has the last ingredient as wheat germ oil, the new one the last is amyl cinnamal)</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, but every cent is worth it.  </li>
            <li> It is very runny and not very conditioning.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, the regular conditioning balm and matching shampoo are still alive and well, and unchanged.</li>
            <li> My hair was not soft after using this like it normally is.  </li>
            <li> No longer creamy and thick, I&#x27;d now compare it to cheap grocery store products.</li>
            <li> But when I run out of this I&#x27;ll make sure to re-order the one that doesn&#x27;t have Ultra-Hydrating in the name as I don&#x27;t like to waste product going down the drain.</li>
            <li> It doesnt make wonders and i need to put some other products on my hair after shower, like stay-on conditioner and hairsilk, because my hair is very lightweight</li>
            <li> When my hair dried it was so much softer and shinier and the ends curled up naturally, which hadn&#x27;t happened in forever.  </li>
            <li> i have stick straight asian hair (long) and it could do with some volume, but this doesnt make my hair flat, greasy, frizzy, or coarse-feeling.</li>
            <li> have color treated, shoulder length hair that is blowdryed a few times a week, and I use hot rollers daily.</li>
            <li> i had planned on using this as an everyday conditioner once my hair got back to normal).    </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really disappointed and will continue to use it because it does smell good</li>
            <li> , my hair looks the same after it&#x27;s completely dry.</li>
            <li> but it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The scent is heavenly and lasts a few days (the bf&#x27;s nose is not as sensitive as mine, and he loves it).</li>
            <li> EXCEPT it&#x27;s really long</li>
            <li> I also tried to use other Biolage shampoo and conditioners, but I just did not get the same results.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried other products, but ultimately return to biolage.  </li>
            <li> it is kinda dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Since I was still using Salon quality products,  I blamed my breaking, dry hair on the fact that I had dyed it.  </li>
            <li> After my hair dresser suggested using Biolage Conditioning Balm once or twice a week to treat my dry, color-treated hair, I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> Eventually those silicones will coat your hair, cause buildup, and dry your hair out and make it crunchy and damaged.</li>
            <li> I have rough, wavy long hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick naturally wavy, curly long hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry, frizzy hair and</li>
            <li> little goes a long way and it keeps my dry, colored grey hair very supple and moist for at least 2 days!</li>
            <li> The consistency was a little different (runny)</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected ...</li>
            <li> The product is oily, smells different, and my hair is not smooth after using this product from this seller.</li>
            <li> Everything came as expected.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, relaxed hair, and any old conditioner off the shelf at the store does not work for me.  </li>
            <li> My hair is abit wavy and thick and usually gets abit frizzy on rainy days and the first day of shampooing.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the results would be if I followed the label and used less and left on only  for 1 to 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One day, I didn&#x27;t have my other shampoo and conditioner, and had a little left of this set.  </li>
            <li> my hair is dry and a tangled mess.</li>
            <li> The one I&#x27;d gotten before was not the Ultra-Hydrating one and this is quite a bit thinner than the other one.</li>
            <li> It leaves the same results as a store-bought bottle, softness, etc., but is not much more than that.</li>
            <li> Will not repair damaged hair, just acts like any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely NOT just your average conditioner.  </li>
            <li> This product is no better than the Pantene conditioner I use on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> Just wet down hair and apply conditioner.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money if you have dry, damaged, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need to use less of the conditioner than other brands.  </li>
            <li> I have thick unbearable asian hair and this smooths it our like non-other.</li>
            <li> Its some thick goop that doesn&#x27;t have the same consistency, smell, or performance.  </li>
            <li> My educated guess is that the product was watered down.</li>
            <li> The label reads \\&quot;Ultra-Hydrating Balm\\&quot; except it does not say \\&quot;Nourishes Thick, Coarse Hair\\&quot; like all the other jars I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> It may seem a little pricey</li>
            <li> my hair was so bad that i bought hundreds of dollars worth of products and forgot about this one</li>
            <li> A few months ago I deviated from this shampoo.</li>
            <li> : Do not shampoo hair before using unless your hair is heavily coated with product.</li>
            <li> but there must be some kind of oils or something in it, because it gave me horrible acne!  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair everyday...</li>
            <li> I ski in the winter and my hair is subjected to the harsh climate for the season.  </li>
            <li> Also cut the time of styling my hair in half!</li>
            <li> And I agree with the other reviewers - it actually doesn&#x27;t end up being all that expensive.</li>
            <li> My conflict lies with the packaging, the lid is hard to handle, especially when one hand is loaded with product, I mean seriously,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Biolage products in the past, but the Ultra hydrating balm is just wonderful--not too thick, creamy, and does not weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> (won&#x27;t want to waste it)!</li>
            <li> i dont think ill ever go back!    </li>
            <li> Wife like this, not sure why.</li>
            <li> Goes back to the old adage, don&#x27;t fix it if it ain&#x27;t broken!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, uncontrollable hair.  </li>
            <li> This is supposed to be really thick</li>
            <li> My hair feels like crap and now I have to go somewhere and buy the real stuff.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find that I had to double the amount to get my hair to feel the way it usually does when applied.</li>
            <li> It smells different, the color is different and it is horrible!!!</li>
            <li> I am so sorry to relay it, hoping its just a few that are \\&quot;different\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> have thin but curly hair</li>
            <li> Not happy and will not purchase this again on line.</li>
            <li> It does not spread in my hair because it&#x27;s so thin.</li>
            <li> WTF?  </li>
            <li> and it was so expensive</li>
            <li> Although some feel the product is too expensive, I disagree.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing that the seller is dishonest.</li>
            <li> It still wasn&#x27;t absolutely bad either..</li>
            <li> Oh I dislike giving bad report....</li>
            <li> so much-however perhaps I got a bad batch.  </li>
            <li> In that aspect, I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I always regret it because my hair looks like crap and breaks off horribly.</li>
            <li> You will be mad!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The seller was great but as many of the other reviewers, I was hoping for the thick conditioning balm that is amazing and makes your hair so incredibly soft even with long hair.  This is not it.  It was clearly my mistake and I&#x27;m still using this product up.  It works decently but you need a lot more and it just doesn&#x27;t compare.  To clear up any confusion, this is the \\&quot;Ultra-hydrating balm\\&quot; and if you want the amazing thick stuff, you want the \\&quot;Conditioning Balm.\\&quot;  Big difference!  Hope that helps!  :)</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, uncontrollable hair.  This conditioner is the only conditioner on the planet that tames my hair.  I only use this on my hair. No shampoo, as it dries and frizzes my hair out.  I use this with the detangling lotion and my hair is soft and I can get a brush through it again.  I have been using this product for more than 10 years and it is my absolute favorite!!</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected ... Good purchase!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Biolage conditioning balm for awhile now and like the results I get with my hair. I&#x27;ve got less issues with dryness than with most other conditioners I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it turns out this last time that I hadn&#x27;t ordered the exact same product. The one I&#x27;d gotten before was not the Ultra-Hydrating one and this is quite a bit thinner than the other one. I suppose that makes it easier to use with a pump, but I&#x27;m reaching in with fingers and losing some of the product by the time I get my hand to my hair. You wouldn&#x27;t have that same issue if you used a pump and got it in the palm of your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair doesn&#x27;t feel as rich when I have the product in my hair, as the other one, but I do like the results. But when I run out of this I&#x27;ll make sure to re-order the one that doesn&#x27;t have Ultra-Hydrating in the name as I don&#x27;t like to waste product going down the drain.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. I&#x27;ve tried so many and this works instantly on my hair. It&#x27;s like getting a deep treatment. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Matrix ultra-hydrating conditioning balm and received the basic Matrix conditioning balm. This is NOT the same product</li>
            <li> This conditioner is well worth the price.  And since you have to use 1/2 as much as regular conditioners it probably doesn&#x27;t work out to be that much more expensive overall.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! It leaves my hair super silky and smooth. And I agree with the other reviewers - it actually doesn&#x27;t end up being all that expensive. I&#x27;ve been using biolage products for years and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I have been straightening me hair for 8 years and it is fried as you can imagine. I have tried so many different combinations of products and what finally works? Biolage. I had this in my hair for 5 minutes while in the shower and I could barely tell if my hair was done being rinsed because I had never felt my hair that soft before in my life! I kept rinsing and rinsing waiting to feel my coarse ends and it never happened. I finally realized that the conditioner worked and I wasn&#x27;t used to feeling instant results like that. Also cut the time of styling my hair in half! Instead of using a straightening iron and I can blow-dry it straight without it frizzing out and making me look like a 1990&#x27;s single Cher.</li>
            <li> There is nothing special with this as opposed to other moisturizing conditioners. It leaves the same results as a store-bought bottle, softness, etc., but is not much more than that. Will not repair damaged hair, just acts like any other conditioner. Don&#x27;t waste your money if you have dry, damaged, frizzy hair. Doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> omg it really works! I felt difference right when i was putting it on and washing it off! my hair felt so very smooth! I tried a lot of hair products and they all were just the same, didnt do much to my hair, but this one really does what it promises.&lt;br /&gt;I have thin but curly hair and i dye it blond, so it is kinda dry and frizzy. It doesnt make wonders and i need to put some other products on my hair after shower, like stay-on conditioner and hairsilk, because my hair is very lightweight and i look like blowball if i dont use those.</li>
            <li> It may seem a little pricey but it lasts a long time. And the best part is....it works!!! My hair feels fabulous when I use this. It actually seems to repair your hair as opposed to just masking the split ends. Smells fabulous too.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is like liquid gold to my hair.  It is a little pricey, but every cent is worth it.  I used the shampoo and conditioner duo for over a year and a half with great results. I began to think that my hair was naturally so soft, and voluminous, and healthy, and forgot to attribute anything to the shampoo and conditioner.  A few months ago I deviated from this shampoo. Since I was still using Salon quality products,  I blamed my breaking, dry hair on the fact that I had dyed it.  I just figured that was how my hair was going to feel since I had it through so much chemical turmoil.  One day, I didn&#x27;t have my other shampoo and conditioner, and had a little left of this set.  When my hair dried it was so much softer and shinier and the ends curled up naturally, which hadn&#x27;t happened in forever.  Instantly my hair had body and shine.  I&#x27;ve been using it again for about a month, and I will never stray again.  For my naturally dry, slightly wavy hair this is the BEST product I have ever found.  It works wonders.    I also tried to use other Biolage shampoo and conditioners, but I just did not get the same results. But like I said, my hair is on the drier side, so it needs the hydration.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday,but for some reason it just doesn&#x27;t feel like the stuff that I used to get ....It still wasn&#x27;t absolutely bad either..So that&#x27;s why I di not give it 5 stars, I don&#x27;t know if its amazon or Matrix that changed it up....This has been my last 2 orders that I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware.  This product is watery and runny, not thick and creamy like when I buy it at a store.  I use about 4x as much on my thick, curly hair and still don&#x27;t get good results.  Very disappointing that the seller is dishonest.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried other products, but ultimately return to biolage.  It&#x27;s great for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Not just for coarse and thicker hair types...I have very soft, fine, somewhat wavy hair that I straighten and have semi-permanent colored. I&#x27;ve used Biolage products in the past, but the Ultra hydrating balm is just wonderful--not too thick, creamy, and does not weigh down my hair. The scent is heavenly and lasts a few days (the bf&#x27;s nose is not as sensitive as mine, and he loves it). My hair has a bit more body and smoothness than usual and am more motivated to try different styles. It&#x27;s very exciting :) Try it!</li>
            <li> My Lover uses this stuff ...  She left some with the accompanying shampoo with me so I could use it and smell like her when she&#x27;s gone.  I love the stuff and received complements at work after using ... Well they were more like questions such as, &amp;#34;did you get a haircut?&amp;#34;  Anyways, it&#x27;s awesome sauce stuff.  My conflict lies with the packaging, the lid is hard to handle, especially when one hand is loaded with product, I mean seriously, WTF?  Additionally, the conditioner costs far more than the shampoo but is used faster.  Why?</li>
            <li> This is absolutely NOT just your average conditioner.  I have really thick, relaxed hair, and any old conditioner off the shelf at the store does not work for me.  Even some of the salon lines are not moisturizing enough.  I have tried many, and I always come back to this.  If you are looking for a rich conditioner, this really may be the answer for you!  My hair feels so silky after letting it sit for around 5 minutes.  I just hope they never stop making it!  I don&#x27;t know that the shampoo in this line is anything out of the ordinary, but I use it in conjunction with the conditioner, and my hair looks and feels great.  Definitely give this a try</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I recomend!!!</li>
            <li> I heard good things about this product so was excited to try it out. For a conditioner that cost 10x as much as the store bought brand, I really expected better results. My hair is abit wavy and thick and usually gets abit frizzy on rainy days and the first day of shampooing. Well, after shampooing and even blow drying it so it&#x27;s just abit damp, my hair looks the same after it&#x27;s completely dry. This product is no better than the Pantene conditioner I use on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really disappointed and will continue to use it because it does smell good and it was so expensive (won&#x27;t want to waste it)! But after this jar is used up I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> This product brought life to my once brittle and over processed hair. I use it about twice a week and will continue to do so. Nothing softens and shines my hair better.</li>
            <li> great at untangling long hair and smells wonderful</li>
            <li> As I said this is a great conditioner.  I have been using this conditioner and it is wonderful for my type of hair.  I have curly hair and it needs the moisture I find very satisfying from this product.  I always make sure I have it on hand and use it each time I shampoo my hair.</li>
            <li> The product I received was not the hydrating balm  I&#x27;m not even sure it was biolage. It is very runny and not very conditioning.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you zoom in on the product and make sure you get which one you want. Some are hydrasource and some are hydratherapie (not the same product).</li>
            <li> After my hair dresser suggested using Biolage Conditioning Balm once or twice a week to treat my dry, color-treated hair, I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  The product is so fantastic that I quickly started using it every day, and my hair has never been in better condition!     At first I thought that the product wasn&#x27;t rinsing all the way out, but I soon realized that it rinses out fine, it just leaves my hair so soft that it seems that the conditioner must still be in!  It leaves my hair incredibly soft, tangle free and shiny and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair like many other conditioners do.  To top it off it does wonders for detangling my three-year-old daughter&#x27;s hair.      Although some feel the product is too expensive, I disagree.  You&#x27;ll need to use less of the conditioner than other brands.  The 37 ounce container lasts me about 4 months!  Biolage Conditioning Balm is worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner excells in detangling and conditioning chemically, over processed hair ending with wonderful results.   I am extremely happy to have come across this after trying so many other conditioners that did nothing for me.   Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> i dont know what else to say about this product since you&#x27;ve read all the good reviews. this product literally changes the TEXTURE of my hair!!! ive always been searching for a product that would turn my lifeless hair into gorgeous hair that hair models have, and now ive found it! (it doesnt give volume though)    i stumbled upon this product during a sale at lord and ladys salon at my mall. i was looking for biolage&#x27;s ceramide to fix my chemically damaged and overprocessed hair. i ended up buying it but didnt use it for over a year! my hair was so bad that i bought hundreds of dollars worth of products and forgot about this one (i didnt think it would be hydrating enough...i had planned on using this as an everyday conditioner once my hair got back to normal).    i have stick straight asian hair (long) and it could do with some volume, but this doesnt make my hair flat, greasy, frizzy, or coarse-feeling. my hair feels SOFT and SILKY and tames almost all of my fly-aways. i could go on forever about this product. bottom line: BUY IT! it has totally transformed my hair. i dont think ill ever go back!    note: if you dont have really damaged hair like i do (now), you dont even need to use much or leave it in for forever. so its not really expensive. it works in 2 min and leaves your hair shiny, silky, and beautiful!! you wont regret it!</li>
            <li> Great!&lt;br /&gt; Saved me a trip to the store!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect, just what I wanted. Shipping perfect too!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much for the easy, smooth transaction!</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner I use.  I have thick unbearable asian hair and this smooths it our like non-other.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for years, and am quite familiar with it. The consistency was a little different (runny) but I assumed it may have been a result of its shipping journey. I was disappointed to find that I had to double the amount to get my hair to feel the way it usually does when applied. My educated guess is that the product was watered down.</li>
            <li> I purchased this conditioner and tried it yesterday. I have used this product for eight years and this is a knock off product. The previous review is right! The product is oily, smells different, and my hair is not smooth after using this product from this seller. I WANT MY MONEY BACK AND BEWARE DO NOT BUT FROM THIS SELLER!</li>
            <li> THE BEST CONDITIONING BALM I EVER TRIED!!! I will order again and again.&lt;br /&gt;I little goes a long way and it keeps my dry, colored grey hair very supple and moist for at least 2 days!</li>
            <li> This is a very good moisturizer for dry hair. I&#x27;ve tried many brands, and this is one I keep coming back to.</li>
            <li> My hubby has premature white hair and I talked him into trying a pony tail.  He lived abroad many years and was definitely a button down bespoke kinda man.  After he retired, he tried the P-tail and loves it....EXCEPT it&#x27;s really long *(and gorgeous) now, and tangles easily.  This stuff worls. even on my shorter hair. Now he asks for it specifically.  Win/Win.</li>
            <li> I have never used Matrix products before, so this is my first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have color treated, shoulder length hair that is blowdryed a few times a week, and I use hot rollers daily. So my hair is not in the best condition. And I live in NY -- very hot and humid area in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Matrix conditioner for the first time yesterday. I wet and towel dried my hair and applied a generous amount of product (like a full palm full). I left it in my hair for about FIVE HOURS. Then I rinsed out with warm water and sealed with ice cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner did a wonderful job of taming my frizzies and restoring shine. It is not a miracle product -- I don&#x27;t believe that exists. But it does do a great job of making hair shiny and soft. Not sure what the results would be if I followed the label and used less and left on only  for 1 to 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: Do not shampoo hair before using unless your hair is heavily coated with product. Just wet down hair and apply conditioner. Then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product. Will update my review after repeated uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One week later:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product kept my hair shiny and glowing for almost a full week without a need to shampoo in between. I used again today, leaving  a palm full of conditioner in for one hour. Great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no longer using this product</li>
            <li> I have thick naturally wavy, curly long hair.  This stuff was a miracle.  This was the first time in my life that my hair detangled well and felt super soft!  I love it but there must be some kind of oils or something in it, because it gave me horrible acne!  It was pretty gross and right where my hair laid.  So I havent used it since.  PS:  I bought mine from a salon and after reading some of these reviews, I have to wonder if the some of these on here are real.</li>
            <li> I have really dry, brittle, frizzy, curly, Jewish hair that breaks off really easily. I&#x27;ve been using the Biolage Hydratherapy shampoo and the Biolage Ultra Hydrating Conditioner for 10 years. Whenever I get cheap and think, \\&quot;Oh, I should try this other shampoo because it&#x27;s cheaper. Blah, Blah, Blah,\\&quot; I always regret it because my hair looks like crap and breaks off horribly. The nice thing is that you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it. You only need a small amount. It also works well to protect your hair if you are going to be out in the sun or to put in your swimcap if you are a swimmer. It&#x27;s not the end all be all for me, but it is a cornerstone in my hair routine.    My hair routine: I use Matrix Biolage hydratherapy shampoo and Ultra-Hydrating conditioner in the tub, CHI Silk Infusion as a leave in treatment before I comb my hair out with my hair pick, and then style with AG Foam. I also take Biotin vitamins specifically along with my multi-vitamin. I avoid straightening my hair. It took me a long time, but I finally found the right routine to help my hair grow out.</li>
            <li> My daughter swears this is the best product ever for her face. My sons favorite also. Actually the whole family loves it.</li>
            <li> I used to use this years ago and kept changing conditioners. I should have just stuck with this one. This makes my hair soo silky. I love it. I wash my hair everyday... Even though you aren&#x27;t supposed too but with this it doesn&#x27;t matter. My hair feels amazing even if I shampoo everyday.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!  I have very dry, frizzy hair and this product does wonders.  My hair feels soft and looks very shiny every time I use it.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended! My hair feels so soft afterwards. Normally, my hair is frizzy but with Biolage, the frizziness disappears. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This is not the real conditioning balm that is normally purchased.</li>
            <li> I have rough, wavy long hair. I bought this expecting \\&quot;soft and silky\\&quot; hair after reading many reviews. In that aspect, I&#x27;m disappointed. Plus, it is e.x.p.e.n.s.i.v.e.    But overall, it is a good conditioner. My hair feels better than before but I still can&#x27;t get rid of frizz. My hair is still a little dry after washing but more manageable. I guess it&#x27;s not meant to do magic on my rough and voluminous hair.</li>
            <li> great~ my hair can get over dry and this leaves it comb throughble and happy</li>
            <li> Works great on thin hair.  Gives it volume.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be really thick and it is very runny. Not happy and will not purchase this again on line.</li>
            <li> I love love this product and will only use it, I am on well water and you would never know it</li>
            <li> This arrived really fast!!!!  Love this product.  Leaves my damaged hair feeling really soft. I leave it in for an hour and use as a deep conditioning treatment!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this conditioner for years and love it.  My hair is softer, smoother and the ends are totally tamed.  I ski in the winter and my hair is subjected to the harsh climate for the season.  I can count on the balm to keep my long hair looking great!</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous! It smells amazing and works so well, each time I use it my hair is soft, smooth and smells great! The seller shipped exactly what was advertised, so I am very happy with my purchase and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE. I have been using this conditioner for 10 years now and when I opened this product it is NOT the same as the real thing! It smells different, the color is different and it is horrible!!! My hair was not soft after using this like it normally is.  Plus, it did not come with the protective paper layer that is normally under the cap, so you know it has been opened before. Somebody is replacing the good stuff with a cheap knock off and selling it for bank! DO NOT BUY from this seller!!!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner but it is not as good as it use to be. Very watery.</li>
            <li> Everything came as expected.</li>
            <li> I use it before and I don&#x27;t stop to use it. My hair is curly and long and this product help my hair look great, soft, hydrate and smell good. Wonderful!! I recommend it.</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft but it gives me dandruff! Don&#x27;t know why. And it&#x27;s too pricey for me.hope they will lower the price</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the original biolage. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and once I started using the one from here my hair is dry and a tangled mess. Will never buy this from outside a salon again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Biolage&#x27;s Ultra-Hydrating Balm for over 15 years. Have always loved it for my long, coarse, thick hair, and will continue to use it... but I will never buy from this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging looks the same. The label reads \\&quot;Ultra-Hydrating Balm\\&quot; except it does not say \\&quot;Nourishes Thick, Coarse Hair\\&quot; like all the other jars I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. The product contained is watery and has an almost grayish color. It lacks the familiar balm-like appearance, texture, and feel. It does not spread in my hair because it&#x27;s so thin. At $25, I&#x27;m careful about spillage, but most of it ends up running out of my hands before it even gets to my head! It&#x27;s SO watery! It also smells completely different. And not in a good way. It wasn&#x27;t cheap, but I&#x27;m tossing it and buying another jar from a different seller. Bummer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. I thought I notice a change in the shampoo, seemed a bit runny. Then this last conditioner was a very obvious change in the feel. No longer creamy and thick, I&#x27;d now compare it to cheap grocery store products. I still had my old container of conditioner and sure enough the ingredients are different. This WAS the only product I had ever found that worked on my hair. Guess it&#x27;s time to go back to the drawing board and try to find in new line that will work for long thick hair that is fine and tangles easily. Goes back to the old adage, don&#x27;t fix it if it ain&#x27;t broken!!!!!! ( the old formula has the last ingredient as wheat germ oil, the new one the last is amyl cinnamal)</li>
            <li> Oh I dislike giving bad report....so much-however perhaps I got a bad batch.  This one felt \\&quot;thinner\\&quot; and more like the generic (off label but compare to brand).  Ive been using it for years so I have to send this one back.  I hope the company will look into their Quality Control...I am so sorry to relay it, hoping its just a few that are \\&quot;different\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I got scammed.  I used this product for years and what I received from the seller was not Biolage Ultra-Hydrating Conditioner  Its some thick goop that doesn&#x27;t have the same consistency, smell, or performance.  Not only do I feel I got ripped off once but twice because the price was good and I bought two.  My hair feels like crap and now I have to go somewhere and buy the real stuff.  Really disappointed.  If you used the real product before don&#x27;t buy this  You will be mad!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite conditioners; never lets me down. Hair feels great!</li>
            <li> Why change a great thing?  Matrix started this ULTRA line and added SILICONES to an otherwise perfect conditioner and shampoo. It smells different, and is a subpar product, designed only to give the illusion of more conditioning through more instant \\&quot;slip\\&quot; right after using.  Eventually those silicones will coat your hair, cause buildup, and dry your hair out and make it crunchy and damaged. Thankfully, the regular conditioning balm and matching shampoo are still alive and well, and unchanged. Thank GOD. Ive used the originals for over 20 years and have had day dreams winning the lottery and stockpiling this stuff by the gallon in an underground bunker ... so that I never run out should the makers ever discontinue the BEST CONDITIONER ON THE PLANET.  If you want the regular, old, tried and true conditioning balm all you have to do is make sure it doesnt say ULTRA on the label.  The two different formulas are packaged deceptively similarly, but this rule will see you through.  And no need to stockpile yet, as the old version is still being produced.  This brings me peace.  If youve never used these products before, please look up my reviews of the original formula BIOLAGE CONDITIONING BALM or their MOISTURIZING SHAMPOO.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product 2 years in row as Christmas gifts, my wife likes this brand.&lt;br /&gt;It is a good price and no shipping charges if you buy enough. Two smaller jar appears to be a better value than one large one.</li>
            <li> Wife like this, not sure why.</li>
            <li> I leave it in my hair when im showering for about 2-3 minutes and then comb through it and my hair becomes so soft and silky. Highly recommend it esp if you have curly and damaged hair!</li>
