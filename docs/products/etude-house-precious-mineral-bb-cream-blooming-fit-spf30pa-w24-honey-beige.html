            <li>It really good product.. Will purchase more soon.</li>
            <li>After 5 hours of work my skin still looks really nice.</li>
            <li>, the color is lighter and doesn&#x27;t cover as nicely.</li>
            <li>The coverage and consistency is nice</li>
            <li>This shade fitted nicely.</li>
            <li>Good coverage and lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>It has pretty good staying power, too!</li>
            <li>love love love it!</li>
            <li>Nice cream , you must apply it in sections and let it sit for about 10 to 20 minutes to see if it oxidizes to a un-casper the friendly ghost shade!  </li>
            <li>It offers Great coverage and it feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>The product itself is great but unfortunately not for my skin.</li>
            <li>powder ok</li>
            <li>I like my Missha better.</li>
            <li>I love it , I&#x27;ll order more of it soon</li>
            <li>I love this make-up.</li>
            <li>After reading that Korea was the inventor of the BB cream movement, I thought that if I went to the OG source it would be somehow even better than the Canadian rendition.</li>
            <li>(whatever that means--- as if oxygenating something means it can tell what color my skin and then magically becomes that)...</li>
            <li>One of my favorite bb creams.</li>
            <li>I ordered this from SeoulGlamour the way the packaged it was fantastic!</li>
            <li>They both match my skin color and the coverage is fantastic!</li>
            <li>so this was a nice fit</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>but I wish there were more colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>but I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this item and I am STILL using it since the day I bought it. :)</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it has SPF in it.</li>
            <li>It blends better if I mix it with a bit of my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I use this over Skin79 BB Precious collection, and it takes the place of foundation.</li>
            <li>But if I didn&#x27;t need better coverage I would buy this product 100% of the time.</li>
            <li>and it simply looks flawless.</li>
            <li>I bought this a month or two ago and I&#x27;ve been really enjoying it</li>
            <li>packaging is really cute.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy using it!</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I got this.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I have not been able to use any OTC BB Creams.</li>
            <li>i also use the powder and its great together!Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Make sure you get some sort of powder to put over it or specifically search out the &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; version.</li>
            <li>I think I would use it more for the winter time.</li>
            <li>Both had mild shine, so I still use a press powder; both were great coverage throughout the day &amp; both had a mild scent, like w/ most lotions</li>
            <li>I am a chinese with darker skin and it fit my skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li>the best bb cream i have used in my life,sooooooo soft &amp; gentle on the face with light amazing smell</li>
            <li>so if you have very dry skin like I do, it&#x27;s best to moisturize your face before using this product.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have my first BB cream and for it to be a success for</li>
            <li>It is by far the first BB Cream to match my skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li>But for sure its for people with a light complexion not recommended for darker complexion.</li>
            <li>Love this BB Cream it goes on smooth and stays on well.</li>
            <li>The consistency is nice and has fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It matched my skin tone perfectly without giving that ashy tone like the other BB creams.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would recommend this type of BB Cream to anyone even if not this exact color if you&#x27;re looking for light but pigmented coverage while still looking natural and nearly flawless.</li>
            <li>This made it easy for me to distribute the product over my face and neck.</li>
            <li>After doing some research and reading many amazon reviews, I settled on Etude House Precious mineral because I thought it would give good coverage, easily blendable and would match my coloring (I&#x27;m a tan asian with yellow-olive tones, with some T zone redness).</li>
            <li>I live in GA and it has done a good job of staying on my face through the heat and humidity.</li>
            <li>But it is fine.</li>
            <li>The texture is light and easy to blend</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t fall in love with it, but it&#x27;s a nice BB cream that offers a lot of coverage for my face.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>sometimes i get really light</li>
            <li>It blends really nice and makes my skill looks really even.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so light that I don&#x27;t feel any thing on my skin after apply it.</li>
            <li>This also have a light perfume scent to it, but it&#x27;s not an overpowering smell.&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>These are fantastic products.</li>
            <li>seeing as how I powder over this lightly.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product, will buy again.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>The product smells so clean and feels light on my skin...</li>
            <li>i hope you have as much success with this product as I did!</li>
            <li>I use it with the original Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li>And I feel it works better when I put some prime on it first.</li>
            <li>One thing I do love about this is that it doesn&#x27;t oxidize like normal foundation does!!</li>
            <li>Its great for comb/to dry skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This lasts on my face all day if I set it with a powder, if you have dry skin that probably won&#x27;t be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very nice product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gonna go buy Marcelle&#x27;s Golden Glow for $20 more and probably 200ml less, but I&#x27;ll be super happy on the product performs.</li>
            <li>Overall good product but not for oily skin like myself.</li>
            <li>Definitely, this is good for winter</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone that wants ample coverage, SPF, and a healthy &#x27;glow&#x27; to their skin.</li>
            <li>The product itself is amazing, I have oily and dry skin combination (more on the oily side though)</li>
            <li>The color seemed dark at first but again when distributed, it matched my own skin tone nicely.</li>
            <li>I bought this from SeoulGlamor and they were nice enough to add in freebies (such as the nymph aura volumizer by etude house - a liquid applied with bb cream or foundation to give that coveted \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; glow) which made my Korean cosmetic experience all the better!</li>
            <li>I find that this also blends into your skin very well and makes it feel light and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product is just what it claims to be - great coverage, moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t lay heavily on your face.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite BB cream so far.</li>
            <li>I have a golden tone to my skin</li>
            <li>, it looks more natural.</li>
            <li>Arrived earlier than expected and was in great condition!</li>
            <li>Also, I have really dry skin, and this is really moisturizing, might not be good for someone with oily skin...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good, but I will try out other BB Creams before fully judging this one.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not meant for super coverage, but really works well.</li>
            <li>The price is right compared to other BB creams on the market, I will buy more!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rather thick but when fully absorbed it creates very nice matte finish without looking too cakey.</li>
            <li>It does make the skin look poreless and firm, however have to mix it with true match n6 to get any form of believable coverage!</li>
            <li>product itself is more fluid than I thought.</li>
            <li>It had no emollient feel, so if you apply it with putting on your moisturizer first it skips on your skin...</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the floral scent can be overbearing if you are not used to Korean products, as most of them have some type of fragrance.</li>
            <li>My first order got lost on the way</li>
            <li>so thanks!</li>
            <li>This BB Cream was the first one I tried ever.</li>
            <li>It said &amp;#34;2013&amp;#34; at the top edge on the back</li>
            <li>Covers up pretty well.</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream simply because it covers all my skin imperfections.</li>
            <li>Overall I think I look better without it.</li>
            <li>However, this one matches my skin tone very well!</li>
            <li>I apply this BB Cream with a foundation brush not with my fingers - in case that might make a difference with the finish for anyone interested.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t very sure at first which shade of cream to get since I would think they run a little lighter than they look.</li>
            <li>Nice coverage, long lasting, gives a smooth texture and &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to skin.  </li>
            <li>I am Asian with yellow undertone and somewhat with fair skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m in my teens, asian tanned skin that gets oily fairly easy.</li>
            <li>This is the first time trying an asian bb cream...and let me tell you this product is fantastic...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little light and the scent is strong, but I like the coverage and benefits.</li>
            <li>Color is a bit light initially but then quickly absorbs and my complexion is natural, covered, and brightened.  </li>
            <li>Its nice little oily bt with</li>
            <li>I do believe that a primer is essential to get the desired smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I bought it not expecting much</li>
            <li>It blends very well with my skin tone &amp; doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
            <li>When I shake the bottle, I can actually hear a watery sound.</li>
            <li>Doesnt cover up much but brings out the understone of ur complexion.</li>
            <li>and this goes very well with it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The cream blends in really well</li>
            <li>What I really like about</li>
            <li>I bought this for $12-- a steal really</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much to do the job.</li>
            <li>It blends really well</li>
            <li>For this price, you really can&#x27;t afford not to.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything</li>
            <li>If you do too much you will look pasty.  </li>
            <li>This is the third BB Cream that I have tried and so far this is my favorite BB cream.</li>
            <li>I have tried lot of different BB Cream, so far, this one is among the better side.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bb cream itself is very liquidy compared to typical bb creams, but it&#x27;s very easy to blend.</li>
            <li>I do not use it on a daily basis as I prefer to save it for a special occasion.</li>
            <li>It covers most of my acne scars and I use a lot less concealer to cover up the imperfections on my face when I use this BB cream.</li>
            <li>Recently I&#x27;ve changed to a different product that affords more coverage.</li>
            <li>W/ the Loreal, I looked like I had NO BB foundation, the medium tan color blended way better, looked natural, in other words.</li>
            <li>The coverage is good and a little pump goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It gives you a flawless effect plus it doesnt smell bad.</li>
            <li>I have normal to oily skin</li>
            <li>highly recommend this to anyone with slightly darker-skinned (those with a golden or even light brownish tone in their skin) compared to the extremely fair-skinned Asians that tend to have more pink tones than gold tones.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For helpful comparison, I am light to medium skin tone (NC25-NC30 in MAC) and use Honey- 31 years old with the average lines and creases for my age.</li>
            <li>It has helped clear my complexion as well.  </li>
            <li>, My only con is that since I do have an oily T zone this cream didn&#x27;t really help that.</li>
            <li>The cream feels soft and makes you&#x27;re skin look even.</li>
            <li>I bought this shade and the natural beige to use together</li>
            <li>The estimated shipping was around 1 month (since I think it ships directly from Korea)</li>
            <li>and I use it every day, Bottle is still half full.</li>
            <li>Would recommend highly even at its current price of ~$27.</li>
            <li>it provides semi-sheer coverage when spread thinly and almost opaque coverage when concentrated on \\&quot;problem areas.\\&quot; Great product for gals (and guys) with uneven and blemished skin.</li>
            <li>I usually stray away from BB creams simply because I&#x27;m a bit tan and most asian BB creams lean on the lighter side...</li>
            <li>Product was too thick and although I used it with an oil moisturizer to smooth it out, I still did not care for it.  </li>
            <li>It was a little challenging to pick the color based on just pictures and my color was a little lighter than my skin needed.</li>

            <li> Just love it!</li>
            <li> I love the coverage of this and it makes my skin look even and dewy!</li>
            <li> I just tried it for the first time and I am very Happy with it.</li>
            <li> and I love them!</li>
            <li> Better than DIOR!</li>
            <li> The coverage is pretty darn impressive.</li>
            <li> This is a very smooth feeling and looking good to me.</li>
            <li> and it is amazing that it can work with a variety of skin tones.</li>
            <li> and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> It really good product.. Will purchase more soon.</li>
            <li> After 5 hours of work my skin still looks really nice.</li>
            <li> , the color is lighter and doesn&#x27;t cover as nicely.</li>
            <li> The coverage and consistency is nice</li>
            <li> This shade fitted nicely.</li>
            <li> Good coverage and lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li> It has pretty good staying power, too!</li>
            <li> love love love it!</li>
            <li> Nice cream , you must apply it in sections and let it sit for about 10 to 20 minutes to see if it oxidizes to a un-casper the friendly ghost shade!  </li>
            <li> It offers Great coverage and it feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great but unfortunately not for my skin.</li>
            <li> powder ok</li>
            <li> I like my Missha better.</li>
            <li> I love it , I&#x27;ll order more of it soon</li>
            <li> I love this make-up.</li>
            <li> After reading that Korea was the inventor of the BB cream movement, I thought that if I went to the OG source it would be somehow even better than the Canadian rendition.</li>
            <li> (whatever that means--- as if oxygenating something means it can tell what color my skin and then magically becomes that)...</li>
            <li> One of my favorite bb creams.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from SeoulGlamour the way the packaged it was fantastic!</li>
            <li> They both match my skin color and the coverage is fantastic!</li>
            <li> so this was a nice fit</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> but I wish there were more colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> but I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this item and I am STILL using it since the day I bought it. :)</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it has SPF in it.</li>
            <li> It blends better if I mix it with a bit of my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use this over Skin79 BB Precious collection, and it takes the place of foundation.</li>
            <li> But if I didn&#x27;t need better coverage I would buy this product 100% of the time.</li>
            <li> and it simply looks flawless.</li>
            <li> I bought this a month or two ago and I&#x27;ve been really enjoying it</li>
            <li> packaging is really cute.</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy using it!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I got this.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I have not been able to use any OTC BB Creams.</li>
            <li> i also use the powder and its great together!Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Make sure you get some sort of powder to put over it or specifically search out the &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; version.</li>
            <li> I think I would use it more for the winter time.</li>
            <li> Both had mild shine, so I still use a press powder; both were great coverage throughout the day &amp; both had a mild scent, like w/ most lotions</li>
            <li> I am a chinese with darker skin and it fit my skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li> the best bb cream i have used in my life,sooooooo soft &amp; gentle on the face with light amazing smell</li>
            <li> so if you have very dry skin like I do, it&#x27;s best to moisturize your face before using this product.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have my first BB cream and for it to be a success for</li>
            <li> It is by far the first BB Cream to match my skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li> But for sure its for people with a light complexion not recommended for darker complexion.</li>
            <li> Love this BB Cream it goes on smooth and stays on well.</li>
            <li> The consistency is nice and has fresh scent.</li>
            <li> It matched my skin tone perfectly without giving that ashy tone like the other BB creams.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this type of BB Cream to anyone even if not this exact color if you&#x27;re looking for light but pigmented coverage while still looking natural and nearly flawless.</li>
            <li> This made it easy for me to distribute the product over my face and neck.</li>
            <li> After doing some research and reading many amazon reviews, I settled on Etude House Precious mineral because I thought it would give good coverage, easily blendable and would match my coloring (I&#x27;m a tan asian with yellow-olive tones, with some T zone redness).</li>
            <li> I live in GA and it has done a good job of staying on my face through the heat and humidity.</li>
            <li> But it is fine.</li>
            <li> The texture is light and easy to blend</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t fall in love with it, but it&#x27;s a nice BB cream that offers a lot of coverage for my face.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> sometimes i get really light</li>
            <li> It blends really nice and makes my skill looks really even.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so light that I don&#x27;t feel any thing on my skin after apply it.</li>
            <li> This also have a light perfume scent to it, but it&#x27;s not an overpowering smell.&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> These are fantastic products.</li>
            <li> seeing as how I powder over this lightly.</li>
            <li> Overall, great product, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> The product smells so clean and feels light on my skin...</li>
            <li> i hope you have as much success with this product as I did!</li>
            <li> I use it with the original Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li> And I feel it works better when I put some prime on it first.</li>
            <li> One thing I do love about this is that it doesn&#x27;t oxidize like normal foundation does!!</li>
            <li> Its great for comb/to dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This lasts on my face all day if I set it with a powder, if you have dry skin that probably won&#x27;t be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very nice product</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gonna go buy Marcelle&#x27;s Golden Glow for $20 more and probably 200ml less, but I&#x27;ll be super happy on the product performs.</li>
            <li> Overall good product but not for oily skin like myself.</li>
            <li> Definitely, this is good for winter</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that wants ample coverage, SPF, and a healthy &#x27;glow&#x27; to their skin.</li>
            <li> The product itself is amazing, I have oily and dry skin combination (more on the oily side though)</li>
            <li> The color seemed dark at first but again when distributed, it matched my own skin tone nicely.</li>
            <li> I bought this from SeoulGlamor and they were nice enough to add in freebies (such as the nymph aura volumizer by etude house - a liquid applied with bb cream or foundation to give that coveted \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; glow) which made my Korean cosmetic experience all the better!</li>
            <li> I find that this also blends into your skin very well and makes it feel light and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product is just what it claims to be - great coverage, moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t lay heavily on your face.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite BB cream so far.</li>
            <li> I have a golden tone to my skin</li>
            <li> , it looks more natural.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected and was in great condition!</li>
            <li> Also, I have really dry skin, and this is really moisturizing, might not be good for someone with oily skin...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, but I will try out other BB Creams before fully judging this one.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not meant for super coverage, but really works well.</li>
            <li> The price is right compared to other BB creams on the market, I will buy more!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather thick but when fully absorbed it creates very nice matte finish without looking too cakey.</li>
            <li> It does make the skin look poreless and firm, however have to mix it with true match n6 to get any form of believable coverage!</li>
            <li> product itself is more fluid than I thought.</li>
            <li> It had no emollient feel, so if you apply it with putting on your moisturizer first it skips on your skin...</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the floral scent can be overbearing if you are not used to Korean products, as most of them have some type of fragrance.</li>
            <li> My first order got lost on the way</li>
            <li> so thanks!</li>
            <li> This BB Cream was the first one I tried ever.</li>
            <li> It said &amp;#34;2013&amp;#34; at the top edge on the back</li>
            <li> Covers up pretty well.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream simply because it covers all my skin imperfections.</li>
            <li> Overall I think I look better without it.</li>
            <li> However, this one matches my skin tone very well!</li>
            <li> I apply this BB Cream with a foundation brush not with my fingers - in case that might make a difference with the finish for anyone interested.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very sure at first which shade of cream to get since I would think they run a little lighter than they look.</li>
            <li> Nice coverage, long lasting, gives a smooth texture and &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to skin.  </li>
            <li> I am Asian with yellow undertone and somewhat with fair skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m in my teens, asian tanned skin that gets oily fairly easy.</li>
            <li> This is the first time trying an asian bb cream...and let me tell you this product is fantastic...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little light and the scent is strong, but I like the coverage and benefits.</li>
            <li> Color is a bit light initially but then quickly absorbs and my complexion is natural, covered, and brightened.  </li>
            <li> Its nice little oily bt with</li>
            <li> I do believe that a primer is essential to get the desired smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I bought it not expecting much</li>
            <li> It blends very well with my skin tone &amp; doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
            <li> When I shake the bottle, I can actually hear a watery sound.</li>
            <li> Doesnt cover up much but brings out the understone of ur complexion.</li>
            <li> and this goes very well with it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The cream blends in really well</li>
            <li> What I really like about</li>
            <li> I bought this for $12-- a steal really</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much to do the job.</li>
            <li> It blends really well</li>
            <li> For this price, you really can&#x27;t afford not to.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything</li>
            <li> If you do too much you will look pasty.  </li>
            <li> This is the third BB Cream that I have tried and so far this is my favorite BB cream.</li>
            <li> I have tried lot of different BB Cream, so far, this one is among the better side.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bb cream itself is very liquidy compared to typical bb creams, but it&#x27;s very easy to blend.</li>
            <li> I do not use it on a daily basis as I prefer to save it for a special occasion.</li>
            <li> It covers most of my acne scars and I use a lot less concealer to cover up the imperfections on my face when I use this BB cream.</li>
            <li> Recently I&#x27;ve changed to a different product that affords more coverage.</li>
            <li> W/ the Loreal, I looked like I had NO BB foundation, the medium tan color blended way better, looked natural, in other words.</li>
            <li> The coverage is good and a little pump goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It gives you a flawless effect plus it doesnt smell bad.</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin</li>
            <li> highly recommend this to anyone with slightly darker-skinned (those with a golden or even light brownish tone in their skin) compared to the extremely fair-skinned Asians that tend to have more pink tones than gold tones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For helpful comparison, I am light to medium skin tone (NC25-NC30 in MAC) and use Honey- 31 years old with the average lines and creases for my age.</li>
            <li> It has helped clear my complexion as well.  </li>
            <li> , My only con is that since I do have an oily T zone this cream didn&#x27;t really help that.</li>
            <li> The cream feels soft and makes you&#x27;re skin look even.</li>
            <li> I bought this shade and the natural beige to use together</li>
            <li> The estimated shipping was around 1 month (since I think it ships directly from Korea)</li>
            <li> and I use it every day, Bottle is still half full.</li>
            <li> Would recommend highly even at its current price of ~$27.</li>
            <li> it provides semi-sheer coverage when spread thinly and almost opaque coverage when concentrated on \\&quot;problem areas.\\&quot; Great product for gals (and guys) with uneven and blemished skin.</li>
            <li> I usually stray away from BB creams simply because I&#x27;m a bit tan and most asian BB creams lean on the lighter side...</li>
            <li> Product was too thick and although I used it with an oil moisturizer to smooth it out, I still did not care for it.  </li>
            <li> It was a little challenging to pick the color based on just pictures and my color was a little lighter than my skin needed.</li>
            <li> Make sure to heat it up between fingers to apply and apply some moisturizer or primer prior so that it spreads easier on the skin as it is a heavy, thick , creamy texture.</li>
            <li> The color is about right (i guess) but the undertone looks a little grayish to me (unlike other reviews saying it has yellow undertone..</li>
            <li> , I wear NC 42 and there wasn&#x27;t enough yellow in the color, it made me look a bit grey and ashy.</li>
            <li> One pump is enough, alot goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times but so far I haven&#x27;t broken out of it since my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s something that can be fixed with a little bronzer.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it was still a bit too light on me</li>
            <li> It lasts all the day long.</li>
            <li> Stays on for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my BB Cream was kinda old or something because it didn&#x27;t have a dewey finish like some say, but I like it that way anyway.</li>
            <li> You only need one pump, maybe less</li>
            <li> It starts to fade after around 6 hours though, but only slightly.</li>
            <li> I also have very dry skin</li>
            <li> If your skin is very dry, you&#x27;ll still need to wear a moisturizer underneath.</li>
            <li> It looked too cakey and I only used a little product.</li>
            <li> in a little pink box (I ordered several items) and a lot of bubble wrap</li>
            <li> and it came way before the expected date.</li>
            <li> Shipping came undamaged and arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> It comes in a pink rectangular box that holds the product.</li>
            <li> Oh and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> will look a little cakey and your dry patches will show.</li>
            <li> the W16 Sand beige and W24 honey biege, since i tend to get really dark in the summer and lighter in the winter.</li>
            <li> It helps with dark spots, acne, dryness...</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t cover dark spots/hyper pigmentation or blemishes, but it will cover redness if you layer it.</li>
            <li> Feels more like a base foundation used for make-up.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not very light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super dark</li>
            <li> Blending along the hairline was a failure cause the pigment is so deep that it lightened my hair.</li>
            <li> If you are oily, you might not like the slight sheen this product produces.</li>
            <li> The only cons i have is that its so sticky and heavy, makes it a little hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have bad skin or super problematic one</li>
            <li> So I mix it with another tinted product just a little bit to adjust the color.</li>
            <li> You might look a little dewy but the makeup itself dries without any residue.</li>
            <li> It seemed as though it would melt after a few hours, and I&#x27;d have to keep botting the oil throughout the day.</li>
            <li> version, which means after an hour or two that &amp;#34;dewy glow&amp;#34; will start looking just plain greasy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, i am not sure if i will buy again because it&#x27;s too heavy and cakey for me.</li>
            <li> The consistency is on the thicker side but not super thick.</li>
            <li> Thick and heavy and waaaay whiter than it should be.  </li>
            <li> I was really not sure if I wanted to buy this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it also moisturizes the skin, but if it does, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it.</li>
            <li> , so i was a little bit afraid of in purchasing this since it is an Asian product</li>
            <li> really disappointed me cause it really just acts like a foundation.</li>
            <li> At least it was cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you try to blend it starts to feel thick.</li>
            <li> so I was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> It goes on evenly and doesn&#x27;t look fake at all.</li>
            <li> but i was wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First I want to say that I got the wrong shade, this is lighter than my face, but it&#x27;s nothing powder</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look too bad underneath powder.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Its nice little oily bt with powder ok</li>
            <li> Thick and heavy and waaaay whiter than it should be.  This brand&#x27;s version of medium is just chalky white.  I looked like a ghost.  Ugh</li>
            <li> This is darker than I though! But it is fine. This is a very smooth feeling and looking good to me.</li>
            <li> For comparison, I also bought the &amp;#34;Loreal BB Cream Youth Code w/ spf 15, medium color,&amp;#34; &amp; betwn the 2, I hav to say I like the cheaper BB cream, the Loreal.  Both had mild shine, so I still use a press powder; both were great coverage throughout the day &amp; both had a mild scent, like w/ most lotions w/ spf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference betwn the 2 is the cost &amp; color tone. Loreal is cheaper &amp; the Etude color, I looked whitish tan. W/ the Loreal, I looked like I had NO BB foundation, the medium tan color blended way better, looked natural, in other words.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a bit of a darker color, but it works.  Doesn&#x27;t look too bad underneath powder.  I like my Missha better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little light and the scent is strong, but I like the coverage and benefits.</li>
            <li> I love it , I&#x27;ll order more of it soon&lt;br /&gt;easy to apply ! perfect for my skin type!&lt;br /&gt;I might try their skin care line as well</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have my first BB cream and for it to be a success for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is more fluid than I thought. This made it easy for me to distribute the product over my face and neck. The color seemed dark at first but again when distributed, it matched my own skin tone nicely. I do believe that a primer is essential to get the desired smooth finish. I do not use it on a daily basis as I prefer to save it for a special occasion. i hope you have as much success with this product as I did!</li>
            <li> It really good product.. Will purchase more soon.</li>
            <li> I love this make-up. It offers Great coverage and it feels good on my skin. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was introduced by BB creams from a sample I got in my monthly Birchbox... It was a Canadian brand. It&#x27;s awesome. After reading that Korea was the inventor of the BB cream movement, I thought that if I went to the OG source it would be somehow even better than the Canadian rendition. After doing some research and reading many amazon reviews, I settled on Etude House Precious mineral because I thought it would give good coverage, easily blendable and would match my coloring (I&#x27;m a tan asian with yellow-olive tones, with some T zone redness). I also wanted it to act as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really disappointed me cause it really just acts like a foundation. It had no emollient feel, so if you apply it with putting on your moisturizer first it skips on your skin... When you try to blend it starts to feel thick. I order Honey Beige based on the reviews... and it was way too like. Blending along the hairline was a failure cause the pigment is so deep that it lightened my hair. And I don&#x27;t think it ever &amp;#34;oxidized&amp;#34; (whatever that means--- as if oxygenating something means it can tell what color my skin and then magically becomes that)... just stayed one color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I threw away my packaging and air bill so I&#x27;m stuck with it. At least it was cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gonna go buy Marcelle&#x27;s Golden Glow for $20 more and probably 200ml less, but I&#x27;ll be super happy on the product performs.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite bb creams. I bought it not expecting much but to my surprise it&#x27;s awesome! It blends very well with my skin tone &amp; doesn&#x27;t feel oily. After 5 hours of work my skin still looks really nice.</li>
            <li> This BB Cream is too watery. When I shake the bottle, I can actually hear a watery sound. When compared with Missha M Perfect Cover BB Cream SPF 42 PA+++ 50ml No.27 (Honey Beige), the color is lighter and doesn&#x27;t cover as nicely. Buy Missha instead.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from SeoulGlamour the way the packaged it was fantastic! in a little pink box (I ordered several items) and a lot of bubble wrap and it came way before the expected date. This BB cream has Great Coverage! wooow i was impressed I am light skin I&#x27;ll say my skin color is just like the Actress Michelle Rodrigues, so i was a little bit afraid of in purchasing this since it is an Asian product so I got me to bottles the W16 Sand beige and W24 honey biege, since i tend to get really dark in the summer and lighter in the winter. They both match my skin color and the coverage is fantastic! Recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> It matched my skin tone perfectly without giving that ashy tone like the other BB creams. I would definitely buy one once mine runs out. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times but so far I haven&#x27;t broken out of it since my skin is very sensitive. Make sure to heat it up between fingers to apply and apply some moisturizer or primer prior so that it spreads easier on the skin as it is a heavy, thick , creamy texture.</li>
            <li> Shipping came undamaged and arrived as expected. The product itself is great but unfortunately not for my skin.Its great for comb/to dry skin. Definitely not for oily skin. The consistency is nice and has fresh scent.Doesnt cover up much but brings out the understone of ur complexion. Overall good product but not for oily skin like myself.</li>
            <li> This BB Cream is the bomb!! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the floral scent can be overbearing if you are not used to Korean products, as most of them have some type of fragrance.</li>
            <li> I referenced another review on what i should get for color im hispanic so im a bit tan sometimes i get really light but this color fits me perfectly.</li>
            <li> My first order got lost on the way so this is my 2nd order (re-order). I got refunded by the way..so thanks! I got this one earlier than ETA. Based from reviews, i was convinced to try this. I am Asian with yellow undertone and somewhat with fair skin. The color is about right (i guess) but the undertone looks a little grayish to me (unlike other reviews saying it has yellow undertone..but who knows maybe it&#x27;s just mine). The coverage is good and a little pump goes a long way. This tube will probably last for couple of months if you use it religiously but mine might take 6 months or so. Unfortunately, i am not sure if i will buy again because it&#x27;s too heavy and cakey for me. Definitely, this is good for winter but i won&#x27;t recommend it for summer use else you end up looking like you&#x27;re going to a children&#x27;s birthday party for their entertainment, if you know what i mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, i&#x27;m moving on.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t fall in love with it, but it&#x27;s a nice BB cream that offers a lot of coverage for my face. I don&#x27;t have bad skin or super problematic one so this was a nice fit, My only con is that since I do have an oily T zone this cream didn&#x27;t really help that. It seemed as though it would melt after a few hours, and I&#x27;d have to keep botting the oil throughout the day. One thing I do love about this is that it doesn&#x27;t oxidize like normal foundation does!! I didn&#x27;t look orange or tanned at the end of the day so that&#x27;s a huge plus for me. I would buy again but not anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Impressive. Etude house i love it.</li>
            <li> I like the bb cream but unfortunately it was still a bit too light on me, I wear NC 42 and there wasn&#x27;t enough yellow in the color, it made me look a bit grey and ashy. The coverage and consistency is nice but I wish there were more colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a piece of work. Wearing only this is enough when you&#x27;re out of time to put makeup. It&#x27;s magic!!</li>
            <li> This BB Cream was the first one I tried ever. I am Chinese and have relatively &amp;#34;dark for asians&amp;#34; kinda skin, so I got W24 or Honey Beige. It brightens up my face in a way as it matches my skin tone yet does the brightening. I&#x27;m not sure if my BB Cream was kinda old or something because it didn&#x27;t have a dewey finish like some say, but I like it that way anyway. It said &amp;#34;2013&amp;#34; at the top edge on the back so I was a little skeptical. Still works well cuz I use it as a spot concealer. Covers up pretty well. It&#x27;s scent is amazing by the way! I love it lol. One downside may be that it shows up whiter in flash photography. It&#x27;s pretty good, but I will try out other BB Creams before fully judging this one.</li>
            <li> I was really not sure if I wanted to buy this but I am glad I did. I&#x27;m not super dark but I&#x27;m not very light. I&#x27;m a tan skin tone and this goes very well with it. It goes on evenly and doesn&#x27;t look fake at all. I absolutely love this item and I am STILL using it since the day I bought it. :)</li>
            <li> It blends really nice and makes my skill looks really even. Since my acne scars are really deep, I still need to use concealer besides the BB Cream. Otherwise, this is a great product! In addition, the package comes with 5 packets of samples. I will try them all and buy more Etude House products :D</li>
            <li> Just love it! I am a chinese with darker skin and it fit my skin tone perfectly. And it&#x27;s so light that I don&#x27;t feel any thing on my skin after apply it. It lasts all the day long. Thumbs up! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> the best bb cream i have used in my life,sooooooo soft &amp; gentle on the face with light amazing smell</li>
            <li> I have tried over 7 BB creams and I find myself always going back to this one. I try buying the American brands but they just haven&#x27;t perfected it quite yet. I love the coverage of this and it makes my skin look even and dewy! I also love the fact that it has SPF in it. This is my favorite BB cream so far.</li>
            <li> Im so happy i purchased this. The color is perfect with my skin. It gives you a flawless effect plus it doesnt smell bad. The only cons i have is that its so sticky and heavy, makes it a little hard to apply. But it settles flawless. Overall. I loove it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream simply because it covers all my skin imperfections. It&#x27;s rather thick but when fully absorbed it creates very nice matte finish without looking too cakey. It was a little challenging to pick the color based on just pictures and my color was a little lighter than my skin needed. So I mix it with another tinted product just a little bit to adjust the color. It works.</li>
            <li> Very nice bottle, product but not for tan skin. I&#x27;m hispanic and i have like Jessica albas and Eva Mendes skin color and i thought since this was the darkest shade it would work with my skin color but i was wrong. These products aren&#x27;t made for tan/dark skin.</li>
            <li> I have a golden tone to my skin but I am relatively light-skinned too and this works perfectly for me. It is by far the first BB Cream to match my skin tone perfectly. I find that this also blends into your skin very well and makes it feel light and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anyone with slightly darker-skinned (those with a golden or even light brownish tone in their skin) compared to the extremely fair-skinned Asians that tend to have more pink tones than gold tones.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this type of BB Cream to anyone even if not this exact color if you&#x27;re looking for light but pigmented coverage while still looking natural and nearly flawless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it also moisturizes the skin, but if it does, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it. Feels more like a base foundation used for make-up.</li>
            <li> This was not for me.  Product was too thick and although I used it with an oil moisturizer to smooth it out, I still did not care for it.  It looked too cakey and I only used a little product.</li>
            <li> This is the third BB Cream that I have tried and so far this is my favorite BB cream. The texture is light and easy to blend and I also like how this product has a variety of tones to choose from. It does a good job evening out your skin tone and the it gives good coverage. I stopped using concealer cause this covered my under eye circle along with my blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product four out of five stars because it doesn&#x27;t entirely match my skin tone. I have a yellow undertone so this bb cream can also leave a white cast over your face but it&#x27;s something that can be fixed with a little bronzer. I also have very dry skin so if you have very dry skin like I do, it&#x27;s best to moisturize your face before using this product. If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll face will look a little cakey and your dry patches will show. This also have a light perfume scent to it, but it&#x27;s not an overpowering smell.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would repurchase this product again.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic products. They provide perfect coverage but it doesn&#x27;t even look like you&#x27;re wearing anything. The cream blends in really well and it is amazing that it can work with a variety of skin tones. After using for awhile you will notice a difference in your skin. I use this and I have aging skin. My daughter is a teenager and she uses it. It helps with dark spots, acne, dryness...our skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I just tried it for the first time and I am very Happy with it. I wasn&#x27;t very sure at first which shade of cream to get since I would think they run a little lighter than they look. Im hispanic with tan skin and the HONEY BEIGE fit perfectly! The cream feels soft and makes you&#x27;re skin look even. Def recommend it!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t return it but I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase. The color is good and it&#x27;s not drying, however despite vigorous blending it still tends to sit in the lines of my face. What I really like about it is how well it covers up redness (reason I am keeping it). It blends better if I mix it with a bit of my moisturizer. Overall I think I look better without it.</li>
            <li> I use this over Skin79 BB Precious collection, and it takes the place of foundation. It has great staying power, makes my skin even, and doesn&#x27;t settle in to creases. I still have to use concealer, as it is a BB cream so it&#x27;s not meant for super coverage, but really works well. For helpful comparison, I am light to medium skin tone (NC25-NC30 in MAC) and use Honey- 31 years old with the average lines and creases for my age. Also, I have really dry skin, and this is really moisturizing, might not be good for someone with oily skin... seeing as how I powder over this lightly. Overall, great product, will buy again. Oh and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This shade fitted nicely. It covers well and it doesn&#x27;t have a make up look to it, it looks more natural. But for sure its for people with a light complexion not recommended for darker complexion.</li>
            <li> Good coverage and lasts most of the day. The Honey Beige is great for my skin tone. Great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for $12-- a steal really and it is amazing. Recently I&#x27;ve changed to a different product that affords more coverage. But if I didn&#x27;t need better coverage I would buy this product 100% of the time. I&#x27;ve had it for around 10 months now and I use it every day, Bottle is still half full. Amazing. You only need one pump, maybe less and you&#x27;re good to go. Goes on smooth. I use it with the original Beauty Blender. Would recommend highly even at its current price of ~$27. Still more affordable than many products out there and great quality!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It covers fantastically.  Stays on for a long time.  You don&#x27;t need much to do the job.</li>
            <li> I bought this shade and the natural beige to use together and I love them! The product smells so clean and feels light on my skin... it provides semi-sheer coverage when spread thinly and almost opaque coverage when concentrated on \\&quot;problem areas.\\&quot; Great product for gals (and guys) with uneven and blemished skin. I bought this from SeoulGlamor and they were nice enough to add in freebies (such as the nymph aura volumizer by etude house - a liquid applied with bb cream or foundation to give that coveted \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; glow) which made my Korean cosmetic experience all the better!</li>
            <li> I usually stray away from BB creams simply because I&#x27;m a bit tan and most asian BB creams lean on the lighter side... However, this one matches my skin tone very well! It doesn&#x27;t have that grayish tone that most BB creams have and it has awesome coverage. It covers most of my acne scars and I use a lot less concealer to cover up the imperfections on my face when I use this BB cream. The consistency is on the thicker side but not super thick. It blends really well and I use a flattop kabuki brush to apply it and it simply looks flawless. Definitely try it out if you&#x27;ve never use a BB cream before... For this price, you really can&#x27;t afford not to.</li>
            <li> I bought this a month or two ago and I&#x27;ve been really enjoying it (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my teens, asian tanned skin that gets oily fairly easy. I have this in the shade Honey Beige.&lt;br /&gt;First I want to say that I got the wrong shade, this is lighter than my face, but it&#x27;s nothing powder won&#x27;t fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is really cute. It comes in a pink rectangular box that holds the product. The way the bb cream is dispensed is just like the Missha ones, through a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bb cream itself is very liquidy compared to typical bb creams, but it&#x27;s very easy to blend. Coverage is also sheer. It won&#x27;t cover dark spots/hyper pigmentation or blemishes, but it will cover redness if you layer it. Doesn&#x27;t look cakey at all. Doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lasts on my face all day if I set it with a powder, if you have dry skin that probably won&#x27;t be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very nice product and I really enjoy using it! (:</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected and was in great condition! The estimated shipping was around 1 month (since I think it ships directly from Korea) but it arrived in about...2 weeks? The product itself is amazing, I have oily and dry skin combination (more on the oily side though) and I also have problems with acne. This bb cream has caused no problems whatsoever and does not have any conflict with my acne, I would even say that it improved my skin (probably because of the SPF30). It starts to fade after around 6 hours though, but only slightly.</li>
            <li> I have used others before and this is the best option for me.  I am so glad that I got this.  Color is a bit light initially but then quickly absorbs and my complexion is natural, covered, and brightened.  It has helped clear my complexion as well.  I will def purchase again.  One pump is enough, alot goes a long way.  If you do too much you will look pasty.  But that would be with any product or foundation.</li>
            <li> Good as always! Better than DIOR!</li>
            <li> i love the way it blends with my color and its amazing how it provide great overage. love love love it! will buy again.</li>
            <li> Nice coverage, long lasting, gives a smooth texture and &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to skin.  The price is right compared to other BB creams on the market, I will buy more!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this BB Cream. I like the range of color choices. It has a dispenser pump. The coverage is pretty darn impressive. It has pretty good staying power, too! I live in GA and it has done a good job of staying on my face through the heat and humidity. I have not noticed it rubbing off on my clothing, either. I am also someone who does not reapply makeup throughout the day but for lipgloss. For me, the best attribute of this BB Cream is the fact that the sunscreen ingredient used is Titanium Dioxide. My skin does not tolerate chemical sunscreens AT ALL. Therefore, I have not been able to use any OTC BB Creams. I was using Jane Iredale BB Cream - but between the lack of color choices and cost, I thought I&#x27;d try this one. I am so happy that I did. I would recommend this product to anyone that wants ample coverage, SPF, and a healthy &#x27;glow&#x27; to their skin. If you are oily, you might not like the slight sheen this product produces. If your skin is very dry, you&#x27;ll still need to wear a moisturizer underneath. You might look a little dewy but the makeup itself dries without any residue. I apply this BB Cream with a foundation brush not with my fingers - in case that might make a difference with the finish for anyone interested.</li>
            <li> This is the first time trying an asian bb cream...and let me tell you this product is fantastic...US bb cream doesnt compare to this...I have oily skin and it still make my skin looks good just need to set it with ur fave powder and ur good togo will purchase again❤</li>
            <li> I have tried lot of different BB Cream, so far, this one is among the better side. It does not give the skin a ashy tone. And I feel it works better when I put some prime on it first.</li>
            <li> Love this BB Cream it goes on smooth and stays on well. i also use the powder and its great together!Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> This product is just what it claims to be - great coverage, moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t lay heavily on your face. It makes my skin look practically perfect. I&#x27;d just warn anyone looking to buy this in the future that it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; version, which means after an hour or two that &amp;#34;dewy glow&amp;#34; will start looking just plain greasy. Make sure you get some sort of powder to put over it or specifically search out the &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; version.</li>
            <li> I did like the coverage a lot.  I think I would use it more for the winter time. I have normal to oily skin so it was a bit shiny by the end of the day, but definitely purchase again! ;)</li>
            <li> Nice cream , you must apply it in sections and let it sit for about 10 to 20 minutes to see if it oxidizes to a un-casper the friendly ghost shade!  It does make the skin look poreless and firm, however have to mix it with true match n6 to get any form of believable coverage!</li>
