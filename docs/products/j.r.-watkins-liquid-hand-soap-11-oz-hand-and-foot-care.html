            <li> Maybe a little costly compared to the cheaper stuff, but all natural and smells wonderful! Makes want to wash your hands a lot.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Leaves the hands clean ang great smelling.</li>
            <li> Almost no lathering with this soap. It cleans OK at best. The only positive aspect in the lemon scent.</li>
            <li> Cleans well with a crisp lemon scent. Much better than having my hands smell like Lavender Breeze. :-)</li>
            <li> This Watkins Liquid Hand Soap is just what my wife and I had been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Especially the lemon scent.  We love citrus smells for getting rid of cooking and&lt;br /&gt;food preparation smells, as well as those times that we eat with our fingers and&lt;br /&gt;have that hamburger smell lingering on us.  The price was substantially less than&lt;br /&gt;a product that I had previously been buying and does the job every bit as well.&lt;br /&gt;I could not find a good replacement for that expensive product before, so once again,&lt;br /&gt;thank you amazon.com for finding such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> favorite new soap - you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> Really good soap. good for soaking combs and hair brushes. Feels nice and scent is just right Lemony but not too strong</li>
            <li> I love the fresh citrus scent and clean feeling after using this soap.</li>
            <li> great hand soap, cool bottle</li>
            <li> Great quality and price!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and that its natural without antibacterial attributes.</li>
            <li> Smells light and very lemony!  Not drying to my hands.</li>
            <li> This product is advertised with several lies. It is not &amp;#34;natural&#x27; in any way. It is not soap. It contains ethanol, strong detergent (sodium laureth sulfate), and several chemicals to thicken it and kill germs. But it does clean, and does smell nicely of lemon.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes lemon liquid hand soap and Santa put this in her stocking! It was a little pricey, but that&#x27;s what usually happens at Christmas. It has a nice, light scent, not overpowering, but still refreshing.</li>
            <li> Love this hand soap and will be ordering more very shortly.  We do not use heavily perfumed cosmetics or soap products.  JR Watkins has no overpowering odor and cleanses thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I bought it in the store and my husband and I thought it smelled so nice I did a web search for more lemon scented products from them.&lt;br /&gt;Just bought more of everything they make in lemon scent.  (Bath oil and moisturizers.)</li>
            <li> Really like this soap</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell!  Nice plastic bottle</li>
