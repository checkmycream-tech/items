    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I rubbed it in like a lotion and hoped for the best.</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>but it works good</li>
            <li>Did not use plastic wrap to keep it warm and from drying.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest most men are not purchasing numbing cream for tattoos they never got or going to get, and if they did if must be a MURAL of a tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>No complaints here. :-)</li>
            <li>guys if you&#x27;re looking for a cream for sexual longevity</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most because of the business I&#x27;m and the women appreciate my performance because referrals keep coming; no pun</li>
            <li>It worked great highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Is good for the first 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>I would strongly advise against any numbing cream unless you like the intensity of pain.</li>
            <li>Works really fast, I love it!</li>
            <li>Takes less than required to use, super quick to work, very nice, very easy to use, wish it came with more instructions, or if it was toxic or not.</li>
            <li>It takes a little time for working, but it&#x27;s works very good.</li>
            <li>Super number cream came today</li>
            <li>Was well worth it</li>
            <li>if you reviews think this Super Numb is great for tattoos, then you&#x27;ll be INVESTING in LMX 4% which is absolutely better.</li>
            <li>I will most likely purchase again.</li>
            <li>My wife and I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>Probably a bit mild for some of our sensitive tattoo clients.</li>
            <li>It really works</li>
            <li>COLD TURKEY IS BEST!!!!</li>
            <li>Very useful, I still have a ton of it left.</li>
            <li>So, the second tattoo I decided to use it again on a bigger tattoo and it was fine for about 30 minutes, when the sensation came back the pain was so intense!!!!</li>
            <li>Took a break and tried to put more on to numb it better now that it was open wound, could get in her system better.</li>
            <li>I tried this three time , first time on a small tattoo and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>So, my conclusion is if you want a small tattoo it is ok.</li>
            <li>However, I did not follow directions completely.</li>
            <li>Her tattoo stayed inflamed and red around the whole area for the rest of the night and into the morning.</li>
            <li>Had considerable pain during eyebrow tatoo.</li>
            <li>but my skin lost its numbness in the middle of waxing, you have to act fast, like in an hour after you start waxing</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t enough for one full use &amp; therefore, not worth the money.</li>
            <li>This product was way too small to get the full numbing affect.  </li>
            <li>Very small for the price, doesn&#x27;t seem to make a huge difference in pain experience for tattoo clients.</li>
            <li>no other cream especially this one tops</li>
    </ol>

            <li> no other cream especially this one tops</li>
            <li> It numbs slightly but not enough to take the pain away completely.</li>
            <li> Thought we might have just left it on too long.</li>
            <li> Does the trick and keeps the pain away for a long time.</li>
            <li> the box was damage very bad not to happy bout</li>
            <li> purchased this to see if 5% lidocaine would turn my 4% marathon cream into a SPARTAN SUPER RACE, and I didn&#x27;t get off the starting block with this cream as it didn&#x27;t numb</li>
            <li> Did not have numbing effect I expected.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> There was some pain but not as bad and intense</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with LMX 4% Topical Cream, and I will be trying LMX 5% for the hell of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sorry, I can only tell the truth.</li>
            <li> It was surprisingly small as if I could say you need 2 of them for just brezilian wax...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several other types of numbing cream, and this is the worst one by far.</li>
            <li> Apply at least 2 layers and heating up the product like the instructions say.</li>
            <li> So after waiting 45 minutes for it to take effect which it didn&#x27;t, I washed with soap and water waited an additional hour and then applied my LMX 4% Topical Cream and was numb in 20 minutes which speaks volumes for LMX</li>
            <li> It felt worse than a blistery sunburn.</li>
            <li> (10 time worse then with no numbing cream).</li>
            <li> Showering and putting on lotion was a joke it was bad for muplitple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE poduct!</li>

            <li> Loved it. It really works</li>
            <li> Just a dab won&#x27;t do. Apply at least 2 layers and heating up the product like the instructions say.No complaints here. :-)</li>
            <li> I purchased this for waxing purposes. I think it helped.. Although I may just be getting used to waxing again. However, I did not follow directions completely. Did not use plastic wrap to keep it warm and from drying. I rubbed it in like a lotion and hoped for the best. It took the edge off.. I will most likely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Junk.  No numbing affect whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It takes a little time for working, but it&#x27;s works very good.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both used this on our side/ backs for tattoos recently. TERRIBLE poduct! My wife and I followed the directions exactly. Covered for 3 hours. Only lasted about 10 minutes but I could still feel a lot of pain.&lt;br /&gt;My wife had an allergic reaction that made her skin red and irritated. Thought we might have just left it on too long. She sat through 3 hours of pain during her tattoo. Took a break and tried to put more on to numb it better now that it was open wound, could get in her system better. It hurt from the second she started her tattoo again. Could only handle another hour. Her tattoo stayed inflamed and red around the whole area for the rest of the night and into the morning. It felt worse than a blistery sunburn. I couldnt even touch the area. Showering and putting on lotion was a joke it was bad for muplitple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any sensitivity to creams or chemicals, DO NOT USE!!!!!</li>
            <li> Super number cream came today the box was damage very bad not to happy bout that</li>
            <li> Very small for the price, doesn&#x27;t seem to make a huge difference in pain experience for tattoo clients. Probably a bit mild for some of our sensitive tattoo clients. Maybe works on some, but I haven&#x27;t seen it.</li>
            <li> Is good for the first 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work at all. I put it on and let it sit for 3 hours and it didn&#x27;t work at all. I&#x27;ve used several other types of numbing cream, and this is the worst one by far. After 3 hours, this wore off after about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Did not have numbing effect I expected. Had considerable pain during eyebrow tatoo.</li>
            <li> Works great! Does the trick and keeps the pain away for a long time.</li>
            <li> works just like it says</li>
            <li> It worked great highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Takes about an hour to start numbing but it works good</li>
            <li> i pierced my septum with this. I didn&#x27;t feel a thing.</li>
            <li> I tried this three time , first time on a small tattoo and it worked fine. (30 min maximum) So, the second tattoo I decided to use it again on a bigger tattoo and it was fine for about 30 minutes, when the sensation came back the pain was so intense!!!! (10 time worse then with no numbing cream). The third tattoo I tried  with NO numbing cream at all !!!! There was some pain but not as bad and intense then the second tattoo when the numbing cream stop working. So, my conclusion is if you want a small tattoo it is ok. For anything longer then 30 min. I would strongly advise against any numbing cream unless you like the intensity of pain. COLD TURKEY IS BEST!!!!</li>
            <li> This product was way too small to get the full numbing affect.  It wasn&#x27;t enough for one full use &amp; therefore, not worth the money. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Was well worth it</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest most men are not purchasing numbing cream for tattoos they never got or going to get, and if they did if must be a MURAL of a tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this to see if 5% lidocaine would turn my 4% marathon cream into a SPARTAN SUPER RACE, and I didn&#x27;t get off the starting block with this cream as it didn&#x27;t numb anything accept a couple of fingers. So after waiting 45 minutes for it to take effect which it didn&#x27;t, I washed with soap and water waited an additional hour and then applied my LMX 4% Topical Cream and was numb in 20 minutes which speaks volumes for LMX 4%!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So guys if you&#x27;re looking for a cream for sexual longevity no other cream especially this one tops LMX 4%. I&#x27;ve tried most because of the business I&#x27;m and the women appreciate my performance because referrals keep coming; no pun intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with LMX 4% Topical Cream, and I will be trying LMX 5% for the hell of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you reviews think this Super Numb is great for tattoos, then you&#x27;ll be INVESTING in LMX 4% which is absolutely better.</li>
            <li> i purchased this numbing cream for micro- needling. It numbs slightly but not enough to take the pain away completely. It also takes a while to set in and the directions state to put saran wrap after applying cream.</li>
            <li> Not even what I thought it would do. Not worth the money. Sorry, I can only tell the truth.</li>
            <li> Works really fast, I love it!</li>
            <li> I finally use it for a tattoo on my hand. It did the job I will use it again.</li>
            <li> It was surprisingly small as if I could say you need 2 of them for just brezilian wax...it works well, I waxed the areas I could never even think about waxing them...but my skin lost its numbness in the middle of waxing, you have to act fast, like in an hour after you start waxing</li>
            <li> Takes less than required to use, super quick to work, very nice, very easy to use, wish it came with more instructions, or if it was toxic or not. Very useful, I still have a ton of it left.</li>
