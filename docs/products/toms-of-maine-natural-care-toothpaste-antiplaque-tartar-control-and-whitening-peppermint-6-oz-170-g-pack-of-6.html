            <li>My husband and I love this item and are very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Good tasting tooth paste.  </li>
            <li>During an overnight stay, my sister-in-law even complimented on the scent of our toothpaste, saying that it smelled really good.</li>
            <li>She tried some and loved it too.</li>
            <li>price is good, also.</li>
            <li>I also like that it is good for the environment.</li>
            <li>The texture was good.</li>
            <li>Have had good results from using it with good checkups from the dentists.  </li>
            <li>Although Tom’s does a good job on the environmental front, I’m</li>
            <li>Xylitol is so good for your enamel</li>
            <li>Besides that, I&#x27;m super happy with this product!</li>
            <li>To me, this stuff tastes awesome and if anything is more powerful and minty-fresh than I want.  </li>
            <li>it works and the taste is kind of odd.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, the peppermint flavor is nice..</li>
            <li>I do not use the fluorinated kind</li>
            <li>Its nice to know you can buy a toothpaste without sodium sacarin</li>
            <li>It is a bit strong, but I will have to adjust and scour the closeout stores for my beloved spearmint without fluoride.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want something that&#x27;s harmfully abrasive, but the old formula did an excellent job.  </li>
            <li>Great toothpaste for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>A friend told me she had to get used to it first, yet for me it was great on day 1.</li>
            <li>Once you brush your teeth with this toothpaste, you get a pleasant feeling in your mouth right away.    </li>
            <li>Most pharmacies and drug stores carry this brand of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this toothpaste out as a member of BzzAgent.com.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this brand is available in all parts of the country, because I had never heard of it before, but if you see it in your area, try it out!</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is by no means perfect, but it seems to at least be better.&lt;br /&gt;- Tube is great.  </li>
            <li>, i.e., you will be more susceptible to cavities.</li>
            <li>I had been using ProHealth for many years</li>
            <li>but I was looking for a better tooth cleaning experience.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this product.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many many types of Colgate, including a period of time when they had a naturals line with a lemon flavored toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Brushing my teeth never felt better.</li>
            <li>Good quality and fresh.</li>
            <li>And it has no flouride, which I love, and it&#x27;s not a gel, which I likewise love.    </li>
            <li>The perppermint tastes better than the spearmint to me.  </li>
            <li>It tingles my mouth more and feels more refreshing.  </li>
            <li>After using this toothpaste to brush, my teeth feel cleaner and my mouth feels more refreshed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like an aluminum-type tube</li>
            <li>love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste comes in many flavors.</li>
            <li>Nature’s Gate provides more information on sustainability than do Jason’s.</li>
            <li>I also love that they are made with xylitol.  </li>
            <li>sure,</li>
            <li>but i mostly drink water</li>
            <li>(i&#x27;ll have a soda maybe like once or twice a week at most).</li>
            <li>used to love you till this......</li>
            <li>It leaves kind of an after taste, however a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>so most of toothpaste brands were too strong and itching to me</li>
            <li>My experience and why I like it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine flouride free toothpaste for almost two years now and am glad I made the switch.  </li>
            <li>Also, it is important to note that I prefer Pepperment over Spearment Tom&#x27;s as the taste is significantly more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use to love Tom&#x27;s of Maine, but after being bought from the original founders, the product has changed in quality.</li>
            <li>Use to love the original tin/metal like tube that held the toothpaste, but it has been changed to a nondescript squeezable plastic tube that is rather sterile to the touch.</li>
            <li>sometimes too easy</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have fluoride in your toothpaste, you&#x27;ll get cavities very quickly.</li>
            <li>(My dentist even recommended me not to brush too often a day because my teeth are easy to be corroded by brushing).</li>
            <li>I love Tom&#x27;s because it makes my teeth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li>It has a good rating at [...] which is the main reason I bought it.  </li>
            <li>I bought both the spearmint and perppermint because I thought the peppermint would be too strong.  </li>
            <li>In the years since, though, more and more people have begun to believe, like we do, that nature can provide many of the health benefits we need — and that companies should minimize their environmental impact while working towards positive change in our communities.</li>
            <li>taste is fine, no  complaints from me.</li>
            <li>I am happy that I finally found the toothpaste I can use.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste is available in sizes from 1 ounce to 6 ounces.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic Toothpaste.</li>
            <li>they provide free shipping labels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li>and i had to pay to get them filled..</li>
            <li>Good toothpaste that does not destroy your teeth with fluoride.</li>
            <li>Despite having no &#x27;foaming&#x27; ingredient, the Burt&#x27;s Bees was far superior to &#x27;Tom&#x27;s Peppermint Whitening&#x27; which makes my mouth feel like I&#x27;ve been gnawing cotton.</li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning my mouth still feels fresh from the night before, which is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>It has a mild mint flavor, but not too strong.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with the natural care toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>However, this is controversial and I will not go too much in depth.  </li>
            <li>So, the amount of fluoride in toothpaste is fairly significant if you use a lot of paste, brush your teeth often, and/or tend to swallow some of it.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, I&#x27;ve not noticed a particularly &#x27;clean&#x27; feeling, nor have my teeth seemed any whiter.  </li>
            <li>Its gives you a super-fresh clean feeling in the mouth for hours.</li>
            <li>Soon more people will make the switch to more natural toothpastes like this.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that the toothpaste actually tastes good and is very refreshing.</li>
            <li>The best part is that the ingredients are much more natural than in a typical toothpaste, but the quality of our tooth care doesn&#x27;t seem to be compromised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste, and buy it in bulk for the whole family.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel super clean after using Toms of Maine.  </li>
            <li>On Amazon, you can find Peppermint, Spearmint, Fennel, Orange-Mango, Cinnamint, Wintermint, Apricot, Soothing Mint, True Mint, and Gingermint, among others.</li>
            <li>Product leaves your teeth feeling minty clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>What I like about Toms of Maine toothpaste is the clean feeling as well as the fact that there are no artificial ingredients.</li>
            <li>I feel my mouth is ten times cleaner, and am very impressed with the product overall.</li>
            <li>is the main reason i love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Calcium carbonate - Mild abrasive (Purified calcium from the</li>
            <li>I even put it on canker sores to get rid of them quickly.  </li>
            <li>thinking of switching back to Nature’s Gate (also a great company), mainly because of the chalkiness / dryness I feel after using Tom’s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t be able to stick with them with the new changes.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and fluoride-free!</li>
            <li>The toothpaste works best when it goes straight onto the brush and then the teeth, no moistening from the faucet before applying (it is very fluid, not runny but less dense than most).  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth</li>
            <li>After I heard many complaints about the taste, I was pleasantly surprised by the taste.</li>
            <li>I wake up with my mouth feeling fresh not fuzzy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;so take it for what it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>Great taste, works great, probably as efficient if not more than Crest and other generics.. and look ma!</li>
            <li>Not just right after I brush but even overnight.  </li>
            <li>The old formula was more abrasive and is possibly why it did a better job at whitening.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper at my local SAM&#x27;S Club so be sure to check there first!</li>
            <li>However, this one is mild and gentle and doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth and gum at all.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, Colgate has left Tom&#x27;s alone to manage their business according to their original principles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom</li>
            <li>My teeth are white and clean; a fantastic toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of any Tom&#x27;s of Maine product</li>
            <li>However, I do taste the fresh mint, which I really like.</li>
            <li>I was beginning to get fed up with this, and actually looked up at the top shelf in the toothpaste aisle</li>
            <li>Finally gave it a show and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>the fluoride front, the addition to fluoride to water (practiced in the US but not in most European countries) helps to reduce dental decay but also carries some risks.</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical about switching from so many years of getting bombarded with ads telling me how good</li>
            <li>The flavor and texture of the toothpaste took some getting used to, and at first I was very unsure I&#x27;d keep using it.</li>
            <li>personally  -strong whitening power, gets my teeth cleaner  and more polished than conventional toothpastes, which I didn&#x27;t at all expect    Cons (major con!)  </li>
            <li>other popular options in the category of natural toothpaste (cruelty-free, generally natural ingredients, and fluoride-free options available) are Nature’s Gate and Jason’s.</li>
            <li>A large strip of toothpaste contains around 2.25 mg of fluoride (and</li>
            <li>In addition to gastrointestinal discomfort, chronic exposure to fluoride in large amounts interferes with bone formation.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is an excellent option for those wanting to avoid fluoride, additives, artificial coloring, etc.  </li>
            <li>Someone mentioned it having an aftertaste, but I didn&#x27;t really notice that.</li>
            <li>Really.    </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>but my teeth are definitely much whiter.</li>
            <li>Like I said the way it lathers really gives an even coverage.</li>
            <li>I will keep using this product on principle and for the health of my teeth, but the taste is a real downer.  </li>
            <li>The spearmint tastes like extra free gum.  </li>
            <li>Tastes too much like baking soda.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Better than we expected and would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>and/or my habits has ever really changed</li>
            <li>Together, we&#x27;ve really started to make a difference!&amp;#34; from Tom&#x27;s of Maine website.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I find that the tooth paste does not stay on my tooth brush or my teeth as easily as the tooth paste (not natural) that I was using before.  </li>
            <li>I like that it also doesn&#x27;t have the gummy texture of most other toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought it because flouride toothpaste would irritate the sides of my lips (red skin, etc).</li>
            <li>The only downside is that, because I drink coffee a lot, I don&#x27;t see any significant effect of whitening yet.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering another huge supply for my family so we don&#x27;t run out for a long time.</li>
            <li>Though flouride free, it offers much protection against cavities as I am a twice a day brusher and have actually seen a decrease in cavities after switching.  </li>
            <li>but it can be a skin irritant at higher concentrations and has been shown to exacerbate canker sores in sensitive people.</li>
            <li>It’s worth checking out Terracycle for recycling packaging in general -</li>
            <li>The taste is subtle and so much better than all those sugary sweet tastes of the &amp;#34;big brand&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Pros:  -metal tube, which is really cool and easy to crimp  -less aftertaste than conventional toothpastes (i.e. it actually rinses out of my mouth, unlike most toothpastes where I have to wait an hour before I can eat no matter how much I rinse)  </li>
            <li>I am becoming a big fan of Tom&#x27;s in general</li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s actually doing a better job of keeping my teeth white.</li>
            <li>I ran out recently and had to use my husband&#x27;s Colgate (my former favorite).  </li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve been spoiled with REAL mint instead of artifical flavor and sweeteners, the standard brands just don&#x27;t leave your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>yet i find it interesting that i turn up with little cavities 3 months after using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the whitening action really works, although it does take time.</li>
            <li>my teeth were real sensitive after using.</li>
            <li>I did nothing out of the normal aside from change toothpastes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not packaged in the normal plastic tubes.  </li>
            <li>prefer this particular variety due to its flavor (which is sugar free) and my preference to paste vs. gel.</li>
            <li>personally the taste is just fine, but people have different tastes.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it can be found on Amazon and other web sites.</li>
            <li>I’d rather eliminate the fluoride source in my toothpaste even if I choose to live with the fluoride in my tap water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tastes like it&#x27;s actually something good for you, not like some of the \\&quot;candy\\&quot; toothpastes you see on store shelves lately.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth and gum</li>
            <li>Thank goodness there are natural choices!</li>
            <li>I prefer the Peppermint flavor, which is refreshing, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I originally switched mainly due to fear after hearing the dangers of flouride.  </li>
            <li>Terracycle offer recycling of toothpaste tubes (along with many other items such as deodorant, floss, mouthwash and toothbrushes) for people willing to collect several of them and ship them off.</li>
            <li>Once you adjust to the simple clean and minty taste of this stuff, you&#x27;ll never go back and your breathe will be all the fresher for it, too.  </li>
            <li>-lathers/foams well, for good tooth coverage  -mild on the gums, less irritating for me</li>
            <li>I instantly noticed a more polished, less grainy look on my teeth.</li>
            <li>You really need to start squeezing the toothpaste tube from the bottom because if you keep squeezing from the top and it starts to crease, it&#x27;ll be very hard to push the toothpaste up.  </li>
            <li>and I have noticed some whitening action as well.  </li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Care Toothpaste, Anti-plaque, Tartar Control &amp; Whitening, Peppermint, 6 oz (170 g)</li>
            <li>&#x27;s makes natural products.</li>
            <li>If you want the benefits of natural toothpastes, try Tom&#x27;s of Maine or even Burt&#x27;s Bees (which my dentist recommended).  </li>
            <li>Then, around 0.2 mg/kg body weight can cause gastrointestinal discomfort (i.e. 2.4 mg for a 12 kg 2 year old, or 12 mg for a 60 kg adult).</li>
            <li>I want Natural, not conglomerate......</li>
            <li>Although this brand of toothpaste is more expensive, it&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
            <li>actually - I&#x27;ve had a couple times where too much comes out, especially when you first open a new tube.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quick summary of fluoride dosage and toxicity: around 5 grams is a potentially lethal dose for an adult and 60 mg for an average 2 year old.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Seems to be less toxic than most other toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve used practically every mainstream major brand toothpaste out there.</li>
            <li>However, what I did realize was that I am probably swallowing a decent amount of flouride by not completely rinsing my mouth out every time I brush</li>
            <li>I have tried baking soda toothpastes before, and this one is even worse in the taste department than those - there is not enough of a peppermint taste or the refreshing tingle I was hoping for, tasted mostly of dirt/salt, the likely culprit being the silica in it  -more expensive than conventional pastes    </li>
            <li>It has very natural ingredients, whereas, the other toothpastes are high in sugar content.  </li>
            <li>I happen to not like gummy toothpastes in general</li>
            <li>I like Tom’s of Maine in general on account of their environmental awareness and no animal testing policy.</li>
            <li>and i generally stay away from sodas and candy.</li>
            <li>After my local discount store ran out of Burt&#x27;s Bees natural toothpaste, I decided to venture out and try the Tom&#x27;s in peppermint.  </li>
            <li>I got tired of florides, and the gels always ended up mostly in the sink.</li>
            <li>Its ridiculous how clean the natural mint makes your mouth feel.</li>
            <li>After using it for less than two years, I had a mouthful of cavities, a first for me as I am meticulous about brushing and flossing.  </li>
            <li>After I discovered Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Care Toothpaste, I could never return back to standard toothpaste.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll never go back to the major brands after using Tom&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>i started using this toothpaste back in early February and my recent trip to the dentist (mid April)</li>
            <li>I think we (involuntarily) get enough fluoride in our water – supplementing this with the even more fluoride in toothpaste is unnecessary in my view, considering that there are several concerns regarding its use.</li>
            <li>The consistency is slightly runny compared to my last toothpaste but it certainly seems to do the job.</li>
            <li>Also, my coffee tastes normal when I drink it, as opposed to tasting all funky after using other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>The taste is a bit different from Colgate or Crest: it is intensely minty and not sweet at all, but I am starting to like it.  </li>
            <li>and it really must cut the acid in my mouth because I do not grown plaque when I&#x27;m using it regularly and the dentist always comments on how little tartar I have built up on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Like I said earlier, I mix a small amount with baking soda when I brush - this stuff very much</li>
            <li>Buying in bulk is a good idea when it is an item that you know you won&#x27;t have problems using prior to it going bad.</li>
            <li>Since making the switch, I had have experienced a dramatic decrease in canker sores likely caused by harsh ingredients in typical Colgate and Crest toothpaste.  </li>

            <li> Good tasting tooth paste.  </li>
            <li> During an overnight stay, my sister-in-law even complimented on the scent of our toothpaste, saying that it smelled really good.</li>
            <li> She tried some and loved it too.</li>
            <li> price is good, also.</li>

            <li> Xylitol is so good for your enamel</li>
            <li> Besides that, I&#x27;m super happy with this product!</li>
            <li> To me, this stuff tastes awesome and if anything is more powerful and minty-fresh than I want.  </li>
            <li> it works and the taste is kind of odd.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , the peppermint flavor is nice..</li>
            <li> I do not use the fluorinated kind</li>
            <li> Its nice to know you can buy a toothpaste without sodium sacarin</li>
            <li> It is a bit strong, but I will have to adjust and scour the closeout stores for my beloved spearmint without fluoride.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want something that&#x27;s harmfully abrasive, but the old formula did an excellent job.  </li>
            <li> Great toothpaste for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> A friend told me she had to get used to it first, yet for me it was great on day 1.</li>
            <li> Once you brush your teeth with this toothpaste, you get a pleasant feeling in your mouth right away.    </li>
            <li> Most pharmacies and drug stores carry this brand of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this toothpaste out as a member of BzzAgent.com.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this brand is available in all parts of the country, because I had never heard of it before, but if you see it in your area, try it out!</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is by no means perfect, but it seems to at least be better.&lt;br /&gt;- Tube is great.  </li>
            <li> , i.e., you will be more susceptible to cavities.</li>
            <li> I had been using ProHealth for many years</li>
            <li> but I was looking for a better tooth cleaning experience.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this product.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many many types of Colgate, including a period of time when they had a naturals line with a lemon flavored toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Brushing my teeth never felt better.</li>
            <li> Good quality and fresh.</li>
            <li> And it has no flouride, which I love, and it&#x27;s not a gel, which I likewise love.    </li>
            <li> The perppermint tastes better than the spearmint to me.  </li>
            <li> It tingles my mouth more and feels more refreshing.  </li>
            <li> After using this toothpaste to brush, my teeth feel cleaner and my mouth feels more refreshed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like an aluminum-type tube</li>
            <li> love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> The toothpaste comes in many flavors.</li>
            <li> Nature’s Gate provides more information on sustainability than do Jason’s.</li>
            <li> I also love that they are made with xylitol.  </li>
            <li> sure,</li>
            <li> but i mostly drink water</li>
            <li> (i&#x27;ll have a soda maybe like once or twice a week at most).</li>
            <li> used to love you till this......</li>
            <li> It leaves kind of an after taste, however a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> so most of toothpaste brands were too strong and itching to me</li>
            <li> My experience and why I like it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine flouride free toothpaste for almost two years now and am glad I made the switch.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is important to note that I prefer Pepperment over Spearment Tom&#x27;s as the taste is significantly more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use to love Tom&#x27;s of Maine, but after being bought from the original founders, the product has changed in quality.</li>
            <li> Use to love the original tin/metal like tube that held the toothpaste, but it has been changed to a nondescript squeezable plastic tube that is rather sterile to the touch.</li>
            <li> sometimes too easy</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have fluoride in your toothpaste, you&#x27;ll get cavities very quickly.</li>
            <li> (My dentist even recommended me not to brush too often a day because my teeth are easy to be corroded by brushing).</li>
            <li> I love Tom&#x27;s because it makes my teeth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li> It has a good rating at [...] which is the main reason I bought it.  </li>
            <li> I bought both the spearmint and perppermint because I thought the peppermint would be too strong.  </li>
            <li> In the years since, though, more and more people have begun to believe, like we do, that nature can provide many of the health benefits we need — and that companies should minimize their environmental impact while working towards positive change in our communities.</li>
            <li> taste is fine, no  complaints from me.</li>
            <li> I am happy that I finally found the toothpaste I can use.</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is available in sizes from 1 ounce to 6 ounces.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fantastic Toothpaste.</li>
            <li> they provide free shipping labels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li> and i had to pay to get them filled..</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste that does not destroy your teeth with fluoride.</li>
            <li> Despite having no &#x27;foaming&#x27; ingredient, the Burt&#x27;s Bees was far superior to &#x27;Tom&#x27;s Peppermint Whitening&#x27; which makes my mouth feel like I&#x27;ve been gnawing cotton.</li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning my mouth still feels fresh from the night before, which is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> It has a mild mint flavor, but not too strong.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased with the natural care toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> However, this is controversial and I will not go too much in depth.  </li>
            <li> So, the amount of fluoride in toothpaste is fairly significant if you use a lot of paste, brush your teeth often, and/or tend to swallow some of it.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I&#x27;ve not noticed a particularly &#x27;clean&#x27; feeling, nor have my teeth seemed any whiter.  </li>
            <li> Its gives you a super-fresh clean feeling in the mouth for hours.</li>
            <li> Soon more people will make the switch to more natural toothpastes like this.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that the toothpaste actually tastes good and is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> The best part is that the ingredients are much more natural than in a typical toothpaste, but the quality of our tooth care doesn&#x27;t seem to be compromised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste, and buy it in bulk for the whole family.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel super clean after using Toms of Maine.  </li>
            <li> On Amazon, you can find Peppermint, Spearmint, Fennel, Orange-Mango, Cinnamint, Wintermint, Apricot, Soothing Mint, True Mint, and Gingermint, among others.</li>
            <li> Product leaves your teeth feeling minty clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> What I like about Toms of Maine toothpaste is the clean feeling as well as the fact that there are no artificial ingredients.</li>
            <li> I feel my mouth is ten times cleaner, and am very impressed with the product overall.</li>
            <li> is the main reason i love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Calcium carbonate - Mild abrasive (Purified calcium from the</li>
            <li> I even put it on canker sores to get rid of them quickly.  </li>
            <li> thinking of switching back to Nature’s Gate (also a great company), mainly because of the chalkiness / dryness I feel after using Tom’s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t be able to stick with them with the new changes.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and fluoride-free!</li>
            <li> The toothpaste works best when it goes straight onto the brush and then the teeth, no moistening from the faucet before applying (it is very fluid, not runny but less dense than most).  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth</li>
            <li> After I heard many complaints about the taste, I was pleasantly surprised by the taste.</li>
            <li> I wake up with my mouth feeling fresh not fuzzy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;so take it for what it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> Great taste, works great, probably as efficient if not more than Crest and other generics.. and look ma!</li>
            <li> Not just right after I brush but even overnight.  </li>
            <li> The old formula was more abrasive and is possibly why it did a better job at whitening.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper at my local SAM&#x27;S Club so be sure to check there first!</li>
            <li> However, this one is mild and gentle and doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth and gum at all.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, Colgate has left Tom&#x27;s alone to manage their business according to their original principles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom</li>
            <li> My teeth are white and clean; a fantastic toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of any Tom&#x27;s of Maine product</li>
            <li> However, I do taste the fresh mint, which I really like.</li>
            <li> I was beginning to get fed up with this, and actually looked up at the top shelf in the toothpaste aisle</li>
            <li> Finally gave it a show and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> the fluoride front, the addition to fluoride to water (practiced in the US but not in most European countries) helps to reduce dental decay but also carries some risks.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about switching from so many years of getting bombarded with ads telling me how good</li>
            <li> The flavor and texture of the toothpaste took some getting used to, and at first I was very unsure I&#x27;d keep using it.</li>
            <li> personally  -strong whitening power, gets my teeth cleaner  and more polished than conventional toothpastes, which I didn&#x27;t at all expect    Cons (major con!)  </li>
            <li> other popular options in the category of natural toothpaste (cruelty-free, generally natural ingredients, and fluoride-free options available) are Nature’s Gate and Jason’s.</li>
            <li> A large strip of toothpaste contains around 2.25 mg of fluoride (and</li>
            <li> In addition to gastrointestinal discomfort, chronic exposure to fluoride in large amounts interferes with bone formation.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is an excellent option for those wanting to avoid fluoride, additives, artificial coloring, etc.  </li>
            <li> Someone mentioned it having an aftertaste, but I didn&#x27;t really notice that.</li>
            <li> Really.    </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> but my teeth are definitely much whiter.</li>
            <li> Like I said the way it lathers really gives an even coverage.</li>
            <li> I will keep using this product on principle and for the health of my teeth, but the taste is a real downer.  </li>
            <li> The spearmint tastes like extra free gum.  </li>
            <li> Tastes too much like baking soda.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Better than we expected and would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> and/or my habits has ever really changed</li>
            <li> Together, we&#x27;ve really started to make a difference!&amp;#34; from Tom&#x27;s of Maine website.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I find that the tooth paste does not stay on my tooth brush or my teeth as easily as the tooth paste (not natural) that I was using before.  </li>
            <li> I like that it also doesn&#x27;t have the gummy texture of most other toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought it because flouride toothpaste would irritate the sides of my lips (red skin, etc).</li>
            <li> The only downside is that, because I drink coffee a lot, I don&#x27;t see any significant effect of whitening yet.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering another huge supply for my family so we don&#x27;t run out for a long time.</li>
            <li> Though flouride free, it offers much protection against cavities as I am a twice a day brusher and have actually seen a decrease in cavities after switching.  </li>
            <li> but it can be a skin irritant at higher concentrations and has been shown to exacerbate canker sores in sensitive people.</li>
            <li> It’s worth checking out Terracycle for recycling packaging in general -</li>
            <li> The taste is subtle and so much better than all those sugary sweet tastes of the &amp;#34;big brand&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Pros:  -metal tube, which is really cool and easy to crimp  -less aftertaste than conventional toothpastes (i.e. it actually rinses out of my mouth, unlike most toothpastes where I have to wait an hour before I can eat no matter how much I rinse)  </li>
            <li> I am becoming a big fan of Tom&#x27;s in general</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s actually doing a better job of keeping my teeth white.</li>
            <li> I ran out recently and had to use my husband&#x27;s Colgate (my former favorite).  </li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve been spoiled with REAL mint instead of artifical flavor and sweeteners, the standard brands just don&#x27;t leave your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> yet i find it interesting that i turn up with little cavities 3 months after using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the whitening action really works, although it does take time.</li>
            <li> my teeth were real sensitive after using.</li>
            <li> I did nothing out of the normal aside from change toothpastes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not packaged in the normal plastic tubes.  </li>
            <li> prefer this particular variety due to its flavor (which is sugar free) and my preference to paste vs. gel.</li>
            <li> personally the taste is just fine, but people have different tastes.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it can be found on Amazon and other web sites.</li>
            <li> I’d rather eliminate the fluoride source in my toothpaste even if I choose to live with the fluoride in my tap water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tastes like it&#x27;s actually something good for you, not like some of the \\&quot;candy\\&quot; toothpastes you see on store shelves lately.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and gum</li>
            <li> Thank goodness there are natural choices!</li>
            <li> I prefer the Peppermint flavor, which is refreshing, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I originally switched mainly due to fear after hearing the dangers of flouride.  </li>
            <li> Terracycle offer recycling of toothpaste tubes (along with many other items such as deodorant, floss, mouthwash and toothbrushes) for people willing to collect several of them and ship them off.</li>
            <li> Once you adjust to the simple clean and minty taste of this stuff, you&#x27;ll never go back and your breathe will be all the fresher for it, too.  </li>
            <li> -lathers/foams well, for good tooth coverage  -mild on the gums, less irritating for me</li>
            <li> I instantly noticed a more polished, less grainy look on my teeth.</li>
            <li> You really need to start squeezing the toothpaste tube from the bottom because if you keep squeezing from the top and it starts to crease, it&#x27;ll be very hard to push the toothpaste up.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed some whitening action as well.  </li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Care Toothpaste, Anti-plaque, Tartar Control &amp; Whitening, Peppermint, 6 oz (170 g)</li>
            <li> &#x27;s makes natural products.</li>
            <li> If you want the benefits of natural toothpastes, try Tom&#x27;s of Maine or even Burt&#x27;s Bees (which my dentist recommended).  </li>
            <li> Then, around 0.2 mg/kg body weight can cause gastrointestinal discomfort (i.e. 2.4 mg for a 12 kg 2 year old, or 12 mg for a 60 kg adult).</li>
            <li> I want Natural, not conglomerate......</li>
            <li> Although this brand of toothpaste is more expensive, it&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
            <li> actually - I&#x27;ve had a couple times where too much comes out, especially when you first open a new tube.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quick summary of fluoride dosage and toxicity: around 5 grams is a potentially lethal dose for an adult and 60 mg for an average 2 year old.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Seems to be less toxic than most other toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve used practically every mainstream major brand toothpaste out there.</li>
            <li> However, what I did realize was that I am probably swallowing a decent amount of flouride by not completely rinsing my mouth out every time I brush</li>
            <li> I have tried baking soda toothpastes before, and this one is even worse in the taste department than those - there is not enough of a peppermint taste or the refreshing tingle I was hoping for, tasted mostly of dirt/salt, the likely culprit being the silica in it  -more expensive than conventional pastes    </li>
            <li> It has very natural ingredients, whereas, the other toothpastes are high in sugar content.  </li>
            <li> I happen to not like gummy toothpastes in general</li>
            <li> I like Tom’s of Maine in general on account of their environmental awareness and no animal testing policy.</li>
            <li> and i generally stay away from sodas and candy.</li>
            <li> After my local discount store ran out of Burt&#x27;s Bees natural toothpaste, I decided to venture out and try the Tom&#x27;s in peppermint.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of florides, and the gels always ended up mostly in the sink.</li>
            <li> Its ridiculous how clean the natural mint makes your mouth feel.</li>
            <li> After using it for less than two years, I had a mouthful of cavities, a first for me as I am meticulous about brushing and flossing.  </li>
            <li> After I discovered Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Care Toothpaste, I could never return back to standard toothpaste.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never go back to the major brands after using Tom&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> i started using this toothpaste back in early February and my recent trip to the dentist (mid April)</li>
            <li> I think we (involuntarily) get enough fluoride in our water – supplementing this with the even more fluoride in toothpaste is unnecessary in my view, considering that there are several concerns regarding its use.</li>
            <li> The consistency is slightly runny compared to my last toothpaste but it certainly seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> Also, my coffee tastes normal when I drink it, as opposed to tasting all funky after using other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> The taste is a bit different from Colgate or Crest: it is intensely minty and not sweet at all, but I am starting to like it.  </li>
            <li> and it really must cut the acid in my mouth because I do not grown plaque when I&#x27;m using it regularly and the dentist always comments on how little tartar I have built up on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Like I said earlier, I mix a small amount with baking soda when I brush - this stuff very much</li>
            <li> Buying in bulk is a good idea when it is an item that you know you won&#x27;t have problems using prior to it going bad.</li>
            <li> Since making the switch, I had have experienced a dramatic decrease in canker sores likely caused by harsh ingredients in typical Colgate and Crest toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I really like to brush my teeth with toothpaste (I usually mix baking soda with a very small amount of paste to minimize the amount of toothpaste I use), but most of the major brand ones out there are full of artificial sweeteners and fluoride and all sorts of other stuff.  </li>
            <li> If only it could taste a bit better which I understand is probably due to its natural ingredients and lack of artificial sweeteners.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad tasting, not great either.</li>
            <li> This is the old metal tube that stays compressed once there is less content in the tube.  </li>
            <li> So far I have tried about maybe a half dozen brands.  </li>
            <li> do not exactly live in a wilderness area, but my local stores no longer carry Tom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> If combined with flossing (as I only recently have started doing), you will almost certainly not get any cavities.  </li>
            <li> but actually you can recycle empty containers from any company.</li>
            <li> I like both companies and have used Nature’s Gate toothpaste for a long time.</li>
            <li> The 6-pack lasts us a long time!</li>
            <li> It now has the same gummy texture of other toothpastes .  </li>
            <li> I had been going back and forth between Crest and Colgate, and noticed little whitening, and with Crest pro clinic, pro health and 3D white</li>
            <li> While I like the idea of using less plastic, with the metal tube it is difficult to really get all of the toothpaste out, and sometimes if you bend or squeeze the tube too much it can crack.</li>
            <li> Much to my dismay, my breath actually seems WORSE after brushing</li>
            <li> Tom’s says: “When used in our toothpaste, SLS has limited contact with the gums and is then rinsed out.</li>
            <li> SLS is not naturally occurring – it’s made from fatty acids such as those found in coconut oil.</li>
            <li> it gets hard to push out that last amount of toothpaste from the container, but it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive, but it&#x27;s the only natural toothpaste I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a toothpaste free of fluoride and and artificial sweeteners when I decided to try this.</li>
            <li> It is quite expensive, but since I&#x27;m the only one in my family that uses it, it will take me a while to get through the whole tube.</li>
            <li> They also do a lot of internal recycling, use post-consumer cardboard for packaging and waste or vegetable-based inks for printing.</li>
            <li> , overall I’ll give the Tom’s of Maine Antiplaque and Whitening toothpaste 4/5 goldstars for quality of the product and 5/5 “green” stars based on the social-ethical-environmental aspects of producing it.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;When we first started out, this brand-new idea of natural products and sustainable companies seemed a little crazy to some.</li>
            <li> If a child were to accidentally swallow less than half a tube of toothpaste (such as Colgate Kids), it could be fatal.</li>
            <li> Seems to work just as well as other toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> When I discovered Tom&#x27;s peppermint toothpaste, I never want to go back to my usual Crest or Colgate ever again.  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews and some people didn&#x27;t like the taste</li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner with shorter brushing, and like other reviewers noted the aftertaste doesn&#x27;t linger and interfere with other foods as much as conventional toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Not worth purchasing online unless you&#x27;re buying in bulk.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is about the tube.</li>
            <li> The Burt&#x27;s Bees had no sodium laurel sulfate, which kept sores down to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> Not only did they not feel immediately as clean as with Tom&#x27;s, the next morning they felt disgusting.  </li>
            <li> I could no longer use the heavily sweetened toothpastes from Colgate and the other makers.  </li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine makes my mouth feel SO clean and it lasts for hours, without the fake, minty filmy taste that other toothpastes leave behind.</li>
            <li> You may have to get used to the bland taste and watery texture, but i think the flavor is acceptable.  </li>
            <li> If they changed their formulation by removing the SDS and made it less chalky</li>
            <li> If they changed their formulation by removing the SDS and made it less chalky then it might get 5 gold stars.</li>
            <li> Much to my disappointment, the Tom&#x27;s has sodium laurel sulfate, the active ingredient responsible for the &#x27;foaming&#x27; of toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> The taste does take a little getting used to, but now that I&#x27;m used to it</li>
            <li> It has been a few weeks</li>
            <li> So, I had to get the yearly supply of expensive, imported natural toothpaste from my parents when I visited them.</li>
            <li> The “goodness report” on their website expansively covers their goals for energy and water use, recycling and waste generation, ingredients and community impact.</li>
            <li> then it might get 5 gold stars.stars for quality of the product and 5/5 “green” stars based on the social-ethical-environmental aspects of producing it.</li>
            <li> However, now I’ve started using less toothpaste and also letting it hydrate/foam a little in my mouth for a minute or two before I do any serious brushing and</li>
            <li> I \\&quot;converted\\&quot; to this all natural toothpaste because I have sensitivities to artificial sweeteners, which seem to be in everything these days.</li>
            <li> Since my initial review I sadly have to downgrade my rating some.  </li>
            <li> The only con of the product is the weird baking soda and licorice taste.</li>
            <li> I decided no more sensitivity, and no more fluoride.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s is a small company, employing fewer than two hundred people.</li>
            <li> (usually I just swish/spit once).  </li>
            <li> and I usually had to drink or rinse with a lot of water after brushing my teeth to get rid of the chalkiness.</li>
            <li> a truly pea-sized amount contains 0.3 mg) while a liter of municipal tap water usually contains 1 mg.</li>
            <li> Years ago I discovered some negative facts about fluorides effects on health.</li>
            <li> are slowly disappearing.</li>
            <li> they tell me i have 3 very small cavities</li>
            <li> I received a product sample from BzzAgent , I doubt if I would have ever purchased the product without trying it being addicted to Crest.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to believe that any toothpaste could make morning breath worse, but this product accomplishes that with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> Fail.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m left with a terrible taste in my mouth!  </li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
            <li> I like knowing that I am using tooth paste that does not have aluminum or other nasty ingredients.  </li>
            <li> (look at their deodorants also if you don&#x27;t like smearing crazy chemicals under your arms).  </li>
            <li> I used Tom&#x27;s for a few months and tried to make myself get over the awful taste.</li>
            <li> Again though, the taste is something to get tolerable too, just use really cold water to offset it though.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste contains no sugar, sweeteners, or artificial flavoring.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what everyones talking about with the taste being bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Of all those the Tom&#x27;s of Maine stands out as the worst taste.  </li>
            <li> I have used &#x27;baking soda&#x27; tooth paste for 20 years which my friends unanimously agree is the worst tasting tooth paste there is.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good tasting tooth paste.  I find that the tooth paste does not stay on my tooth brush or my teeth as easily as the tooth paste (not natural) that I was using before.  I like knowing that I am using tooth paste that does not have aluminum or other nasty ingredients.  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Most pharmacies and drug stores carry this brand of toothpaste. Not worth purchasing online unless you&#x27;re buying in bulk. Then again you can do the same at your local BJs. Love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and fluoride-free!</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s produces a great product that helps to keep my teeth in good repair  WITHOUT POISONING ME WITH FLUORIDE. The taste is subtle and so much better than all those sugary sweet tastes of the &amp;#34;big brand&amp;#34; products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Tom&#x27;s for me forever.</li>
            <li> My family and I have been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste for years. We were concerned about a potential dip in quality and ingredients when Colgate purchased them, but we have not seen any detriment to this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this particular variety due to its flavor (which is sugar free) and my preference to paste vs. gel. During an overnight stay, my sister-in-law even complimented on the scent of our toothpaste, saying that it smelled really good. She tried some and loved it too. The best part is that the ingredients are much more natural than in a typical toothpaste, but the quality of our tooth care doesn&#x27;t seem to be compromised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is good, also. Buying in bulk is a good idea when it is an item that you know you won&#x27;t have problems using prior to it going bad. The 6-pack lasts us a long time!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is an excellent option for those wanting to avoid fluoride, additives, artificial coloring, etc.  The taste is a bit different from Colgate or Crest: it is intensely minty and not sweet at all, but I am starting to like it.  My teeth feel cleaner with shorter brushing, and like other reviewers noted the aftertaste doesn&#x27;t linger and interfere with other foods as much as conventional toothpaste.  It has been a few weeks and I have noticed some whitening action as well.  The toothpaste works best when it goes straight onto the brush and then the teeth, no moistening from the faucet before applying (it is very fluid, not runny but less dense than most).  The metal tube could be improved, but that is about it. I am becoming a big fan of Tom&#x27;s in general (look at their deodorants also if you don&#x27;t like smearing crazy chemicals under your arms).  Thank goodness there are natural choices!</li>
            <li> I was able to try this toothpaste out as a member of BzzAgent.com. It has a mild mint flavor, but not too strong. Someone mentioned it having an aftertaste, but I didn&#x27;t really notice that. I also like that it is good for the environment. I don&#x27;t know if this brand is available in all parts of the country, because I had never heard of it before, but if you see it in your area, try it out!</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Seems to be less toxic than most other toothpaste.  I really like to brush my teeth with toothpaste (I usually mix baking soda with a very small amount of paste to minimize the amount of toothpaste I use), but most of the major brand ones out there are full of artificial sweeteners and fluoride and all sorts of other stuff.  This one is by no means perfect, but it seems to at least be better.&lt;br /&gt;- Tube is great.  Some brands have switched to plastic tubes and pop caps... Fail.  This is the old metal tube that stays compressed once there is less content in the tube.  Makes for super-easy squeezing.. sometimes too easy actually - I&#x27;ve had a couple times where too much comes out, especially when you first open a new tube.&lt;br /&gt;- Seems to work just as well as other toothpastes.  I&#x27;ve not noticed a difference when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t know what everyones talking about with the taste being bad.  To me, this stuff tastes awesome and if anything is more powerful and minty-fresh than I want.  Like I said earlier, I mix a small amount with baking soda when I brush - this stuff very much overpowers the baking soda and then some.  Makes my mouth tingly.</li>
            <li> it works and the taste is kind of odd.&lt;br /&gt;But I like it since no sugar or F is added</li>
            <li> I used Tom&#x27;s for a few months and tried to make myself get over the awful taste. However, I noticed that I had staining on my back tooth and decided to stop. I have always had great dental health and I&#x27;ve never had a cavity. Well, that was until I went to the dentist after using this toothpaste. I did nothing out of the normal aside from change toothpastes. I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine for a couple of years now. I \\&quot;converted\\&quot; to this all natural toothpaste because I have sensitivities to artificial sweeteners, which seem to be in everything these days. The flavor and texture of the toothpaste took some getting used to, and at first I was very unsure I&#x27;d keep using it. But I&#x27;ve found that now when I try a regular toothpaste like Crest or something, my mouth feels so gross. Tom&#x27;s of Maine makes my mouth feel SO clean and it lasts for hours, without the fake, minty filmy taste that other toothpastes leave behind. Also, my coffee tastes normal when I drink it, as opposed to tasting all funky after using other toothpastes. My teeth are white and clean; a fantastic toothpaste. The only complaint I have is about the tube. While I like the idea of using less plastic, with the metal tube it is difficult to really get all of the toothpaste out, and sometimes if you bend or squeeze the tube too much it can crack. It&#x27;s a little expensive, but it&#x27;s the only natural toothpaste I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that the toothpaste actually tastes good and is very refreshing. Great toothpaste for a reasonable price! The consistency is slightly runny compared to my last toothpaste but it certainly seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> Best tooth paste on Earth. Really.    Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Care Toothpaste, Anti-plaque, Tartar Control &amp; Whitening, Peppermint, 6 oz (170 g) (Pack of 6)</li>
            <li> Years ago I discovered some negative facts about fluorides effects on health. A very experienced and knowledgeable dentist also told me that for my teeth, fluoride toothpaste is prohibited. After I discovered Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Care Toothpaste, I could never return back to standard toothpaste. Once you brush your teeth with this toothpaste, you get a pleasant feeling in your mouth right away.    Good toothpaste that does not destroy your teeth with fluoride.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. It even heals skin rashes. You know how you ask questions in your mind, like when looking at yourself in the mirror, and you get the inkling of an answer. Well, that&#x27;s what happened to me. I had a skin rash that kept itching and spreading, like poison ivy infection almost, and nothing would make it stop. I asked in my mind what I could use to heal it and it came to me to use my tooth paste. It worked. And it is great for my teeth and breath as well.</li>
            <li> All you&#x27;ll taste is the mint; no sugary, saccarin aftertaste with this product; been buying it from Amazon at quite a savings over local grocery and drug chains. The big BUT here is that some of the Tom&#x27;s have NO Fluoride, i.e., you will be more susceptible to cavities.</li>
            <li> After my local discount store ran out of Burt&#x27;s Bees natural toothpaste, I decided to venture out and try the Tom&#x27;s in peppermint.  Much to my disappointment, the Tom&#x27;s has sodium laurel sulfate, the active ingredient responsible for the &#x27;foaming&#x27; of toothpaste.  My issue with this is that this ingredient aggravates the tissues of my mouth, causing canker sores.  The Burt&#x27;s Bees had no sodium laurel sulfate, which kept sores down to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;  Furthermore, I&#x27;ve not noticed a particularly &#x27;clean&#x27; feeling, nor have my teeth seemed any whiter.  Much to my dismay, my breath actually seems WORSE after brushing and I&#x27;m left with a terrible taste in my mouth!  It&#x27;s difficult to believe that any toothpaste could make morning breath worse, but this product accomplishes that with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;  All in all, I can&#x27;t wait until my Burt&#x27;s Bees comes back into the store.  Despite having no &#x27;foaming&#x27; ingredient, the Burt&#x27;s Bees was far superior to &#x27;Tom&#x27;s Peppermint Whitening&#x27; which makes my mouth feel like I&#x27;ve been gnawing cotton.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a toothpaste free of fluoride and and artificial sweeteners when I decided to try this. The taste does take a little getting used to, but now that I&#x27;m used to it I really like it. Its gives you a super-fresh clean feeling in the mouth for hours. Its ridiculous how clean the natural mint makes your mouth feel. When I wake up in the morning my mouth still feels fresh from the night before, which is pretty amazing. And the whitening action really works, although it does take time. I&#x27;ve noticed some tea stains I had on the back of my front teeth are slowly disappearing. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I cannot use fluoride toothpaste - so, I choose Tom&#x27;s. It is everything one would want in a toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The only quality of life issue as stated numerous times already is the taste, or the lack of. It is quite expensive, but since I&#x27;m the only one in my family that uses it, it will take me a while to get through the whole tube. As for it&#x27;s whitening capabilities, I only recently got the stuff, though my teeth are not as white as I would like, so hopefully I&#x27;ll notice a difference in a couple of weeks. Again though, the taste is something to get tolerable too, just use really cold water to offset it though.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of any Tom&#x27;s of Maine product and I&#x27;m very pleased with the natural care toothpaste.  Product leaves your teeth feeling minty clean and fresh.  I like that it also doesn&#x27;t have the gummy texture of most other toothpastes.  I haven&#x27;t been for my 6 month dental checkup yet so the verdict is still out on the tartar control but my teeth are definitely much whiter. All without any toxic chemicals!  Update: 9/6/2012:  Since my initial review I sadly have to downgrade my rating some.  Tom&#x27;s of Maine is now affiliated with Colgate-Palmolive and has changed the formula of the toothpaste some.  It now has the same gummy texture of other toothpastes .  I have also noticed that it doesn&#x27;t whiten as well.  The old formula was more abrasive and is possibly why it did a better job at whitening.  I don&#x27;t want something that&#x27;s harmfully abrasive, but the old formula did an excellent job.  Anyway, in all fairness to Tom&#x27;s of Maine and for those keeping score, it still ranks a &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; on the EWG ratings scale. I happen to not like gummy toothpastes in general so I won&#x27;t be able to stick with them with the new changes.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste, and buy it in bulk for the whole family.  It&#x27;s cheaper at my local SAM&#x27;S Club so be sure to check there first!</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of TOM, especially the spearmint flavor without fluoride. I  recently started my son on the same brand only to have found that the non fluoride only comes in peppermint. It is a bit strong, but I will have to adjust and scour the closeout stores for my beloved spearmint without fluoride.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is awesome. I originally bought it because flouride toothpaste would irritate the sides of my lips (red skin, etc). I believe it&#x27;s actually doing a better job of keeping my teeth white. The only downside of this toothpaste is the aluminum-like container..it gets hard to push out that last amount of toothpaste from the container, but it&#x27;s no big deal. Definitely worth buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the peppermint flavor is nice..personally the taste is just fine, but people have different tastes. A friend told me she had to get used to it first, yet for me it was great on day 1.</li>
            <li> What I like about Toms of Maine toothpaste is the clean feeling as well as the fact that there are no artificial ingredients. I received a product sample from BzzAgent , I doubt if I would have ever purchased the product without trying it being addicted to Crest. My teeth feel super clean after using Toms of Maine.  The only con of the product is the weird baking soda and licorice taste. If only it could taste a bit better which I understand is probably due to its natural ingredients and lack of artificial sweeteners.</li>
            <li> I had been using ProHealth for many years but I was looking for a better tooth cleaning experience. I read the reviews and did my research. I hesitantly decided to buy this one. After I heard many complaints about the taste, I was pleasantly surprised by the taste. I have not tasted the baking soda at all. However, I do taste the fresh mint, which I really like. And after just a couple of weeks, I noticed my teeth and my boyfriend&#x27;s teeth become a lot whiter. I didn&#x27;t expect that. I am really pleased with this product.    Update:   I noticed that this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t have any fluoride in it. There are a couple things you need out of a toothpaste. Fluoride is one of them. If you don&#x27;t have fluoride in your toothpaste, you&#x27;ll get cavities very quickly.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve used practically every mainstream major brand toothpaste out there. Aim, Aquafresh, Colgate, and Crest. I&#x27;ve used many many types of Colgate, including a period of time when they had a naturals line with a lemon flavored toothpaste. I&#x27;ve even used the \\&quot;herbal\\&quot; ones. I got tired of florides, and the gels always ended up mostly in the sink. I had been going back and forth between Crest and Colgate, and noticed little whitening, and with Crest pro clinic, pro health and 3D white my teeth were real sensitive after using. I was beginning to get fed up with this, and actually looked up at the top shelf in the toothpaste aisle and I saw Tom&#x27;s. I decided no more sensitivity, and no more fluoride. I bought this at Wal-Mart for 4.50 for a 6 oz tube. Brushing my teeth never felt better. I was actually suprised at how well it foamed up. The texture was good. It&#x27;s not bad tasting, not great either. It leaves kind of an after taste, however a clean feeling. I instantly noticed a more polished, less grainy look on my teeth. Like I said the way it lathers really gives an even coverage. I feel my mouth is ten times cleaner, and am very impressed with the product overall.</li>
            <li> Good quality and fresh.</li>
            <li> I bought 6 tubes of this at Amazon, so I&#x27;m committed to it.  It has a good rating at [...] which is the main reason I bought it.  And it has no flouride, which I love, and it&#x27;s not a gel, which I likewise love.    Here are my findings:    Pros:  -metal tube, which is really cool and easy to crimp  -less aftertaste than conventional toothpastes (i.e. it actually rinses out of my mouth, unlike most toothpastes where I have to wait an hour before I can eat no matter how much I rinse)  -lathers/foams well, for good tooth coverage  -mild on the gums, less irritating for me personally  -strong whitening power, gets my teeth cleaner  and more polished than conventional toothpastes, which I didn&#x27;t at all expect    Cons (major con!)  -what is with the taste?  I have tried baking soda toothpastes before, and this one is even worse in the taste department than those - there is not enough of a peppermint taste or the refreshing tingle I was hoping for, tasted mostly of dirt/salt, the likely culprit being the silica in it  -more expensive than conventional pastes    I will keep using this product on principle and for the health of my teeth, but the taste is a real downer.  Otherwise, a great product.</li>
            <li> When I discovered Tom&#x27;s peppermint toothpaste, I never want to go back to my usual Crest or Colgate ever again.  Although this brand of toothpaste is more expensive, it&#x27;s worth the price.  It has very natural ingredients, whereas, the other toothpastes are high in sugar content.  I bought both the spearmint and perppermint because I thought the peppermint would be too strong.  The perppermint tastes better than the spearmint to me.  It tingles my mouth more and feels more refreshing.  The spearmint tastes like extra free gum.  After using this toothpaste to brush, my teeth feel cleaner and my mouth feels more refreshed.  The dental hygenist also noticed a great improvement on my teeth since the switch.  The only thing that I would change about this is the packaging.  You really need to start squeezing the toothpaste tube from the bottom because if you keep squeezing from the top and it starts to crease, it&#x27;ll be very hard to push the toothpaste up.  It&#x27;s not packaged in the normal plastic tubes.  It&#x27;s more like an aluminum-type tube (imagine how aluminum foil creases).  Besides that, I&#x27;m super happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I am happy that I finally found the toothpaste I can use. I have very sensitive teeth and gum so most of toothpaste brands were too strong and itching to me (My dentist even recommended me not to brush too often a day because my teeth are easy to be corroded by brushing). So, I had to get the yearly supply of expensive, imported natural toothpaste from my parents when I visited them. However, this one is mild and gentle and doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth and gum at all. I read other reviews and some people didn&#x27;t like the taste but I have no problem with the taste.     The only downside is that, because I drink coffee a lot, I don&#x27;t see any significant effect of whitening yet.</li>
            <li> I could no longer use the heavily sweetened toothpastes from Colgate and the other makers.  Once you adjust to the simple clean and minty taste of this stuff, you&#x27;ll never go back and your breathe will be all the fresher for it, too.  Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Tastes too much like baking soda. I ordered the wrong Tom&#x27;s of Maine. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.  it has no flouride is the main reason i love it. taste is fine, no  complaints from me.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is poison. There is carrageenan in it</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.  Tastes like it&#x27;s actually something good for you, not like some of the \\&quot;candy\\&quot; toothpastes you see on store shelves lately.  Have had good results from using it with good checkups from the dentists.  And my teeth look great!!  I was a bit skeptical about switching from so many years of getting bombarded with ads telling me how good this brand or that brand is.  Never have seen an ad for Tom&#x27;s, just had recommendations from friends.  Finally gave it a show and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s is a small company, employing fewer than two hundred people. It was founded in 1970 and then purchased by Colgate in 2006. Fortunately, Colgate has left Tom&#x27;s alone to manage their business according to their original principles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&#x27;s makes natural products. The toothpaste contains no sugar, sweeteners, or artificial flavoring. By contrast, I looked at a tube of Colgate toothpaste that I have on the shelf. It contains \\&quot;flavor,\\&quot; whatever that is, \\&quot;saccharine,\\&quot; and \\&quot;propylene glycol.\\&quot; The last ingredient is a less-toxic form of anti-freeze. One advantage of Tom&#x27;s toothpaste is that we do not have to worry about ingesting poisons when we use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Tom&#x27;s for years. The toothpaste comes in many flavors. On Amazon, you can find Peppermint, Spearmint, Fennel, Orange-Mango, Cinnamint, Wintermint, Apricot, Soothing Mint, True Mint, and Gingermint, among others. I prefer the Peppermint flavor, which is refreshing, but not overwhelming. The toothpaste is available in sizes from 1 ounce to 6 ounces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not exactly live in a wilderness area, but my local stores no longer carry Tom&#x27;s. Fortunately, it can be found on Amazon and other web sites. The prices do vary from vendor to vendor, so check for the best price.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My experience and why I like it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine flouride free toothpaste for almost two years now and am glad I made the switch.  I originally switched mainly due to fear after hearing the dangers of flouride.  However, this is controversial and I will not go too much in depth.  However, what I did realize was that I am probably swallowing a decent amount of flouride by not completely rinsing my mouth out every time I brush (usually I just swish/spit once).  By using this toothpaste you will not have to worry about swallowing the toothpaste as there is no warning label on it, though i don&#x27;t recommend swallowing it.  Though flouride free, it offers much protection against cavities as I am a twice a day brusher and have actually seen a decrease in cavities after switching.  If combined with flossing (as I only recently have started doing), you will almost certainly not get any cavities.  You may have to get used to the bland taste and watery texture, but i think the flavor is acceptable.  Since making the switch, I had have experienced a dramatic decrease in canker sores likely caused by harsh ingredients in typical Colgate and Crest toothpaste.  This alone perhaps is enough of a selling point.  Soon more people will make the switch to more natural toothpastes like this.  If you want the benefits of natural toothpastes, try Tom&#x27;s of Maine or even Burt&#x27;s Bees (which my dentist recommended).  Also, it is important to note that I prefer Pepperment over Spearment Tom&#x27;s as the taste is significantly more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purpose of all the Ingredients and where they come from:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calcium carbonate - Mild abrasive (Purified calcium from the earth)&lt;br /&gt;Hydrated Silica - Stain removal (Purified silica from the earth)&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin - Moistener (Vegetable Oils)&lt;br /&gt;Xylitol - Flavor (Birch trees or corn)&lt;br /&gt;Natural Flavors - Flavor (Spearment Leaves)&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Lauryl Sulfate - Dispersant (Derived from coconut and/or palm kernel oil)&lt;br /&gt;Water - Consistency (Purified water)&lt;br /&gt;Zinc Citrate - Helps fight tartar (Derived from purified zinc from the earth)&lt;br /&gt;Chondrus Crispus - Thickener (Seaweed)&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Bicarbonate - Mouth freshness (Purified sodium bicarbonate from the earth)Zinc Citrate - Helps fight tartar (Derived from purified zinc from the earth)  Chondrus Crispus - Thickener (Seaweed)  Sodium Bicarbonate - Mouth freshness (Purified sodium bicarbonate from the earth)</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this item and are very happy with it.  Better than we expected and would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I like Tom’s of Maine in general on account of their environmental awareness and no animal testing policy. I had found that their Antiplaque and Whitening toothpaste has a dehydrating effect and I usually had to drink or rinse with a lot of water after brushing my teeth to get rid of the chalkiness. However, now I’ve started using less toothpaste and also letting it hydrate/foam a little in my mouth for a minute or two before I do any serious brushing and that has helped a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several vigilant reviewers have pointed out that Tom’s (now owned by Colgate-Palmolive) add sodium lauryl sulfate (aka SLS or SDS) to their toothpaste. There’s no evidence that SLS causes cancer but it can be a skin irritant at higher concentrations and has been shown to exacerbate canker sores in sensitive people. SLS is not naturally occurring – it’s made from fatty acids such as those found in coconut oil. Tom’s says: “When used in our toothpaste, SLS has limited contact with the gums and is then rinsed out. At the levels used in our products, SLS has no known toxicity — not even when ingested.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the fluoride front, the addition to fluoride to water (practiced in the US but not in most European countries) helps to reduce dental decay but also carries some risks. I think we (involuntarily) get enough fluoride in our water – supplementing this with the even more fluoride in toothpaste is unnecessary in my view, considering that there are several concerns regarding its use. Quick summary of fluoride dosage and toxicity: around 5 grams is a potentially lethal dose for an adult and 60 mg for an average 2 year old. If a child were to accidentally swallow less than half a tube of toothpaste (such as Colgate Kids), it could be fatal. Then, around 0.2 mg/kg body weight can cause gastrointestinal discomfort (i.e. 2.4 mg for a 12 kg 2 year old, or 12 mg for a 60 kg adult). A large strip of toothpaste contains around 2.25 mg of fluoride (and a truly pea-sized amount contains 0.3 mg) while a liter of municipal tap water usually contains 1 mg. So, the amount of fluoride in toothpaste is fairly significant if you use a lot of paste, brush your teeth often, and/or tend to swallow some of it. In addition to gastrointestinal discomfort, chronic exposure to fluoride in large amounts interferes with bone formation. I’d rather eliminate the fluoride source in my toothpaste even if I choose to live with the fluoride in my tap water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sustainability: 100% of Tom’s energy usage is offset by wind energy credits. They also do a lot of internal recycling, use post-consumer cardboard for packaging and waste or vegetable-based inks for printing. The “goodness report” on their website expansively covers their goals for energy and water use, recycling and waste generation, ingredients and community impact. It also mentions their planned move away from using SDS. Terracycle offer recycling of toothpaste tubes (along with many other items such as deodorant, floss, mouthwash and toothbrushes) for people willing to collect several of them and ship them off. This recycling program is sponsored by Tom’s but actually you can recycle empty containers from any company. It’s worth checking out Terracycle for recycling packaging in general - they provide free shipping labels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two other popular options in the category of natural toothpaste (cruelty-free, generally natural ingredients, and fluoride-free options available) are Nature’s Gate and Jason’s. I like both companies and have used Nature’s Gate toothpaste for a long time. Nature’s Gate provides more information on sustainability than do Jason’s. Although Tom’s does a good job on the environmental front, I’m thinking of switching back to Nature’s Gate (also a great company), mainly because of the chalkiness / dryness I feel after using Tom’s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall I’ll give the Tom’s of Maine Antiplaque and Whitening toothpaste 4/5 goldstars for quality of the product and 5/5 “green” stars based on the social-ethical-environmental aspects of producing it. If they changed their formulation by removing the SDS and made it less chalky then it might get 5 gold stars.stars for quality of the product and 5/5 “green” stars based on the social-ethical-environmental aspects of producing it.

            <li> I love Tom&#x27;s because it makes my teeth feel so clean.  Not just right after I brush but even overnight.  I wake up with my mouth feeling fresh not fuzzy.  I ran out recently and had to use my husband&#x27;s Colgate (my former favorite).  Not only did they not feel immediately as clean as with Tom&#x27;s, the next morning they felt disgusting.  By the next evening they felt like I hadn&#x27;t brushed in days not hours.  I also love that they are made with xylitol.  I do not use the fluorinated kind and I don&#x27;t need to.  Xylitol is so good for your enamel and it really must cut the acid in my mouth because I do not grown plaque when I&#x27;m using it regularly and the dentist always comments on how little tartar I have built up on my teeth.  I even put it on canker sores to get rid of them quickly.  I will be ordering another huge supply for my family so we don&#x27;t run out for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great taste, works great, probably as efficient if not more than Crest and other generics.. and look ma! No fluoride</li>
            <li> This toothpaste does not contain fluoride, which you need to prevent cavities.  After using it for less than two years, I had a mouthful of cavities, a first for me as I am meticulous about brushing and flossing.  Cost to repair the damage will be over $2300 dollars. My dentist told me that others had had the same experience with Tom&#x27;s.  Fluoride is absolutely necessary in a toothpaste.</li>
            <li> all i&#x27;m gonna say is that i&#x27;m 23 and i don&#x27;t remember the last time i got a cavity but it was probably when i was a kid. i started using this toothpaste back in early February and my recent trip to the dentist (mid April) they tell me i have 3 very small cavities and i had to pay to get them filled.. granted it&#x27;s been a year since i went to get my teeth looked at, sure, but i mostly drink water and i generally stay away from sodas and candy. (i&#x27;ll have a soda maybe like once or twice a week at most). AND i brush morning and evening. nothing about my diet and/or my habits has ever really changed yet i find it interesting that i turn up with little cavities 3 months after using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so take it for what it&#x27;s worth but i&#x27;m not going to use this toothpaste anymore. if it works for you then that&#x27;s great but i&#x27;m going back to Colgate Total.</li>
            <li> Im very happy with this product.  Its nice to know you can buy a toothpaste without sodium sacarin</li>
            <li> I am searching for non-fluoride tooth paste.  So far I have tried about maybe a half dozen brands.  Of all those the Tom&#x27;s of Maine stands out as the worst taste.  It was a struggle to use up the tube.  I have used &#x27;baking soda&#x27; tooth paste for 20 years which my friends unanimously agree is the worst tasting tooth paste there is.  But Tom&#x27;s has changes the scale.</li>
            <li> Use to love Tom&#x27;s of Maine, but after being bought from the original founders, the product has changed in quality. Its somewhat watery compared to what it use to be. Use to love the original tin/metal like tube that held the toothpaste, but it has been changed to a nondescript squeezable plastic tube that is rather sterile to the touch.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;When we first started out, this brand-new idea of natural products and sustainable companies seemed a little crazy to some. In the years since, though, more and more people have begun to believe, like we do, that nature can provide many of the health benefits we need — and that companies should minimize their environmental impact while working towards positive change in our communities. Together, we&#x27;ve really started to make a difference!&amp;#34; from Tom&#x27;s of Maine website.  The product is great; tastes great.  Company ethics is the icing.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> used to love you till this......I want Natural, not conglomerate......no more...http://livingtraditionally.com/warning-toms-of-maine-products-are-not-so-natural-youve-been-lied-to-again/</li>
            <li> Still the best toothpaste around.  You&#x27;ll never go back to the major brands after using Tom&#x27;s.  Once you&#x27;ve been spoiled with REAL mint instead of artifical flavor and sweeteners, the standard brands just don&#x27;t leave your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
