            <li>Love the metal rollers and the size</li>
            <li>we all like &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I have not tried to take the top off so that I can reuse the bottle</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and good quality.</li>
            <li>was easy to find appropriate use for this size.</li>
            <li>I do have to say that he metal rollers are super nice</li>
            <li>so I still gave a good review, but would rather feel like more oil was coming out without so much pressure.</li>
            <li>But, they work fine and hold 5mm of my favorite product to always have with me.</li>
            <li>Relatively easy to refill and</li>
            <li>Easy transaction.  </li>
            <li>Roller ball pushes on to the glass bottle easily and securely.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, and are great for my essential oils :  )</li>
            <li>The lids fit tightly, and the ball dispenses the perfect amount of oils when rolling.</li>
            <li>They glide very smoothly and dispense just the right amount of oil.</li>
            <li>These are great for giving away essential oil samples!</li>
            <li>Worked great for making DIY essential oil blends.</li>
            <li>5ml bottle work perfect no rollerball trouble</li>
            <li>These are great for essential oils, perfumes etc.</li>
            <li>Just right to give someone a blend for pain, headache, eczema, what ever takes more then one oil.  </li>
            <li>very good quality.. doesn&#x27;t leak and love how small they are.</li>
            <li>Roller ball tops are super easy to insert.</li>
            <li>These are small, but they are perfect for my diaper bag.</li>
            <li>Perfect for small blends.</li>
            <li>The first one I pried off with tweezer and it went OK</li>
            <li>These are small but they are the best ones I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and is a great tiny roll on that works very well!</li>
            <li>but the top of the glass that holds the ball (which I do love) broke off completely in the cap.</li>
            <li>Good for my essential oils.</li>
            <li>I enjoy them and will most likely buy more.</li>
            <li>I only had about 20 drops of EO and then 30 or so of FCO, and I loved it until I put it in my case to go on an outing.</li>
            <li>Quickly shipped and what I was looking for</li>
            <li>Im new to using oils, and I thought these would be perfect to experiment a little.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more and suggest these bottles to all my oily friends!</li>
            <li>nice accessories for essential oils!</li>
            <li>Perfect size, roller spreads oils evenly, nothing broken or spilling out.</li>
            <li>Has a metal roller and fits nicely in my purse for my essential oils!</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t buy this again but not a bad product, just wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I was excited by the stainless steel ball (instead of plastic).</li>
            <li>The price is definitely right compared to buying from the oil companies.</li>
            <li>I like these, but sometimes the oils won&#x27;t roll out right away</li>
            <li>Easily fills with your own choices of essential and carrier oils for personal use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to carry around my whole bottles of oils, and these are a great way to have a small amount of oils on hand at all times.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I neeed</li>
            <li>Perfect for travel but definitely on the small side.</li>
            <li>Maybe a biggersize would be better next time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got another brand before, and these are much higher quality.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>We have placed multiple orders and will probably end up ordering more.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I used the first one today.</li>
            <li>Other recommendations said the stainless steel roller balls were best and so I chose this over other kinds that had plastic parts.</li>
            <li>The roller top is easy to take on and off yet fits tightly so that the oil stays in the applicator!</li>
            <li>the roller balls/caps seem to be of very high quality.</li>
            <li>Smaller than what I expected, but love the metal roller and sometimes a smaller bottle us better for travel!</li>
            <li>Cost a little more, but we&#x27;ll worth it.  </li>
            <li>I never really checked to see if they were all okay when they arrived</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND these!</li>
            <li>I really did.</li>
            <li>I really like the steel ball.</li>
            <li>They roll in really well.</li>
            <li>Probably very soon.</li>
            <li>Mixed my own concoction of essential oils in them.</li>
            <li>Im used to making sure the caps on ALL my oils are tight before taking them any where, and when I took this out to use it, it was busted.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I was pleased that the seller helped me out when one of the bottles was a little leaky.</li>
            <li>These bottles are nicely made, I like everything about them except the part that holds the roller ball is really hard to get off to refill.</li>
            <li>The glass is nice and thick so if you accidentally drop it you&#x27;re not going to break it as easily as lots of the other ones.</li>
            <li>I ordered these bottles for essential oil rollers and they are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The bottles I received are incredibly flimsy and thin compared to other bottles I use.</li>
            <li>I put 8 drops of YL Thieves essential oil and 5 drops YL Lemon essential oil in these and fill the rest with a carrier oil (sweet almond oil).</li>
            <li>I was super stoked to get these, I have other roll on bottles</li>
            <li>Highly recommended...perfect for the essential oils I use, and only a metal ball works consistently.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have to refill them with my oils as frequently.  </li>
            <li>and I was looking forward to the metal roller balls as I&#x27;ve read that they provide a much smoother application and last longer than plastic ones.</li>
            <li>These are small roll on bottles but the steel ball makes the essential oils go on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it is just made cheaply, or if I put the cap on to tight, but it broke and leaked oil everywhere (Smells great at least!)</li>
            <li>Sometimes the rollers stick a bit and the essential oil doesn&#x27;t come out, but a gentle tap and its back in buisness again!</li>
            <li>I bought a set of 5 5ml ones with black lids on Amazon and they are much easier to get off.</li>
            <li>Not a horrible product for the price, but I have never had any of my other brand rollers break or crap so easily.</li>

            <li> These are small roll on bottles but the steel ball makes the essential oils go on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is just made cheaply, or if I put the cap on to tight, but it broke and leaked oil everywhere (Smells great at least!)</li>
            <li> Sometimes the rollers stick a bit and the essential oil doesn&#x27;t come out, but a gentle tap and its back in buisness again!</li>
            <li> I bought a set of 5 5ml ones with black lids on Amazon and they are much easier to get off.</li>
            <li> Not a horrible product for the price, but I have never had any of my other brand rollers break or crap so easily.</li>
            <li> I was a bit let down in how flimsy the glass on these feels; compared to my other roller bottles these feel thin and not terribly sturdy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or if it is because they are smaller, but the roller ball does not roll very easily.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing (it gives a nice pressure-point massage)</li>
            <li> so I will just keep these as back up bottles and use the roller balls in my other bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WISH THEY CAME IN A LITTLE BIT BIGGER BOTTLES!</li>
            <li> and I tend to be rough on things.  </li>
            <li> Product received carefully packaged.</li>
            <li> I ended up using the two that were not broken and within a month of using them they have broken.</li>
            <li> USPS delivered my package into my happy little hands, and much to my disappointment one of the bottles was in broken pieces in the bag!</li>
            <li> Definitly small enough for purse!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I like that as well as the standard plastic roller.</li>
            <li> but with the small size I feel like I have to do a lot of rolling for proper application instead of just 1 swipe.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m hoping I can just swap them out with some of my other bottles that are sturdier.</li>
            <li> So I will use the other 2 rollers, but I won&#x27;t be taking them anywhere at all.</li>
            <li> I am super disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> These little bottles were as advertised and came within two days of ordering!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable customer service.</li>
            <li> Can be difficult to find in purse or diaper bag and need to be refilled about once a month with daily use.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s so hard when buying online sometimes).  </li>
            <li> Also hard to find with the metal rollerrballs.</li>
            <li> Small in size though!</li>
            <li> so they are very small.</li>
            <li> not good for a med.</li>
            <li> I apply this to my feet wrists and behind ears daily to help prevent cold and flu!</li>
            <li> One is broken but</li>
            <li> After cleaning the broken glass off of them and filling them with FCO &amp; oils</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it does not roll well</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are great for giving away essential oil samples!</li>
            <li> nice accessories for essential oils!</li>
            <li> Quickly shipped and what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I bought these to dilute my Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils with carrier oil (I use coconut.) Especially if you have children and want to apply oil to their feet this is the way to do it. They are very good quality bottles, the perfect size for carrying in my purse, but I feel like I have to press very hard when rolling to get the oil to roll on. This isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing (it gives a nice pressure-point massage) so I still gave a good review, but would rather feel like more oil was coming out without so much pressure. The price is definitely right compared to buying from the oil companies.</li>
            <li> These did great...wish the sets came in 5&#x27;s</li>
            <li> love it!! very good quality.. doesn&#x27;t leak and love how small they are. I can have several in my purse without the heaviness of larger ones. well packaged//</li>
            <li> These are small, but they are perfect for my diaper bag. I don&#x27;t like to carry around my whole bottles of oils, and these are a great way to have a small amount of oils on hand at all times. The rollerballs are metal, which is terrific for essential oils! They have not leaked on me! I will definitely order more and suggest these bottles to all my oily friends!</li>
            <li> Very nice, packaging was good and everything is in working order.</li>
            <li> Love these. Perfect size, roller spreads oils evenly, nothing broken or spilling out.</li>
            <li> Worked great for making DIY essential oil blends.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Unbelievable customer service.</li>
            <li> Love, love , love ! Cost a little more, but we&#x27;ll worth it.  My essential oils did not leak out and I prefer the metal ball roller.  Despenses the essential oils  on the skin evenly. BEST OF ALL... NO LEAKING of costly oils !!</li>
            <li> Roller ball tops are super easy to insert. They all fit! I&#x27;ve purchased several sets of these. They are the best. Love the size!</li>
            <li> I love the size.  One is broken but I never really checked to see if they were all okay when they arrived and I tend to be rough on things.  Therefore, I&#x27;m not letting it affect my rating of the product.</li>
            <li> On fourth set of these. Highly recommended...perfect for the essential oils I use, and only a metal ball works consistently.</li>
            <li> These are a lot smaller than I was thinking they would be. The roller ball sometimes gets stuck and refuses to roll.</li>
            <li> Good quality.  Just wish they were bigger so I didn&#x27;t have to refill them with my oils as frequently.  Definitely better than the plastic roller ball ones (the plastic ones broke on me)</li>
            <li> These bottles and metal roller are very effective. Will buy them again.</li>
            <li> Smaller than what I expected, but love the metal roller and sometimes a smaller bottle us better for travel!</li>
            <li> I really love these bottle I have ordered them twice now.  They are perfect for my essential oils.  Just right to give someone a blend for pain, headache, eczema, what ever takes more then one oil.  Very easy to uses &amp; reuse.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and good quality.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I neeed</li>
            <li> Perfect for small blends.</li>
            <li> These are nice great quality Amber glass bottles with metal rollers! Very good quality! Small in size though! Definitly small enough for purse! Sometimes the rollers stick a bit and the essential oil doesn&#x27;t come out, but a gentle tap and its back in buisness again! The roller top is easy to take on and off yet fits tightly so that the oil stays in the applicator! HIGHLY RECOMMEND these! I put 8 drops of YL Thieves essential oil and 5 drops YL Lemon essential oil in these and fill the rest with a carrier oil (sweet almond oil). I apply this to my feet wrists and behind ears daily to help prevent cold and flu! LOVE that I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting the oil all over my fingers and hands now with these lovely applicator roll on bottles!!! WISH THEY CAME IN A LITTLE BIT BIGGER BOTTLES!</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel but definitely on the small side. Can be difficult to find in purse or diaper bag and need to be refilled about once a month with daily use. Relatively easy to refill and the roller balls/caps seem to be of very high quality.</li>
            <li> 5ml bottle work perfect no rollerball trouble</li>
            <li> These bottles are nicely made, I like everything about them except the part that holds the roller ball is really hard to get off to refill. The first one I pried off with tweezer and it went OK but the second one I tore up so it can be used with the roller anymore. I bought a set of 5 5ml ones with black lids on Amazon and they are much easier to get off.</li>
            <li> It rolls fairly well and does the job. I was pleased that the seller helped me out when one of the bottles was a little leaky. Good for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or if it is because they are smaller, but the roller ball does not roll very easily. Maybe a biggersize would be better next time.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful. I&#x27;ve got another brand before, and these are much higher quality. The glass is nice and thick so if you accidentally drop it you&#x27;re not going to break it as easily as lots of the other ones. Quality product here!</li>
            <li> Perfect. They are just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love these. I really did. I was excited by the stainless steel ball (instead of plastic). Unfortunately it does not roll well and I have to repeatedly roll it in order to try to get my eye serum out. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Perfect cost effective solution for mixing essential oils. Delivery was prompt and bottles don&#x27;t leak after filling. I really like the steel ball.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Just what I ordered</li>
            <li> Set of 3 amber glass bottles with metal roller balls.  The part that holds the roller ball is plastic so I&#x27;ll see how it holds up but for now I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I ordered these bottles for essential oil rollers and they are exactly what I was looking for. They are smaller bottles which I wanted and the steel roller balls are awesome. They glide very smoothly and dispense just the right amount of oil. I highly recommend them. I&#x27;ve tried plastic roller balls before and they are junk. The steel ones are the way to go.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought, but I like them.</li>
            <li> These are small but they are the best ones I&#x27;ve found. They roll in really well.</li>
            <li> Easy transaction.  Bottles were what I was looking for. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I like these, but sometimes the oils won&#x27;t roll out right away</li>
            <li> They are as advertised except that I did not realize they had metal rollers. I&#x27;m not sure I like that as well as the standard plastic roller. But, they work fine and hold 5mm of my favorite product to always have with me.</li>
            <li> Mixed my own concoction of essential oils in them. Worked well.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Product received carefully packaged. Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> great for my EO mixtures!</li>
            <li> These are small roll on bottles but the steel ball makes the essential oils go on very smoothly. I enjoy them and will most likely buy more.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. I will buy these again.</li>
            <li> not good for a med. skin oil but nice otherwise</li>
            <li> smaller than what I was expecting- but is what was described- I did not pay close attention before purchasing. was easy to find appropriate use for this size.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this bottle!  Has a metal roller and fits nicely in my purse for my essential oils!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, and are great for my essential oils :  )</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought, but will work for my under eye serum.</li>
            <li> Love these roller balls</li>
            <li> I bought these to use for my essential oils. They are fabulous! The lids fit tightly, and the ball dispenses the perfect amount of oils when rolling. I bought some blue ones from a different company because I needed a bigger size, but they sucked. I will be buying more of these.</li>
            <li> love the bottles...kind of pricey though</li>
            <li> These bottles are prefect for on the go to keep in your purse, I like that they are glass with a metal ball, I ended up buying another set. Keep in mind these are only a 5ml bottle so they are very small.</li>
            <li> Very tiny vials.  I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the measurements (it&#x27;s so hard when buying online sometimes).  They work ok but with the small size I feel like I have to do a lot of rolling for proper application instead of just 1 swipe.  I probably won&#x27;t buy this again but not a bad product, just wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> These vials are my very favorite for esstential oils!! They are perfect and very well made. We have placed multiple orders and will probably end up ordering more. They are also great for sharing oils with others.  Love the metal rollers and the size is ideal for home, work, and travel!!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Plastic around roller ball fell apart after a short time.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and is a great tiny roll on that works very well!</li>
            <li> I was super stoked to get these, I have other roll on bottles but they all have plastic balls and I was looking forward to the metal roller balls as I&#x27;ve read that they provide a much smoother application and last longer than plastic ones. USPS delivered my package into my happy little hands, and much to my disappointment one of the bottles was in broken pieces in the bag! I requested a refund and it was promptly processed for the one bottle, leaving me with 2 bottles to work with. After cleaning the broken glass off of them and filling them with FCO &amp; oils I was a bit let down in how flimsy the glass on these feels; compared to my other roller bottles these feel thin and not terribly sturdy. I had planned on these being in my bag and for my 5 year son to use, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be trusting these to being toted around or for my kiddo to have as his own roller bottle. I do have to say that he metal rollers are super nice, I&#x27;m hoping I can just swap them out with some of my other bottles that are sturdier. I&#x27;d give these a 1 but the company customer service was awesome and shipping was fast and I have to give a star for that. I should have just done a return on these but my excitement to try them out got the best of me so I will just keep these as back up bottles and use the roller balls in my other bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- I ended up using the two that were not broken and within a month of using them they have broken. The bottles I received are incredibly flimsy and thin compared to other bottles I use. I am super disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I love these, they roll nicely as well as have that &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; appearance that lets face it we all like &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> These little bottles were as advertised and came within two days of ordering! I love them and loved the shipping also. Great quality item and will be ordering more from Rivertree Life again! Probably very soon. These are great for essential oils, perfumes etc. Also hard to find with the metal rollerrballs. Thanks!</li>
            <li> What you see is what you get. Roller ball pushes on to the glass bottle easily and securely. I have not tried to take the top off so that I can reuse the bottle but this was my intention. Other recommendations said the stainless steel roller balls were best and so I chose this over other kinds that had plastic parts. Easily fills with your own choices of essential and carrier oils for personal use.</li>
            <li> Im new to using oils, and I thought these would be perfect to experiment a little. I used the first one today. I only had about 20 drops of EO and then 30 or so of FCO, and I loved it until I put it in my case to go on an outing. Im used to making sure the caps on ALL my oils are tight before taking them any where, and when I took this out to use it, it was busted. I&#x27;m not sure if it is just made cheaply, or if I put the cap on to tight, but it broke and leaked oil everywhere (Smells great at least!) but the top of the glass that holds the ball (which I do love) broke off completely in the cap. So I will use the other 2 rollers, but I won&#x27;t be taking them anywhere at all. They will be night time rollers for my kids or something. Not a horrible product for the price, but I have never had any of my other brand rollers break or crap so easily.</li>
