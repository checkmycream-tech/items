            <li>This is my favorite and you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>im getting a more gooey liquid version of it.</li>
            <li>Been using Tigi Bed Head Mac Daddy Manipulator for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t return the product because it works ok</li>
            <li>I have used this product for 8 years or more.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and don&#x27;t think I could do without it.  </li>
            <li>and I love the price</li>
            <li>, I love getting two for the price of one compared to buying the product from the store.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Awesome product, great deal that I highly recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is wonderful and this has lasted me quite a long time-</li>
            <li>It gives my hair the look I want -- spiked, full of volume and life, always looking nice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to report that this batch of my favorite &#x27;gunk&#x27; is the old type.</li>
            <li>A great price for a pack of two!&lt;br /&gt;I got two for the price of one of these at a popular local supply store.</li>
            <li>I do have a very full head of hair.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use also.</li>
            <li>Not stickey and easy to work into hair.</li>
            <li>Also has a strong perfume odor now.</li>
            <li>The price is beyond right, the product is magnificent -- this is a total win-win situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Same product but a great price.</li>
            <li>jars available again.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;I am happy with this product and would have no reason to not reorder in the same manner</li>
            <li>Liked the old formula better.  </li>
            <li>Works great , not really wet look, just a little would recommend to anyone to buy this product again, great</li>
            <li>Used to be my favorite hair product, but now don&#x27;t like it so much.</li>
            <li>first couple of times ive gotten which i guess is the old version which was like puddy, which i liked.</li>
            <li>you are in need of a hair product that will put life, volume, style, and stay-put durability into your life, this is exactly what you are looking for!  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine, totally straight, and has zero volume.  </li>
            <li>I liked it, so I added it as my final step.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fresh</li>
            <li>Definitely some kind of knock-off or something...</li>
            <li>so you use less, and it smells better than the fluffier, more liquid consistency of some jars I purchased a year ago.</li>
            <li>My husband uses it, and likes it very much.</li>
            <li>Thanks you!</li>
            <li>The formula has evidently changed.</li>
            <li>Even a pretty color.</li>
            <li>Product arrived on exact shipment date.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and am able to fix my hair from shampoo to out the door so much faster with my hair style and Manipulator.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s almost back to normal!</li>
            <li>It still works more or less the same, but it would be better if the product&#x27;s consistency were consistent w/ those purchased at retail.</li>
            <li>This product is great for giving your hair that chunky, spiky, messy look without leaving a lot of extra residue.</li>
            <li>Works very well to make my hair do what I want.</li>
            <li>I like this product it really works, smells good.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This was much cheaper than the $17 I pay for one at a salon or any retail store.</li>
            <li>and It is too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thinner and doesn&#x27;t have as much hold.</li>
            <li>The two pack price was as much as just one purchased in a salon.</li>
            <li>However, since it was free, I was open to trying it.  </li>
            <li>Too much can make hair look greasy.</li>
            <li>Company gave me a refund which was really appreciated.  </li>
            <li>It holds my hair very well since it does get frizzy and curly at the ends</li>
            <li>I have been using the sweet pretty blue texture paste for years now.  </li>
            <li>My biggest hope is that the company has gone back to the old formula we all know and love.</li>
            <li>The damage looked worse than it really was; most of the product was still in the jar and useable, but the mess took a good 10 minutes to clean off the jars.  </li>
            <li>The smell is still not the original tropical smell, but the texture is the same as it used to be - and it works as well as it did before they changed the formula.</li>
            <li>like most other hair products.</li>
            <li>Used to be able to buy it in a larger size, but can only find the 2 ounce size now.  </li>
            <li>He has tried many different products and keeps coming back to this.</li>
            <li>is if it arrived busted and if it did that, as a Prime member I get mainly from Amazon and they take care of all issues like that</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, there is a pleasant practically non-odor element, and it WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While the cost seems high, these two jars will last a year or more since you only use a dime-sized amount each time.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair styled in place without having that hard like consistency and smells really nice.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it does not fit this case&lt;</li>
            <li>the new one works too but not as well.</li>
            <li>I love how it does not make my hair feel hard, crunchy, oily, etc.</li>
            <li>I contacted seller and was told TIGI changed formulation and that they (the seller) made  that clear on their site when I ordered.  </li>
            <li>I work in an elementary school cafeteria and have to wear the dreaded white mushroom hair net for hours a day.  </li>
            <li>Like other Tigi products, it can be a bit pricey for the amount you get, but the quality is worth it.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t always work the same as when you purchase it from a local hair salon or store, the shelf turnover is much higher and the product is newer.  </li>
            <li>Love the price, usually pay double that for one.</li>
            <li>This product (just use a little) adds great texture, body (I have thin hair</li>
            <li>Now, with Bed Head; I use less - get more of a natural and less greasy look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a sundry or something I use in everyday life like light bulbs, toilet paper, cereal etc</li>
            <li>Grrr when my favorite products are discontinued!!</li>

            <li> I contacted seller and was told TIGI changed formulation and that they (the seller) made  that clear on their site when I ordered.  </li>
            <li> I work in an elementary school cafeteria and have to wear the dreaded white mushroom hair net for hours a day.  </li>
            <li> Like other Tigi products, it can be a bit pricey for the amount you get, but the quality is worth it.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t always work the same as when you purchase it from a local hair salon or store, the shelf turnover is much higher and the product is newer.  </li>
            <li> Love the price, usually pay double that for one.</li>
            <li> This product (just use a little) adds great texture, body (I have thin hair</li>
            <li> Now, with Bed Head; I use less - get more of a natural and less greasy look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a sundry or something I use in everyday life like light bulbs, toilet paper, cereal etc</li>
            <li> Grrr when my favorite products are discontinued!!</li>
            <li> The price is half what I normally pay at a retail store.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair stay all day long; I just get up in the morning</li>
            <li> I actually only use this on my hair when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> It came in a pink package instead of a blue one.  </li>
            <li> but my BED HEAD keeps my look going all day long no matter what the conditions my hair is put to test</li>
            <li> My hair stylist always uses it on .my hair dry</li>
            <li> Dry Look&#x27;</li>
            <li> The reason I added this is that I couldn&#x27;t find a container of my regular gel that was small enough for travel (TSA regulations).  </li>
            <li> but I still would rather use it wet</li>
            <li> Te product I received was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> The secret to using it is not to use to much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and sticky and leaves my hair flat.  </li>
            <li> Be careful, though, because a little bit goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way for me....</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Use in my short hair everyday!</li>
            <li> I will not buy TIGI again and I will not use The Beauty Source again because they were not interested in refunding my money.</li>
            <li> and I have tried other products but continue to like Manipulator over all others.</li>
            <li> At my hairdresser&#x27;s and at other retail stores, the price for one is what I paid on AMAZON for the price of two.  </li>
            <li> I have thick short hair and this stuff helps my hair stick up the way I want it to.  </li>
            <li> I mean, this stuff works, but it&#x27;s not the same as the jars you would buy at the salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using TIGI Bed Head Manipulator for years and although they have changed the formula slightly and it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as it used to</li>
            <li> Yet, here it is and for less $$ than I&#x27;ve ever paid.</li>
            <li> The 2pk arrived a gooey mess.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always been expensive, but I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased it a few times on Amazon and it almost seems as if the product is slightly &amp;#34;gooeyier&amp;#34; or drier compared to those purchased at retail.  </li>
            <li> Controls my curls without weighing them down or making them too stiff.  </li>
            <li> fix my hair with a little of this</li>
            <li> I feel that sometimes when I purchase this product from an online distributor that it is past its shelf life and starts to break down.  </li>
            <li> ; product, at least that is my belief in the product line.  </li>
            <li> When you add in heat/humidity during these late summer days, the result could be a beauty catastrophe --  </li>
            <li> The stuff is not as thick and doesn&#x27;t hold as well.</li>
            <li> only way I would give a bad review</li>
            <li> And I mean zero volume -- none - zilch!.  </li>
            <li> Was not happy at all</li>
            <li> It appears that one of the jars had it&#x27;s seal broken quite some time ago and had leaked -exploded- all over the inside of the packaging.  </li>
            <li> that one jar was rusted on the inside of the lid because of the broken seal, so I had to repurpose a rubbermaid container to hold the remaining product.  </li>
            <li> is one of the items that a review is silly to do&lt;</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Got here save and sound! This is better than moose!!</li>
            <li> Love the product. So glad you carry it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite and you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. $20.00 each at store.  This is a great deal!</li>
            <li> You could use this to style your hair and then go out in a force 10 gale and your hair would not budge. It is easy to use also.</li>
            <li> ive ordered this product several times. first couple of times ive gotten which i guess is the old version which was like puddy, which i liked. now im getting a more gooey liquid version of it. i liked the puddy, worked better. the new one works too but not as well.</li>
            <li> Use in my short hair everyday! Works very well to make my hair do what I want. I also like buying it in two packs!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and appreciate the value of two for this price.  Keep &#x27;em coming!  Thanks you!</li>
            <li> The formula has evidently changed. The stuff is not as thick and doesn&#x27;t hold as well. Also has a strong perfume odor now. Used to be my favorite hair product, but now don&#x27;t like it so much.</li>
            <li> After rubbing a bit of BB&#x27;s Manipulator in my fingertips, I apply it to my hair...at the roots or wherever it&#x27;s needed to lift or keep my hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;Then I use a hair pick or just my fingers to place my hair where I want it.  The best thing I like about BB&#x27;s Manipulator is that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with a sticky feeling.  Stays smooth and shiny; and the best part is that I don&#x27;t need hair spray.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that is about shoulder length.  I use curl spray, mousse, a different gel, then this.....every day.  The reason I added this is that I couldn&#x27;t find a container of my regular gel that was small enough for travel (TSA regulations).  I bought this at Target because it was in a 2-for-1 pack.  I liked it, so I added it as my final step.  I started buying on Amazon because you can&#x27;t always find a 2-for-1.  A little goes a long way for me....a 2 oz container lasts months.</li>
            <li> My wife LOVES this product.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great for the quantity of product.&lt;br /&gt;Good value, good product, good good good.</li>
            <li> Have used Bed Head manipulator for several years to create my spiked hair style.  Not stickey and easy to work into hair.</li>
            <li> i&amp;#34;ve been using this for years and was thrilled well that has changed and so has this product it does not work anymore it&#x27;s oily does not hold the style even the smell is different I called them and they said they have changed some of the ingredients will not use this anymore until they change it back</li>
            <li> I like this product it really works, smells good.&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product!&lt;br /&gt; Have used this product for 10 years. Even a pretty color.</li>
            <li> Works great , not really wet look, just a little would recommend to anyone to buy this product again, great</li>
            <li> Love bed head manipulator !! It is wonderful and this has lasted me quite a long time- it makes my hair stay all day long; I just get up in the morning fix my hair with a little of this and I am good to go!</li>
            <li> Been using Tigi Bed Head Mac Daddy Manipulator for many, many years.  It makes my hair do what I want it to do.  It&#x27;s always been expensive, but I can&#x27;t live without it.  Used to be able to buy it in a larger size, but can only find the 2 ounce size now.  $10 is the best price I&#x27;ve found - $20 for two 2 ounce jars.</li>
            <li> I actually only use this on my hair when it&#x27;s wet and it give me great hold.  My hair stylist always uses it on .my hair dry but I still would rather use it wet</li>
            <li> This was much cheaper than the $17 I pay for one at a salon or any retail store. Same product but a great price.</li>
            <li> Was not happy at all i think this product was a flop its not like before now its to watery and it doesnt feel the same i think something was changed out. Will not order again</li>
            <li> I feel that sometimes when I purchase this product from an online distributor that it is past its shelf life and starts to break down.  it doesn&#x27;t always work the same as when you purchase it from a local hair salon or store, the shelf turnover is much higher and the product is newer.  Occasionally the product is not as tacky and a different viscosity than &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; product, at least that is my belief in the product line.  The online distributors need to turn over the product faster and purchase smaller quantities at a time for this to be a reliable online sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s fresh its a great product and I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have thick short hair and this stuff helps my hair stick up the way I want it to.  Love it !</li>
            <li> The quality of this product differs from those purchased at retail.  I&#x27;ve purchased it a few times on Amazon and it almost seems as if the product is slightly &amp;#34;gooeyier&amp;#34; or drier compared to those purchased at retail.  It still works more or less the same, but it would be better if the product&#x27;s consistency were consistent w/ those purchased at retail.</li>
            <li> Great value for a good product. My husband loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> Te product I received was not what I expected. It came in a pink package instead of a blue one.  I&#x27;ve never seen this before. The formula is also a bit different-not as thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t return the product because it works ok and It is too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> Great value and holds hair well when styling.</li>
            <li> Good deal, works well.</li>
            <li> great price and great shipping</li>
            <li> My husband uses it, and likes it very much. He has tried many different products and keeps coming back to this. Now it is the only thing he buys, and it is the cheapest on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 8 years or more. When  I received the  product  it was totally different.  I contacted seller and was told TIGI changed formulation and that they (the seller) made  that clear on their site when I ordered.  I was not informed of this change at any time when I ordered. I should have read the reviews because this is the only place it was mentioned. I will not buy TIGI again and I will not use The Beauty Source again because they were not interested in refunding my money.</li>
            <li> Great seller! Highly recommended! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great--best I&#x27;ve used for giving my hairstyle some texture.</li>
            <li> I mean, this stuff works, but it&#x27;s not the same as the jars you would buy at the salon. It&#x27;s thinner and doesn&#x27;t have as much hold. Definitely some kind of knock-off or something...</li>
            <li> Liked the old formula better.  It was a thicker consistency.  Would like to see the 8 oz. jars available again.  I love this product and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Used this product for quite a while. The two pack price was as much as just one purchased in a salon. Great deal!!</li>
            <li> Bed Head Manipulator is just the best hair product, I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 10yrs now and I have tried other products but continue to like Manipulator over all others. Keeps hair styled in place without having that hard like consistency and smells really nice.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on exact shipment date. Love the price, usually pay double that for one. Definitely recommend this product to you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using TIGI Bed Head Manipulator for years and although they have changed the formula slightly and it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as it used to, it is still a good product.</li>
            <li> My local stylist gave me jar as a Christmas gift. I would never have thought to purchase this product on my own. I am in my 60s and not into spikeing my hair. However, since it was free, I was open to trying it.  I do have a very full head of hair. I get kidded about always having my hair &amp;#34;perfectly groomed&amp;#34;. Now, with Bed Head; I use less - get more of a natural and less greasy look. I am happy to be able to have that (retro 70s) &#x27;Dry Look&#x27;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and don&#x27;t think I could do without it.  The secret to using it is not to use to much.</li>
            <li> The smell is still not the original tropical smell, but the texture is the same as it used to be - and it works as well as it did before they changed the formula. I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s almost back to normal!</li>
            <li> A great price for a pack of two!&lt;br /&gt;I got two for the price of one of these at a popular local supply store.</li>
            <li> TIGI BED HEAD MANIPULATOR - TWO OUNCE TWO PACK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short spiky hair.  My hair is fine, totally straight, and has zero volume.  And I mean zero volume -- none - zilch!.  Enter BED HEAD MANIPULATOR into my life.  I have been using the sweet pretty blue texture paste for years now.  It gives my hair the look I want -- spiked, full of volume and life, always looking nice.  I work in an elementary school cafeteria and have to wear the dreaded white mushroom hair net for hours a day.  When you add in heat/humidity during these late summer days, the result could be a beauty catastrophe --  but my BED HEAD keeps my look going all day long no matter what the conditions my hair is put to test under!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can purchase this two pack for the price of just one -- what a deal. At my hairdresser&#x27;s and at other retail stores, the price for one is what I paid on AMAZON for the price of two.  The price is beyond right, the product is magnificent -- this is a total win-win situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in need of a hair product that will put life, volume, style, and stay-put durability into your life, this is exactly what you are looking for!  A little bit goes a long way, there is a pleasant practically non-odor element, and it WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pam</li>
            <li> Exactly what I buy in Walgreen&#x27;s but a BETTER price!!</li>
            <li> greatest product every!  I wear my hair flipped out and this stuff ROCKS!</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s go to product. I wish they still sold the Mac Daddy size.</li>
            <li> This is the best price I can find any where for these 2 packs.  They are just like those I have gotten in the retail store.  The product is great, I use it to sculpt and shape my hair after curling but before hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product, great deal that I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers and Vidimo Se!</li>
            <li> This product is great for giving your hair that chunky, spiky, messy look without leaving a lot of extra residue. It has a strong hold and smells great in your hair. Like other Tigi products, it can be a bit pricey for the amount you get, but the quality is worth it.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time. The price is half what I normally pay at a retail store.</li>
            <li> The product is awesome! and I love the price, I love getting two for the price of one compared to buying the product from the store. I will buy this again if it is offered in a bundle..</li>
            <li> The 2pk arrived a gooey mess.  It appears that one of the jars had it&#x27;s seal broken quite some time ago and had leaked -exploded- all over the inside of the packaging.  The damage looked worse than it really was; most of the product was still in the jar and useable, but the mess took a good 10 minutes to clean off the jars.  Add on that one jar was rusted on the inside of the lid because of the broken seal, so I had to repurpose a rubbermaid container to hold the remaining product.  Otherwise, I love this stuff, it makes my hair look great and holds fairly well all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and I love it!  Controls my curls without weighing them down or making them too stiff.  Be careful, though, because a little bit goes a long way!  Too much can make hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to report that this batch of my favorite &#x27;gunk&#x27; is the old type. It&#x27;s thicker so you use less, and it smells better than the fluffier, more liquid consistency of some jars I purchased a year ago. My biggest hope is that the company has gone back to the old formula we all know and love.</li>
            <li> I have loved this product for years. Then all the salons &amp; beauty supply stores stopped carrying it.  They said it was discontinued.  Grrr when my favorite products are discontinued!! Yet, here it is and for less $$ than I&#x27;ve ever paid. I want to stock up! This product (just use a little) adds great texture, body (I have thin hair but this changes my world &amp; flexible hold. I use fora curly look. Even my teenage son uses.</li>
            <li> Like the way it keeps my fine hair looking good all day. Have been buying this product fo a number  of years. A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> As a canned response to a requested review, I state this:&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the items that a review is silly to do&lt;br /&gt;It is a sundry or something I use in everyday life like light bulbs, toilet paper, cereal etc&lt;br /&gt;My review is GOOD&lt;br /&gt;the only way I would give a bad review is if it arrived busted and if it did that, as a Prime member I get mainly from Amazon and they take care of all issues like that so I&#x27;m sure it does not fit this case&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this product and would have no reason to not reorder in the same manner</li>
            <li> Great service... Very happy</li>
            <li> I always use this stuff and its great. HOlds hair how you want it all day. Will continue on buying</li>
            <li> Company gave me a refund which was really appreciated.  TIGI changed the formula.  Don&#x27;t like it anymore.  It&#x27;s heavy and sticky and leaves my hair flat.  Will not reorder.</li>
            <li> Good hair product. I love how it does not make my hair feel hard, crunchy, oily, etc. like most other hair products. It holds my hair very well since it does get frizzy and curly at the ends so it does a good job in keeping it all tamed. This was a very great deal since in the store the price of one container is equivalent to this 2pk. Great deal and a great hair product. Shipped quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and am able to fix my hair from shampoo to out the door so much faster with my hair style and Manipulator.  While the cost seems high, these two jars will last a year or more since you only use a dime-sized amount each time.</li>
            <li> Great product , great price!</li>
            <li> Great price and speedy service.</li>
