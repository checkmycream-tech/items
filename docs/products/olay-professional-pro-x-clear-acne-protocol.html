    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am very happy with the result I have received with Olay Pro X.</li>
            <li>This product is the best acne system I have tried to date.  </li>
            <li>and my wife thinks Olay has the greatest products on the market.</li>
            <li>you have BEAUTIFUL skin!!</li>
            <li>It took about 8 weeks for a noticable difference, but now my skin looks GREAT!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle cream, it does not work after one use, but if you keep using it you will be happy with the results!</li>
            <li>so that wasn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li>But after your skin adjusts, it is awesome!</li>
            <li>But I am very, very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I have to say I am not too impressed.</li>
            <li>Really a great bundle!</li>
            <li>When the protocol kit arrived I started using it immediately and was very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-greasy and serves as the perfect primer for mineral makeup.</li>
            <li>Oil of Olay, I have to say, this isn&#x27;t your best system.  </li>
            <li>Awesome and</li>
            <li>And there was their make-up line (which I LOVED!!!)</li>
            <li>This may be perfect for you, or you may have to try again.</li>
            <li>I bought this product about 5 weeks ago and it is beyond great!</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is great!</li>
            <li>The lotion however, is probably the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>but this is the best product I have found.</li>
            <li>The results have been absolutely wonderful and with the added benefit of no &#x27;medicine&#x27; smell.  </li>
            <li>Very good!</li>
            <li>Hopefully, it works as well--I wish Olay still carried the Pro-X Acne products, I for one was extremely happy with them!</li>
            <li>This combination seems to work the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product is great!!  </li>
            <li>Love my olay!!!  </li>
            <li>This prduct is excellent and I got very good results.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still using it, with very good results.  </li>
            <li>the hormones in our body and if they&#x27;re not regulated with exercise and good diet, hormonal acne will always keep coming!  </li>
            <li>Good Luck!</li>
            <li>It is a good match for my skin!   </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so happy I did.  </li>
            <li>But to those that like it, great for you.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy with this product.</li>
            <li>and I feel so great.</li>
            <li>It is just great.</li>
            <li>This product is working great for me.  </li>
            <li>That being said, it isn&#x27;t great at removing make-up.</li>
            <li>I have used it under make-up or alone and it makes my skin look great.  </li>
            <li>and I saw a lot of great reviews about this.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>The treatment smells great</li>
            <li>The price was great online, saved me $10.</li>
            <li>As that product worked great, I decided to stay with Olay and purchase this Protocol.  </li>
            <li>Either way, great product, I will purchase again.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy that I tried this Olay product.</li>
            <li>This cleared up my skin and the cystic acne so happy.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very nice.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t had issues with sensitivity, these products do not seem very effective.  </li>
            <li>I will say that it makes my skin feel very nice after I use it.  </li>
            <li>This regimen is amazing!</li>
            <li>I purchased this a week ago, and already am seeing amazing results!   </li>
            <li>My skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li>The lotion is really nice!  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed with how well this product works.  </li>
            <li>Great price, good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great if you have acne, but severe combo skin, beware!</li>
            <li>This system doesn&#x27;t even get your skin clean!!!  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and does a good job of balancing out the treatment.</li>
            <li>I for one will never purchase this product again and in good conscience cannot recommend it.</li>
            <li>I know Olay is a good company</li>
            <li>I had read that salicylic acid was good to help get rid of milia.  </li>
            <li>I had hoped that with the ingredients in this Olay set that I would see some good results.  </li>
            <li>This light gel is perfect.</li>
            <li>This skin clearing system has been fantastic and has made me fee great!</li>
            <li>To be fair, my daughter is a type-1 diabetic</li>
            <li>I gave the Olay a shot since price wise</li>
            <li>Compared to Proactiv, the cost is good.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I thought Olay would be reliable and a good brand to try.</li>
            <li>i wish u all beautiful complexions &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>I loved this and my skin has never looked better!  </li>
            <li>She is very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>and so I bought this product since I had read so many great things from the reviews.</li>
            <li>It feels good going on, but I honestly can&#x27;t say that it helped me.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad that I did!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>:) Maybe it will help you too!</li>
            <li>Thanks! :D  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product because Olay has an excellent reputation, and this is one acne program that seems to be geared more towards adults.    </li>
            <li>My skin is smoother, softer, and better looking than it has EVER been, in my life!</li>
            <li>I LOVE the step 3 moisturizing product!  </li>
            <li>LOVE this kit from Olay!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a satisfied customer for life!  </li>
            <li>I just had to say I LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I figured why not try one more thing!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>I previously used this awesome \\&quot;Reclaim\\&quot; product for years and years for anti aging benefits and it was awesome!</li>
            <li>Instead of using the face wash at night, I have started using Olay Definity Pore Refining Scrub, which is also an AMAZING product.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing product though if you can find the BP wash, Toner and Vitamin A.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam, but you rub it on your face with warm water and you can feel it working.  </li>
            <li>I have had nice skin,</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I contacted Oil of Olay to find out about refunding my money for this product and they were so nice about it.</li>
            <li>product is effective and I am seeing results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it is a good product</li>
            <li>Wash my face with just warm water and a wash cloth to get all of the makeup off  </li>
            <li>Clearing of acne, nice moisturizing of my aging</li>
            <li>I liked these products and their use is intuitive and self explanatory.  </li>
            <li>a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>nice.&lt;br /&gt;Small amount on my finger tip, spread over face, massage in circles over face and neck, this is the nice part.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>face feels nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product, and after having been using it for about 2 weeks now, I am loving this product.</li>
            <li>The cleanser itself feel kind of greasy, but it comes off without leaving a residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish I had taken before pictures, but I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting this product to work so well.</li>
            <li>If you have mild acne this product may work great for you.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and the results, even though they took some time, it</li>
            <li>My skin also dries out very easily.</li>
            <li>and antibiotics (Also worked wonderfully, but I am hearing the dangers of them and trying to steer clear!)</li>
            <li>, the seller was awesome and the product shipped early!</li>
            <li>I noticed that most of the 4 and 5 star reviews for this product are from slightly older women, but I&#x27;m 25 and it has worked marvelously for my skin as well.</li>
            <li>This will clear it up and keep it that way, very impressed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used a lot of acne regimens and this seems to have worked the best so far, and doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin at any time.</li>
            <li>I love using this its so amazing for my face.</li>
            <li>So now with my new routine plus olay&#x27;s product my skin is looking and feeling better by the minute, it hasn&#x27;t looked this great and under control in years!</li>
            <li>Five years ago I was on Accutane (worked wonderful, but NEVER AGAIN, the health problems I experienced were not worth it!)</li>
            <li>The first day that I used the product my skin felt great.</li>
            <li>This had pretty great reviews, so I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li>When I came across this product, I noticed that it was salicylic acid, which  in the research I made is softer on the skin and good for mild cases.</li>
            <li>This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written; I love this product!!</li>
            <li>i noticed a huge difference over night!</li>
            <li>I have tried Oil of Olay and for the most part it is okay, but i thought since this is geared toward acne</li>
            <li>The amount of outbreaks are increasing and outbreaks are more</li>
            <li>Love this for my African-American skin.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and I want to thank Olay for making it! :)</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love that...</li>
            <li>I would mostly breakout in the chin area.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It keeps the skin hydrated and does a better job of calming acne symptoms at a comparable price.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Throughout my life I&#x27;ve had perfect skin, but am now finding my post-menopausal skin having the occasional breakout.  </li>
            <li>but I was able to get more out of it.</li>
            <li>Be sure not to wear a favorite shirt while washing your face or even if you have the lotion on when you sleep.</li>
            <li>If i was able to buy the products separately, i would consider the cleanser and the gel, but would find another acne spot treatment.  </li>
            <li>I have used many products to control my acne, including Accutane.</li>
            <li>This system truly gives you the results you need, but keeps your skin hydrated, and looking healthy.</li>
            <li>but just the fact that my blood is able to flow and toxins are always coming out</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and waited more than a month for it to work.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Oil OF Olay because they got an award last year as the best anti wrinkle eyes cream.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s still out of control, it&#x27;s probably time to switch to another system better for your skin type.</li>
            <li>And with this product, how many uses do you get out of each bottle?  </li>
            <li>Well, I can&#x27;t say for sure if it has helped that yet.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, I love Oil of Olay products.</li>
            <li>I love Olay products</li>
            <li>I still love olay</li>
            <li>I started breaking out more after using this.</li>
            <li>The redness and marks are still prominent even after a month of continued use.</li>
            <li>Olay needs to introduce a &#x27;magic eraser&#x27; to address this problem:-)</li>
            <li>I have been using the Neutrotgena acne kit with better luck</li>
            <li>and I have broke out more.  </li>
            <li>I eventually began to find more affordable cleanser alternatives, and I turned to an acne cleanser from Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li>But I am satisfied with turning to another, more affordable alternative.</li>
            <li>But, from day 1, my skin felt better.</li>
            <li>I use a separate facewash to make sure I get all of my makeup</li>
            <li>The scrub in this product is much better at removing make-up and grime from my face than the Pro-X face wash.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I do love Olay...</li>
            <li>had hoped for more</li>
            <li>Ok, so I have tried everything under the sun for my skin.</li>
            <li>But since then, I have tried SO many products.</li>
            <li>I truly love this product.</li>
            <li>The lotion/acne treatment lotion are okay</li>
            <li>and it caused more breakouts.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing serum is my favorite.</li>
            <li>They recommended I purchase another product (Oil of Olay Refreshing Toner).  </li>
            <li>It was the only thing that ever made my skin look great!  </li>
            <li>The moisterizer is ok</li>
            <li>My skin looked significantly better in 2 days than it did with over 2 weeks use of Pro-X Acne from Olay.</li>
            <li>I would love to just be able to buy step 1 alone.</li>
            <li>(Most salicylic acid acne products you can get at the store contain anywhere between 1 - 2%)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok, It&#x27;s been more than 2 weeks now since I started using this product.</li>
            <li>It was never terrible but never went away no matter what products I tried.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much for the sulphur spot treatment, but Burt&#x27;s Bees has a great spot treatment that I use on occasion before I use the Olay treatment cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched to a Philosphy line and have had much better results.</li>
            <li>BUT I still love it.  </li>
            <li>my skin is more moisturized and even-looking when I used the cleanser step from this kit.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I have never been able to use Oil of Olay moisturizer without breaking out, and the moisture lotion offered as part of this protocol is no acception.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it along with Olay Exfoliating Cleanser and the Pro X scrubber that help with better cleansing.  </li>
            <li>The price is so much better than drug stores or Walmart.</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s just too many steps.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll continue using this product until it is gone, but I don&#x27;t intend on buying any more of it.</li>
            <li>With Olay, I have the ability to purchase more product at my leisure.</li>
            <li>If I see better results in another month, I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
            <li>I bought this system and even enrolled in auto delivery because I was that confident in Olay.  </li>
            <li>sure my skin will always be oily</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not as prominent as when I used this</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>But doesnt have SPF, so make sure you add</li>
            <li>I finished the kit, I noticed that my skin did have a more even tone and looked quite youthful</li>
            <li>I will be making another purchase for the same itme because it is listed at a great price!</li>
            <li>So love this product :)</li>
            <li>Most acne products he has tried either do not work or have caused him a lot of skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>I finally found a bc pill that is best suited for me, but still have battled with the monthly breakouts.</li>
            <li>This product is okay.</li>
            <li>While it appears others have had better luck than me, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend spending the money.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I love Olay.</li>
            <li>When I started using this product 5 weeks ago, I was in love.</li>
            <li>It seems that the magical effect it once had is diminishing.</li>
            <li>Olay spf 15 moisturizer (I&#x27;m giving you one more chance Olay).</li>
            <li>more effectively.&lt;br</li>
            <li>product saved my skin and gave me an overwhelming amount of confidence.</li>
            <li>Mostly I had itchy acne around my jawline that nothing seemed to help.</li>
            <li>No product has EVER been able to help me when Mother Nature is doing her thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve stumbled across this product.</li>
            <li>I was able to avoid most break outs.  </li>
            <li>I also follow it in the evenings with Olay&#x27;s moisturizer, just to make sure I stay moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I used this product for about six weeks, until most of it was gone.</li>
            <li>I have tried many many products including proactiv that did nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>I am feeling more confident in my skin, and I am just so excited to see what my face will look like in four weeks!  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this product since it claims it is geared for adults with acne.  </li>
            <li>In just two days I noticed a very significant difference in my face.</li>
            <li>Acne treatment kits were first made successful by Proactive, and now it seems like everyone is selling these kits with 3-4 steps that promise \\&quot;clear beautiful</li>
            <li>since I run out of the face cleaner coming with the machine, my face feels very clean and refreshed after cleaning.</li>
            <li>The first thing I loved was it did not have benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>OH AND PLEASE DON&#x27;T DICONTINUE IT OR NEW AND IMPROVE IT ITS GREAT</li>
            <li>The best part about it was that it didn&#x27;t dry her skin out like others.  </li>
            <li>It provides the perfect amount of acne medication without leaving the skin dry.</li>
            <li>i ve found my eternal skin care thanks olay and with amazon i ve get the best price with fast delivery</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to products using benzoyl peroxide and was happy to see an acne skin care line that didn&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>One positive thing about this product is that it says it&#x27;s good for controlling oily skin.</li>
            <li>This product has done a wonderful job of evening out my skin tone, texture, clarity and has significantly lightened and evened the left over marks.  </li>
            <li>I was more comfortable with -</li>
            <li>I am in love with the step 3 lotion; it does tingle on application but leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love it when my skin feels light and tingly and it just didn&#x27;t feel that way with this wash</li>
            <li>While I almost always have had great results with Olay facial products, I was sure these products were most suited for those in their teens and twenties.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m happy with the protocol.  </li>
            <li>But so far I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>is the first product I&#x27;ve been able to use twice per day and not have any kind of dryness</li>
            <li>And so far I haven&#x27;t experienced any redness or drying out on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was apprehensive in purchasing it as it was kind of spendy, but it has been well worth it.</li>
            <li>I am right now LOVING this product.</li>
            <li>- SO TRUE!</li>
            <li>Looking for my receipt to return Olay for a full refund!</li>
            <li>Once they had it, I received the item very quickly.</li>
            <li>i ve really liked it and it gives perfect results and a beautiful skin just after one week of using olay pro/x clear acne protocol ,my skin is very delicate and finaly</li>
            <li>Also, it smells really nice, which is a great change from other products.</li>
            <li>I am 25 and have battled with acne for years, and this system successfully helped to clear my skin.  </li>
            <li>And then there&#x27;s the lotion (step 3) which is exactly like the Oil of Olay popular serum.  </li>
            <li>On the first day I used it, I noticed a nice smoothness to my skin.</li>
            <li>But all you get is the fine print on the side of the box.</li>
            <li>I just ordered Dudu Osun black soap (I have heard wonderful things) and</li>
            <li>It is very mild and just feels like putting on a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I use up the cleanser more quickly than I use the lotions</li>
            <li>Ok first off I rarely leave reviews unless its something amazing.</li>
            <li>, I am a HUGE fan of Olay produts!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had been using it for about a week when I began getting these huge cysts on my face.  </li>
            <li>This along with my Clairsonic Mia makes a huge difference in the texture and clarity of  my skin, Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>Now, two weeks in, my face is CLEAR, definitely more even, and the thing I MOST love...</li>
            <li>My break-outs have stopped and my skin feels smooth and even-toned.</li>
            <li>We have been going through Neutrogena products for years trying to find a some-what cheap solution... not happening.</li>
            <li>This product is gentle, yet effective.</li>
            <li>also feel that this kit could use some kind of gentle exfoliant in the cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It seems to smooth away impurities.</li>
            <li>I have not seen much of a difference honestly.</li>
            <li>face does feel smooth and not greasy to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Result - a month later, the redness around my nostrils is not gone but greatly diminished.</li>
            <li>any kind really)</li>
            <li>I finish this regimen with Acne Free terminator spot treatment</li>
            <li>I do wish they would sell all the products sepratly and would make it available in stores.</li>
            <li>My face is smooth and even-toned.</li>
            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz]] in the shower.  </li>
            <li>so I contacted Olay (via their website) who confirmed the product had been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things :)</li>
            <li>it might not have looked better right away</li>
            <li>Also, an added bonus is that Olay is offering a $15 rebate on this product right now. :)</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!</li>
            <li>I always feel like I get a better clean and fresh skin feeling when I use a toner before moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Treatments I have used in the past like benzoyl peroxide have always done more harm to my skin than good, so this salicylic acid acid has been a nice change.  </li>
            <li>My face skin is absolutely fabulous, clean and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Quick easy, cleanser, day or night treatment.  </li>
            <li>it is quick easy and doesn&#x27;t break me out or irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>Since this is an Olay product I was pretty sure it would work well.  </li>
            <li>My original cystic acne I&#x27;ve had now for two months and</li>
            <li>The name never sounded that appealing to me, I always have had oily skin and anybody that puts \\&quot;oil\\&quot; on their name is not going to be the first product I grab</li>
            <li>So I was excited to give this a try.     </li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I had read the reviews on this product and was so excited that Oil of Olay came out with an Acne treatment system.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed a significant difference in 2 days.</li>
            <li>The first week I had breakouts from Pro-Active and this stuff cleared it up without causing more blemishes.</li>
            <li>My skin has cleared significantly.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant reduction in breakouts (almost none), and if I did get one or two blemishes, it would go away within a day or two, unlike before where it could even take up to a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have successfully used Olay&#x27;s cleansers and moisturizers since I was a teen, so I was really excited when I found out they are now making an acne kit.</li>
            <li>My face feels smoother and clean and the breakouts have lessened significantly.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make my skin feel clean at all.</li>
            <li>Clean out your pores and bring everything to a head, so to speak.</li>
            <li>It took 2 weeks for it to start working , as with any skin regimen, and my skin got worse before it got better, but it works great!</li>
            <li>never felt that washing my face with the product that my face was truely clean (hope that makes sense)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The face wash doesn&#x27;t make my face totally clean (I guess because it is a cream).</li>
            <li>I bought the Olay Spinbrush thing (like the Clarisonic) and use that at night, so that seems to help with it feeling clean.</li>
            <li>The cleanser did not make my face feel clean at all</li>
            <li>After using the product for one week I started to get more and more pimples, I thought that maybe it was bringing out all the impurities and that they would eventually clear up</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say my face feels clean.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I feel like it doesn&#x27;t get my skin as clean as I like.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so amazingly clean when I use the cleanser.</li>
            <li>I loved that it did not dry my face.  </li>
            <li>It did not dry my face out like it warned it might, so that was good.</li>
            <li>My skin even from the first use looked much more clear and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li>But for those of us who have less than perfect skin need Acne.org&#x27;s regiman first.</li>
            <li>The chin is my problem area and with special attention and time, it is clearing that up.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser does not create any nice soap, but it does make your skin feel clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>I experienced absolutely no drying out of my skin, and my acne cleared up within a week.  </li>
            <li>but I had a huge one on my laugh line</li>
            <li>As a teenager I had beautiful skin-it wasn&#x27;t until my early 20s/1st pregancy that it went wild.</li>
            <li>Overall, though, I think it is a good product</li>
            <li>I really like the renewal lotion (more like a gel then a lotion).  </li>
            <li>The cleanser however (step 1) requires more at each use and therefore is used up much faster.</li>
            <li>I thought this might be a good solution for me since I did not want to go back to using Proactiv, which I used about 3-5 years.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I think it is a good product</li>
            <li>If Olay had more reasonable prices for the cleanser sold separately, I would stick to their products.  </li>
            <li>It is really deceptive for a reputable company to release a line of product and get people&#x27;s hopes up.</li>
            <li>my skin looks a whole lot better.  </li>
            <li>It has been traumatic to say the least because I had perfect skin as a teenager and my confidence never suffered.</li>
            <li>and I cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is really gentle and while I like it, I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>I thought this might be a good product to try, but after using it I have mixed feelings about it.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>Would it work for a full blown acne problem?</li>
            <li>Before using this product my skin wasn&#x27;t perfect in the least bit</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, I had very large, almost cystic-like pimples on my cheeks and forehead that hurt  upon touching them.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price and worth trying!</li>
            <li>It seemed to work for most people and it seemed as if it was specifically geared for individuals who were older with acne</li>
            <li>For me, I guess I wasn&#x27;t one of the lucky ones.</li>
            <li>The system is very similar to ProActiv, in terms of the 3-step use (and even the way the product feels/smells) but with Olay, you don&#x27;t have to subscribe and keep getting charged each month for more and more product.  </li>
            <li>Olay Professional Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol is a great skin cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I am confident that with continued use her skin will remain clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>The treatment lotion goes on well and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The cleanser also is excellent, and you only need a tiny amount.  </li>
            <li>I never felt like Step 1 did an adequate job in cleaning my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay product, but definitely not the best/a magic fixer/worth the price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that this is a product for most people with acne since sebum is one of the main culprits of acne.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Pro-X for three weeks now and my acne and skin texture has improved tremendously.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super upset about this.</li>
            <li>It has helped tremendously with evening out my skin tone and keeping the redness at bay.</li>
            <li>I maintain a healthy diet, exercise and although I have a high stress level</li>
            <li>I really like Olay products and was kind of excited to hear about this new acne protocol.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m 24 and bizarrely have started breaking out with cystic acne for the first time.</li>
            <li>I felt like there was more cream in the little tube that I couldn&#x27;t get to, and I cut the top of the cleanser container and there was easily another two weeks worth of cleanser that I could have thrown away when I couldn&#x27;t get it to squeeze out!</li>
            <li>I know that the active ingredient in this product, salicylic acid, is supposed to be the best thing for keeping skin clear, so it seems like this product should work.</li>
            <li>Right now I only have a couple of scars, that are fading more and more each day.</li>
            <li>Ran right out to get it and paid full price $50.</li>
            <li>This stuff worked great for me at first, my bottles are close to empty.  </li>
            <li>So I bought into Olay&#x27;s commercial about being specially formulated for \\&quot;adult acne\\&quot; and thought this product would be great.</li>
            <li>I love the Olay Pro Clear products!  </li>
            <li>I had an appointment to meet with a dermatologist before I purchased this product, after the first night, no need for that appointment!</li>
            <li>I would be nice if it did work as I would like to be able to use it, but have instead turned to one I have used previously from another manufacturer.    </li>
            <li>Very soft and smoothe and the products are very creamy and have a nice feel to them.</li>
            <li>Lol, little do they know - without this stuff my skin would be a disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>My skin looks great, helps keep those few breakouts at bay and its controlling oil in this heat.  </li>
            <li>And the last step renewing lotion is amazing.</li>
            <li>I discontinued use, bought a gentle para-fan free cleansing bar and began using that after a woman at work recommended it.  </li>
            <li>I no longer have trouble with breakouts and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>My teenage son &#x27;absconded&#x27; with the kit and the results have been amazing for him as well.  </li>
            <li>I have traditionally loved Olay products for sensitive skin and wanted to try this for my adult acne.  </li>
            <li>Rarely get a pimple</li>
            <li>I feel so fresh.</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>If I could find another product that was able to clear my skin and did not test on animals, I would switch in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li>I love this Olay Pro-x clear.</li>
            <li>However it is far better than Proactiv which can damage and irritate skin.</li>
            <li>Also, my skin is much dryer than in my younger years, and I suspected the lotion would best be suited for younger skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin regime:  Rinse my face several times with warm water  </li>
            <li>Oh and btw the Pro-X made tiny zits pop up all over my forehead, yea that was a nice surprise</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;ll be interesting if the Olay Professional Acne treatement system can get rid of it</li>
            <li>I paid $40 for the kit which just isn&#x27;t worth it to me when the Proactiv kit costs me $60 for a 2 month cycle.</li>
            <li>im not 100% clear like i would love to be (its been about 4 days since i started AMBI)</li>
            <li>I rarely have blemishes now, and no one believes me when I say I have \\&quot;problem skin\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>After they came out with the types for more sensitive skin, I switched to that.</li>
            <li>Adult acne is embarrassing and this combo is working most of the time.  </li>
            <li>and I feel like it has helped to clear and prevent most of my acne.</li>
            <li>The clearing lotion is much more cream-like than the moisturizer which is like a clear serum and not so loition-like.</li>
            <li>They did me one better, they gave me a whole regimen that really works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, for the products themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANSER: This is the most sensitive and calming cleanser I have used, and I have used Cetaphil, FAB etc.</li>
            <li>I wish Olay would sell the acne treatment by itself, as I will run out of that first, &amp; still have almost full step 1 and step 3, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>get about 3 months use out of each kit, so for me it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>After a while of using the trio, I started getting some more breakouts, then realized that it&#x27;s because my skin was becoming too dry and that dryness was causing the breakouts.  </li>
            <li>For the first two-weeks I had a pretty significant breakout and I wanted to stop using it</li>
            <li>But it was very refreshing and didn&#x27;t burn or dry out my face.</li>
            <li>My skin was softer and it cleared up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I had that this product seemed to help cause cleared up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>My face is fairly oily and I have ever present blackheads it seems, which are the main cause for my pimples.  </li>
            <li>I didnt expect results right away.  </li>
            <li>And, indeed, I turned out to be right.  </li>
            <li>I am waiting for the dreaded post-cycle week to see if I break out or not - I&#x27;ll update this review if I experience a breakout but right now, I&#x27;m hopeful that this protocol has solved my acne problem.</li>
            <li>I did not like how the cleanser really didn&#x27;t make my face feel clean.</li>
            <li>After seeing all of the great reviews and having used Olay facial moisturizers faithfully for a few years now with great results, I had really high hopes for this acne protocol, but for me it didn&#x27;t live up to them.  </li>
            <li>It can be hard finding acne products that work on everyone, but for me, this so far has been the best.</li>
            <li>Threw it out this morning and went back to good old Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>Overall, the product really wasn&#x27;t all that effective for me.  </li>
            <li>I used Benzaclin for years, and it worked wonderfully, but in the last year or so, it became too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 37 and have sensitive, very oily, acne prone skin with most breakouts being hormonal.</li>
            <li>I keep my makeup light, and would prefer to just use tinted moisturizer if I didn&#x27;t require pounds of cover-up just to feel comfortable walking outside.</li>
            <li>What I really liked about this system was that it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin like some others.  </li>
            <li>The moisturizer has some kind of talc-like substance suspended in it that makes your skin look dry and pasty.</li>
            <li>It did take a few weeks to notice a pleasant change, and my skin has continued to improve over time.  </li>
            <li>I love that they created this for adults because it seems like someone finally got it right.</li>
            <li>I am 45 and in great physical shape, so it&#x27;s not diet related, more hormone related.</li>
            <li>I had been using this product since the end of January and was extremely excited to see clear results since others have had success with it.</li>
            <li>, I use it twice a day and its fine on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would be mild enough for my sensitive skin, but effective for acne.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really use products like this one, but I have liked Olay products I have tried in the past, so I gave ths one a try and was not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li>I added Neutrogena&#x27;s Pore Refining Toner to my regimen and at the end of week three my skin is almost completely clear and my normally huge pores are almost nonexistent.</li>
            <li>(use 1-3x a day) and only using it once a day because I think more than that would be too drying.</li>
            <li>I started noticing this within the first week.</li>
            <li>This one, however, from Olay is really doing what it promised to do!</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon Vine, for giving me this to review!</li>
            <li>Over the next day or so I noticed that my skin was visibly more oily than before</li>
            <li>About a week in that is exactly what happened.</li>
            <li>Most of the redness I had before has toned down/gone and my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li>great product that I would recommend for woman in their late 30&#x27;s that still suffer from acne.</li>
            <li>So far I have gotten more acne than I normally get</li>
            <li>Use it consistently, and it will work.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I am writing a review for any skincare product.  </li>
            <li>I first started trying this about two weeks ago</li>
            <li>It never totally got rid of the breakouts but it controlled them better and they were not as severe.   </li>
            <li>I am very impresssed with this product and have subscribed to getting it every 3 months now!</li>
            <li>Went back to docs and was put on more gels and antibiotics</li>
            <li>My acne recently turned a bit more cystic.  </li>
            <li>My first &#x27;set&#x27; lasted me 6 weeks.    </li>
            <li>I used it once a day for the first five days and twice a day thereafter.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>The first day I did not see any difference.   </li>
            <li>The second day I had more breakouts than before I used it.</li>
            <li>When a blemish has appeared, the acne cream worked exactly how it was suppose to, also.  </li>
            <li>I only wish this acne set existed decades ago when I really needed it! :)</li>
            <li>The gel lotion (step 3) was something that I stopped using after the first two times.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure some of its existence could be attributed to external forces in my life and not just genetics, but it is what it is.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see or feel any difference from this higher priced product and the Oil of Olay lower priced products.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in years, I do not have to use a liquid foundation for my makeup.</li>
            <li>so I use a different one that seems to lather up and take off my makeup better.</li>
            <li>Olay usually has great products, so when this line came out I was very hopeful.</li>
            <li>In the interm, and attempts to clear up my face, I found a cheap product, \\&quot;Acne</li>
            <li>I miss it so much!  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say I&#x27;m the one who tries everything looking for \\&quot;the</li>
            <li>I say go to Acne.org first before trying this product.</li>
            <li>Cleanser and Skin Clearing Treatment felt good on my skin (not too heavy or greasy), but when I first applied the Complexion Renewing Lotion to my skin</li>
            <li>I have oilier skin, more blackheads and red pimples then ever.   </li>
            <li>in a pretty borwn and beige bottle johnson&amp;johnson make it).</li>
            <li>In the evening I just use a forming cleanser first to get all the makeup off my eyes, then follow with this cleanser all over.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First start with the cleaner, I used it with my Clarisonic mia</li>
            <li>I plan on adding a handheld cleansing scrubber so that I stop touching my face entirely.    </li>
            <li>First off, the face wash leaves your skin feeling oily and unclean.</li>
            <li>You have to be consistent though.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be working pretty well</li>
            <li>The first day I noticed improvment.</li>
            <li>Now after one month of using all 3 products every day my skin has never been so clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>Possibly but can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased to have found an over the counter product that finally works without drying my skin out and harming my skin texture.</li>
            <li>No way I was going to continue using it if it did this much damage in one week!</li>
            <li>but it really worked!</li>
            <li>It really changed my life!</li>
            <li>suffer from stress related break outs; because of that I have had more issues with acne in my 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>My problem is that i ran out and tried to buy more, i looked at local drugstores and the olay website.  </li>
            <li>This product has worked great on both my daughter AND my son&#x27;s acne problems with slightly oily and yet sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>I mainly suffered from breakouts in the chin and forehead area and those areas are now completely clear and I am seeing the gradual fading of old marks which I am thrilled about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I still have the occasional pimple, but this has worked better for me than Murad, Proactiv, Clean &amp; Clear etc.</li>
            <li>i was very excited about olay coming out with the new pro X clear.</li>
            <li>Long story short, I started using this a week ago and have seen significant improvement over my Clinique regimen (though I still love Clinique!).  </li>
            <li>but alas the good effects are now dwindling to an end!</li>
            <li>I love my Olay products, but this system is a great disappointment.</li>
            <li>I do consider this a huge success because I was already on a 3 step regimen from Clinique for the last year (salicylic cleanser, salicylic toner and benzoyle peroxide face moisturizer) and was continuing to break out a week after my cycle.  </li>
            <li>My skin is naturally oily and the cleanser does not leave my skin feeling sweaky clean.</li>
            <li>I really want to believe it works, but i just dont see enough clarity to know for sure its working.</li>
            <li>If you REALLY want to treat acne, at whatever cost, I would recommend the Obagi Cleanziderm system (very pricey but worth it), or a product line called Vivant sold at skin care clinics.  </li>
            <li>but it just did nothing positive for me.</li>
            <li>however I haven&#x27;t used it that long so I&#x27;m not 100% sure.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed my complexion becoming smoother and my red acne scars are fading away.</li>
            <li>With my pores still clogged after using this step I opted to use Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst Surge Energizing Power Cleanser which has made my skin feel much softer and cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product, hopeful that it would work or at least give my skin a nice clean.  </li>
            <li>so I checked the ingredient list and sure enough, the lotion contains dimethicone (a silicone) which is the main ingredient in my hair serum.</li>
            <li>At 17 years old, we&#x27;re wondering if this product is suitable for our younger skin?</li>
            <li>But the results are worth it, especially if you have something special to get ready for.</li>
            <li>Its about $5 at Walmart for a large bottle</li>
            <li>It helps my acne to disappear faster but certainly doesn&#x27;t prevent it from forming.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised when I first used this and discovered it to be more of a gel as opposed to a traditional lotion.  </li>
            <li>have different amounts of each product, so you will run out of one (or more) steps before you run out of the others and you&#x27;ll end up having to buy a new kit, as the don&#x27;t sell the steps separately.</li>
            <li>I guess, I would pay the more expensive price for the better products out there!</li>
            <li>Overall a good product and quick results, I used it every night and noticed a difference less than a week!</li>
            <li>As mentioned before, my bc pills have switched, so I&#x27;m not sure if this has to do with my face clearing up as well, but I do feel that my skin feels much more resilient and clean.</li>
            <li>Tried Proactive, clean &amp; clear, neutrogena, ddf, and Bliss&#x27;s new \\&quot;no zit Sherlock\\&quot;, etc.  </li>
            <li>Some comments about the products-     1)Cleanser- does not foam (which I know can bother some people), very soothing, not drying.     </li>
            <li>but really didn&#x27;t think it would shrink my pores.</li>
            <li>that since I had spent the money on the product I should use it for a couple more days to see if it starts to improve.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li>and a week in, my face was absolutely noticeably clearer.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this product</li>
            <li>and I took care of the whole thing over the phone.</li>
            <li>but it really worked for me.</li>
            <li>When I started, my skin was currently in its best condition, having just cleared up the last monthly blemish (they usually only last about 3 days).  </li>
            <li>So i choose to refund the product after so much wishful thinking.</li>
            <li>It worked very well for me.  </li>
            <li>My teen-aged daughter was having real issues with oily skin.  </li>
            <li>-- I really believe that this does work for me.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product, and based on others&#x27; reviews, I thought I would.</li>
            <li>Also, Amazon was VERY helpful and fast when I had a problem with my shipment.</li>
            <li>They do offer a money-back guarantee, so really you have nothing to lose</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t try my skin out once I started using step 2 once a day as directed for those of us that don&#x27;t have really oily skin.     </li>
            <li>I made it through the month but didn&#x27;t really have anything to spare.</li>
            <li>I have used the serum for years and really like it.      </li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t like the way my skin felt after using the wash.</li>
            <li>but I really think it was bringing all of the jusnk that had been cloggin my pores up and out...</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really know what that is about.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, it just looks very shiny.  </li>
            <li>I really do.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 6 weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li>In addition my skin had become very oily looking.</li>
            <li>So, I went searching for products that didn&#x27;t contain as much benzoyl peroxide and promised to be gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I used the cleanser as instructed (not too much</li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>I really wish Olay would resume the Definity line.</li>
            <li>it was similar to Practive, and shipping was free.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m on my 3rd box of this since it became available</li>
            <li>I bought it when it has $10 coupon something so altogether $15.XX for the whole box.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t have very troublesome skin, so if that is you, I don&#x27;t want to just take a guess as to if this fixes it or not.</li>
            <li>We really like it in our family.</li>
            <li>my son wants it now.</li>
            <li>As an update, I have bought the product twice, and have come to realize that Olay really, really needs to sell the products separately.  </li>
            <li>and it was getting really embarassing to go to work with teenager-like acne.</li>
            <li>(they work really well for me - should have stuck to it) and my skin has started clearing up - so I could breathe a sigh of relief when I look into the mirror now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I dont care much for the cleanser.</li>
            <li>and I prefer products that are gentle.  </li>
            <li>I really wish they would sell the lotion by itself.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear much make-up</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now and can&#x27;t really make up my mind on it.  </li>
            <li>I really like Olay products.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really help my \\&quot;bump\\&quot; problem.</li>
            <li>I really like this kit but wish they sold the lotions separately.</li>
            <li>and I never saw as much improvement as I was hoping for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it REALLY does its job without causing irritation.</li>
            <li>It really</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had acne most of my teen and adult years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 22 years old, have had acne since I was 10 and have been looking for the magical product that will finally  just make it go away.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that in some areas I have broken out more, but on Olay&#x27;s website they said you might break out more because it is unclogging everything and bringing it all to the surface.</li>
            <li>I saw the commercial for the product and thought I should take a chance with something that might be better for my 25 year old skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different products to clear my skin, even my skin tone, and prevent breakouts and NOTHING has worked like this stuff works.</li>
            <li>Since there were no detailed instructions included, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was supposed to use the renewing lotion (#3) right after the skin clearing treatment (#2) or not, so sometimes I did</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to purchase another whole set until I have used up more of the other products.    </li>
            <li>I was excited to get this product for Christmas because my acne suddenly worsened after the summer.</li>
            <li>I am 23 and I have tried so many other products and treatments including- proactive, clearsil, neutrogena, acnefree, and aveeno.</li>
            <li>I say this but keep in mind, I do love the Oil of Olay product line but think you can gain the benefits of Olay from their other products.</li>
            <li>and I was excited to start using it despite the mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>has worked or even helped any more than the other.</li>
            <li>I had an initial purging that lasted about two or three weeks, but it was so worth it!</li>
            <li>I use this 3 step system in conjunction with an exfoliating glove and my Clairisonic (two other products that I love).</li>
            <li>The lotion seemed to make my skin extremely oily/greasy, &amp; contributed to more breakouts.</li>
            <li>The cleanser works well enough although I wanted to mention it doesn&#x27;t foam or give you that &#x60;squeaky clean&#x27; feel that some people look for.  </li>
            <li>I plan on continuing to use it as it is a reasonable price and is doing an decent job.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought the cleanser in this set would be the only item I would often use, since I rarely get blemishes any longer.  </li>
            <li>usually clean my face in the shower, heat &amp; Steam open up the pores something</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, fair, dry, clog-prone, acne-prone skin with a tendency for it to get blotchy and red.</li>
            <li>After the first application, I could feel the swelling go down and knew that it was gentle on my skin but strong against the acne.</li>
            <li>Now I have too much lotion to justify spending the money to buy a whole new kit.</li>
            <li>One good thing though, is that it isn&#x27;t super expensive</li>
            <li>I am 41, Caucasian with sensitive skin, I have had acne my entire life but have been able to control it with Neutrogena products.[[ASIN:B000EPA4FW Neutrogena Complete Acne Therapy System]]</li>
            <li>In addition, I was using the Clinique \\&quot;Even Better Dark Spot</li>
            <li>You HAVE to use it religiously for one full month before you will see the results your looking for.</li>
            <li>I have had more success with just plain water and sensitive soap</li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t like is that i have to buy the whole kit again where I live.</li>
            <li>so I end up having to buy a whole new kit.</li>
            <li>Eventually I began running out of product a week or two before I received more, and customer service couldn&#x27;t have cared less.</li>
            <li>And until someone commented on the evenness of their skin tone/texture, did I realize that my skin does look less blotchy and more uniform in color.</li>
            <li>&quot;  The cream does have a slight scent; I didn&#x27;t find it to be a perfume smell, more of a soap scent.  </li>
            <li>And if I do, they&#x27;re very, very tiny and go away quickly.</li>
            <li>I have occasional mild acne flare-ups.</li>
            <li>My main problem was and still is cystic acne on my chin.</li>
            <li>Try it, and if it works for you then that&#x27;s awesome, and if not don&#x27;t be too disappointed because it seems to be a pretty even split.</li>
            <li>The only thing that is better or bigger is the price.    </li>
            <li>So overall, I have not seen much change, and I don&#x27;t find it worth the money.</li>
            <li>Best of all I didn&#x27;t think it had any nasty chemical smell like so many acne products do.</li>
            <li>i have oily skin in my T-Zone and mainly breakout on my cheeks</li>
            <li>But, the main part is step 2 with the salicylic acid.</li>
            <li>To avoid touching my face (your fingers produce a lot of oil, and that clogs pores), I apply the second and third step with cotton pads.</li>
            <li>This might be a good line for you if your skin is not the least bit sensitive, but it DESTROYED my skin.</li>
            <li>this particular one.</li>
            <li>I have tried proactive (highly allergic) and</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend all of those products, plus the Regenerist Anti-aging Eye Roller.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly reccommend you use this system.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I really, really wish you could buy the products separately because the other two are fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is nice, just like the other olay daily serum.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 35 years old and have tried everything to clear my mild adult acne from proactiv, exposed, and prescription medications.</li>
            <li>(I added the use of the Olay moisturizer just for around my eyes and mouth/lips, since I always need a little more moisturizer.)</li>
            <li>Thank you OLAY for creating an ADULT acne product while keeping aging and skin in mind!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little unclear if you should be doing this in the morning, at night, more than once, etc.  </li>
            <li>Talk about an unexpected benefit!!  </li>
            <li>Hmm, interesting, guess I will observe a little bit longer.</li>
            <li>i wanted to try a new product to help with my skin now that i am also getting older.   </li>
            <li>Pros:  my skin feels clean without being dry.  </li>
            <li>This product helped to clear my skin fast.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, I feel like I&#x27;m going to run out of the moisturizer early if I don&#x27;t really watch the amounts.</li>
            <li>I could not hide the breakouts no matter what I did and felt very self conscious interacting with people.</li>
            <li>and I really thought that this product would clear my skin once and for all</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and thanks to this product</li>
            <li>I would break out on almost a daily basis before, but now I rarely get any pimples.</li>
            <li>What I didn&#x27;t expect were the many tiny white heads I got in unexpected places on my skin - forehead, cheeks and nose.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally wear any foundation but would have to use a concealer on the breakouts</li>
            <li>I called to ask if an inital breakout was normal but the lady couldt comprehend me ???.</li>
            <li>Normally Oil of Olay is worth shelling out the extra dollars, but in this case it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I would recommend this, but everyone is different, so it may be worth a try.</li>
            <li>The step 2 is the most harsh.</li>
            <li>Many times, heavy creams are too heavy for my skin, causing more break outs.</li>
            <li>The wash was oily, the lotion was oily and I&#x27;m not sure what the 3rd step was good for.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the second step much as it is not needed, but the first step I use day and night.  </li>
            <li>I tend to have fairly normal skin...</li>
            <li>Everything dried my skin to the point of peeling, which in turn lead to more severe breakouts.</li>
            <li>her two months after her first using Olay Professional Pro-X Clear, I could see the results myself.  </li>
            <li>Now at 20 years old, my acne has subsided for the most part (except the annual menstrual break out) and dark spots remain.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, product was as expected.</li>
            <li>The treatment doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, and I actually feel it moisturizes more than the moisturizer itself</li>
            <li>It seems like its noraml to get your money back after atleast 3months if you read their minds right.</li>
            <li>Granted the percentage is less than other products of its kind but after using it for several weeks my face was clearer and stayed acne free.</li>
            <li>It was strange using the gel-like substance when you are used to cream, but it seemed to rub in fairly quickly and wasn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>Seeking advice from others, I asked my mom if she could see any difference in my skin, without mentioning the new protocol</li>
            <li>I get a new one almost every day.</li>
            <li>I tried this new system hoping to maybe even manage to eliminate those.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that I continue to get new pimples.  </li>
            <li>so I thought I would lay off the Proactiv and give this new product a try.   </li>
            <li>I have since tried a new product called AMBI</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for years and just thought I would try something new.  </li>
            <li>This step, according to the bottle, is supposed to \\&quot;reduce oil and penetrates pores to help prevent new acne from forming.\\</li>
            <li>I bought this product for maintenance purposes, as I generally have pretty clear skin</li>
            <li>From drug store to high end, I have tried to find something that did not damage my skin and that would actually clear up break outs.</li>
            <li>I definatley approve of Olay Pro Clear!</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear since I was a teenager!</li>
            <li>I can truly say my face is 100% clear after just one month of use!</li>
            <li>Overall, I would highly recommend this product-it has saved my skin!!</li>
            <li>I am SO happily surprised with this product!</li>
            <li>Cleared up a chronic case of adult acne like now!  </li>
            <li>I have been using the product for over 2 months and have been following the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>Most were small</li>
            <li>During the hot, humid summer, this lotion was the only lotion I could use on my face that didn&#x27;t prove to be too moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>This product made me break out even more than usual.  </li>
            <li>At first it didn&#x27;t seem like it was helping my acne at all, though my face instantly started feeling smoother.</li>
            <li>Traditional salicylic acid acne cream from other manufacturers are probably ok, as well, for cheaper.</li>
            <li>This product might perform miracles for some customers but it completely DESTROYED my skin!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>My skin actually looks healthy now and isn&#x27;t constantly in the back of my mind anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use the most gentle plain facial cleanser for removing make-up like foundation and cover up  </li>
            <li>I have tried other acne products for mature skin, including Proactive, but most made my skin red or burned it.</li>
            <li>There has been absolutely no improvement in my acne ( which is mild).</li>
            <li>Since a friend sells Mary Kay, I agreed to try the far more expensive Mary Kay products instead of the Pro-X Clear Acne product and while they worked were ten times more expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>2 lotion - this is a light lotion that contains the same anti-acne ingredient as the Total Effects lotion I used to love, and it is the secret to my clear skin!!!  </li>
            <li>I felt the face wash itself was too thin - I like something that lathers up a little better or even has a gritty texture to it which leaves my face feeling really smooth and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>Skin Clearing Treatment - to treat acne, clear up acne blemishes, and keep skin clear of new acne.</li>
            <li>However, after about a week, my old acne began to clear up, and the new acne began to subside as well.  </li>
            <li>I am acne free, have soft, glowing skin... and my pores while they are visible, they are a lot less noticable.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give the product adequate time to work before I hastily demanded my money back as Olay gives a money back guarantee.  </li>
            <li>it will clear up.  </li>
            <li>These areas were clear before I started the kit.</li>
            <li>They even include this lotion with the Pro X Clear trial kit that has the intensive refining sulfur mask.</li>
            <li>If my skin is clear, it seems clear, if it breaks out, it breaks out bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But nothing has worked for me like Oil of Olay Pro Clear.</li>
            <li>I have been using Proavtive for years and it was starting to become very ineffective at keeping my skin clear.</li>
            <li>My face is as clear</li>
            <li>I have been using Olay Pro Clear for about three weeks now</li>
            <li>Two tricks that I have learned to try to keep my skin clear are 1)</li>
            <li>My twin sister and I are trying to find a product that will clear our skin of acne, scars and redness.</li>
            <li>I am a 34 year old female who has been battling acne my whole life.  </li>
            <li>It did help clear up my skin somewhat, but you probably shouldn&#x27;t go into it expecting drastic results.</li>
            <li>clear leaves my skin soft and clear.</li>
            <li>but maybe like 85% clear now.</li>
            <li>skin is clear, even-textured, and even luminous after using this for about 9 months.  </li>
            <li>But her skin is clear about 90% of the time...</li>
            <li>it helps keep things clear.</li>
            <li>clear, Clinique, Murad and so on.</li>
            <li>Instead, try Philosophy Completely Clear Skincare System.</li>
            <li>Instead, I use the Boots gentle foam cleanser for sensitive skin (from Target) which actually cleans my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- both of these products seemed to help clear my skin</li>
            <li>I kept using it and by day 6 my face was clear.</li>
            <li>My face has been clear since using this product.</li>
            <li>started using Proactive 3 or 4 years ago; and it did clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product and it was old, expired.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your time ordering this product or using this seller.</li>
            <li>The appeal of this product was that it was for adult women.</li>
            <li>have tried chemical cleansers (proactive, shiseido, murad) and natural cleansers (st. ives) and spot treatments (eradikate).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have problem skin until after I had my children and was in my early twenties.</li>
            <li>I had resolved to go to the dermatologist after realizing that I needed some professional help.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had this occur since my early teens.</li>
            <li>At least from trying it I know for a fact benzoyl peroxide works better for me.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and allergies but have no reaction what so ever so all around</li>
            <li>As an adult acne sufferer, I look for products that can help keep my face clear.  </li>
            <li>Written by my wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 49 years old and have been using this product for a month now.</li>
            <li>Please note, I only use step 2 once a day as directed for those of us that don&#x27;t have really oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I am 35 years old and have dealt with acne since college.  </li>
            <li>(oil cleansing method), natural plants..</li>
            <li>This system is gentle enough to use twice a day, and my skin looks healthier now than it did even before I had acne.  </li>
            <li>I started using Olay Professional Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol</li>
            <li>After 5 weeks though, my acne is the same as, if not worse than when I started the recommended regimen.</li>
            <li>I saw Olay Professional Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol reviewed in In-Style Magazine</li>
            <li>I use the olay cleansing brush too and my skin is so soft now</li>
            <li>old skin that is sensitive, oily and acne prone.  </li>
            <li>As an adult, I get acne from time to time.  </li>
            <li>By this time you&#x27;ll be ready to invest in a second box.</li>
            <li>reduces enlarged pores, gives your skin a smoother texture and doesn&#x27;t break out sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I rather have clear skin than soft skin.</li>
            <li>It has cleared up my skin, however, hasn&#x27;t done anything as far as my hyperpigmentation</li>
            <li>I am truly surprised with this Olay set.  </li>
            <li>Just thought I&#x27;d give others a heads up if considering and are have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am a 30 year old woman who has been dealing with oily skin and breakouts since I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li>About two weeks ago I started using Olay Professional Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol after reading a review in one of my fashion magazines.</li>
            <li>Enter Olay Professional Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol--and after using it for a month straight, I give it a big MEH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She tried just about everything out there to get rid of minor, but consistent acne.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t detect what makes this product line \\&quot;Professional Pro-X\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I am 30 years old and never had acne as a teenager.</li>
            <li>I have tried nearly everything, from Proactive to Neutrogena to Clinique.</li>
            <li>I have been using the system for nearly 2 months now.</li>
            <li>In addition, my old scars have faded to the point that I&#x27;m no longer self conscious about leaving the house without foundation.  </li>
            <li>Corrector\\&quot; and it was not working fast enough to heal and lighten those acne scars.  </li>
            <li>I have had adult chin acne for years.  </li>
            <li>, im in my early 20&#x27;s and have been suffering since i was 12 from acne.</li>
            <li>my face has done a complete turn around.</li>
            <li>3 lotion - this product is the one that pleasantly surprised me.  </li>
            <li>I still feel like I need to wear makes up but much less...and it doesn&#x27;t make my oily skin extra oily or anything.</li>
            <li>All my old acne scarring and hyperpigmentation has reduced dramatically.</li>
            <li>I am 32 years old and started getting acne around 8 years ago.</li>
            <li>I have used the product for nearly a month</li>
            <li>Now that he has been using the Olay Professional Pro-X</li>
            <li>I am a 48 tear old women who still broke out like a teenager until I bought this kit a month ago.</li>
            <li>I am 40 years old and have been battling adult acne since I was 20.</li>
            <li>I tried this product in an effort to alleviate my adult acne.  </li>
            <li>I read that Olay developed this for adult acne.</li>
            <li>I am 17 years old</li>
            <li>I break out when I menstruate, my pores are now filled yucky fatty stuff, and my face is still oily.</li>
            <li>I am in my early twenties</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered Olay Professional Pro-X Clear three months ago, and I have been using it twice a day since.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all</li>
            <li>I noticed so far that this, garnier and Roc products don&#x27;t work well for my skin.</li>
            <li>The Olay Professional Pro-X Clear has worked WONDERS for my skin.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who has acne-prone skin or anyone who even gets the occasional breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>as it has the Salicylic Acid that I think was the cure for my adult acne all in one product</li>
            <li>/&gt;This seller was VERY prompt in their shipping, and I would definitely order from them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to admit I was surprised when I discovered the lotion was gel, and I had my doubts.</li>
            <li>I would now say that this product is worth a try because it is so simple to get your money back if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Well, I did continue to use the product hoping that my mom would be right, and unfortunately it did not get any better.</li>
            <li>Also, my skin is not dry at all using this product and only seems to get oily if the weather is hot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only going to continue to use this product for one more month, and only because of the other encouraging reviews.</li>
            <li>I tried proactive and some other acne products before which charged me a lot more but did not really work on my case, so you understand why.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars on other products and decided to invest in the Olay brand a couple of months ago and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>During the first few weeks, I did break out a little more</li>
            <li>I use a face wash I got from the person who I get facials from and have fairly clear skin when I use that and get a facial, but let&#x27;s be honest that&#x27;s getting pretty expensive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun including but not limited to: natures cure, pro active, clean n</li>
            <li>It made it worse at first, but from my time with dermatologists, I have learned that is typical for most acne products when you first start using them.</li>
            <li>I expected my skin to break out at first as it&#x27;s all coming to the surface so the acne kit can properly clear the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m going to be able to pick this product back up to try it again for the recommended four weeks...</li>
            <li>even in places that I never typically did like my cheeks.</li>
            <li>Third, the product (particularly step 2) has an odor to it that I did not care for.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While I do feel that the moisture level of my skin improved (especially with the Renewing Lotion), my main concern, the acne, did not improve whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I am 41 yrs old and have been battling acne for the last few years and recently my breakouts have been getting worse (welcome menopause years!)</li>
            <li>My pores are noticeably smaller, less break outs and the texture is so smooth.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser that I usually use has an exfolliant and it helps to make my face feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>I am a 34 year old redhead with sensitive, oily skin and moderate adult acne.</li>
            <li>Typically these products clean out the pores so breakouts get worse before they get better.  </li>
            <li>I dont normally have acne, but i am extremely susceptible to it with really oily skin...</li>
            <li>I was so excited to hear that Olay came out with these products because Olay is the only brand I typically use.</li>
            <li>for me, this was a big disappointment.[[ASIN:B004UDRUJW Olay Professional Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol]]</li>
            <li>The Olay Professional Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol Kit has cleared up her skin and has prevented breakouts for several weeks.  </li>
            <li>Overall my skin is much clearer than it was before and the overall texture has improved but it isn&#x27;t the miracle fix that I was praying that it would be.  </li>
            <li>Using this cream cleanser after using a different foaming cleanser is an extra step that I used to skip in the evening sometimes, but I found that it really makes a difference when I use it -</li>
            <li>I picked up the Olay pro-x with low expectations.... and WOW!   </li>
            <li>and I saw major improvements.  </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to make a major investment just to try it.</li>
            <li>some oiliness, but nothing major in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>During the first week, I noticed that I was getting an increase in blackheads and other breakouts.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s become more moderate in the past several months since I&#x27;ve stopped birth control.</li>
            <li>Olay Age Defying, Anti-Wrinkle Day Lotion with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum , SPF 15, 3.4 Ounce (</li>
            <li>I was a little surprised by the price, over $30 when it first came out (it has since come down), but I thought it was worth</li>
            <li>The other 2 boxes are not bad too, not sting, irritate or dry out my skin, but seems calm it down, and after 3,4 days, my acne start fading away.</li>
            <li>Other treatments focus on the power and strength of their ingredients but they just made my skin super sensitive and made my acne dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>The gel also has a slight smell; again it&#x27;s not a perfume smell, more of a slight gel-like odor.  </li>
            <li>reviews are mainly what i base my purchases on and i rely on them greatly.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive, so when I first put the lotion on it does burn a little.  </li>
            <li>First, a little about me: I am a female in my mid-twenties and have fairly oily skin which, in the past few months, has been acne-ridden.  </li>
            <li>At last I have clear skin.</li>
            <li>My forehead was clear as possible.</li>
            <li>I had a lone pimple sprout up a month back and started using Olay Pro X Clear immediately.</li>
            <li>This was actually my 2nd set of the Olay Clear Acne Protocol.</li>
            <li>It is the only thing that keeps my skin consistently clear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took a while for my skin to improve, but it has finally started to clear up.</li>
            <li>I am 23 years old, female, Asian-American.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it is baby soft and just so happens to look much younger.</li>
            <li>I am now 38 years old and still am prone to an occasional breakout every now and then.</li>
            <li>Although I never suffered from acne as a teen, I developed adult acne in my mid twenties and have suffered with it ever since.  </li>
            <li>I only use it once a day because I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I will be going back to Neutrogena Complete Acne Therapy System</li>
            <li>I have to preface this by saying I&#x27;ve only been using the treatment for just over a week, but here are my opinions so far:  </li>
            <li>However, in my early twenties, I started battling acne in different forms.</li>
            <li>My adult daughter has suffered with acne issue since she became a teen.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna start back to my old regiman which is from Acne.org.</li>
            <li>if she gets busy or lets it go for a day or two, she pays for it with some break-outs, but resumed use brings her skin back under control again!  </li>
            <li>, and this might simply be me being picky and not having used many different facial cleansers in the past</li>
            <li>and I went back to my old regimen - which includes Oil of Olay oil reducing face wash, toner and night cream along with Vicco Tumeric Cream</li>
            <li>I have oily sensitive skin and an allergy to Parabens, about a year ago olay dicontinued their acne wrinkle moisterizer I wrote to them begging to bring it back since it contained no parabens and worked well.</li>
            <li>Bought this last October to try Olay&#x27;s adult acne product and have used it in varying routines since.</li>
            <li>Iam 36 years old and never had acne as a teen</li>
            <li>After telling her about the protocol she offered the suggestion that maybe it gets worse before it gets better and</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t gotten better or worse.</li>
            <li>Nothing is more frustrating than being over 40 and feeling like you are going through puberty all over again.  </li>
            <li>My hands feel a little sticky and gross after applying it, but it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I have extremely oily skin and large, porous, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>Despite my difficulty, I do give Pro-X Clear two stars for a few positive reasons.</li>
            <li>I always run out of the face wash first and have tons left of the other two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Her face felt natural after using it, not tight or dry.  </li>
            <li>wish it would have worked for me, because I really don&#x27;t know what other products that I would use.</li>
            <li>I did find that I didn&#x27;t need to scrub my face because I didn&#x27;t flake and peel as much as with other products.</li>
            <li>I have now used up all of the facewash but still have PLENTY of both of the other products and refuse to pay again for the whole kit when all I need is the facewash.</li>
            <li>little and/or short lived success.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several prescription acne products including Benzaclin with little success.</li>
            <li>After a week of use I stopped applying the product, and several days later, my skin is now beginning to clear up.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The third step lotion they provided doesn&#x27;t really moisturize, especially when you have dry skin.</li>
            <li>I also want to specify that I only use it once a day (instead of the recommended twice daily) since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am a 26 year old that has recently been having skin problems, and I was convinced nothing short of a trip to the dermatologist would work.</li>
            <li>I went back to using my old acne medication w/benzyl peroxide for the actual acne treatment part.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the 3rd step lotion anymore, but have reverted back to my old face lotion - Elizabeth Arden Visible Difference.</li>
            <li>It does not dry my skin out at all</li>
            <li>I actually had more breakouts than normal, which was very frustrating.</li>
            <li>So I went back to my usual cleanser (Neutrogena deep clean) and used that with the treatment and lotion, and that has led to improvment.  </li>
            <li>(I prefer mineral spf).&lt;br /&gt;Right now, I&#x27;m using the Biore combination cleanser, Neutrogena rapid clear toner (although it&#x27;s a little harsh), Olay regenerist fragrence free serum, and the moisturizer from this kit.  </li>
            <li>Second, it seemed a little backward to wash your face, put medication on trouble spots, and then turn around and slather lotion on top of that.  </li>
            <li>Not worth buying the whole kit again...  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this product is worth a try.</li>
            <li>The first few days, I used it as directed</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me about two and a half months to get through my first package ( a little goes a long way with each part of the system), so I definitely feel it is worth the price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never managed to achieve perfectly clear skin, but for the past several years I&#x27;ve been using other Olay products that have kept it pretty much under control, aside from the occasional 1-2 hormonal related monthly blemishes.</li>
            <li>and although I still have breakouts, especially when I am hormonal, right before my cycle, etc., The overall appearance of my skin has improved and the time it takes for my breakouts to start to fade is just a few days.</li>
            <li>I hope they keep making this product because it has given me clear skin, which is something I&#x27;ve been trying to get for a long time!</li>
            <li>I used to use Vivant but can&#x27;t find it anywhere where I live anymore as the clinic I went to closed.  </li>
            <li>his skin is clear without leaving him with a rash or dry irritated skin.</li>
            <li>So given that I have dry, sensitive skin and my acne is hormonal</li>
            <li>and it cost less than 20 and lasts so much longer.</li>
            <li>After turning away from over the counter acne products and instead going to a Dermatologist, I found my skin to be overly sensitive, and overly dry.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my adult acne after having used Proactiv for years along with Olay Regererist when my skin became dry.  </li>
            <li>It did visibly helped fade some small, old acne scars I had on my chin, so this step also works really well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But over the weeks with my acne getting worse from this kit with two cystic pimples becoming five (and my forehead attacked with white heads which I still have to this day and refuse to go away), this product ended up burning my skin every time I put it on.</li>
            <li>It took about 6 weeks of constant use to see the final result for my daughter and as long as she keeps up with it, it works and keeps her clear...</li>
            <li>The cool thing is that every morning everything is not as red looking, and I am noticing less and less pimples.   </li>
            <li>Somehow, this super moisturizing lotion MAKES MY SKIN LESS OILY/ SHINY!!!  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I am very happy with the result I have received with Olay Pro X.</li>
            <li> This product is the best acne system I have tried to date.  </li>
            <li> and my wife thinks Olay has the greatest products on the market.</li>
            <li> you have BEAUTIFUL skin!!</li>
            <li> It took about 8 weeks for a noticable difference, but now my skin looks GREAT!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle cream, it does not work after one use, but if you keep using it you will be happy with the results!</li>
            <li> so that wasn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li> But after your skin adjusts, it is awesome!</li>
            <li> But I am very, very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am not too impressed.</li>
            <li> Really a great bundle!</li>
            <li> When the protocol kit arrived I started using it immediately and was very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-greasy and serves as the perfect primer for mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> Oil of Olay, I have to say, this isn&#x27;t your best system.  </li>
            <li> Awesome and</li>
            <li> And there was their make-up line (which I LOVED!!!)</li>
            <li> This may be perfect for you, or you may have to try again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 5 weeks ago and it is beyond great!</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is great!</li>
            <li> The lotion however, is probably the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> but this is the best product I have found.</li>
            <li> The results have been absolutely wonderful and with the added benefit of no &#x27;medicine&#x27; smell.  </li>
            <li> Very good!</li>
            <li> Hopefully, it works as well--I wish Olay still carried the Pro-X Acne products, I for one was extremely happy with them!</li>
            <li> This combination seems to work the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product is great!!  </li>
            <li> Love my olay!!!  </li>
            <li> This prduct is excellent and I got very good results.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still using it, with very good results.  </li>
            <li> the hormones in our body and if they&#x27;re not regulated with exercise and good diet, hormonal acne will always keep coming!  </li>
            <li> Good Luck!</li>
            <li> It is a good match for my skin!   </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so happy I did.  </li>
            <li> But to those that like it, great for you.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product.</li>
            <li> and I feel so great.</li>
            <li> It is just great.</li>
            <li> This product is working great for me.  </li>
            <li> That being said, it isn&#x27;t great at removing make-up.</li>
            <li> I have used it under make-up or alone and it makes my skin look great.  </li>
            <li> and I saw a lot of great reviews about this.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> The treatment smells great</li>
            <li> The price was great online, saved me $10.</li>
            <li> As that product worked great, I decided to stay with Olay and purchase this Protocol.  </li>
            <li> Either way, great product, I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy that I tried this Olay product.</li>
            <li> This cleared up my skin and the cystic acne so happy.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very nice.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t had issues with sensitivity, these products do not seem very effective.  </li>
            <li> I will say that it makes my skin feel very nice after I use it.  </li>
            <li> This regimen is amazing!</li>
            <li> I purchased this a week ago, and already am seeing amazing results!   </li>
            <li> My skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li> The lotion is really nice!  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed with how well this product works.  </li>
            <li> Great price, good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great if you have acne, but severe combo skin, beware!</li>
            <li> This system doesn&#x27;t even get your skin clean!!!  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy and does a good job of balancing out the treatment.</li>
            <li> I for one will never purchase this product again and in good conscience cannot recommend it.</li>
            <li> I know Olay is a good company</li>
            <li> I had read that salicylic acid was good to help get rid of milia.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped that with the ingredients in this Olay set that I would see some good results.  </li>
            <li> This light gel is perfect.</li>
            <li> This skin clearing system has been fantastic and has made me fee great!</li>
            <li> To be fair, my daughter is a type-1 diabetic</li>
            <li> I gave the Olay a shot since price wise</li>
            <li> Compared to Proactiv, the cost is good.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I thought Olay would be reliable and a good brand to try.</li>
            <li> i wish u all beautiful complexions &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I loved this and my skin has never looked better!  </li>
            <li> She is very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> and so I bought this product since I had read so many great things from the reviews.</li>
            <li> It feels good going on, but I honestly can&#x27;t say that it helped me.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad that I did!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>
            <li> :) Maybe it will help you too!</li>
            <li> Thanks! :D  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because Olay has an excellent reputation, and this is one acne program that seems to be geared more towards adults.    </li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, softer, and better looking than it has EVER been, in my life!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the step 3 moisturizing product!  </li>
            <li> LOVE this kit from Olay!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a satisfied customer for life!  </li>
            <li> I just had to say I LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I figured why not try one more thing!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> I previously used this awesome \\&quot;Reclaim\\&quot; product for years and years for anti aging benefits and it was awesome!</li>
            <li> Instead of using the face wash at night, I have started using Olay Definity Pore Refining Scrub, which is also an AMAZING product.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing product though if you can find the BP wash, Toner and Vitamin A.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam, but you rub it on your face with warm water and you can feel it working.  </li>
            <li> I have had nice skin,</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I contacted Oil of Olay to find out about refunding my money for this product and they were so nice about it.</li>
            <li> product is effective and I am seeing results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it is a good product</li>
            <li> Wash my face with just warm water and a wash cloth to get all of the makeup off  </li>
            <li> Clearing of acne, nice moisturizing of my aging</li>
            <li> I liked these products and their use is intuitive and self explanatory.  </li>
            <li> a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> nice.&lt;br /&gt;Small amount on my finger tip, spread over face, massage in circles over face and neck, this is the nice part.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> face feels nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product, and after having been using it for about 2 weeks now, I am loving this product.</li>
            <li> The cleanser itself feel kind of greasy, but it comes off without leaving a residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I had taken before pictures, but I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting this product to work so well.</li>
            <li> If you have mild acne this product may work great for you.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and the results, even though they took some time, it</li>
            <li> My skin also dries out very easily.</li>
            <li> and antibiotics (Also worked wonderfully, but I am hearing the dangers of them and trying to steer clear!)</li>
            <li> , the seller was awesome and the product shipped early!</li>
            <li> I noticed that most of the 4 and 5 star reviews for this product are from slightly older women, but I&#x27;m 25 and it has worked marvelously for my skin as well.</li>
            <li> This will clear it up and keep it that way, very impressed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a lot of acne regimens and this seems to have worked the best so far, and doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin at any time.</li>
            <li> I love using this its so amazing for my face.</li>
            <li> So now with my new routine plus olay&#x27;s product my skin is looking and feeling better by the minute, it hasn&#x27;t looked this great and under control in years!</li>
            <li> Five years ago I was on Accutane (worked wonderful, but NEVER AGAIN, the health problems I experienced were not worth it!)</li>
            <li> The first day that I used the product my skin felt great.</li>
            <li> This had pretty great reviews, so I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> When I came across this product, I noticed that it was salicylic acid, which  in the research I made is softer on the skin and good for mild cases.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written; I love this product!!</li>
            <li> i noticed a huge difference over night!</li>
            <li> I have tried Oil of Olay and for the most part it is okay, but i thought since this is geared toward acne</li>
            <li> The amount of outbreaks are increasing and outbreaks are more</li>
            <li> Love this for my African-American skin.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and I want to thank Olay for making it! :)</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love that...</li>
            <li> I would mostly breakout in the chin area.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It keeps the skin hydrated and does a better job of calming acne symptoms at a comparable price.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Throughout my life I&#x27;ve had perfect skin, but am now finding my post-menopausal skin having the occasional breakout.  </li>
            <li> but I was able to get more out of it.</li>
            <li> Be sure not to wear a favorite shirt while washing your face or even if you have the lotion on when you sleep.</li>
            <li> If i was able to buy the products separately, i would consider the cleanser and the gel, but would find another acne spot treatment.  </li>
            <li> I have used many products to control my acne, including Accutane.</li>
            <li> This system truly gives you the results you need, but keeps your skin hydrated, and looking healthy.</li>
            <li> but just the fact that my blood is able to flow and toxins are always coming out</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and waited more than a month for it to work.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Oil OF Olay because they got an award last year as the best anti wrinkle eyes cream.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s still out of control, it&#x27;s probably time to switch to another system better for your skin type.</li>
            <li> And with this product, how many uses do you get out of each bottle?  </li>
            <li> Well, I can&#x27;t say for sure if it has helped that yet.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, I love Oil of Olay products.</li>
            <li> I love Olay products</li>
            <li> I still love olay</li>
            <li> I started breaking out more after using this.</li>
            <li> The redness and marks are still prominent even after a month of continued use.</li>
            <li> Olay needs to introduce a &#x27;magic eraser&#x27; to address this problem:-)</li>
            <li> I have been using the Neutrotgena acne kit with better luck</li>
            <li> and I have broke out more.  </li>
            <li> I eventually began to find more affordable cleanser alternatives, and I turned to an acne cleanser from Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li> But I am satisfied with turning to another, more affordable alternative.</li>
            <li> But, from day 1, my skin felt better.</li>
            <li> I use a separate facewash to make sure I get all of my makeup</li>
            <li> The scrub in this product is much better at removing make-up and grime from my face than the Pro-X face wash.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I do love Olay...</li>
            <li> had hoped for more</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have tried everything under the sun for my skin.</li>
            <li> But since then, I have tried SO many products.</li>
            <li> I truly love this product.</li>
            <li> The lotion/acne treatment lotion are okay</li>
            <li> and it caused more breakouts.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing serum is my favorite.</li>
            <li> They recommended I purchase another product (Oil of Olay Refreshing Toner).  </li>
            <li> It was the only thing that ever made my skin look great!  </li>
            <li> The moisterizer is ok</li>
            <li> My skin looked significantly better in 2 days than it did with over 2 weeks use of Pro-X Acne from Olay.</li>
            <li> I would love to just be able to buy step 1 alone.</li>
            <li> (Most salicylic acid acne products you can get at the store contain anywhere between 1 - 2%)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ok, It&#x27;s been more than 2 weeks now since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> It was never terrible but never went away no matter what products I tried.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much for the sulphur spot treatment, but Burt&#x27;s Bees has a great spot treatment that I use on occasion before I use the Olay treatment cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched to a Philosphy line and have had much better results.</li>
            <li> BUT I still love it.  </li>
            <li> my skin is more moisturized and even-looking when I used the cleanser step from this kit.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I have never been able to use Oil of Olay moisturizer without breaking out, and the moisture lotion offered as part of this protocol is no acception.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it along with Olay Exfoliating Cleanser and the Pro X scrubber that help with better cleansing.  </li>
            <li> The price is so much better than drug stores or Walmart.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s just too many steps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue using this product until it is gone, but I don&#x27;t intend on buying any more of it.</li>
            <li> With Olay, I have the ability to purchase more product at my leisure.</li>
            <li> If I see better results in another month, I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
            <li> I bought this system and even enrolled in auto delivery because I was that confident in Olay.  </li>
            <li> sure my skin will always be oily</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as prominent as when I used this</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> But doesnt have SPF, so make sure you add</li>
            <li> I finished the kit, I noticed that my skin did have a more even tone and looked quite youthful</li>
            <li> I will be making another purchase for the same itme because it is listed at a great price!</li>
            <li> So love this product :)</li>
            <li> Most acne products he has tried either do not work or have caused him a lot of skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> I finally found a bc pill that is best suited for me, but still have battled with the monthly breakouts.</li>
            <li> This product is okay.</li>
            <li> While it appears others have had better luck than me, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend spending the money.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I love Olay.</li>
            <li> When I started using this product 5 weeks ago, I was in love.</li>
            <li> It seems that the magical effect it once had is diminishing.</li>
            <li> Olay spf 15 moisturizer (I&#x27;m giving you one more chance Olay).</li>
            <li> more effectively.&lt;br</li>
            <li> product saved my skin and gave me an overwhelming amount of confidence.</li>
            <li> Mostly I had itchy acne around my jawline that nothing seemed to help.</li>
            <li> No product has EVER been able to help me when Mother Nature is doing her thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve stumbled across this product.</li>
            <li> I was able to avoid most break outs.  </li>
            <li> I also follow it in the evenings with Olay&#x27;s moisturizer, just to make sure I stay moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used this product for about six weeks, until most of it was gone.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many products including proactiv that did nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> I am feeling more confident in my skin, and I am just so excited to see what my face will look like in four weeks!  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product since it claims it is geared for adults with acne.  </li>
            <li> In just two days I noticed a very significant difference in my face.</li>
            <li> Acne treatment kits were first made successful by Proactive, and now it seems like everyone is selling these kits with 3-4 steps that promise \\&quot;clear beautiful</li>
            <li> since I run out of the face cleaner coming with the machine, my face feels very clean and refreshed after cleaning.</li>
            <li> The first thing I loved was it did not have benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> OH AND PLEASE DON&#x27;T DICONTINUE IT OR NEW AND IMPROVE IT ITS GREAT</li>
            <li> The best part about it was that it didn&#x27;t dry her skin out like others.  </li>
            <li> It provides the perfect amount of acne medication without leaving the skin dry.</li>
            <li> i ve found my eternal skin care thanks olay and with amazon i ve get the best price with fast delivery</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to products using benzoyl peroxide and was happy to see an acne skin care line that didn&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> One positive thing about this product is that it says it&#x27;s good for controlling oily skin.</li>
            <li> This product has done a wonderful job of evening out my skin tone, texture, clarity and has significantly lightened and evened the left over marks.  </li>
            <li> I was more comfortable with -</li>
            <li> I am in love with the step 3 lotion; it does tingle on application but leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I love it when my skin feels light and tingly and it just didn&#x27;t feel that way with this wash</li>
            <li> While I almost always have had great results with Olay facial products, I was sure these products were most suited for those in their teens and twenties.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m happy with the protocol.  </li>
            <li> But so far I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> is the first product I&#x27;ve been able to use twice per day and not have any kind of dryness</li>
            <li> And so far I haven&#x27;t experienced any redness or drying out on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive in purchasing it as it was kind of spendy, but it has been well worth it.</li>
            <li> I am right now LOVING this product.</li>
            <li> - SO TRUE!</li>
            <li> Looking for my receipt to return Olay for a full refund!</li>
            <li> Once they had it, I received the item very quickly.</li>
            <li> i ve really liked it and it gives perfect results and a beautiful skin just after one week of using olay pro/x clear acne protocol ,my skin is very delicate and finaly</li>
            <li> Also, it smells really nice, which is a great change from other products.</li>
            <li> I am 25 and have battled with acne for years, and this system successfully helped to clear my skin.  </li>
            <li> And then there&#x27;s the lotion (step 3) which is exactly like the Oil of Olay popular serum.  </li>
            <li> On the first day I used it, I noticed a nice smoothness to my skin.</li>
            <li> But all you get is the fine print on the side of the box.</li>
            <li> I just ordered Dudu Osun black soap (I have heard wonderful things) and</li>
            <li> It is very mild and just feels like putting on a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use up the cleanser more quickly than I use the lotions</li>
            <li> Ok first off I rarely leave reviews unless its something amazing.</li>
            <li> , I am a HUGE fan of Olay produts!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had been using it for about a week when I began getting these huge cysts on my face.  </li>
            <li> This along with my Clairsonic Mia makes a huge difference in the texture and clarity of  my skin, Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Now, two weeks in, my face is CLEAR, definitely more even, and the thing I MOST love...</li>
            <li> My break-outs have stopped and my skin feels smooth and even-toned.</li>
            <li> We have been going through Neutrogena products for years trying to find a some-what cheap solution... not happening.</li>
            <li> This product is gentle, yet effective.</li>
            <li> also feel that this kit could use some kind of gentle exfoliant in the cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It seems to smooth away impurities.</li>
            <li> I have not seen much of a difference honestly.</li>
            <li> face does feel smooth and not greasy to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Result - a month later, the redness around my nostrils is not gone but greatly diminished.</li>
            <li> any kind really)</li>
            <li> I finish this regimen with Acne Free terminator spot treatment</li>
            <li> I do wish they would sell all the products sepratly and would make it available in stores.</li>
            <li> My face is smooth and even-toned.</li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz]] in the shower.  </li>
            <li> so I contacted Olay (via their website) who confirmed the product had been discontinued.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things :)</li>
            <li> it might not have looked better right away</li>
            <li> Also, an added bonus is that Olay is offering a $15 rebate on this product right now. :)</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!</li>
            <li> I always feel like I get a better clean and fresh skin feeling when I use a toner before moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Treatments I have used in the past like benzoyl peroxide have always done more harm to my skin than good, so this salicylic acid acid has been a nice change.  </li>
            <li> My face skin is absolutely fabulous, clean and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Quick easy, cleanser, day or night treatment.  </li>
            <li> it is quick easy and doesn&#x27;t break me out or irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> Since this is an Olay product I was pretty sure it would work well.  </li>
            <li> My original cystic acne I&#x27;ve had now for two months and</li>
            <li> The name never sounded that appealing to me, I always have had oily skin and anybody that puts \\&quot;oil\\&quot; on their name is not going to be the first product I grab</li>
            <li> So I was excited to give this a try.     </li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews on this product and was so excited that Oil of Olay came out with an Acne treatment system.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed a significant difference in 2 days.</li>
            <li> The first week I had breakouts from Pro-Active and this stuff cleared it up without causing more blemishes.</li>
            <li> My skin has cleared significantly.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant reduction in breakouts (almost none), and if I did get one or two blemishes, it would go away within a day or two, unlike before where it could even take up to a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have successfully used Olay&#x27;s cleansers and moisturizers since I was a teen, so I was really excited when I found out they are now making an acne kit.</li>
            <li> My face feels smoother and clean and the breakouts have lessened significantly.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my skin feel clean at all.</li>
            <li> Clean out your pores and bring everything to a head, so to speak.</li>
            <li> It took 2 weeks for it to start working , as with any skin regimen, and my skin got worse before it got better, but it works great!</li>
            <li> never felt that washing my face with the product that my face was truely clean (hope that makes sense)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The face wash doesn&#x27;t make my face totally clean (I guess because it is a cream).</li>
            <li> I bought the Olay Spinbrush thing (like the Clarisonic) and use that at night, so that seems to help with it feeling clean.</li>
            <li> The cleanser did not make my face feel clean at all</li>
            <li> After using the product for one week I started to get more and more pimples, I thought that maybe it was bringing out all the impurities and that they would eventually clear up</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say my face feels clean.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I feel like it doesn&#x27;t get my skin as clean as I like.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so amazingly clean when I use the cleanser.</li>
            <li> I loved that it did not dry my face.  </li>
            <li> It did not dry my face out like it warned it might, so that was good.</li>
            <li> My skin even from the first use looked much more clear and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li> But for those of us who have less than perfect skin need Acne.org&#x27;s regiman first.</li>
            <li> The chin is my problem area and with special attention and time, it is clearing that up.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser does not create any nice soap, but it does make your skin feel clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> I experienced absolutely no drying out of my skin, and my acne cleared up within a week.  </li>
            <li> but I had a huge one on my laugh line</li>
            <li> As a teenager I had beautiful skin-it wasn&#x27;t until my early 20s/1st pregancy that it went wild.</li>
            <li> Overall, though, I think it is a good product</li>
            <li> I really like the renewal lotion (more like a gel then a lotion).  </li>
            <li> The cleanser however (step 1) requires more at each use and therefore is used up much faster.</li>
            <li> I thought this might be a good solution for me since I did not want to go back to using Proactiv, which I used about 3-5 years.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I think it is a good product</li>
            <li> If Olay had more reasonable prices for the cleanser sold separately, I would stick to their products.  </li>
            <li> It is really deceptive for a reputable company to release a line of product and get people&#x27;s hopes up.</li>
            <li> my skin looks a whole lot better.  </li>
            <li> It has been traumatic to say the least because I had perfect skin as a teenager and my confidence never suffered.</li>
            <li> and I cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is really gentle and while I like it, I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li> I thought this might be a good product to try, but after using it I have mixed feelings about it.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> Would it work for a full blown acne problem?</li>
            <li> Before using this product my skin wasn&#x27;t perfect in the least bit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I had very large, almost cystic-like pimples on my cheeks and forehead that hurt  upon touching them.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price and worth trying!</li>
            <li> It seemed to work for most people and it seemed as if it was specifically geared for individuals who were older with acne</li>
            <li> For me, I guess I wasn&#x27;t one of the lucky ones.</li>
            <li> The system is very similar to ProActiv, in terms of the 3-step use (and even the way the product feels/smells) but with Olay, you don&#x27;t have to subscribe and keep getting charged each month for more and more product.  </li>
            <li> Olay Professional Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol is a great skin cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I am confident that with continued use her skin will remain clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> The treatment lotion goes on well and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The cleanser also is excellent, and you only need a tiny amount.  </li>
            <li> I never felt like Step 1 did an adequate job in cleaning my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product, but definitely not the best/a magic fixer/worth the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that this is a product for most people with acne since sebum is one of the main culprits of acne.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pro-X for three weeks now and my acne and skin texture has improved tremendously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super upset about this.</li>
            <li> It has helped tremendously with evening out my skin tone and keeping the redness at bay.</li>
            <li> I maintain a healthy diet, exercise and although I have a high stress level</li>
            <li> I really like Olay products and was kind of excited to hear about this new acne protocol.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m 24 and bizarrely have started breaking out with cystic acne for the first time.</li>
            <li> I felt like there was more cream in the little tube that I couldn&#x27;t get to, and I cut the top of the cleanser container and there was easily another two weeks worth of cleanser that I could have thrown away when I couldn&#x27;t get it to squeeze out!</li>
            <li> I know that the active ingredient in this product, salicylic acid, is supposed to be the best thing for keeping skin clear, so it seems like this product should work.</li>
            <li> Right now I only have a couple of scars, that are fading more and more each day.</li>
            <li> Ran right out to get it and paid full price $50.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked great for me at first, my bottles are close to empty.  </li>
            <li> So I bought into Olay&#x27;s commercial about being specially formulated for \\&quot;adult acne\\&quot; and thought this product would be great.</li>
            <li> I love the Olay Pro Clear products!  </li>
            <li> I had an appointment to meet with a dermatologist before I purchased this product, after the first night, no need for that appointment!</li>
            <li> I would be nice if it did work as I would like to be able to use it, but have instead turned to one I have used previously from another manufacturer.    </li>
            <li> Very soft and smoothe and the products are very creamy and have a nice feel to them.</li>
            <li> Lol, little do they know - without this stuff my skin would be a disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> My skin looks great, helps keep those few breakouts at bay and its controlling oil in this heat.  </li>
            <li> And the last step renewing lotion is amazing.</li>
            <li> I discontinued use, bought a gentle para-fan free cleansing bar and began using that after a woman at work recommended it.  </li>
            <li> I no longer have trouble with breakouts and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> My teenage son &#x27;absconded&#x27; with the kit and the results have been amazing for him as well.  </li>
            <li> I have traditionally loved Olay products for sensitive skin and wanted to try this for my adult acne.  </li>
            <li> Rarely get a pimple</li>
            <li> I feel so fresh.</li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> If I could find another product that was able to clear my skin and did not test on animals, I would switch in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I love this Olay Pro-x clear.</li>
            <li> However it is far better than Proactiv which can damage and irritate skin.</li>
            <li> Also, my skin is much dryer than in my younger years, and I suspected the lotion would best be suited for younger skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin regime:  Rinse my face several times with warm water  </li>
            <li> Oh and btw the Pro-X made tiny zits pop up all over my forehead, yea that was a nice surprise</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;ll be interesting if the Olay Professional Acne treatement system can get rid of it</li>
            <li> I paid $40 for the kit which just isn&#x27;t worth it to me when the Proactiv kit costs me $60 for a 2 month cycle.</li>
            <li> im not 100% clear like i would love to be (its been about 4 days since i started AMBI)</li>
            <li> I rarely have blemishes now, and no one believes me when I say I have \\&quot;problem skin\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> After they came out with the types for more sensitive skin, I switched to that.</li>
            <li> Adult acne is embarrassing and this combo is working most of the time.  </li>
            <li> and I feel like it has helped to clear and prevent most of my acne.</li>
            <li> The clearing lotion is much more cream-like than the moisturizer which is like a clear serum and not so loition-like.</li>
            <li> They did me one better, they gave me a whole regimen that really works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, for the products themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANSER: This is the most sensitive and calming cleanser I have used, and I have used Cetaphil, FAB etc.</li>
            <li> I wish Olay would sell the acne treatment by itself, as I will run out of that first, &amp; still have almost full step 1 and step 3, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> get about 3 months use out of each kit, so for me it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> After a while of using the trio, I started getting some more breakouts, then realized that it&#x27;s because my skin was becoming too dry and that dryness was causing the breakouts.  </li>
            <li> For the first two-weeks I had a pretty significant breakout and I wanted to stop using it</li>
            <li> But it was very refreshing and didn&#x27;t burn or dry out my face.</li>
            <li> My skin was softer and it cleared up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I had that this product seemed to help cause cleared up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> My face is fairly oily and I have ever present blackheads it seems, which are the main cause for my pimples.  </li>
            <li> I didnt expect results right away.  </li>
            <li> And, indeed, I turned out to be right.  </li>
            <li> I am waiting for the dreaded post-cycle week to see if I break out or not - I&#x27;ll update this review if I experience a breakout but right now, I&#x27;m hopeful that this protocol has solved my acne problem.</li>
            <li> I did not like how the cleanser really didn&#x27;t make my face feel clean.</li>
            <li> After seeing all of the great reviews and having used Olay facial moisturizers faithfully for a few years now with great results, I had really high hopes for this acne protocol, but for me it didn&#x27;t live up to them.  </li>
            <li> It can be hard finding acne products that work on everyone, but for me, this so far has been the best.</li>
            <li> Threw it out this morning and went back to good old Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> Overall, the product really wasn&#x27;t all that effective for me.  </li>
            <li> I used Benzaclin for years, and it worked wonderfully, but in the last year or so, it became too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 and have sensitive, very oily, acne prone skin with most breakouts being hormonal.</li>
            <li> I keep my makeup light, and would prefer to just use tinted moisturizer if I didn&#x27;t require pounds of cover-up just to feel comfortable walking outside.</li>
            <li> What I really liked about this system was that it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin like some others.  </li>
            <li> The moisturizer has some kind of talc-like substance suspended in it that makes your skin look dry and pasty.</li>
            <li> It did take a few weeks to notice a pleasant change, and my skin has continued to improve over time.  </li>
            <li> I love that they created this for adults because it seems like someone finally got it right.</li>
            <li> I am 45 and in great physical shape, so it&#x27;s not diet related, more hormone related.</li>
            <li> I had been using this product since the end of January and was extremely excited to see clear results since others have had success with it.</li>
            <li> , I use it twice a day and its fine on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would be mild enough for my sensitive skin, but effective for acne.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really use products like this one, but I have liked Olay products I have tried in the past, so I gave ths one a try and was not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> I added Neutrogena&#x27;s Pore Refining Toner to my regimen and at the end of week three my skin is almost completely clear and my normally huge pores are almost nonexistent.</li>
            <li> (use 1-3x a day) and only using it once a day because I think more than that would be too drying.</li>
            <li> I started noticing this within the first week.</li>
            <li> This one, however, from Olay is really doing what it promised to do!</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon Vine, for giving me this to review!</li>
            <li> Over the next day or so I noticed that my skin was visibly more oily than before</li>
            <li> About a week in that is exactly what happened.</li>
            <li> Most of the redness I had before has toned down/gone and my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li> great product that I would recommend for woman in their late 30&#x27;s that still suffer from acne.</li>
            <li> So far I have gotten more acne than I normally get</li>
            <li> Use it consistently, and it will work.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I am writing a review for any skincare product.  </li>
            <li> I first started trying this about two weeks ago</li>
            <li> It never totally got rid of the breakouts but it controlled them better and they were not as severe.   </li>
            <li> I am very impresssed with this product and have subscribed to getting it every 3 months now!</li>
            <li> Went back to docs and was put on more gels and antibiotics</li>
            <li> My acne recently turned a bit more cystic.  </li>
            <li> My first &#x27;set&#x27; lasted me 6 weeks.    </li>
            <li> I used it once a day for the first five days and twice a day thereafter.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> The first day I did not see any difference.   </li>
            <li> The second day I had more breakouts than before I used it.</li>
            <li> When a blemish has appeared, the acne cream worked exactly how it was suppose to, also.  </li>
            <li> I only wish this acne set existed decades ago when I really needed it! :)</li>
            <li> The gel lotion (step 3) was something that I stopped using after the first two times.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure some of its existence could be attributed to external forces in my life and not just genetics, but it is what it is.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see or feel any difference from this higher priced product and the Oil of Olay lower priced products.  </li>
            <li> For the first time in years, I do not have to use a liquid foundation for my makeup.</li>
            <li> so I use a different one that seems to lather up and take off my makeup better.</li>
            <li> Olay usually has great products, so when this line came out I was very hopeful.</li>
            <li> In the interm, and attempts to clear up my face, I found a cheap product, \\&quot;Acne</li>
            <li> I miss it so much!  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say I&#x27;m the one who tries everything looking for \\&quot;the</li>
            <li> I say go to Acne.org first before trying this product.</li>
            <li> Cleanser and Skin Clearing Treatment felt good on my skin (not too heavy or greasy), but when I first applied the Complexion Renewing Lotion to my skin</li>
            <li> I have oilier skin, more blackheads and red pimples then ever.   </li>
            <li> in a pretty borwn and beige bottle johnson&amp;johnson make it).</li>
            <li> In the evening I just use a forming cleanser first to get all the makeup off my eyes, then follow with this cleanser all over.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First start with the cleaner, I used it with my Clarisonic mia</li>
            <li> I plan on adding a handheld cleansing scrubber so that I stop touching my face entirely.    </li>
            <li> First off, the face wash leaves your skin feeling oily and unclean.</li>
            <li> You have to be consistent though.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be working pretty well</li>
            <li> The first day I noticed improvment.</li>
            <li> Now after one month of using all 3 products every day my skin has never been so clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> Possibly but can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased to have found an over the counter product that finally works without drying my skin out and harming my skin texture.</li>
            <li> No way I was going to continue using it if it did this much damage in one week!</li>
            <li> but it really worked!</li>
            <li> It really changed my life!</li>
            <li> suffer from stress related break outs; because of that I have had more issues with acne in my 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> My problem is that i ran out and tried to buy more, i looked at local drugstores and the olay website.  </li>
            <li> This product has worked great on both my daughter AND my son&#x27;s acne problems with slightly oily and yet sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> I mainly suffered from breakouts in the chin and forehead area and those areas are now completely clear and I am seeing the gradual fading of old marks which I am thrilled about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I still have the occasional pimple, but this has worked better for me than Murad, Proactiv, Clean &amp; Clear etc.</li>
            <li> i was very excited about olay coming out with the new pro X clear.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I started using this a week ago and have seen significant improvement over my Clinique regimen (though I still love Clinique!).  </li>
            <li> but alas the good effects are now dwindling to an end!</li>
            <li> I love my Olay products, but this system is a great disappointment.</li>
            <li> I do consider this a huge success because I was already on a 3 step regimen from Clinique for the last year (salicylic cleanser, salicylic toner and benzoyle peroxide face moisturizer) and was continuing to break out a week after my cycle.  </li>
            <li> My skin is naturally oily and the cleanser does not leave my skin feeling sweaky clean.</li>
            <li> I really want to believe it works, but i just dont see enough clarity to know for sure its working.</li>
            <li> If you REALLY want to treat acne, at whatever cost, I would recommend the Obagi Cleanziderm system (very pricey but worth it), or a product line called Vivant sold at skin care clinics.  </li>
            <li> but it just did nothing positive for me.</li>
            <li> however I haven&#x27;t used it that long so I&#x27;m not 100% sure.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed my complexion becoming smoother and my red acne scars are fading away.</li>
            <li> With my pores still clogged after using this step I opted to use Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst Surge Energizing Power Cleanser which has made my skin feel much softer and cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product, hopeful that it would work or at least give my skin a nice clean.  </li>
            <li> so I checked the ingredient list and sure enough, the lotion contains dimethicone (a silicone) which is the main ingredient in my hair serum.</li>
            <li> At 17 years old, we&#x27;re wondering if this product is suitable for our younger skin?</li>
            <li> But the results are worth it, especially if you have something special to get ready for.</li>
            <li> Its about $5 at Walmart for a large bottle</li>
            <li> It helps my acne to disappear faster but certainly doesn&#x27;t prevent it from forming.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised when I first used this and discovered it to be more of a gel as opposed to a traditional lotion.  </li>
            <li> have different amounts of each product, so you will run out of one (or more) steps before you run out of the others and you&#x27;ll end up having to buy a new kit, as the don&#x27;t sell the steps separately.</li>
            <li> I guess, I would pay the more expensive price for the better products out there!</li>
            <li> Overall a good product and quick results, I used it every night and noticed a difference less than a week!</li>
            <li> As mentioned before, my bc pills have switched, so I&#x27;m not sure if this has to do with my face clearing up as well, but I do feel that my skin feels much more resilient and clean.</li>
            <li> Tried Proactive, clean &amp; clear, neutrogena, ddf, and Bliss&#x27;s new \\&quot;no zit Sherlock\\&quot;, etc.  </li>
            <li> Some comments about the products-     1)Cleanser- does not foam (which I know can bother some people), very soothing, not drying.     </li>
            <li> but really didn&#x27;t think it would shrink my pores.</li>
            <li> that since I had spent the money on the product I should use it for a couple more days to see if it starts to improve.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li> and a week in, my face was absolutely noticeably clearer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product</li>
            <li> and I took care of the whole thing over the phone.</li>
            <li> but it really worked for me.</li>
            <li> When I started, my skin was currently in its best condition, having just cleared up the last monthly blemish (they usually only last about 3 days).  </li>
            <li> So i choose to refund the product after so much wishful thinking.</li>
            <li> It worked very well for me.  </li>
            <li> My teen-aged daughter was having real issues with oily skin.  </li>
            <li> -- I really believe that this does work for me.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, and based on others&#x27; reviews, I thought I would.</li>
            <li> Also, Amazon was VERY helpful and fast when I had a problem with my shipment.</li>
            <li> They do offer a money-back guarantee, so really you have nothing to lose</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t try my skin out once I started using step 2 once a day as directed for those of us that don&#x27;t have really oily skin.     </li>
            <li> I made it through the month but didn&#x27;t really have anything to spare.</li>
            <li> I have used the serum for years and really like it.      </li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t like the way my skin felt after using the wash.</li>
            <li> but I really think it was bringing all of the jusnk that had been cloggin my pores up and out...</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really know what that is about.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, it just looks very shiny.  </li>
            <li> I really do.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 6 weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li> In addition my skin had become very oily looking.</li>
            <li> So, I went searching for products that didn&#x27;t contain as much benzoyl peroxide and promised to be gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I used the cleanser as instructed (not too much</li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> I really wish Olay would resume the Definity line.</li>
            <li> it was similar to Practive, and shipping was free.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m on my 3rd box of this since it became available</li>
            <li> I bought it when it has $10 coupon something so altogether $15.XX for the whole box.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t have very troublesome skin, so if that is you, I don&#x27;t want to just take a guess as to if this fixes it or not.</li>
            <li> We really like it in our family.</li>
            <li> my son wants it now.</li>
            <li> As an update, I have bought the product twice, and have come to realize that Olay really, really needs to sell the products separately.  </li>
            <li> and it was getting really embarassing to go to work with teenager-like acne.</li>
            <li> (they work really well for me - should have stuck to it) and my skin has started clearing up - so I could breathe a sigh of relief when I look into the mirror now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dont care much for the cleanser.</li>
            <li> and I prefer products that are gentle.  </li>
            <li> I really wish they would sell the lotion by itself.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear much make-up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now and can&#x27;t really make up my mind on it.  </li>
            <li> I really like Olay products.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really help my \\&quot;bump\\&quot; problem.</li>
            <li> I really like this kit but wish they sold the lotions separately.</li>
            <li> and I never saw as much improvement as I was hoping for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it REALLY does its job without causing irritation.</li>
            <li> It really</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne most of my teen and adult years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 years old, have had acne since I was 10 and have been looking for the magical product that will finally  just make it go away.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that in some areas I have broken out more, but on Olay&#x27;s website they said you might break out more because it is unclogging everything and bringing it all to the surface.</li>
            <li> I saw the commercial for the product and thought I should take a chance with something that might be better for my 25 year old skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different products to clear my skin, even my skin tone, and prevent breakouts and NOTHING has worked like this stuff works.</li>
            <li> Since there were no detailed instructions included, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was supposed to use the renewing lotion (#3) right after the skin clearing treatment (#2) or not, so sometimes I did</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to purchase another whole set until I have used up more of the other products.    </li>
            <li> I was excited to get this product for Christmas because my acne suddenly worsened after the summer.</li>
            <li> I am 23 and I have tried so many other products and treatments including- proactive, clearsil, neutrogena, acnefree, and aveeno.</li>
            <li> I say this but keep in mind, I do love the Oil of Olay product line but think you can gain the benefits of Olay from their other products.</li>
            <li> and I was excited to start using it despite the mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> has worked or even helped any more than the other.</li>
            <li> I had an initial purging that lasted about two or three weeks, but it was so worth it!</li>
            <li> I use this 3 step system in conjunction with an exfoliating glove and my Clairisonic (two other products that I love).</li>
            <li> The lotion seemed to make my skin extremely oily/greasy, &amp; contributed to more breakouts.</li>
            <li> The cleanser works well enough although I wanted to mention it doesn&#x27;t foam or give you that &#x60;squeaky clean&#x27; feel that some people look for.  </li>
            <li> I plan on continuing to use it as it is a reasonable price and is doing an decent job.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought the cleanser in this set would be the only item I would often use, since I rarely get blemishes any longer.  </li>
            <li> usually clean my face in the shower, heat &amp; Steam open up the pores something</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, fair, dry, clog-prone, acne-prone skin with a tendency for it to get blotchy and red.</li>
            <li> After the first application, I could feel the swelling go down and knew that it was gentle on my skin but strong against the acne.</li>
            <li> Now I have too much lotion to justify spending the money to buy a whole new kit.</li>
            <li> One good thing though, is that it isn&#x27;t super expensive</li>
            <li> I am 41, Caucasian with sensitive skin, I have had acne my entire life but have been able to control it with Neutrogena products.[[ASIN:B000EPA4FW Neutrogena Complete Acne Therapy System]]</li>
            <li> In addition, I was using the Clinique \\&quot;Even Better Dark Spot</li>
            <li> You HAVE to use it religiously for one full month before you will see the results your looking for.</li>
            <li> I have had more success with just plain water and sensitive soap</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is that i have to buy the whole kit again where I live.</li>
            <li> so I end up having to buy a whole new kit.</li>
            <li> Eventually I began running out of product a week or two before I received more, and customer service couldn&#x27;t have cared less.</li>
            <li> And until someone commented on the evenness of their skin tone/texture, did I realize that my skin does look less blotchy and more uniform in color.</li>
            <li> &quot;  The cream does have a slight scent; I didn&#x27;t find it to be a perfume smell, more of a soap scent.  </li>
            <li> And if I do, they&#x27;re very, very tiny and go away quickly.</li>
            <li> I have occasional mild acne flare-ups.</li>
            <li> My main problem was and still is cystic acne on my chin.</li>
            <li> Try it, and if it works for you then that&#x27;s awesome, and if not don&#x27;t be too disappointed because it seems to be a pretty even split.</li>
            <li> The only thing that is better or bigger is the price.    </li>
            <li> So overall, I have not seen much change, and I don&#x27;t find it worth the money.</li>
            <li> Best of all I didn&#x27;t think it had any nasty chemical smell like so many acne products do.</li>
            <li> i have oily skin in my T-Zone and mainly breakout on my cheeks</li>
            <li> But, the main part is step 2 with the salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> To avoid touching my face (your fingers produce a lot of oil, and that clogs pores), I apply the second and third step with cotton pads.</li>
            <li> This might be a good line for you if your skin is not the least bit sensitive, but it DESTROYED my skin.</li>
            <li> this particular one.</li>
            <li> I have tried proactive (highly allergic) and</li>
            <li> I can highly recommend all of those products, plus the Regenerist Anti-aging Eye Roller.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly reccommend you use this system.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I really, really wish you could buy the products separately because the other two are fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is nice, just like the other olay daily serum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 35 years old and have tried everything to clear my mild adult acne from proactiv, exposed, and prescription medications.</li>
            <li> (I added the use of the Olay moisturizer just for around my eyes and mouth/lips, since I always need a little more moisturizer.)</li>
            <li> Thank you OLAY for creating an ADULT acne product while keeping aging and skin in mind!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little unclear if you should be doing this in the morning, at night, more than once, etc.  </li>
            <li> Talk about an unexpected benefit!!  </li>
            <li> Hmm, interesting, guess I will observe a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> i wanted to try a new product to help with my skin now that i am also getting older.   </li>
            <li> Pros:  my skin feels clean without being dry.  </li>
            <li> This product helped to clear my skin fast.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, I feel like I&#x27;m going to run out of the moisturizer early if I don&#x27;t really watch the amounts.</li>
            <li> I could not hide the breakouts no matter what I did and felt very self conscious interacting with people.</li>
            <li> and I really thought that this product would clear my skin once and for all</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and thanks to this product</li>
            <li> I would break out on almost a daily basis before, but now I rarely get any pimples.</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t expect were the many tiny white heads I got in unexpected places on my skin - forehead, cheeks and nose.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally wear any foundation but would have to use a concealer on the breakouts</li>
            <li> I called to ask if an inital breakout was normal but the lady couldt comprehend me ???.</li>
            <li> Normally Oil of Olay is worth shelling out the extra dollars, but in this case it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I would recommend this, but everyone is different, so it may be worth a try.</li>
            <li> The step 2 is the most harsh.</li>
            <li> Many times, heavy creams are too heavy for my skin, causing more break outs.</li>
            <li> The wash was oily, the lotion was oily and I&#x27;m not sure what the 3rd step was good for.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the second step much as it is not needed, but the first step I use day and night.  </li>
            <li> I tend to have fairly normal skin...</li>
            <li> Everything dried my skin to the point of peeling, which in turn lead to more severe breakouts.</li>
            <li> her two months after her first using Olay Professional Pro-X Clear, I could see the results myself.  </li>
            <li> Now at 20 years old, my acne has subsided for the most part (except the annual menstrual break out) and dark spots remain.  </li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, product was as expected.</li>
            <li> The treatment doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, and I actually feel it moisturizes more than the moisturizer itself</li>
            <li> It seems like its noraml to get your money back after atleast 3months if you read their minds right.</li>
            <li> Granted the percentage is less than other products of its kind but after using it for several weeks my face was clearer and stayed acne free.</li>
            <li> It was strange using the gel-like substance when you are used to cream, but it seemed to rub in fairly quickly and wasn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> Seeking advice from others, I asked my mom if she could see any difference in my skin, without mentioning the new protocol</li>
            <li> I get a new one almost every day.</li>
            <li> I tried this new system hoping to maybe even manage to eliminate those.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that I continue to get new pimples.  </li>
            <li> so I thought I would lay off the Proactiv and give this new product a try.   </li>
            <li> I have since tried a new product called AMBI</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for years and just thought I would try something new.  </li>
            <li> This step, according to the bottle, is supposed to \\&quot;reduce oil and penetrates pores to help prevent new acne from forming.\\</li>
            <li> I bought this product for maintenance purposes, as I generally have pretty clear skin</li>
            <li> From drug store to high end, I have tried to find something that did not damage my skin and that would actually clear up break outs.</li>
            <li> I definatley approve of Olay Pro Clear!</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear since I was a teenager!</li>
            <li> I can truly say my face is 100% clear after just one month of use!</li>
            <li> Overall, I would highly recommend this product-it has saved my skin!!</li>
            <li> I am SO happily surprised with this product!</li>
            <li> Cleared up a chronic case of adult acne like now!  </li>
            <li> I have been using the product for over 2 months and have been following the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> Most were small</li>
            <li> During the hot, humid summer, this lotion was the only lotion I could use on my face that didn&#x27;t prove to be too moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> This product made me break out even more than usual.  </li>
            <li> At first it didn&#x27;t seem like it was helping my acne at all, though my face instantly started feeling smoother.</li>
            <li> Traditional salicylic acid acne cream from other manufacturers are probably ok, as well, for cheaper.</li>
            <li> This product might perform miracles for some customers but it completely DESTROYED my skin!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> My skin actually looks healthy now and isn&#x27;t constantly in the back of my mind anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use the most gentle plain facial cleanser for removing make-up like foundation and cover up  </li>
            <li> I have tried other acne products for mature skin, including Proactive, but most made my skin red or burned it.</li>
            <li> There has been absolutely no improvement in my acne ( which is mild).</li>
            <li> Since a friend sells Mary Kay, I agreed to try the far more expensive Mary Kay products instead of the Pro-X Clear Acne product and while they worked were ten times more expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 2 lotion - this is a light lotion that contains the same anti-acne ingredient as the Total Effects lotion I used to love, and it is the secret to my clear skin!!!  </li>
            <li> I felt the face wash itself was too thin - I like something that lathers up a little better or even has a gritty texture to it which leaves my face feeling really smooth and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> Skin Clearing Treatment - to treat acne, clear up acne blemishes, and keep skin clear of new acne.</li>
            <li> However, after about a week, my old acne began to clear up, and the new acne began to subside as well.  </li>
            <li> I am acne free, have soft, glowing skin... and my pores while they are visible, they are a lot less noticable.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give the product adequate time to work before I hastily demanded my money back as Olay gives a money back guarantee.  </li>
            <li> it will clear up.  </li>
            <li> These areas were clear before I started the kit.</li>
            <li> They even include this lotion with the Pro X Clear trial kit that has the intensive refining sulfur mask.</li>
            <li> If my skin is clear, it seems clear, if it breaks out, it breaks out bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But nothing has worked for me like Oil of Olay Pro Clear.</li>
            <li> I have been using Proavtive for years and it was starting to become very ineffective at keeping my skin clear.</li>
            <li> My face is as clear</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay Pro Clear for about three weeks now</li>
            <li> Two tricks that I have learned to try to keep my skin clear are 1)</li>
            <li> My twin sister and I are trying to find a product that will clear our skin of acne, scars and redness.</li>
            <li> I am a 34 year old female who has been battling acne my whole life.  </li>
            <li> It did help clear up my skin somewhat, but you probably shouldn&#x27;t go into it expecting drastic results.</li>
            <li> clear leaves my skin soft and clear.</li>
            <li> but maybe like 85% clear now.</li>
            <li> skin is clear, even-textured, and even luminous after using this for about 9 months.  </li>
            <li> But her skin is clear about 90% of the time...</li>
            <li> it helps keep things clear.</li>
            <li> clear, Clinique, Murad and so on.</li>
            <li> Instead, try Philosophy Completely Clear Skincare System.</li>
            <li> Instead, I use the Boots gentle foam cleanser for sensitive skin (from Target) which actually cleans my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - both of these products seemed to help clear my skin</li>
            <li> I kept using it and by day 6 my face was clear.</li>
            <li> My face has been clear since using this product.</li>
            <li> started using Proactive 3 or 4 years ago; and it did clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and it was old, expired.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your time ordering this product or using this seller.</li>
            <li> The appeal of this product was that it was for adult women.</li>
            <li> have tried chemical cleansers (proactive, shiseido, murad) and natural cleansers (st. ives) and spot treatments (eradikate).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have problem skin until after I had my children and was in my early twenties.</li>
            <li> I had resolved to go to the dermatologist after realizing that I needed some professional help.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this occur since my early teens.</li>
            <li> At least from trying it I know for a fact benzoyl peroxide works better for me.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and allergies but have no reaction what so ever so all around</li>
            <li> As an adult acne sufferer, I look for products that can help keep my face clear.  </li>
            <li> Written by my wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 49 years old and have been using this product for a month now.</li>
            <li> Please note, I only use step 2 once a day as directed for those of us that don&#x27;t have really oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I am 35 years old and have dealt with acne since college.  </li>
            <li> (oil cleansing method), natural plants..</li>
            <li> This system is gentle enough to use twice a day, and my skin looks healthier now than it did even before I had acne.  </li>
            <li> I started using Olay Professional Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol</li>
            <li> After 5 weeks though, my acne is the same as, if not worse than when I started the recommended regimen.</li>
            <li> I saw Olay Professional Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol reviewed in In-Style Magazine</li>
            <li> I use the olay cleansing brush too and my skin is so soft now</li>
            <li> old skin that is sensitive, oily and acne prone.  </li>
            <li> As an adult, I get acne from time to time.  </li>
            <li> By this time you&#x27;ll be ready to invest in a second box.</li>
            <li> reduces enlarged pores, gives your skin a smoother texture and doesn&#x27;t break out sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I rather have clear skin than soft skin.</li>
            <li> It has cleared up my skin, however, hasn&#x27;t done anything as far as my hyperpigmentation</li>
            <li> I am truly surprised with this Olay set.  </li>
            <li> Just thought I&#x27;d give others a heads up if considering and are have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am a 30 year old woman who has been dealing with oily skin and breakouts since I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li> About two weeks ago I started using Olay Professional Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol after reading a review in one of my fashion magazines.</li>
            <li> Enter Olay Professional Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol--and after using it for a month straight, I give it a big MEH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She tried just about everything out there to get rid of minor, but consistent acne.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t detect what makes this product line \\&quot;Professional Pro-X\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old and never had acne as a teenager.</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly everything, from Proactive to Neutrogena to Clinique.</li>
            <li> I have been using the system for nearly 2 months now.</li>
            <li> In addition, my old scars have faded to the point that I&#x27;m no longer self conscious about leaving the house without foundation.  </li>
            <li> Corrector\\&quot; and it was not working fast enough to heal and lighten those acne scars.  </li>
            <li> I have had adult chin acne for years.  </li>
            <li> , im in my early 20&#x27;s and have been suffering since i was 12 from acne.</li>
            <li> my face has done a complete turn around.</li>
            <li> 3 lotion - this product is the one that pleasantly surprised me.  </li>
            <li> I still feel like I need to wear makes up but much less...and it doesn&#x27;t make my oily skin extra oily or anything.</li>
            <li> All my old acne scarring and hyperpigmentation has reduced dramatically.</li>
            <li> I am 32 years old and started getting acne around 8 years ago.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for nearly a month</li>
            <li> Now that he has been using the Olay Professional Pro-X</li>
            <li> I am a 48 tear old women who still broke out like a teenager until I bought this kit a month ago.</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and have been battling adult acne since I was 20.</li>
            <li> I tried this product in an effort to alleviate my adult acne.  </li>
            <li> I read that Olay developed this for adult acne.</li>
            <li> I am 17 years old</li>
            <li> I break out when I menstruate, my pores are now filled yucky fatty stuff, and my face is still oily.</li>
            <li> I am in my early twenties</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered Olay Professional Pro-X Clear three months ago, and I have been using it twice a day since.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all</li>
            <li> I noticed so far that this, garnier and Roc products don&#x27;t work well for my skin.</li>
            <li> The Olay Professional Pro-X Clear has worked WONDERS for my skin.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who has acne-prone skin or anyone who even gets the occasional breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> as it has the Salicylic Acid that I think was the cure for my adult acne all in one product</li>
            <li> /&gt;This seller was VERY prompt in their shipping, and I would definitely order from them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was surprised when I discovered the lotion was gel, and I had my doubts.</li>
            <li> I would now say that this product is worth a try because it is so simple to get your money back if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Well, I did continue to use the product hoping that my mom would be right, and unfortunately it did not get any better.</li>
            <li> Also, my skin is not dry at all using this product and only seems to get oily if the weather is hot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only going to continue to use this product for one more month, and only because of the other encouraging reviews.</li>
            <li> I tried proactive and some other acne products before which charged me a lot more but did not really work on my case, so you understand why.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars on other products and decided to invest in the Olay brand a couple of months ago and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> During the first few weeks, I did break out a little more</li>
            <li> I use a face wash I got from the person who I get facials from and have fairly clear skin when I use that and get a facial, but let&#x27;s be honest that&#x27;s getting pretty expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun including but not limited to: natures cure, pro active, clean n</li>
            <li> It made it worse at first, but from my time with dermatologists, I have learned that is typical for most acne products when you first start using them.</li>
            <li> I expected my skin to break out at first as it&#x27;s all coming to the surface so the acne kit can properly clear the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m going to be able to pick this product back up to try it again for the recommended four weeks...</li>
            <li> even in places that I never typically did like my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Third, the product (particularly step 2) has an odor to it that I did not care for.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I do feel that the moisture level of my skin improved (especially with the Renewing Lotion), my main concern, the acne, did not improve whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I am 41 yrs old and have been battling acne for the last few years and recently my breakouts have been getting worse (welcome menopause years!)</li>
            <li> My pores are noticeably smaller, less break outs and the texture is so smooth.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser that I usually use has an exfolliant and it helps to make my face feel smooth.  </li>
            <li> I am a 34 year old redhead with sensitive, oily skin and moderate adult acne.</li>
            <li> Typically these products clean out the pores so breakouts get worse before they get better.  </li>
            <li> I dont normally have acne, but i am extremely susceptible to it with really oily skin...</li>
            <li> I was so excited to hear that Olay came out with these products because Olay is the only brand I typically use.</li>
            <li> for me, this was a big disappointment.[[ASIN:B004UDRUJW Olay Professional Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol]]</li>
            <li> The Olay Professional Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol Kit has cleared up her skin and has prevented breakouts for several weeks.  </li>
            <li> Overall my skin is much clearer than it was before and the overall texture has improved but it isn&#x27;t the miracle fix that I was praying that it would be.  </li>
            <li> Using this cream cleanser after using a different foaming cleanser is an extra step that I used to skip in the evening sometimes, but I found that it really makes a difference when I use it -</li>
            <li> I picked up the Olay pro-x with low expectations.... and WOW!   </li>
            <li> and I saw major improvements.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to make a major investment just to try it.</li>
            <li> some oiliness, but nothing major in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> During the first week, I noticed that I was getting an increase in blackheads and other breakouts.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become more moderate in the past several months since I&#x27;ve stopped birth control.</li>
            <li> Olay Age Defying, Anti-Wrinkle Day Lotion with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum , SPF 15, 3.4 Ounce (</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised by the price, over $30 when it first came out (it has since come down), but I thought it was worth</li>
            <li> The other 2 boxes are not bad too, not sting, irritate or dry out my skin, but seems calm it down, and after 3,4 days, my acne start fading away.</li>
            <li> Other treatments focus on the power and strength of their ingredients but they just made my skin super sensitive and made my acne dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> The gel also has a slight smell; again it&#x27;s not a perfume smell, more of a slight gel-like odor.  </li>
            <li> reviews are mainly what i base my purchases on and i rely on them greatly.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, so when I first put the lotion on it does burn a little.  </li>
            <li> First, a little about me: I am a female in my mid-twenties and have fairly oily skin which, in the past few months, has been acne-ridden.  </li>
            <li> At last I have clear skin.</li>
            <li> My forehead was clear as possible.</li>
            <li> I had a lone pimple sprout up a month back and started using Olay Pro X Clear immediately.</li>
            <li> This was actually my 2nd set of the Olay Clear Acne Protocol.</li>
            <li> It is the only thing that keeps my skin consistently clear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took a while for my skin to improve, but it has finally started to clear up.</li>
            <li> I am 23 years old, female, Asian-American.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it is baby soft and just so happens to look much younger.</li>
            <li> I am now 38 years old and still am prone to an occasional breakout every now and then.</li>
            <li> Although I never suffered from acne as a teen, I developed adult acne in my mid twenties and have suffered with it ever since.  </li>
            <li> I only use it once a day because I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I will be going back to Neutrogena Complete Acne Therapy System</li>
            <li> I have to preface this by saying I&#x27;ve only been using the treatment for just over a week, but here are my opinions so far:  </li>
            <li> However, in my early twenties, I started battling acne in different forms.</li>
            <li> My adult daughter has suffered with acne issue since she became a teen.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna start back to my old regiman which is from Acne.org.</li>
            <li> if she gets busy or lets it go for a day or two, she pays for it with some break-outs, but resumed use brings her skin back under control again!  </li>
            <li> , and this might simply be me being picky and not having used many different facial cleansers in the past</li>
            <li> and I went back to my old regimen - which includes Oil of Olay oil reducing face wash, toner and night cream along with Vicco Tumeric Cream</li>
            <li> I have oily sensitive skin and an allergy to Parabens, about a year ago olay dicontinued their acne wrinkle moisterizer I wrote to them begging to bring it back since it contained no parabens and worked well.</li>
            <li> Bought this last October to try Olay&#x27;s adult acne product and have used it in varying routines since.</li>
            <li> Iam 36 years old and never had acne as a teen</li>
            <li> After telling her about the protocol she offered the suggestion that maybe it gets worse before it gets better and</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t gotten better or worse.</li>
            <li> Nothing is more frustrating than being over 40 and feeling like you are going through puberty all over again.  </li>
            <li> My hands feel a little sticky and gross after applying it, but it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and large, porous, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> Despite my difficulty, I do give Pro-X Clear two stars for a few positive reasons.</li>
            <li> I always run out of the face wash first and have tons left of the other two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Her face felt natural after using it, not tight or dry.  </li>
            <li> wish it would have worked for me, because I really don&#x27;t know what other products that I would use.</li>
            <li> I did find that I didn&#x27;t need to scrub my face because I didn&#x27;t flake and peel as much as with other products.</li>
            <li> I have now used up all of the facewash but still have PLENTY of both of the other products and refuse to pay again for the whole kit when all I need is the facewash.</li>
            <li> little and/or short lived success.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several prescription acne products including Benzaclin with little success.</li>
            <li> After a week of use I stopped applying the product, and several days later, my skin is now beginning to clear up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The third step lotion they provided doesn&#x27;t really moisturize, especially when you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I also want to specify that I only use it once a day (instead of the recommended twice daily) since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am a 26 year old that has recently been having skin problems, and I was convinced nothing short of a trip to the dermatologist would work.</li>
            <li> I went back to using my old acne medication w/benzyl peroxide for the actual acne treatment part.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the 3rd step lotion anymore, but have reverted back to my old face lotion - Elizabeth Arden Visible Difference.</li>
            <li> It does not dry my skin out at all</li>
            <li> I actually had more breakouts than normal, which was very frustrating.</li>
            <li> So I went back to my usual cleanser (Neutrogena deep clean) and used that with the treatment and lotion, and that has led to improvment.  </li>
            <li> (I prefer mineral spf).&lt;br /&gt;Right now, I&#x27;m using the Biore combination cleanser, Neutrogena rapid clear toner (although it&#x27;s a little harsh), Olay regenerist fragrence free serum, and the moisturizer from this kit.  </li>
            <li> Second, it seemed a little backward to wash your face, put medication on trouble spots, and then turn around and slather lotion on top of that.  </li>
            <li> Not worth buying the whole kit again...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product is worth a try.</li>
            <li> The first few days, I used it as directed</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me about two and a half months to get through my first package ( a little goes a long way with each part of the system), so I definitely feel it is worth the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never managed to achieve perfectly clear skin, but for the past several years I&#x27;ve been using other Olay products that have kept it pretty much under control, aside from the occasional 1-2 hormonal related monthly blemishes.</li>
            <li> and although I still have breakouts, especially when I am hormonal, right before my cycle, etc., The overall appearance of my skin has improved and the time it takes for my breakouts to start to fade is just a few days.</li>
            <li> I hope they keep making this product because it has given me clear skin, which is something I&#x27;ve been trying to get for a long time!</li>
            <li> I used to use Vivant but can&#x27;t find it anywhere where I live anymore as the clinic I went to closed.  </li>
            <li> his skin is clear without leaving him with a rash or dry irritated skin.</li>
            <li> So given that I have dry, sensitive skin and my acne is hormonal</li>
            <li> and it cost less than 20 and lasts so much longer.</li>
            <li> After turning away from over the counter acne products and instead going to a Dermatologist, I found my skin to be overly sensitive, and overly dry.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my adult acne after having used Proactiv for years along with Olay Regererist when my skin became dry.  </li>
            <li> It did visibly helped fade some small, old acne scars I had on my chin, so this step also works really well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But over the weeks with my acne getting worse from this kit with two cystic pimples becoming five (and my forehead attacked with white heads which I still have to this day and refuse to go away), this product ended up burning my skin every time I put it on.</li>
            <li> It took about 6 weeks of constant use to see the final result for my daughter and as long as she keeps up with it, it works and keeps her clear...</li>
            <li> The cool thing is that every morning everything is not as red looking, and I am noticing less and less pimples.   </li>
            <li> Somehow, this super moisturizing lotion MAKES MY SKIN LESS OILY/ SHINY!!!  </li>
            <li> &quot; The cleanser is happily free of the rough little beads other brands have in their cleanser step.</li>
            <li> After using Pro-Active for 3 years and finding it less effective in the past few months I was fed up.</li>
            <li> and although my skin is not completely clear yet, it is not at all sensitive or dry, and I do see improvement.  </li>
            <li> As is usual when starting new products, my face at first broke out in places it hadn&#x27;t previously.  </li>
            <li> ( I usually use Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti- Wrinkle Anti-Acne cream)No anti-aging benefits as far as I can tell, other than the last step is a moisturizer, which is hardly revolutionary.&lt;br /&gt;The anti-acne ingredient is salicylic acis, and at a fairly low concentration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within the first days of use, my medically dried and painful skin was soft and healthy again.</li>
            <li> I spent 4 weeks religiously going through each of the three steps with very little success.  </li>
            <li> My skin was clear when I began using this due to the Proactiv, but I thought by getting the Olay Acne Protocol I could eliminate the Proactiv and just use the Olay.  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll be returning to my previous regimen, which includes Olay&#x27;s Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-aging Cleanser plus Blemish Control, Olay Oil Minimizing Toner, Olay Complete Daily UV Moisturizer for Combination/Oily skin, and Total Effects Night Firming Cream.</li>
            <li> The price might be a little high once you realize you need to keep purchasing this item over and over.</li>
            <li> My pimples are still coming up, not as long or as big as before, but still present.  </li>
            <li> The reason people on here say it doesn&#x27;t work is only because they didn&#x27;t use it long enough!!</li>
            <li> Not only did it not clear up my skin--it aggravated the problem enormously.</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other negative reviews--the fact that the products are cream-based, after using them, your face never does feel quite clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mild acne my entire life--essentially uneven skin tone, combination skin with, blackheads on my nose, a few whiteheads and the occasional single big gem on my cheek or forehead.  </li>
            <li> Since the products are new and not available individually, I could see running out of one step and then having to buy another kit to replace it.     </li>
            <li> I am very strict with my routine, but it did very little if anything at all.</li>
            <li> It actually helps your skin become less greasy over time and feels so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to find a product that will work to clear up my skin, being 26 with acne is not a fun.</li>
            <li> I will admit that in general, I&#x27;m not consistent about using facial products or washing my face in the evenings.</li>
            <li> I would agree with the others when they say give this kit some time to work, because even though I felt it was working on the first application, it took at least two weeks to have noticeably clearer skin.</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I tried to keep going with it (a week was long enough for me)</li>
            <li> did see results within 3 weeks, and as long as I use it regularly it does seem to keep the break outs at bay.</li>
            <li> I was using prior to purchasing this), with a higher concentration of salicylic acid content than what comes in this package, with very small exfoliater beads in it.</li>
            <li> The Complexion Renewing Lotion is not greasy but after using the full protocol for weeks, my skin got worse.</li>
            <li> The 2 step seems a little ridiculous, Why am I putting on 2 different creams on top of each other, why can&#x27;t they combine them?    </li>
            <li> And just when I thought that my skin couldn&#x27;t get any worse, my acne got a little better.</li>
            <li> After trying Pro-X Clear for two weeks I was frustrated because I felt I had more breakouts then before</li>
            <li> Because my skin is dry with acne everything I tried always made my skin red and irritated.</li>
            <li> I am 46 years old and still having breakouts for the last few years.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is really mild and non irritating but does not get rid of ANY blackheads.</li>
            <li> However, after a couple of weeks, I was out of the cleanser and barely used any of the other two products.  </li>
            <li> It helped possibly for the first 2 days, I say some of the redness starting to diminish, but the longer I used it the worse it seemed to get.</li>
            <li> it still only lasted about 3 weeks while I have tons of the other 2 left.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;m 20, so maybe I&#x27;m a little young to be in this product&#x27;s target audience.</li>
            <li> is that both step 1 &amp; 2 have the same active ingredient with only a difference of .03%.  </li>
            <li> You might have a problem like I did for the first week or so with feeling a little extra slick throughout the day.</li>
            <li> My skin is never dry or tight after using the cleanser and actually feels a bit moisturized.</li>
            <li> the stuff for teenagers does not work on my adult skin (too harsh).  </li>
            <li> The only acne skin clearing treatment to even remotely help my skin contains 10% benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> What I noticed was that when I did get a pimple, it would make it take twice as long for it to go away.   </li>
            <li> I saw no improvement but not a whole lot of extra blemishes either.  </li>
            <li> I had the strange feeling</li>
            <li> I remember when the pink bottle was the only Olay there was!</li>
            <li> I still have minor breakouts when I get overly stressed etc.</li>
            <li> This does not clear the skin.</li>
            <li> It took about a month for them to send me the envelope to return the product and its instructions was not clear.</li>
            <li> I even got a few blemishes on my forehead, which usually is very clear being a minimal concern compared to the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> a woman I tend not to wear makeup unless its for a special occasion, however -- in my early 30&#x27;s I am still prone to acne flare-ups, brought on by hormones, stress, and occasional bad food choices.</li>
            <li> For the last year I was getting little red bumps all over my face and Proactive was NOT helping with them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no professional!</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll alternate this with other products to see what will help with hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> However I do notice that my face is extremely shiny when I wake up the next morning after use.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s possible there was a reaction with other medications she takes; therefore this product gets a neutral review.</li>
            <li> I have now run out of the cleanser prior to running out of the other products, and am going to have to buy the three pack again, just to be the cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Complexion Renewing Lotion - there isn&#x27;t even a use listed on the side of the box with the other information, but on the back where they try to sell you with words like \\&quot;clinically\\&quot; and \\&quot;professionally\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried ProActiv, Clearasil and several other acne fighting regimes.</li>
            <li> This is a tough one for me to review, because while it ABSOLUTELY DID NOT WORK for me, I do know enough about skincare products to allow for the fact that results do vary from person to person.  </li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li> For me, dry skin worsens acne.</li>
            <li> (that has always helped me with dry flaky skin)  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin and need a product that won&#x27;t dry my face out.</li>
            <li> But, when I go without a moisturizer, I feel as though my skin is dry.</li>
            <li> No break-outs and my skin (a combination of oily and dry</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this product doesn&#x27;t dry the skin like Proactive does.</li>
            <li> I used proactive before but it used to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> It doesnt dry out the skin and prevents blemishes.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend it to anyone who has acne and/or dry skin.</li>
            <li> have tried almost every system geared towards combating acne, but they have always made my skin unbearably dry</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why they both have the same active ingredient, but whatever - the program works.  </li>
            <li> In the last few years the only thing that works is Salicylic Acid.</li>
            <li> My face was broken out the whole month but only my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li> The only active ingredient in this \\&quot;acne protocol\\&quot; is salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> I then stopped using it for about a week because I got lazy at night with face washing...and noticed my face was not as clear.  </li>
            <li> My skin is about 80% clearer after using the product now for 2 weeks, the only issue is the dark marks from the acne that Olay caused my skin</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks, using it EXACTLY as directed, my face looked a million times worse.</li>
            <li> I am curious if the improvement will continue to stay long term.</li>
            <li> how could I loose.  </li>
            <li> For the most part it&#x27;s little bumps under the skin, but at any given time I have two or three big, painful red pimples.  </li>
            <li> New spots, and hard cystic ones appeared after 1 day.</li>
            <li> So I am mixed - thumbs up for skin clearing treatment and complexion renewing lotion, but thumbs down on the cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Salicylic acid can be very harsh on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what step in the 3-step system burned my cheeks so badly, so I discontinued use of all three and still felt burning and had red/peeling skin for a good 3-4 days after.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s truly horrible for me, I have followed the instructions exactly and broke out more</li>
            <li> For me, the third step tingles with a slight warming sensation...</li>
            <li> did feel like it left my face feeling slightly</li>
            <li> It did help clear up my excessively oily t-zone, but be careful if you have combination skin.</li>
            <li> but I figured it&#x27;s a small price to pay for making such a big difference.</li>
            <li> I find the 2nd step, the treatment, to be pretty useless.  </li>
            <li> but the big ones usually go away in 48 hours and the smaller ones vanish overnight!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen little improvement over my previous regime (Olay wash for sensitive skin and Regenerist serum).  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m really disappointed because I expected more.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews that the proportions of each step seem off, in that I will probably run out of one step long before two others (I wish each could be sold seperately).     </li>
            <li> it leave my skin feeling deeply hydrated (vs. tight and dry-feeling</li>
            <li> And apparently, there is a very small percentage of salacylic acid in the formula, which is the stuff that&#x27;s supposed to moderate the skin&#x27;s oil.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and seems to be keeping the worst of the acne at bay, but it&#x27;s pricy and doesn&#x27;t really seem to be doing any better of a job than what I was already using.</li>
            <li> First, there is very little direction given other than labeling the bottles step 1, 2, 3 and telling you to rub a small amount in.  </li>
            <li> I would have a little extra.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 41 years old but have a little bit of trouble with acne.  </li>
            <li> I have always had a bad reaction to benzoly peroxide and would break out with a huge red rash on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice over a span of three days to test it out and am shocked about how fantastic this product has worked.</li>
            <li> I have tried acne products targeted for younger people but have found them to be way too harsh for my face.  </li>
            <li> still have to do regular exfoliation, and do find a toner a few times a week helps as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d find a friend who&#x27;s curious split the cost so that if it doesn&#x27;t work for you maybe it&#x27;d work for your friend.</li>
            <li> Spent about $250 on products by Beauticontrol to help with anti-aging and acne</li>
            <li> I used it for roughly 6/7 months, and saw absolutely no change in my skin.</li>
            <li> so I guess that&#x27;s to be expected, but then they added a fragrance to perfume over the chemical.  </li>
            <li> So I guess I&#x27;m out the $40 I spent.</li>
            <li> I use the Olay deep wrinkle treatment on a few lines on my forehead</li>
            <li> I started using once a day then increased to 3 x a day but found that to be to harsh, so went back to once a day.</li>
            <li> : This gel moisturizer is not greasy at all, but it can actually leave my face a shiny after wearing it for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Like all cleansers you wet your face, massage on the cleanser and rinse it off.  </li>
            <li> However, it was too harsh for my skin for daily use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23 years old, and in the last three years, my acne has been worse than is</li>
            <li> I was tired of being embarrassed about my skin, and made the decision to give the Olay regemine a try, since it (finally) seemed to be specifically for mature skin.    </li>
            <li> I used other product before, but I found out the hard way that I am too sensitive to benzoyl peroxide (I got chemical burns.)</li>
            <li> Skin history: oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin (usually bumpy pimples), slight blotchiness</li>
            <li> We all know that if we have struggled with Acne, usually a refining or active toner is a major step in the acne treating process.  </li>
            <li> Not really thrilled with this product and am thinking that I will probably go back to my other face wash since the effect was fairly similar, cost significantly less and lasts 3x as long.  </li>
            <li> I go through the cleanser much quicker than the lotion and skin clearing treatment, but it seems ridiculous to buy the cleanser alone for $25!  </li>
            <li> I have used other Olay products (like Definity) and have not seen such dramatic or immediate improvement in such a short time.</li>
            <li> So, for my surprise with 27$ for 3 products (compare to 120$ I spent before with other brand)</li>
            <li> One curious thing to note is there is no SPF protection from this product line and the other day lotion I use from Olay</li>
            <li> For those of you who struggle with adult acne, this is totally not worth spending your hard earned money.</li>
            <li> You also had to be careful about the amount you use since a little goes A LONG way!</li>
            <li> Also, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I do like that the cleanser doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight and dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;Imagine my disappointment when I came back to order the Pro-X clear from Amazon to find that the price had sky rocketed and only sold by sellers</li>
            <li> And the cleanser goes before the other two items</li>
            <li> and I like the other Olay products that I have tried, so,</li>
            <li> I get blackheads due to my oily skin</li>
            <li> So I cut a few things out of my diet (coffee namely) and that still did not completely fix my issue.  </li>
            <li> Two days in I broke out again, which I expected (the toxins have to escape somehow!)</li>
            <li> quiclky (just as the other reviewer stated)</li>
            <li> I think it is from the salicylic acid, I have had that issue with other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The skin clearning lotion (step 2) and the moisterizing lotion (step 3) only require a very small amount each time and go a long way.</li>
            <li> I have tried Dermalogica, ProActiv, Murad, Clinique, and a million other drug store products with</li>
            <li> and if I go by other reviewers</li>
            <li> But when you come out on the other side (3-4-5 weeks)</li>
            <li> I washed my face with the cleanser before bed and did the other two steps</li>
            <li> It might work for other people but this product just didn&#x27;t agree with my skin.</li>
            <li> This may work for other people but not me.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is quite similiar to the other oil of olay lotions and the treatment (step 2) seems to be an acne cream</li>
            <li> She tried this product for two days and had to stop due to a flare-up.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t feel that they perform much differently than cheaper products I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> The product seems to work well, however the cleanser runs out way before the other products.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to avoid a trip to the dermatologist, so after trying other miscellaneous products which didn&#x27;t work, I chose this three-step kit.  </li>
            <li> I am concerned that I will run out of the face wash before the other pieces in the protocol.  </li>
            <li> Being myself about three or four decades past needing to worry about the problem which this product treats, I allowed my daughter to give it a try, with the following results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My usual facial routine includes cleanser, toner, and a moisturizer, and zit-cream when needed.</li>
            <li> If there are other options, I hope the Olay rep who is lurking around will let us all know what it is.</li>
            <li> Proactiv has stopped working for me as well as other over the counter cleansers/medications.  </li>
            <li> After doing research online, turns out it is \\&quot;plugs of sebum and other form of cellular debris that just COAGULATED in MY pores.\\</li>
            <li> but it just had a few minor breakouts every now and then.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a year and while I was skeptical at first I was amazed at the results.  </li>
            <li> The end result is something you may not enjoy, though I suppose it certainly could be worse</li>
            <li> The Complexion Renewing Lotion does not contain any salicylic acid or any other active ingredient.</li>
            <li> But let me emphasize that what you put on the outside on your face does half the work!!</li>
            <li> and I have tried many products over the years including Proactiv which dried my skin out really bad.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m guilty of picking, therefore i get red marks, but they&#x27;re gone completely after using this product.</li>
            <li> Alas on day 10 the regular bumps where back.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to use alot of different products on a particularly troubled area, just keep with the daily regimen for as long as you can.</li>
            <li> Which is slightly embarrassing and rather obvious, since I am usually sans make-up.</li>
            <li> product was just not right for me.</li>
            <li> My ONLY complaint is that you can&#x27;t buy these components separately.</li>
            <li> The dark spots are still there</li>
            <li> which is how my combination skin typically feels after using all the other acne lotions), but I swear that my skin gets less oily and shiny looking when I use this product.  </li>
            <li> Disclaimer - I do have fairly mild acne (but annoying enough to want to treat!)</li>
            <li> I think I narrowed it down to the moisturizer as the culprit for the acne.  </li>
            <li> and I was let down</li>
            <li> However, my acne has not slowed down at all, and that was what I was aiming for.  </li>
            <li> Bonus is that they are sending me coupons for all the other Olay products my family uses!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the last 3 weeks without missing a day and have seen such a dramatic improvement that I cannot see myself stopping it.</li>
            <li> Speaking for myself, this regimen was a total failure.  </li>
            <li> Now I have stopped using all anti wrinkle products due to their heavy nature.</li>
            <li> The bottles are very small, I&#x27;m assuming the kit is meant to last one month...</li>
            <li> Everything dried out my skin so extremely that I had to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> With that said, I have used this quite a few times to wash up in the evenings, but not consistently.</li>
            <li> My face broke out worse these past 6 months from stress than it ever did when I was in high school.</li>
            <li> Another Note- does have a slight smell to it that might be off-putting to some people.        </li>
            <li> I am a Black woman, and if this does not work I will try RX for Brown skin, and hopefully it will work.  </li>
            <li> I find odd about it</li>
            <li> It ran out by 3 and a half weeks.</li>
            <li> I have noticed less breakouts and a clearing of my complexion.  </li>
            <li> Milia are small white bumps under the skin usually located around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I used the skin clearing bottle (#2) once a day (post shower) and did notice that by the end of the month my face was somewhat less oily in my problem areas...</li>
            <li> I see no improvement over the Oil of Olay product lines that existed previously.  </li>
            <li> After about a month and a half, I gave up.</li>
            <li> I am at a place where my skin has changed and am having a slight problem with discoloration and breakouts.</li>
            <li> I would suggest a product from your dermatologist and if you have insurance you may pay a lot less for the prescription.</li>
            <li> (so I won&#x27;t need to apply the three products I was applying previously).  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after a little over a week on these products I now have 6 new active blemishes, 2 of which I have been dealing with for 5 days now with no improvement in sight.  </li>
            <li> In high school I had minor acne, nothing unusual, but when I hit my twenties I had a horrible flair up!</li>
            <li> Not true.  </li>
            <li> After using it the first time I had to wash my face again because it still felt dirty.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also noticed that it has faded my old blemish scars, which has been difficult to deal with since the other products I&#x27;ve used tend to cause break</li>
            <li> After a few days I noticed the redness around my acne was getting less and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin looking dewy and glowing instead of weighed down my heavy lotions.</li>
            <li> I had no fewer breakouts, and the look of my skin remained dull and dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped to get rid of the malia (small white hard deposits) that were getting infected.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I have tried everything, as I have not had this problem very long, but I was hoping for at least something to get breakouts under control.</li>
            <li> I think this product works so well for me because it is less harsh.</li>
            <li> I was slightly disappointed at first because it took sooooooo long to start noticing a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> my face felt oily and not clean after cleansing.  </li>
            <li> Having not needing an acne product myself for four decades, my exposure has been limited to say the least.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to buy as I read some reviewers who said it caused them to develop cystic acne</li>
            <li> /&gt;After 3 weeks of use, all I have noticed is that my skin is a little softer.</li>
            <li> The plus was the repair serum which made my skin feel a lot softer but with all the little whiteheads everywhere</li>
            <li> I was just a little hopeful.</li>
            <li> I do continue to use my trusted Murad gel cleanser (which also has salycic acid)in combination with this kit because like others, i feel that if I don&#x27;t use the Olay cleanser on a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; face (usually with my Clarisonic), it doesn&#x27;t remove makeup or other build-up.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for a month and a half and it actually seemed to make my acne worse.  </li>
            <li> It felt really heavy (not clean).</li>
            <li> very limited suppliers and hard to get just what you need.</li>
            <li> Started using this product a few days before Thanksgiving this year and thought I noticed a little bit of a change.  </li>
            <li> So, needless to say, I will be trying to get the money back that I spent on this product.</li>
            <li> I had clear skin as a teenager, but now in my twenties I experience severe, painful acne breakouts on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I had been keeping my pimples at bay by having regular extractions done at a dermatology center, but could not sustain this because it&#x27;s quite expensive (over $100 per session).</li>
            <li> a try.&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to use the products 1-3 times daily, but I only use it once in the morning, because I&#x27;m afraid of drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did nothing to clear up my acne or reduce spots and redness as advertised.</li>
            <li> and I was starting to breakout oven worse than before.</li>
            <li> Over my teen years I&#x27;ve tried everything, including Proactiv Solution (which has benzoyl peroxide as opposed to salicylic acid in the Olay protocol) that made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> This treatment constantly dried out my skin along with step 3.</li>
            <li> this product only made the problem worse.</li>
            <li> Despite this, it was a waste of money and a disservice to my skin.</li>
            <li> What I noticed was the cream that you put on that dries your skin out dried out my recently-popped zit</li>
            <li> We tried all over-the-counter skin care systems, plus a few tv/infomercials and nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been running 4 miles (approx 45 mins) everyday for about two weeks</li>
            <li> Finally the moisturizer felt thin and greasy.  </li>
            <li> It almost got humorous-every day I would wake up to find what area had broken out next.  </li>
            <li> I have found that my outbreaks have decreased after the initial time period when I started the system.</li>
            <li> and I get a few blemishes around PMS time.</li>
            <li> I feel that I am treating my acne but also moisturizing my skin and hopefully preventing a few wrinkles along the way.    </li>
            <li> but it seems to have gotten worse in the last couple of years.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken out at all in the last four days, I used to break-out a couple of times a day.</li>
            <li> I still got a few pimples and using the product did not help heal them any faster than not treating or using another face wash.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I feel like I&#x27;ve wasted $30.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months.</li>
            <li> Wish I would not have wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money.   </li>
            <li> considering my entire face was broken out when u started.</li>
            <li> Now, a month later, I&#x27;m suffering from acne worse than ever before.     </li>
            <li> held out for 5 weeks as I kept telling myself that it will work - lo and behold it only got worse.</li>
            <li> Within a few days I saw improvements.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t always use step three, as in the summer it felt too heavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been three months and my skin actually looks worse than it did before I started using this product.  </li>
            <li> I am a 29 year old female who is sick of *</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers I have tried a lot of products for annoying teen and then adult acne.</li>
            <li> The other issue is that 30 days in, I am out of face wash but still have PLENTY of #2 and #3 left--probably at least twice</li>
            <li> ,it&#x27;s too bad but just be aware of that and don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> The adage that a little goes along way does apply to this product, a small daub on the tip of your finger</li>
            <li> I mean this was a total waste of money and time and the worst part was having to walk around with these huge sebaceous cysts on my face.</li>
            <li> I held off on the third step for awhile because I was afraid it would somehow counter the effects of the other two lotions (for some odd reason), so I can&#x27;t say I followed the regimen to a \\&quot;T\\&quot;</li>
            <li> and I have been struggling with pretty bad acne since I was about 12.</li>
            <li> It seems gentle and doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> This was useless in general.</li>
            <li> I have used Proactiv in the past but found it was too harsh for my face.</li>
            <li> I am always on the lookout for products that will make my skin better--I&#x27;m approaching 40 and don&#x27;t have bad skin per se, but I do have some redness, oiliness in the T-zone, and occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> I had bad breakouts, but now I only have the occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> I was suspicious about products with such low price ( my bad:( ), so I did not use them when I first received them.</li>
            <li> There was so much make up and grossness on the cotton pad, I was shocked.  </li>
            <li> In the past 6 months I have graduated from law school (after a killer finals period)</li>
            <li> , so I&#x27;m not sure if this will work with people for severe acne.</li>
            <li> Since using this product I have had a ton of cystic acne all over my chin and jaw line plus acne around my nose and cheeks where I wouldn&#x27;t usually get it before using the product.</li>
            <li> I went to the spa and bought all of the expensive facial stuff</li>
            <li> and if I do it is small and goes away</li>
            <li> I usually just deal with it, the random breakouts here and there, and then of coarse, the monthly breakouts that always come.  </li>
            <li> This might get repetitive but, I too, have used everything under the sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this regimen is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are like me and have tried a million different products for troubled skin, then I feel your pain.</li>
            <li> and I usually us the pro x face wash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried expensive products like Proactiv and Murad and I&#x27;ve seen a dermatologist on numerous occasions.</li>
            <li> About two weeks ago however I noticed some small breakouts but attributed it to my monthly cycle.</li>
            <li> It takes a few weeks to see results though, so stick with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some small bumps that lasted about a day</li>
            <li> I still get pimples but they are small and tend to disappear after a day or two.</li>
            <li> I was too lazy to continue the treatment to step 3 to reduce the blemishes.</li>
            <li> usually around the time I&#x27;m PMSing.</li>
            <li> still, given all this work, I see no more progress.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if I should apply the acne lotion before or after the wrinkle treatment.  </li>
            <li> I am a 40 year old woman who suffers from summer acne living in a lake community.</li>
            <li> Not sure what they are (maybe whiteheads???).</li>
            <li> I have never battled acne issues until the past year.</li>
            <li> What a waste of $40!</li>
            <li> other products/protocols have been way too irritating and drying...</li>
            <li> Step two is just a concentrated salycidic acid which dries out the skin and can be purchased separately from other brands (probably less expensively too).</li>
            <li> This product used over one and a half weeks made my skin notably worse than it was before I started.</li>
            <li> The only downside to the kit is that it is slightly expensive and the individual pieces are somewhat small, but compared to something like proactive it isn&#x27;t that bad.  </li>
            <li> the worst it has been since I was pregnant!</li>
            <li> hardly any skin</li>
            <li> I have some at the edge of both cheeks which are really hard to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I finally developed a bad rash on my nose and quit using it altogether.</li>
            <li> so when I started to break out AGAIN, I was discouraged to say the least.</li>
            <li> I figured out that this product is Not oil-free and that is why I had negative results</li>
            <li> This month I had at least 10.  </li>
            <li> This product was skimpy for the price and did not do what the ads say, for me at least.</li>
            <li> The one negative thing was the shipping.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have acne as a teenager (now in my late 30s)</li>
            <li> My breakouts subsided for a few days, and then a week later my face was as bad as it had ever been.</li>
            <li> and I am in late twenties</li>
            <li> I used this product for a few weeks before giving up after it made my acne worse.</li>
            <li> No matter how often or seldom I used it, it burned and irritated my skin, and gave it a dull, shallow appearance.</li>
            <li> &quot; my skin tone and seemed to make the oiliness worse, not better, so I went on using just steps 1 and 2 of the system.  </li>
            <li> typical for my skin), but unfortunately, using the product has not helped with that.</li>
            <li> My review is a little unfair toward Olay as I had a severe skin reaction to this product.  </li>
            <li> But then I remembered the review from the magazine that said you HAVE to give this product at least four weeks!</li>
            <li> Bottomline is YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT and give this product at least 4 weeks to see the results!</li>
            <li> Maybe it will work for someone else, but it definitely has not helped my skin &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> I ordered on a Mon. morning and the product wasn&#x27;t taken to the PO until Fri., slow processing!</li>
            <li> , I thought maybe it wouldn&#x27;t dry my skin out too badly.</li>
            <li> Total Fail!!  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Olay Protocol for about two weeks and it seems like my acne is getting worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product didn&#x27;t help, it made it worse.</li>
            <li> After the using the Olay Acne Protocol for two weeks, my sking broke out into the worse breakout.</li>
            <li> I do not find it overly drying or irritating and can use it 2-3 times a day without issues.  </li>
            <li> I am holding out hope, but am not happy that it is not working how I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> I had been using ProActiv for years but never experienced the results that you see on the infomercials.</li>
            <li> In fact, it got worse.  </li>
            <li> Not dramatically worse, but I did see an increase.  </li>
            <li> and it was getting worse.</li>
            <li> My skin is worse now than it&#x27;s ever been</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a bummer to be out $40 for my skin to be worse than it was before.  </li>
            <li> My skin has gotten worse the longer</li>
            <li> olay pro x was making my blemishes worse.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not great for eye makeup removal,</li>
            <li> As the cleanser does a poor job of removing makeup, I&#x27;ve added a remover.</li>
            <li> In fact, the irritation got progressively worse.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t really broken out.</li>
            <li> MADE MY FACE BREAK OUT WORSE</li>
            <li> And I broke out WORSE than ever before.</li>
            <li> However, I have been using this system for a month now and have not seen any dramatic changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> It seems the acne treatment(step 2) was making my acne worse unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I am 22, and I have just been dealing with having annoying breakouts due to stress and hormones.</li>
            <li> The worst part is that you can&#x27;t cover that up with makeup, it only absorbs it and makes it look worse.    </li>
            <li> I used this kit, which is an uncomfortable feeling and worsens when I wear make up like concealer.   </li>
            <li> This has to be the 2nd worst acne treatment I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I did research on internet and bought the Rasul soap (don&#x27;t know how to spell this -- sorry).  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> I was wrong there.  </li>
            <li> and it hasnt failed me.  </li>
            <li> I saw a noticeable difference with in 1 week of using this product-- its not perfect, and I still get the hormonal breakouts around that time of the month.</li>
            <li> I was frustrated, to say the least, with my acne problem.   </li>
            <li> and unfortunately I will not be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> and my skin got WORSE!  </li>
            <li> My chin and jaw area broke out horribly that it took three weeks before my skin stopped looking like a red and inflamed brail board.</li>
            <li> Recently, it was horrible!</li>
            <li> but I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;skin clearing treatment\\&quot; made me break out in such a horrible way - it brought tears to my eyes</li>
            <li> However, it did make me break out on my neck, which is weird since I&#x27;ve never had breakouts in that area before.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worked well but not perfectly.</li>
            <li> Boy, was I wrong.</li>
            <li> Sad to say i couldnt find it.  </li>
            <li> If you have acne-prone skin, results in 3-4 weeks seems like an awful long time to use a product and wait for it to start working.</li>
            <li> I got tired of my skin either drying out or peeling badly after putting make up.</li>
            <li> Along my chin and cheeks are the worst little bumbs everywhere, but I&#x27;m trying to stick it out because I have heard sometimes a person will break out then</li>
            <li> I was desperate to try and change my skin</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re desperate, you could try it, but don&#x27;t expect any miracles, and don&#x27;t throw away the box.</li>
            <li> I will say that while Proactive dried my skin out horribly to the point of peeling, I have not had that problem with this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what type of acne I have, but it&#x27;s worst on my cheeks and jawline.  </li>
            <li> WRONG!  </li>
            <li> The one thing she didn&#x27;t like is that there are three phases to the process and it gets very tedious.  </li>
            <li> My face hurts so bad and it is so greasy from the lotion that comes with this acne system.</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t been this bad in years.</li>
            <li> Even dermatologists pop zits if they&#x27;re really bad.</li>
            <li> so bad that it made my skin literally crack like ice, and that would take almost a week to heal.</li>
            <li> However, if you have really bad cystic acne, I don&#x27;t believe that anything over the counter is going to work...</li>
            <li> and well the moisturizer isn&#x27;t bad - no complaints</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been this bad since I was a teenager</li>
            <li> Grrrr</li>
            <li> By this time, I was getting frustrated.</li>
            <li> Still frustrated.  </li>
            <li> My wife was shocked at how well Olay worked for her.  </li>
            <li> :-(      </li>
            <li> I bought it on Amazon for about 30, I was disappointed with the size of the bottles.  </li>
            <li> I am actually really disappointed since this is an Oil of Olay product.  </li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> In all, I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I contacted olay and found that this product has been discontinued :(  </li>
            <li> but I am disappointed that P&amp;G continues to test its products on animals which I think is terrible.  </li>
            <li> Yet, I was disappointed that it could not work for me!  </li>
            <li> this kit - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and would not recommend this product  to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this acne system for almost 5 weeks and my skin has been horrible since the 1st week.</li>
            <li> It was terrible.</li>
            <li> And I looked awful.</li>
            <li> I have always had terrible oily skin- and have tried every oil reducing serum/ face wash/ lotion and after using this product it&#x27;s been three days since i&#x27;ve used an oil blotting sheet!</li>
            <li> As soon as I thought my skin was clearing up, I would break out terribly.</li>
            <li> It was terrible.  </li>
            <li> In fact, by August of 2011 my skin was in the worst shape it has ever been.</li>
            <li> All I can say is, it wasn&#x27;t terrible.  </li>
            <li> What a horrible disappointment!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this for 3-4 days and it burned my cheeks horribly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWFUL!!</li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>
            <li> When I started using this product I started breaking out terribly!</li>
            <li> and my skin is horrible now!</li>
            <li> and so it was shocking to see that this made me break out.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered this product and it was old, expired.  I returned it and after several weeks, I still don&#x27;t have my money back.  Do not waste your time ordering this product or using this seller.</li>
            <li> In the past 6 months I have graduated from law school (after a killer finals period) and I have been studying for the Bar exam.  My face broke out worse these past 6 months from stress than it ever did when I was in high school. I have tried proactive (highly allergic) and the stuff for teenagers does not work on my adult skin (too harsh).  My skin noticeably improved after just one use of this product-even my parents commented.  Some comments about the products-     1)Cleanser- does not foam (which I know can bother some people), very soothing, not drying.     2)Treatment-absorbs into skin well, doesn&#x27;t burn.  I have been following the directions on the package (use 1-3x a day) and only using it once a day because I think more than that would be too drying. Another Note- does have a slight smell to it that might be off-putting to some people.        3)Lotion- I was surprised when I first used this and discovered it to be more of a gel as opposed to a traditional lotion.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and does a good job of balancing out the treatment. Note- does not contain SPF.       The only downside to the kit is that it is slightly expensive and the individual pieces are somewhat small, but compared to something like proactive it isn&#x27;t that bad.  Since the products are new and not available individually, I could see running out of one step and then having to buy another kit to replace it.     Overall, I would highly recommend this product-it has saved my skin!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne most of my teen and adult years. Disclaimer - I do have fairly mild acne (but annoying enough to want to treat!), so I&#x27;m not sure if this will work with people for severe acne. I also want to specify that I only use it once a day (instead of the recommended twice daily) since I have sensitive skin. It says to expect results around 4 weeks but I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 and have already seen results! I would break out on almost a daily basis before, but now I rarely get any pimples. And if I do, they&#x27;re very, very tiny and go away quickly. The biggest change I&#x27;ve seen is that my pores actually do look smaller! I started noticing this within the first week. I have to say I hoped it cured the acne but really didn&#x27;t think it would shrink my pores. I am now a believer!! Totally worth the price and worth trying!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Olay Protocol for about two weeks and it seems like my acne is getting worse. Along my chin and cheeks are the worst little bumbs everywhere, but I&#x27;m trying to stick it out because I have heard sometimes a person will break out then it will clear up.  Gosh, I hope so.  And the cleanser goes before the other two items (so if I decide to keep this line I will always have to buy the 3 just for the cleanser).  I have tried Oil of Olay and for the most part it is okay, but i thought since this is geared toward acne how could I loose.  I am a Black woman, and if this does not work I will try RX for Brown skin, and hopefully it will work.  I will keep you all posted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 41 years old but have a little bit of trouble with acne.  Since this is an Olay product I was pretty sure it would work well.  It did.  Thing I find odd about it is that both step 1 &amp; 2 have the same active ingredient with only a difference of .03%.  Step one is a salicylic acid 1.8% wash.  It doesn&#x27;t foam, but you rub it on your face with warm water and you can feel it working.  Step two is a salicylic acid 1.5% that you rub in and leave on.  I don&#x27;t understand why they both have the same active ingredient, but whatever - the program works.  Step three is simply a lotion that helps balance it all out.  My skin is sensitive, so when I first put the lotion on it does burn a little.  But it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  I&#x27;ll buy the kit again.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter tried this out for me. She is battling adolescent acne and has tried the much-touted brand that is being advertised as foolproof on TV but doesn&#x27;t actually work.  This one, however, from Olay is really doing what it promised to do! She is very pleased with it. I have noticed a difference in her skin too. Thanks, Amazon Vine, for giving me this to review!</li>
            <li> My review is a little unfair toward Olay as I had a severe skin reaction to this product.  I have traditionally loved Olay products for sensitive skin and wanted to try this for my adult acne.  Yet, I was disappointed that it could not work for me!  Oh well...</li>
            <li> I have occasional mild acne flare-ups. The appeal of this product was that it was for adult women. Well, this made my skin the worst it has been since I was pregnant! I had acne every morning I woke up. New spots, and hard cystic ones appeared after 1 day. I lasted 3 days thinking maybe my skin had to get used to it. Threw it out this morning and went back to good old Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I am 23 years old, female, Asian-American.&lt;br /&gt;I started having acne problems when I turned 22, up until now I have had nice skin, hardly any skin problems.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried chemical cleansers (proactive, shiseido, murad) and natural cleansers (st. ives) and spot treatments (eradikate). I was desperate to try and change my skin and so I bought this product since I had read so many great things from the reviews. It seemed to work for most people and it seemed as if it was specifically geared for individuals who were older with acne problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me at all. It helped possibly for the first 2 days, I say some of the redness starting to diminish, but the longer I used it the worse it seemed to get. I have been using the 3 step product for about 2 to 2.5 weeks now and am I getting acne in areas that I never had any before. The amount of outbreaks are increasing and outbreaks are more painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it would have worked for me, because I really don&#x27;t know what other products that I would use. I maintain a healthy diet, exercise and although I have a high stress level, that stress level has been the same since I was 18.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product didn&#x27;t help, it made it worse.</li>
            <li> I purchased this protocol hoping that it would help with some the skin issues that I have faced. I really like Olay products and was kind of excited to hear about this new acne protocol. I didn&#x27;t have problem skin until after I had my children and was in my early twenties. I can&#x27;t say that I have tried everything, as I have not had this problem very long, but I was hoping for at least something to get breakouts under control. The first day that I used the product my skin felt great. Very soft and smoothe and the products are very creamy and have a nice feel to them. I decided to go ahead and use the protocol twice a day. Over the next day or so I noticed that my skin was visibly more oily than before and I was starting to breakout oven worse than before. I even got a few blemishes on my forehead, which usually is very clear being a minimal concern compared to the rest of my face. Seeking advice from others, I asked my mom if she could see any difference in my skin, without mentioning the new protocol and she replied that she could see that I was starting to breakout out over my nose and cheeks! After telling her about the protocol she offered the suggestion that maybe it gets worse before it gets better and that since I had spent the money on the product I should use it for a couple more days to see if it starts to improve. Well, I did continue to use the product hoping that my mom would be right, and unfortunately it did not get any better. So, needless to say, I will be trying to get the money back that I spent on this product. I really wanted this to work and I like the other Olay products that I have tried, so, for me, this was a big disappointment.[[ASIN:B004UDRUJW Olay Professional Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol]]</li>
            <li> I have always struggled with my skin.  I get blackheads due to my oily skin and then I pick them and get a scar.  So I cut a few things out of my diet (coffee namely) and that still did not completely fix my issue.  I had resolved to go to the dermatologist after realizing that I needed some professional help.  You see, I have tried just about all of the over the counter, department store, and what ever else is out there.  I was on Amazon and stumbled upon this product.  I decided to try it before spending hundreds of dollars and I am so glad that I did!  My skin has done a 180.  My pores are noticeably smaller, less break outs and the texture is so smooth.  I have been using the product for about a week and I am not turning back.  Love this for my African-American skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since I was eleven. Over my teen years I&#x27;ve tried everything, including Proactiv Solution (which has benzoyl peroxide as opposed to salicylic acid in the Olay protocol) that made my skin worse. Now I&#x27;m 24 and bizarrely have started breaking out with cystic acne for the first time. So given that I have dry, sensitive skin and my acne is hormonal I thought I should try Olay&#x27;s Pro X acne regimen: \\&quot;Expert formulations balance moisture levels and minimize the appearance of oily skin throughout hormonal fluctuations.\\&quot;   I used this kit for 30 days, diligently twice a day. I expected my skin to break out at first as it&#x27;s all coming to the surface so the acne kit can properly clear the skin. About a week in that is exactly what happened. What I didn&#x27;t expect were the many tiny white heads I got in unexpected places on my skin - forehead, cheeks and nose. I get a new one almost every day. I haven&#x27;t had this occur since my early teens. These areas were clear before I started the kit. My main problem was and still is cystic acne on my chin. Another reviewer on here had this break out happen and blamed the third step, which is the gel-type moisturizer, and discontinued its use. I wanted to be faithful to the regimen so continued to use it even though I also believe it&#x27;s the culprit to my break out.   Step 1: Pore Clarifying Cleanser  This was useless in general. It didn&#x27;t make my skin feel clean at all. It ran out by about 3 weeks. With my pores still clogged after using this step I opted to use Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst Surge Energizing Power Cleanser which has made my skin feel much softer and cleaner.  Step 2: Skin Clearing Treatment  This does not clear the skin. It ran out by 3 and a half weeks. It contains 1.5% salicylic acid. The only acne skin clearing treatment to even remotely help my skin contains 10% benzoyl peroxide. This treatment constantly dried out my skin along with step 3. My skin has been feeling tighter the longer I used this kit, which is an uncomfortable feeling and worsens when I wear make up like concealer.   Step 3: Complexion Renewing Lotion  I actually do believe this improved my skin&#x27;s complexion a bit. But over the weeks with my acne getting worse from this kit with two cystic pimples becoming five (and my forehead attacked with white heads which I still have to this day and refuse to go away), this product ended up burning my skin every time I put it on. My original cystic acne I&#x27;ve had now for two months and this product only made the problem worse. It&#x27;s said to \\&quot;fade the look of spots and redness\\&quot;? It CAUSED spots and redness for me. If you have any sensitivity to your skin whatsoever avoid this product. They even include this lotion with the Pro X Clear trial kit that has the intensive refining sulfur mask. It feels like oily gel on your skin and causes inflammation and dryness.   I only got this kit for around $25 on ebay. Despite this, it was a waste of money and a disservice to my skin. At least from trying it I know for a fact benzoyl peroxide works better for me. I&#x27;ll have to try Dermatologists again.</li>
            <li> I am SO happily surprised with this product! I am a 26 year old that has recently been having skin problems, and I was convinced nothing short of a trip to the dermatologist would work. In high school I had minor acne, nothing unusual, but when I hit my twenties I had a horrible flair up! Five years ago I was on Accutane (worked wonderful, but NEVER AGAIN, the health problems I experienced were not worth it!) and antibiotics (Also worked wonderfully, but I am hearing the dangers of them and trying to steer clear!) so when I started to break out AGAIN, I was discouraged to say the least. I picked up the Olay pro-x with low expectations.... and WOW!   Two days in I broke out again, which I expected (the toxins have to escape somehow!)... and a week in, my face was absolutely noticeably clearer. Now, two weeks in, my face is CLEAR, definitely more even, and the thing I MOST love... it is baby soft and just so happens to look much younger. Woo! :) (I added the use of the Olay moisturizer just for around my eyes and mouth/lips, since I always need a little more moisturizer.) I absolutely adore this product and I want to thank Olay for making it! :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this acne system for almost 5 weeks and my skin has been horrible since the 1st week. Since using this product I have had a ton of cystic acne all over my chin and jaw line plus acne around my nose and cheeks where I wouldn&#x27;t usually get it before using the product. This has to be the 2nd worst acne treatment I have ever used. My face hurts so bad and it is so greasy from the lotion that comes with this acne system. I&#x27;m so embarrassed by it. I&#x27;m hoping to get another receipt from the seller so I can return this and get my money back. I also bought the Olay spin brush with this and I absolutely love that...I just don&#x27;t like the acne products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I contacted Oil of Olay to find out about refunding my money for this product and they were so nice about it. I didn&#x27;t have to mail anything back and I took care of the whole thing over the phone. I would now say that this product is worth a try because it is so simple to get your money back if you don&#x27;t like it. Bonus is that they are sending me coupons for all the other Olay products my family uses!</li>
            <li> At last I have clear skin. Not only does Olay Pro X work but it really worked for me. I&#x27;m amazed my redness, acne and scars have virtually disappeared. When I do feel an occasional breakout it &#x27;s gone in days, not weeks like before with a scar as proof of it&#x27;s existence. I also have sensitive skin and allergies but have no reaction what so ever so all around I am very happy with the result I have received with Olay Pro X.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27, started having embarrassing breakouts this summer. I don&#x27;t understand why!!! Grrrr I previously used this awesome \\&quot;Reclaim\\&quot; product for years and years for anti aging benefits and it was awesome! Now I have stopped using all anti wrinkle products due to their heavy nature. This stuff worked great for me at first, my bottles are close to empty.  Now seems I have wrinkles and acne! I went to the spa and bought all of the expensive facial stuff and that didn&#x27;t work either, so no offense to Olay... Keep trying!</li>
            <li> I had been using this product since the end of January and was extremely excited to see clear results since others have had success with it.Unfortunately my skin actually got waaay worse,I tried to continue use to see if it would get better but ended the use around the middle of March.I figured out that this product is Not oil-free and that is why I had negative results,it&#x27;s too bad but just be aware of that and don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46 and have been battling acne for 30 yrs. I&#x27;ve never managed to achieve perfectly clear skin, but for the past several years I&#x27;ve been using other Olay products that have kept it pretty much under control, aside from the occasional 1-2 hormonal related monthly blemishes. I tried this new system hoping to maybe even manage to eliminate those.  When I started, my skin was currently in its best condition, having just cleared up the last monthly blemish (they usually only last about 3 days).  Unfortunately, after a little over a week on these products I now have 6 new active blemishes, 2 of which I have been dealing with for 5 days now with no improvement in sight.  My skin hasn&#x27;t been this bad in years. :-(      I guess I&#x27;ll be returning to my previous regimen, which includes Olay&#x27;s Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-aging Cleanser plus Blemish Control, Olay Oil Minimizing Toner, Olay Complete Daily UV Moisturizer for Combination/Oily skin, and Total Effects Night Firming Cream. I can highly recommend all of those products, plus the Regenerist Anti-aging Eye Roller.  I love my Olay products, but this system is a great disappointment.</li>
            <li> I too have mild/sensitive skin. I would mostly breakout in the chin area. I have been using for about 2 weeks twice a day and man I can tell a difference. Most of the redness I had before has toned down/gone and my pores look smaller. Rarely get a pimple and if I do it is small and goes away quiclky (just as the other reviewer stated) My skin is not as oily. Love it. I don&#x27;t normally wear any foundation but would have to use a concealer on the breakouts but now no make up on my face (dont need it). I feel so fresh. Can&#x27;t say enough good things :)</li>
            <li> As an adult acne sufferer, I look for products that can help keep my face clear.  I had some Amazon gift cards and purchased this product from here.  It has definitely cleared up my skin.  I have noticed less breakouts and a clearing of my complexion.  You have to use it following instructions, I use it in the morning and before bed and have noticed a difference within the 1st week.  I am on my fourth week and it is still working.</li>
            <li> I will start off by saying that I have had problem skin all my life. I have tried everything from Accutane to Retinol, so I was not expecting this product to cure my acne,  but I was hoping for something that would \\&quot;calm\\&quot; the problem. The problem with this product is that the use of the three steps, even just once per day, overdries the skin. For me, dry skin worsens acne. This product used over one and a half weeks made my skin notably worse than it was before I started. In my opinion, and as someone who has used just about everything on the market, I would recommend Proactiv (in conjunction with Neutrogena glycerin soap--the non medicated version). It keeps the skin hydrated and does a better job of calming acne symptoms at a comparable price.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a blemish here or there, the Olay product may provide results. Anyone with moderate to severe acne, I would recommend looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product thinking I had finally found a product that works for my skin. My skin is oily and acne prone and I have tried many products over the years including Proactiv which dried my skin out really bad. After the using the Olay Acne Protocol for two weeks, my sking broke out into the worse breakout. I had cystic acne all over my skin especially the chin and cheek areas. I stopped using the product and have returned it for a refund. It just goes to show that what works for some does not work for others. I for one will never purchase this product again and in good conscience cannot recommend it.</li>
            <li> Written by my wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 49 years old and have been using this product for a month now. Throughout my life I&#x27;ve had perfect skin, but am now finding my post-menopausal skin having the occasional breakout.  I have tried acne products targeted for younger people but have found them to be way too harsh for my face.  I needed a product that could control the acne, but that also could provide moisture for the dryer areas of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is effective and I am seeing results.  My outbreaks have almost disappeared and my skin isn&#x27;t drying up.  Please note, I only use step 2 once a day as directed for those of us that don&#x27;t have really oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have to do regular exfoliation, and do find a toner a few times a week helps as well.  Overall, though, I think it is a good product and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I grew up when Olay Professionals went by the name of Oil of Olay. The name never sounded that appealing to me, I always have had oily skin and anybody that puts \\&quot;oil\\&quot; on their name is not going to be the first product I grab for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was over 20 years ago though. I am now 38 years old and still am prone to an occasional breakout every now and then. If my skin is clear, it seems clear, if it breaks out, it breaks out bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried every boxed acne kit out there. Another brand worked but after awhile the results seemed to fade. It was if my skin got used to the product. I used the Acne Protocol for almost 6 weeks. I think it is suppose to last 4 but I was able to get more out of it. The first thing I loved was it did not have benzoyl peroxide. I have always had a bad reaction to benzoly peroxide and would break out with a huge red rash on my face. In the last few years the only thing that works is Salicylic Acid. Granted the percentage is less than other products of its kind but after using it for several weeks my face was clearer and stayed acne free. I also seemed to have oily skin and this product kept it at bay. It is very easy to use and the results, even though they took some time, it worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall is the product does stain. Be sure not to wear a favorite shirt while washing your face or even if you have the lotion on when you sleep. I noticed a lot of orange marks on my clothing/pillowcases. I think it is from the salicylic acid, I have had that issue with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product that I would recommend for woman in their late 30&#x27;s that still suffer from acne. This will clear it up and keep it that way, very impressed.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I am 35 years old and have dealt with acne since college.  I usually just deal with it, the random breakouts here and there, and then of coarse, the monthly breakouts that always come.  i wanted to try a new product to help with my skin now that i am also getting older.   Pros:  my skin feels clean without being dry.  I really like the renewal lotion (more like a gel then a lotion).  I do feel like some of the redness and spots have faded (still there, but not as obvious).  Cons:  I still have acne.  It hasn&#x27;t gotten better or worse. You can not buy the products individually.    I will use the rest of the 3 step kit, but i will not buy it again.  I do not feel like the skin clearing treatment was beneficial.  If i was able to buy the products separately, i would consider the cleanser and the gel, but would find another acne spot treatment.  I have used the product for a month now, and I have to say that it doesn&#x27;t even help hurry the breakout process along.  I got a spot on my forehead 5 days ago, and still have it.  And also, got another one on my check 3 days ago, and saw one forming just tonight.  typical for my skin), but unfortunately, using the product has not helped with that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product religiously for several weeks now and I&#x27;ve seen quite a difference. My break-outs have stopped and my skin feels smooth and even-toned. My ONLY complaint is that you can&#x27;t buy these components separately. The skin clearning lotion (step 2) and the moisterizing lotion (step 3) only require a very small amount each time and go a long way. The cleanser however (step 1) requires more at each use and therefore is used up much faster. Please OLAY, either make the cleanser bigger or sell it separately! If not for that I would have given this product 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I have used many products to control my acne, including Accutane. But nothing has worked for me like Oil of Olay Pro Clear. My skin also dries out very easily. This system truly gives you the results you need, but keeps your skin hydrated, and looking healthy. Also, it smells really nice, which is a great change from other products. I hope they keep making this product because it has given me clear skin, which is something I&#x27;ve been trying to get for a long time!</li>
            <li> Before I bought this I read a lot of reviews, and from what I saw it either works wonders or doesn&#x27;t work at all. I gave it 3 stars for those of the people that it actually works for. For me, I guess I wasn&#x27;t one of the lucky ones. I&#x27;m 22 years old, have had acne since I was 10 and have been looking for the magical product that will finally  just make it go away. By the time I finally grow out of acne I&#x27;ll have wrinkles to worry about!   I used this product for a few weeks before giving up after it made my acne worse. What I noticed was that when I did get a pimple, it would make it take twice as long for it to go away.   I do pop my zits sometimes, which yes could be one of the reasons this didn&#x27;t work for me. Even dermatologists pop zits if they&#x27;re really bad. Sometimes you just gotta do it to relieve the pain and pressure built up! So I would not advise using this product if you can&#x27;t resist picking at your acne at times, I think it&#x27;s meant for people with stronger will power. What I noticed was the cream that you put on that dries your skin out dried out my recently-popped zit so bad that it made my skin literally crack like ice, and that would take almost a week to heal. It was terrible. And I looked awful. The worst part is that you can&#x27;t cover that up with makeup, it only absorbs it and makes it look worse.    Try it, and if it works for you then that&#x27;s awesome, and if not don&#x27;t be too disappointed because it seems to be a pretty even split. I&#x27;d find a friend who&#x27;s curious split the cost so that if it doesn&#x27;t work for you maybe it&#x27;d work for your friend.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been on Rx skincare twice, and to no avail.  We tried all over-the-counter skin care systems, plus a few tv/infomercials and nothing worked.  This has worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 20 but I still get hormonal cystic acne along with white/black heads as well as comedone on my forehead. I&#x27;ve only used this twice over a span of three days to test it out and am shocked about how fantastic this product has worked. Two things that stand out for me when i read about this product does, 1. This product says that it balances the oils of your face and they are not lying about that. I have always had terrible oily skin- and have tried every oil reducing serum/ face wash/ lotion and after using this product it&#x27;s been three days since i&#x27;ve used an oil blotting sheet! yay!- that being said the dryness of the product people referred to probably balanced it out, yes I did have some flakes but I also use the clarisonic (that has always helped me with dry flaky skin)  2. It reduces red marks and evens skin tone - SO TRUE! i&#x27;m guilty of picking, therefore i get red marks, but they&#x27;re gone completely after using this product. red underlying pimple marks that i&#x27;ve not picked, disappeared after having them for weeks. For me, this is one of the only products that i&#x27;ve actually seen improvement. This might get repetitive but, I too, have used everything under the sun. drugstore brands, department store brands, OTC, OCM (oil cleansing method), natural plants.. nothing worked, it kept me inside and never wanting to go out and show my face    But let me emphasize that what you put on the outside on your face does half the work!! It&#x27;s only maintaining what&#x27;s going on the inside  When puberty is over we have nothing left but the hormones in our body and if they&#x27;re not regulated with exercise and good diet, hormonal acne will always keep coming!  i&#x27;ve been running 4 miles (approx 45 mins) everyday for about two weeks and my skin heals faster than it ever has plus pimples heal before it ever touches the surface!! as a college kid I don&#x27;t always eat fruits and veg but just the fact that my blood is able to flow and toxins are always coming out my body is neutralizingit&#x27;s hormones. JUST SAYIN!     So now with my new routine plus olay&#x27;s product my skin is looking and feeling better by the minute, it hasn&#x27;t looked this great and under control in years!</li>
            <li> This product is the best acne system I have tried to date.  I experienced absolutely no drying out of my skin, and my acne cleared up within a week.  This system is gentle enough to use twice a day, and my skin looks healthier now than it did even before I had acne.  Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I dont normally have acne, but i am extremely susceptible to it with really oily skin...so i got this to maintain my skin.....So far I have gotten more acne than I normally get but I think it might have been something else I used at the same time. I am still on the fence about this product set...I really want to believe it works, but i just dont see enough clarity to know for sure its working.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness!  An affordable acne care solution that you don&#x27;t have to get a subscription to purchase!  This product WORKS.  I am a 29 year old female who is sick of *still* dealing with the occasional pimple (dang oily skin!).  I started using Olay Professional Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol and I have not had to deal with a pimple since.  The system is very similar to ProActiv, in terms of the 3-step use (and even the way the product feels/smells) but with Olay, you don&#x27;t have to subscribe and keep getting charged each month for more and more product.  I&#x27;ve made the switch and I&#x27;m so happy I did.  Use it consistently, and it will work.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for a month and a half and it actually seemed to make my acne worse.  I would only get one or two breakouts a month before, so I thought I would use this to try to combat those.  This month I had at least 10.  I&#x27;m sure it is a good product but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Cleared up a chronic case of adult acne like now!  Worth the price and my wife thinks Olay has the greatest products on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product is worth a try. i wouldnt reccomend it to anyone. But to those that like it, great for you.  I tried to stick to this product but it didnt work.??? I followed the instructions and waited more than a month for it to work. My face was broken out the whole month but only my cheeks and chin. My forehead was clear as possible. I called to ask if an inital breakout was normal but the lady couldt comprehend me ???. (Language barrier) The only thing i did like was the feel of a kinda smoothness to my skin. But the breakout of tiny bumbs and larger ones was awlful. So i choose to refund the product after so much wishful thinking. It took about a month for them to send me the envelope to return the product and its instructions was not clear.Ive been holding on to the reciept forever thinking they would send me another envelope but was  told that i was supposed to sent it with the product which sounds like they didnt receive yet. It seems like its noraml to get your money back after atleast 3months if you read their minds right. I know Olay is a good company but I think im done with them.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product. It worked very well for me.  I have been struggle for the last year with premenstrual blemish. I decided to try Oil OF Olay because they got an award last year as the best anti wrinkle eyes cream.  So, for my surprise with 27$ for 3 products (compare to 120$ I spent before with other brand) I solved my problem.  My face skin is absolutely fabulous, clean and moisturized.  I truly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am writing a review for any skincare product.  This product has worked so well for me that I wanted to share my experience.  Although I never suffered from acne as a teen, I developed adult acne in my mid twenties and have suffered with it ever since.  I have tried Dermalogica, ProActiv, Murad, Clinique, and a million other drug store products with little and/or short lived success.  I was a little hesitant to buy as I read some reviewers who said it caused them to develop cystic acne but I decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!  I never had any initial period of additional breakouts and immediately saw a difference in the clarity and texture of my skin.  I mainly suffered from breakouts in the chin and forehead area and those areas are now completely clear and I am seeing the gradual fading of old marks which I am thrilled about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the Olay Microdermabrasion kit and use that once a week as well to help with lightening of marks and sun damage.  If you are on the fence, I would definitely give it a try!  I would have given it 5 stars but I am disappointed that P&amp;G continues to test its products on animals which I think is terrible.  If I could find another product that was able to clear my skin and did not test on animals, I would switch in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this product for Christmas because my acne suddenly worsened after the summer. Using this product was like riding a roller coaster. As soon as I thought my skin was clearing up, I would break out terribly. And just when I thought that my skin couldn&#x27;t get any worse, my acne got a little better. After 5 weeks though, my acne is the same as, if not worse than when I started the recommended regimen. I guess I&#x27;ll just finish up the bottles, but I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I first started trying this about two weeks ago and if I go by other reviewers I should wait it out.  I saw no improvement but not a whole lot of extra blemishes either.  I felt the face wash itself was too thin - I like something that lathers up a little better or even has a gritty texture to it which leaves my face feeling really smooth and clean afterwards. Step two is just a concentrated salycidic acid which dries out the skin and can be purchased separately from other brands (probably less expensively too). Finally the moisturizer felt thin and greasy.  Well, after all that I managed to get poison ivy on my face so I went back to a regimen I was more comfortable with - I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m going to be able to pick this product back up to try it again for the recommended four weeks...</li>
            <li> As someone who is just starting to get wrinkles, but never grew out of acne, I am always looking for products that can take care of both issues. I&#x27;m not sure that this regimen is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is billed as an acne protocol for adults, but there seems to be nothing  here that distinguishes it from anything aimed at teenagers. ( I usually use Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti- Wrinkle Anti-Acne cream)No anti-aging benefits as far as I can tell, other than the last step is a moisturizer, which is hardly revolutionary.&lt;br /&gt;The anti-acne ingredient is salicylic acis, and at a fairly low concentration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 weeks of use, all I have noticed is that my skin is a little softer. There has been absolutely no improvement in my acne ( which is mild). My pores do not seem clearer or reduced in size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As there is no SPF in the moisturizer ( shame on you, Olay!)  I&#x27;ve had to add that,  and I&#x27;ve had to supplement these 3 products with a benzoyl peroxide spot treatment.  These 3 products just are not doing the job for me . Back to Neutrogena!</li>
            <li> Olay Professional Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol is a great skin cleanser.  It leaves your skin feeling clean and smooth.  It cleans the skin without drying it out.  My teen-aged daughter was having real issues with oily skin.  The Olay Professional Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol Kit has cleared up her skin and has prevented breakouts for several weeks.  I am confident that with continued use her skin will remain clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been using Proavtive for years and it was starting to become very ineffective at keeping my skin clear. It never totally got rid of the breakouts but it controlled them better and they were not as severe.   For the last year I was getting little red bumps all over my face and Proactive was NOT helping with them so I decided to try something else! I saw Olay Professional Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol reviewed in In-Style Magazine and they had mentioned it had helped the author with some of the similar problems I had been experiencing so I decided to try it.   Pricing is comparable to Proactive so that is not an issue. After trying Pro-X Clear for two weeks I was frustrated because I felt I had more breakouts then before...I was freaking out! But then I remembered the review from the magazine that said you HAVE to give this product at least four weeks! After bringing out those initial zits it was just clearing out all the ones that were just under the surface.   I am in week five now and my face is about 95% clearer! The red rash/bumps are GONE and after having 4 children I had some darkening of the skin and that has cleared as well! My face is as clear as it EVER was! I will recommend this product to EVERYONE I know!   Bottomline is YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT and give this product at least 4 weeks to see the results! I saw a bunch of reviewers who gave is a week or two and then said it was making them breakout....that is was it is suppose to do! Clean out your pores and bring everything to a head, so to speak. But when you come out on the other side (3-4-5 weeks) you have BEAUTIFUL skin!!</li>
            <li> This is a tough one for me to review, because while it ABSOLUTELY DID NOT WORK for me, I do know enough about skincare products to allow for the fact that results do vary from person to person.  Speaking for myself, this regimen was a total failure.  Not only did it not clear up my skin--it aggravated the problem enormously. I was getting breakouts in places I never had them before-ever. It almost got humorous-every day I would wake up to find what area had broken out next.  I stopped using the serum after only 3 days, because I am convinced that was one of the reasons my skin kept deteriorating.  But, even just using the cleanser and corrective cream(?), nothing improved. I agree with some of the other negative reviews--the fact that the products are cream-based, after using them, your face never does feel quite clean. And apparently, there is a very small percentage of salacylic acid in the formula, which is the stuff that&#x27;s supposed to moderate the skin&#x27;s oil. If you&#x27;re desperate, you could try it, but don&#x27;t expect any miracles, and don&#x27;t throw away the box.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and have tried a million different products for troubled skin, then I feel your pain. I have been using Olay Pro Clear for about three weeks now and although I still have breakouts, especially when I am hormonal, right before my cycle, etc., The overall appearance of my skin has improved and the time it takes for my breakouts to start to fade is just a few days. Also, my skin is not dry at all using this product and only seems to get oily if the weather is hot. Two tricks that I have learned to try to keep my skin clear are 1) Use the most gentle plain facial cleanser for removing make-up like foundation and cover up  I use Cetaphil cleanser  2) Don&#x27;t try to use alot of different products on a particularly troubled area, just keep with the daily regimen for as long as you can. If it&#x27;s still out of control, it&#x27;s probably time to switch to another system better for your skin type. I&#x27;m no professional! That&#x27;s just me :) Maybe it will help you too! I definatley approve of Olay Pro Clear!</li>
            <li> I am 23 and I have tried so many other products and treatments including- proactive, clearsil, neutrogena, acnefree, and aveeno. I think this product works so well for me because it is less harsh. Other treatments focus on the power and strength of their ingredients but they just made my skin super sensitive and made my acne dry and flaky. I love that they created this for adults because it seems like someone finally got it right. I will admit that it can make my skin oily, but my acne is gone so I can handle the oil..I just carry a powder compact with me to de-shine. I use the olay cleansing brush too and my skin is so soft now and I feel so great.</li>
            <li> I was slightly disappointed at first because it took sooooooo long to start noticing a difference in my skin. It took about 8 weeks for a noticable difference, but now my skin looks GREAT! I am very impresssed with this product and have subscribed to getting it every 3 months now! It&#x27;s not a miracle cream, it does not work after one use, but if you keep using it you will be happy with the results!</li>
            <li> I am 46 years old and still having breakouts for the last few years. This is what I have tried during the last 24 months: 1) went to doctor for gels and antibiotics - did not notice difference. I got tired of my skin either drying out or peeling badly after putting make up. 2) Spent about $250 on products by Beauticontrol to help with anti-aging and acne - this did not work. 3) Then saved $$$ to buy Obagi - this worked for about 10 months and then it just was not doing anything for me.  4) Went back to docs and was put on more gels and antibiotics -- this did not help. By this time, I was getting frustrated. I don&#x27;t have severe acne, just the ocassional bumps and pimple that comes with cycle. Nothing is more frustrating than being over 40 and feeling like you are going through puberty all over again.  I did research on internet and bought the Rasul soap (don&#x27;t know how to spell this -- sorry).  Still frustrated.  About 6 weeks ago, I bought the Olay Pro X and after a week, I did notice that my face was clearing up.  No bumps.  I began to get compliments on my skin....I then stopped using it for about a week because I got lazy at night with face washing...and noticed my face was not as clear.  Got back on again -- I really believe that this does work for me.  However, if you have really bad cystic acne, I don&#x27;t believe that anything over the counter is going to work...you just need to try different things until you find something that works. This works for me and I will continue to buy it. I do agree with some folks about the expense and quantity of the facial wash. What I don&#x27;t like is that i have to buy the whole kit again where I live. Olay should sell these items separately and for this reason I gave them 4 stars...Olay, can you please contact me? I know you are reading these posts.</li>
            <li> Started using this product a few days before Thanksgiving this year and thought I noticed a little bit of a change.  My face is fairly oily and I have ever present blackheads it seems, which are the main cause for my pimples.  I use a face wash I got from the person who I get facials from and have fairly clear skin when I use that and get a facial, but let&#x27;s be honest that&#x27;s getting pretty expensive.  I thought this might be a good solution for me since I did not want to go back to using Proactiv, which I used about 3-5 years.  My pimples are still coming up, not as long or as big as before, but still present.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that I continue to get new pimples.  Not really thrilled with this product and am thinking that I will probably go back to my other face wash since the effect was fairly similar, cost significantly less and lasts 3x as long.  I&#x27;m hoping to find a product that will work to clear up my skin, being 26 with acne is not a fun.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, and based on others&#x27; reviews, I thought I would. I used it for roughly 6/7 months, and saw absolutely no change in my skin. I had no fewer breakouts, and the look of my skin remained dull and dry. I&#x27;m 34, and still have occassional breakouts. I was looking for something that would be mild enough for my sensitive skin, but effective for acne. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My twin sister and I are trying to find a product that will clear our skin of acne, scars and redness. We have been going through Neutrogena products for years trying to find a some-what cheap solution... not happening. At 17 years old, we&#x27;re wondering if this product is suitable for our younger skin? And with this product, how many uses do you get out of each bottle?  Thanks! :D  - The Twins ;P</li>
            <li> I love this Olay Pro-x clear. It makes my skin feel very nice. It took 2 weeks for it to start working , as with any skin regimen, and my skin got worse before it got better, but it works great! Lessens the redness in my face. It is just great. I would highly recommend this product. Also, Amazon was VERY helpful and fast when I had a problem with my shipment.</li>
            <li> I have 41 yr. old skin that is sensitive, oily and acne prone.  Although I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t had issues with sensitivity, these products do not seem very effective.  I&#x27;ve been using them for four weeks twice a day (although I can&#x27;t use step 3 every day - makes my face even oilier!)and I&#x27;ve seen little improvement over my previous regime (Olay wash for sensitive skin and Regenerist serum).  I&#x27;m going to give it another couple weeks and use the rest of the product and I also just ordered the mask to see if that makes a difference. I like Olay products and will continue using them-I just cannot justify the cost of this product for how it performs.  They do offer a money-back guarantee, so really you have nothing to lose - try it!  Hopefully it will work for you.  If my opinion changes I will definitely update my review.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because it sounded like what I have been looking for.  However, after a couple of weeks, I was out of the cleanser and barely used any of the other two products.  Then came to find out, it is not in stores (still) and you have to order the entire \\&quot;starter kit\\&quot; all over again just to get the cleanser.  Reminds me of Proactiv...very limited suppliers and hard to get just what you need.</li>
            <li> As an adult, I get acne from time to time.  This product helped to clear my skin fast.  I loved that it did not dry my face.  The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like is that the cleanser did not contain an exfoliant.  The cleanser that I usually use has an exfolliant and it helps to make my face feel smooth.  All in all, I do like this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month now. I have combination skin and need a product that won&#x27;t dry my face out. I have used Proactiv in the past but found it was too harsh for my face. So I was excited to give this a try.     I have found that my outbreaks have decreased after the initial time period when I started the system. It also didn&#x27;t try my skin out once I started using step 2 once a day as directed for those of us that don&#x27;t have really oily skin.     The downside with this product for me is that it doesn&#x27;t have an exfoliater. I priced the Oil of Olay face mask to see about using it because I don&#x27;t like mixing products and was quite taken aback with the price. I feel like this kit is quite pricey and to buy the exfoliant was a lot extra. I did find that I didn&#x27;t need to scrub my face because I didn&#x27;t flake and peel as much as with other products. Additionally, I feel like I&#x27;m going to run out of the moisturizer early if I don&#x27;t really watch the amounts. I made it through the month but didn&#x27;t really have anything to spare. I tend to use wash and moisturizer on my neck as well so maybe if I just did the face I would have a little extra.     Overall, I think it is a good product and I will likely stick with it for another month to see if it makes a bigger difference.</li>
            <li> If you have acne-prone skin, results in 3-4 weeks seems like an awful long time to use a product and wait for it to start working. By this time you&#x27;ll be ready to invest in a second box. One positive thing about this product is that it says it&#x27;s good for controlling oily skin. It seems gentle and doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant odor. The price might be a little high once you realize you need to keep purchasing this item over and over.</li>
            <li> I have never tried an Oil of Olay product that I did not like.  I assumed I&#x27;d like this one as well.  And I do.  I did not get this kit for acne. I got it for milia.  Milia are small white bumps under the skin usually located around the eyes.  I had read that salicylic acid was good to help get rid of milia.  Well, I can&#x27;t say for sure if it has helped that yet.  I will continue to use it and hope it does.  I have noticed that it does work on my enlarged pores.  That is a definite plus.  The kit overall gives my face a softer texture.  I only use it once a day because I have extremely sensitive skin.  Salicylic acid can be very harsh on sensitive skin.  No issues at all with my sensitivity.  One of the bottles in the kit contains a gel which looks a lot like the Oil of Olay Regenerist Serum.  I have used the serum for years and really like it.      So, I can&#x27;t say this works for acne.  I have no way of knowing that.  I can say it:  reduces enlarged pores, gives your skin a smoother texture and doesn&#x27;t break out sensitive skin.  Like I said, I love Oil of Olay products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just turned 43 and I get a few blemishes around PMS time. I know that the active ingredient in this product, salicylic acid, is supposed to be the best thing for keeping skin clear, so it seems like this product should work. It feels good going on, but I honestly can&#x27;t say that it helped me. I have not noticed any difference after using this product.</li>
            <li> I am a 34 year old female who has been battling acne my whole life.  My acne recently turned a bit more cystic.  I am very sensitive to products using benzoyl peroxide and was happy to see an acne skin care line that didn&#x27;t use it.  I have been using the product for over 2 months and have been following the directions exactly. My first &#x27;set&#x27; lasted me 6 weeks.    The cleanser works well enough although I wanted to mention it doesn&#x27;t foam or give you that &#x60;squeaky clean&#x27; feel that some people look for.  I also found that I ran out of the cleanser before the treatment and lotion. The treatment lotion goes on well and absorbs quickly. I do not find it overly drying or irritating and can use it 2-3 times a day without issues.  I am in love with the step 3 lotion; it does tingle on application but leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth.  I feel that I am treating my acne but also moisturizing my skin and hopefully preventing a few wrinkles along the way.    Overall my skin is much clearer than it was before and the overall texture has improved but it isn&#x27;t the miracle fix that I was praying that it would be.  I still have regular whitehead breakouts and one or two cystic acne spots a month.  I plan on continuing to use it as it is a reasonable price and is doing an decent job.  I just wish I could have that prefect skin one day.</li>
            <li> I love Olay products and I usually us the pro x face wash but I thought I would give this a try. I washed my face with the cleanser before bed and did the other two steps and I really didn&#x27;t like the way my skin felt after using the wash. It felt really heavy (not clean). I love it when my skin feels light and tingly and it just didn&#x27;t feel that way with this wash but I finished all the steps and the next morning when I woke up my face had pimples all over it like I was 14 all over again. Most were small but I had a huge one on my laugh line and I haven&#x27;t had one that big for years. Sorry but I have to return it. It might work for other people but this product just didn&#x27;t agree with my skin. I still love olay but I will stick with my pro x and total effects lotion.</li>
            <li> I started breaking out more after using this. The plus was the repair serum which made my skin feel a lot softer but with all the little whiteheads everywhere I rather have clear skin than soft skin.</li>
            <li> I had a lone pimple sprout up a month back and started using Olay Pro X Clear immediately. I used it once a day for the first five days and twice a day thereafter.  The results were of course not overnight....it took about 15 days for my pimple to diminish. However it is far better than Proactiv which can damage and irritate skin. This product is gentle, yet effective. Overall I am satisfied with the results. The reason why it is not getting 5 stars is because it does nothing to erase acne scars. The redness and marks are still prominent even after a month of continued use. Olay needs to introduce a &#x27;magic eraser&#x27; to address this problem:-)</li>
            <li> This was actually my 2nd set of the Olay Clear Acne Protocol. After having my baby 5 months ago but skin started breaking out on my t-zone (chin, nose, forehead), and I have hyperpigmentation. It has cleared up my skin, however, hasn&#x27;t done anything as far as my hyperpigmentation but maybe it&#x27;s not made for that? I guess I&#x27;ll alternate this with other products to see what will help with hyperpigmentation. Overall a good product and quick results, I used it every night and noticed a difference less than a week!</li>
            <li> I had hopes for this product but it&#x27;s truly horrible for me, I have followed the instructions exactly and broke out more and my skin is burnt.  I have priced this product at my local CVS and it is 47 dollars. I bought it on Amazon for about 30, I was disappointed with the size of the bottles.  I have been using the Neutrotgena acne kit with better luck and it cost less than 20 and lasts so much longer. Quick easy, cleanser, day or night treatment.  The Olay cleanser doesn&#x27;t lather , The leave on 2 step treatments seem to have irritated my skin and I have broke out more.  The 2 step seems a little ridiculous, Why am I putting on 2 different creams on top of each other, why can&#x27;t they combine them?    I will be going back to Neutrogena Complete Acne Therapy System it is quick easy and doesn&#x27;t break me out or irritate my skin.  I am 41, Caucasian with sensitive skin, I have had acne my entire life but have been able to control it with Neutrogena products.[[ASIN:B000EPA4FW Neutrogena Complete Acne Therapy System]]</li>
            <li> I used this product three days in the row according to the instrucions.   The first day I did not see any difference.   The second day I had more breakouts than before I used it. Did not think anything off it.    The third day I had lots of breakouts and I stopped using it then.   I am very disappointed and would not recommend this product  to anyone.</li>
            <li> I oredered the product about a month ago for my acne and I still see no difference in my skin besides that it is softer.  I am holding out hope, but am not happy that it is not working how I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> For those of you who struggle with adult acne, this is totally not worth spending your hard earned money. I spent 4 weeks religiously going through each of the three steps with very little success.  (There were two days that I thought my face was clearing up but the acne return with a vengeance).  I am actually really disappointed since this is an Oil of Olay product.  Normally Oil of Olay is worth shelling out the extra dollars, but in this case it wasn&#x27;t.  I have had more success with just plain water and sensitive soap then I did with their acne regimen.</li>
            <li> At first I thought the cleanser in this set would be the only item I would often use, since I rarely get blemishes any longer.  Also, my skin is much dryer than in my younger years, and I suspected the lotion would best be suited for younger skin.  I was wrong there.  During the hot, humid summer, this lotion was the only lotion I could use on my face that didn&#x27;t prove to be too moisturizing.  It&#x27;s now winter and I&#x27;m still using it, with very good results.  The cleanser also is excellent, and you only need a tiny amount.  I use the cleanser once a day, and the lotion twice.  When a blemish has appeared, the acne cream worked exactly how it was suppose to, also.  I am truly surprised with this Olay set.  While I almost always have had great results with Olay facial products, I was sure these products were most suited for those in their teens and twenties.  Not true.  I only wish this acne set existed decades ago when I really needed it! :)</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product since it claims it is geared for adults with acne.  I&#x27;m 27 and have had acne since puberty but it seems to have gotten worse in the last couple of years.  This product made me break out even more than usual.  It was terrible.  I couldn&#x27;t finish the product.  After some trial and error I think I narrowed it down to the moisturizer as the culprit for the acne.  There must be something in it that irritates my skin or I&#x27;m allergic (although I&#x27;ve never been allergic to anything prior).  This may work for other people but not me.  Just thought I&#x27;d give others a heads up if considering and are have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> i ve really liked it and it gives perfect results and a beautiful skin just after one week of using olay pro/x clear acne protocol ,my skin is very delicate and finaly i ve found my eternal skin care thanks olay and with amazon i ve get the best price with fast delivery</li>
            <li> I love the Olay Pro Clear products!  I am 25 and have battled with acne for years, and this system successfully helped to clear my skin.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that Olay overprices the products when you buy the items separately.  I go through the cleanser much quicker than the lotion and skin clearing treatment, but it seems ridiculous to buy the cleanser alone for $25!  I eventually began to find more affordable cleanser alternatives, and I turned to an acne cleanser from Neutrogena.  It works just as well with the Olay skin clearing treatment and Renewing Lotion and is a fraction of the cost.  If Olay had more reasonable prices for the cleanser sold separately, I would stick to their products.  But I am satisfied with turning to another, more affordable alternative.</li>
            <li> I had been using ProActiv for years but never experienced the results that you see on the infomercials. In fact, by August of 2011 my skin was in the worst shape it has ever been. I was breaking out all over the place... even in places that I never typically did like my cheeks. So, I thought I would try Olay ProX acne and it works!  During the first few weeks, I did break out a little more but I really think it was bringing all of the jusnk that had been cloggin my pores up and out... so that wasn&#x27;t the best. But, from day 1, my skin felt better. it might not have looked better right away but it started feeling smoother and softer. After about 2 weeks, my skin had cleared up. I do still get the occasional breakout especially when I am PMSing but I have to say overall ProX Acne has transformed my skin.  My skin regime:  Rinse my face several times with warm water  Wash my face with just warm water and a wash cloth to get all of the makeup off  I use a separate facewash to make sure I get all of my makeup off- I use Olay 7 effects for acne. Its about $5 at Walmart for a large bottle and if you have a $2 off coupon you can get it under $3  Then I use the system: Wash, apply the acne cream, then apply the lotion. The lotion is really nice!  If you have oily skin and you are nervous about the lotion at the end. You might have a problem like I did for the first week or so with feeling a little extra slick throughout the day. But after your skin adjusts, it is awesome! It actually helps your skin become less greasy over time and feels so soft. For me, the third step tingles with a slight warming sensation... don&#x27;t really know what that is about.  Bottomline: I am acne free, have soft, glowing skin... and my pores while they are visible, they are a lot less noticable.</li>
            <li> This product is working great for me.  I didnt expect results right away.  I read the instructions and with continued use, over 2 weeks- this will happen, over 4 weeks- this will happen.  I just stepped back and let the product do its job and it hasnt failed me.  My skin looks great, helps keep those few breakouts at bay and its controlling oil in this heat.  The chin is my problem area and with special attention and time, it is clearing that up.  Thank you OLAY for creating an ADULT acne product while keeping aging and skin in mind!!</li>
            <li> I saw a noticeable difference with in 1 week of using this product-- its not perfect, and I still get the hormonal breakouts around that time of the month. But I am very, very happy with it. And the last step renewing lotion is amazing.</li>
            <li> I am a 30 year old woman who has been dealing with oily skin and breakouts since I was a teenager.  I was excited to try this product because Olay has an excellent reputation, and this is one acne program that seems to be geared more towards adults.    I have to preface this by saying I&#x27;ve only been using the treatment for just over a week, but here are my opinions so far:  First, there is very little direction given other than labeling the bottles step 1, 2, 3 and telling you to rub a small amount in.  It&#x27;s a little unclear if you should be doing this in the morning, at night, more than once, etc.  Second, it seemed a little backward to wash your face, put medication on trouble spots, and then turn around and slather lotion on top of that.  To me, lotion is something you want to stay away from after you just cleaned your face.  And, indeed, I turned out to be right.  The gel lotion (step 3) was something that I stopped using after the first two times.  It did nothing to \\&quot;even out\\&quot; my skin tone and seemed to make the oiliness worse, not better, so I went on using just steps 1 and 2 of the system.  Third, the product (particularly step 2) has an odor to it that I did not care for.  It&#x27;s salicylic acid so I guess that&#x27;s to be expected, but then they added a fragrance to perfume over the chemical.  The end result is something you may not enjoy, though I suppose it certainly could be worse (it sort of reminds me of the scent of hair dye).    Overall, the product really wasn&#x27;t all that effective for me.  I will say that while Proactive dried my skin out horribly to the point of peeling, I have not had that problem with this product.  However I do notice that my face is extremely shiny when I wake up the next morning after use.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, it just looks very shiny.  Then it takes twice the makeup to get rid of the shininess, which probably isn&#x27;t helping with breakouts.  All in all, it&#x27;s rather difficult for me to review this product as I&#x27;m sure everyone willhave slightly different results.  All I can say is, it wasn&#x27;t terrible.  It did help clear up my skin somewhat, but you probably shouldn&#x27;t go into it expecting drastic results.</li>
            <li> At age 40, I still battle a bit of acne.  I&#x27;m sure some of its existence could be attributed to external forces in my life and not just genetics, but it is what it is.  I had hoped that with the ingredients in this Olay set that I would see some good results.  Clearing of acne, nice moisturizing of my aging skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I do feel that the moisture level of my skin improved (especially with the Renewing Lotion), my main concern, the acne, did not improve whatsoever.  In fact, it got worse.  Not dramatically worse, but I did see an increase.  After a week of use I stopped applying the product, and several days later, my skin is now beginning to clear up.  I think I will be keeping the Renewing Lotion, but the rest of the set will be going in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also feel that this kit could use some kind of gentle exfoliant in the cleanser.  I never felt like Step 1 did an adequate job in cleaning my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the price and lack of effectiveness of this product, I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and seems to be keeping the worst of the acne at bay, but it&#x27;s pricy and doesn&#x27;t really seem to be doing any better of a job than what I was already using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23 years old, and in the last three years, my acne has been worse than is EVER was when I was a teenager. I&#x27;ve used tons of over-the-counter products to try to help, but they never worked. I was frustrated, to say the least, with my acne problem.   About two weeks ago I started using Olay Professional Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol after reading a review in one of my fashion magazines. At first it didn&#x27;t seem like it was helping my acne at all, though my face instantly started feeling smoother. After a few days I noticed the redness around my acne was getting less and less noticeable. And finally, about a week ago, I stopped breaking out. Right now I only have a couple of scars, that are fading more and more each day. I haven&#x27;t broken out at all in the last four days, I used to break-out a couple of times a day. I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed with how well this product works.  That being said, it isn&#x27;t great at removing make-up. Instead of using the face wash at night, I have started using Olay Definity Pore Refining Scrub, which is also an AMAZING product. The scrub in this product is much better at removing make-up and grime from my face than the Pro-X face wash. I still use the Pro-X moisturizer after using Definity at night.   I couldn&#x27;t be happier with Olay. This product has changed my face, and how I feel about my skin. My skin is smoother, softer, and better looking than it has EVER been, in my life!</li>
            <li> I am always on the lookout for products that will make my skin better--I&#x27;m approaching 40 and don&#x27;t have bad skin per se, but I do have some redness, oiliness in the T-zone, and occasional breakouts. Enter Olay Professional Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol--and after using it for a month straight, I give it a big MEH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a big fan of cream cleansers, but I used it with a [[ASIN:B002XURD32 Clarisonic]] buffer so it felt like it was working okay. I used the skin clearing bottle (#2) once a day (post shower) and did notice that by the end of the month my face was somewhat less oily in my problem areas...but the redness still remained. You also had to be careful about the amount you use since a little goes A LONG way! Since there were no detailed instructions included, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was supposed to use the renewing lotion (#3) right after the skin clearing treatment (#2) or not, so sometimes I did and sometimes I used it at night before bed. It was strange using the gel-like substance when you are used to cream, but it seemed to rub in fairly quickly and wasn&#x27;t greasy. The other issue is that 30 days in, I am out of face wash but still have PLENTY of #2 and #3 left--probably at least twice the amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I can&#x27;t say that I would recommend this, but everyone is different, so it may be worth a try.</li>
            <li> My wife was shocked at how well Olay worked for her.  She tried just about everything out there to get rid of minor, but consistent acne.  The best part about it was that it didn&#x27;t dry her skin out like others.  Her face felt natural after using it, not tight or dry.  The one thing she didn&#x27;t like is that there are three phases to the process and it gets very tedious.  But the results are worth it, especially if you have something special to get ready for.</li>
            <li> I liked these products and their use is intuitive and self explanatory.  There are 3 bottles and therefore 3 steps.  The cleanser does not create any nice soap, but it does make your skin feel clean and soft.  The lotion is quite similiar to the other oil of olay lotions and the treatment (step 2) seems to be an acne cream but I have noticed no difference in the level of acne I get. I do not have a lot of acne and this product does not seem to have changed my ocasional breakout.  And then there&#x27;s the lotion (step 3) which is exactly like the Oil of Olay popular serum.  This is nice, just like the other olay daily serum.  I don&#x27;t see or feel any difference from this higher priced product and the Oil of Olay lower priced products.  I see no improvement over the Oil of Olay product lines that existed previously.  This is supposed to be Pro-X.  The only thing that is better or bigger is the price.    I say this but keep in mind, I do love the Oil of Olay product line but think you can gain the benefits of Olay from their other products. I didn&#x27;t notice (after several weeks, so I have put the time in) any improvements over the lower priced Oil of Olay similiar products.  I do love Olay...I really do. I just can&#x27;t detect what makes this product line \\&quot;Professional Pro-X\\&quot;. One curious thing to note is there is no SPF protection from this product line and the other day lotion I use from Olay has SPF15.</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old and never had acne as a teenager. However, in my early twenties, I started battling acne in different forms. I have tried nearly everything, from Proactive to Neutrogena to Clinique. From drug store to high end, I have tried to find something that did not damage my skin and that would actually clear up break outs. For me, I have found my go to product!  I have been using the system for nearly 2 months now. My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear since I was a teenager! On the first day I used it, I noticed a nice smoothness to my skin. There was not dryness, burning or medicinal smell from the products. The cleanser is creamy in consistency and does not foam or lather. It seems to smooth away impurities. The step 2 is the most harsh. I do not have oily skin, so I only use the Step 2 once a day. It seems to prevent breakouts and manages redness in my skin, even though I only use it once daily. I LOVE the step 3 moisturizing product!  Many times, heavy creams are too heavy for my skin, causing more break outs. But, when I go without a moisturizer, I feel as though my skin is dry. This light gel is perfect. It leaves my skin looking dewy and glowing instead of weighed down my heavy lotions. I have used it under make-up or alone and it makes my skin look great.  For the first time in years, I do not have to use a liquid foundation for my makeup. This skin clearing system has been fantastic and has made me fee great!</li>
            <li> My adult daughter has suffered with acne issue since she became a teen.  She tried this product for two days and had to stop due to a flare-up.  To be fair, my daughter is a type-1 diabetic so it&#x27;s possible there was a reaction with other medications she takes; therefore this product gets a neutral review.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of the commercials that I seen on TV and I saw a lot of great reviews about this.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I am a HUGE fan of Olay produts!&lt;br /&gt;I do not have a lot of acne, but I thought this might help me because it isnt targeted for teens and it targeted to women.&lt;br /&gt;But using this product, all 3 steps daily- actually 2 times a day, in the morning and before bed.&lt;br /&gt;I did not see any difference at all and did not prevent pimples either- I still got a few pimples and using the product did not help heal them any faster than not treating or using another face wash.&lt;br /&gt;I did feel like it left my face feeling slightly greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I never felt that washing my face with the product that my face was truely clean (hope that makes sense)&lt;br /&gt;I had hoped for more and I was let down</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have tried everything under the sun for my skin. I am 24 and didn&#x27;t start having acne until about 21 or so. But since then, I have tried SO many products. Nothing seemed to work and the stuff from the dermatologist murdered my skin leaving it red and flaky. So I thought I would try this line, since it does not have a lot of salicylic acid in it, I thought maybe it wouldn&#x27;t dry my skin out too badly. I have to say I am not too impressed. I have been using it for about 6 weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference. It made it worse at first, but from my time with dermatologists, I have learned that is typical for most acne products when you first start using them. So I worked through that. I have not seen much of a difference honestly. I still get break-outs; they don&#x27;t seem to go away any quicker than they did before. The face wash doesn&#x27;t make my face totally clean (I guess because it is a cream). I bought the Olay Spinbrush thing (like the Clarisonic) and use that at night, so that seems to help with it feeling clean. I have noticed that my skin feels softer, but I don&#x27;t know if that is because of the line or the brush? I haven&#x27;t been using the moisturizer gel, because I felt like it made my skin feel greasy. So overall, I have not seen much change, and I don&#x27;t find it worth the money. I have now used up all of the facewash but still have PLENTY of both of the other products and refuse to pay again for the whole kit when all I need is the facewash. I figure I will change facewashes and keep using the treatment cream until it runs out. Not worth buying the whole kit again...  I know that different things work for different people, so I am not going to say don&#x27;t buy it. Maybe it will work for someone else, but it definitely has not helped my skin &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> I loved this and my skin has never looked better!  I will definitely be buyimg this again as soon as I run out!</li>
            <li> Great price, good product.Well worth the money! I am definately going to reorder my product monthly with the same buyer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 35 years old and have tried everything to clear my mild adult acne from proactiv, exposed, and prescription medications. All of these products worked in the beginning but stop working after a month or two. Because my skin is dry with acne everything I tried always made my skin red and irritated. Olay Pro  clear leaves my skin soft and clear. My skin looks refreshed and younger. I truly love this product.</li>
            <li> Really a great bundle! However, I am not a fan of the face wash so I use a different one that seems to lather up and take off my makeup better. I really, really wish you could buy the products separately because the other two are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I got this item a month or so ago and I was excited to start using it despite the mixed reviews. I have had problems with acne off and on for years. I&#x27;ve tried expensive products like Proactiv and Murad and I&#x27;ve seen a dermatologist on numerous occasions. When the protocol kit arrived I started using it immediately and was very happy with the results. My skin was softer and it cleared up pretty quickly. Best of all I didn&#x27;t think it had any nasty chemical smell like so many acne products do. About two weeks ago however I noticed some small breakouts but attributed it to my monthly cycle. A week later the breakout was still there and it was getting worse. In addition my skin had become very oily looking. I continued to use the product morning and night as per the instructions but my skin has not improved at all and I&#x27;ve decided to stop using it - in fact I threw the remainder of the bottles in the trash this morning. Bottom line - I wouldn&#x27;t buy this item again and I feel like I&#x27;ve wasted $30. Back to Neutrogena I go.</li>
            <li> What a horrible disappointment!!!! Olay usually has great products, so when this line came out I was very hopeful. Ran right out to get it and paid full price $50. (notice now it is now $30). After a couple of weeks, using it EXACTLY as directed, my face looked a million times worse. Instead of a couple of blemishes, I had over a dozen, that would not go away, in areas of my face that I never had acne!!!! I am 45 and in great physical shape, so it&#x27;s not diet related, more hormone related. I have tried everything perscription &amp; non-prescription.  It is really deceptive for a reputable company to release a line of product and get people&#x27;s hopes up. I have never returned anything in my life....  but this is going back to P&amp;G.... pronto. In the interm, and attempts to clear up my face, I found a cheap product, \\&quot;Acne Free\\&quot;, for $18. I have been using it for almost 2 weeks and my face doesn&#x27;t have a pimple in sight or any on their way!! I hope this is helpful to people like me, who don&#x27;t hesitate to spend alot of money on stuff.... IF IT WORKS!!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to hear that Olay came out with these products because Olay is the only brand I typically use. However, I have been using this system for a month now and have not seen any dramatic changes in my skin. I&#x27;m still getting break outs and I would not spend money to buy this again once I run out. The cleanser is really mild and non irritating but does not get rid of ANY blackheads. The lotion/acne treatment lotion are okay, I don&#x27;t feel that they perform much differently than cheaper products I have purchased in the past. Overall, I&#x27;m really disappointed because I expected more. It&#x27;s an okay product, but definitely not the best/a magic fixer/worth the price.</li>
            <li> I used Benzaclin for years, and it worked wonderfully, but in the last year or so, it became too harsh on my skin. So, I went searching for products that didn&#x27;t contain as much benzoyl peroxide and promised to be gentle on the skin. This had pretty great reviews, so I gave it a shot. I am very strict with my routine, but it did very little if anything at all. After about a month and a half, I gave up. My skin is worse now than it&#x27;s ever been and I feel like I&#x27;m out of options. Granted, I&#x27;m 20, so maybe I&#x27;m a little young to be in this product&#x27;s target audience. I was just a little hopeful.</li>
            <li> I am at a place where my skin has changed and am having a slight problem with discoloration and breakouts. This product was skimpy for the price and did not do what the ads say, for me at least. I may have misread what the product was supposed to do so bear with me here. The cleanser did not make my face feel clean at all and it caused more breakouts. The skin clearing treatment felt sticky on my skin and the complexion renewing lotion did not make it feel any cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;This product was just not right for me.</li>
            <li> The product seems to work well, however the cleanser runs out way before the other products.  I used the cleanser as instructed (not too much product)and it still only lasted about 3 weeks while I have tons of the other 2 left.  I don&#x27;t want to purchase another whole set until I have used up more of the other products.    They should let you buy each product separately or make the cleanser larger.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, hopeful that it would work or at least give my skin a nice clean.  the product feels as though it&#x27;s based in oil.  The wash was oily, the lotion was oily and I&#x27;m not sure what the 3rd step was good for.  After using the product for one week I started to get more and more pimples, I thought that maybe it was bringing out all the impurities and that they would eventually clear up but after my second week I knew I had to stop the product.  I don&#x27;t think that this is a product for most people with acne since sebum is one of the main culprits of acne.  Total Fail!!  Since using this product I started using Acnefree Severe Acne kit.  It did in 2 days what Olay could not do in 2 weeks.  My skin is about 80% clearer after using the product now for 2 weeks, the only issue is the dark marks from the acne that Olay caused my skin but the pimples are cleared up and my skin looks a whole lot better.  Looking for my receipt to return Olay for a full refund!</li>
            <li> First, a little about me: I am a female in my mid-twenties and have fairly oily skin which, in the past few months, has been acne-ridden.  I&#x27;m not sure what type of acne I have, but it&#x27;s worst on my cheeks and jawline.  For the most part it&#x27;s little bumps under the skin, but at any given time I have two or three big, painful red pimples.  The last time I had this much acne trouble was in middle school.  After seeing all of the great reviews and having used Olay facial moisturizers faithfully for a few years now with great results, I had really high hopes for this acne protocol, but for me it didn&#x27;t live up to them.  I wanted to avoid a trip to the dermatologist, so after trying other miscellaneous products which didn&#x27;t work, I chose this three-step kit.  I will say that it makes my skin feel very nice after I use it.  However, my acne has not slowed down at all, and that was what I was aiming for.  It has been about six weeks or so since I started using the kit and unfortunately I will not be purchasing it again. Olay has a money-back guarantee if you are unsatisfied, which is comforting.</li>
            <li> This product works!! I&#x27;m 25 and have been battling acne since middle school. I&#x27;ve tried several prescription acne products including Benzaclin with little success. After 2 weeks of using all three Olay Pro-X Acne products every day, my skin was the smoothest and clearest it has ever been. It provides the perfect amount of acne medication without leaving the skin dry. The moisturizing serum is my favorite. It&#x27;s non-greasy and serves as the perfect primer for mineral makeup. I wish I had taken before and after pictures to prove it, but this product definitely does work!</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews on this product and was so excited that Oil of Olay came out with an Acne treatment system.  However, when I opened the box, I found only three steps.  We all know that if we have struggled with Acne, usually a refining or active toner is a major step in the acne treating process.  This system does not have a toner.  The first few days, I used it as directed and my skin got WORSE!  I was devastated.  I contacted Oil of Olay and asked them why there wasn&#x27;t a toner.  They recommended I purchase another product (Oil of Olay Refreshing Toner).  I bought that and used it after the cleanser and yuck!  There was so much make up and grossness on the cotton pad, I was shocked.  This system doesn&#x27;t even get your skin clean!!!  Really?  I discontinued use, bought a gentle para-fan free cleansing bar and began using that after a woman at work recommended it.  I used that for about 3 days and I saw major improvements.  If you REALLY want to treat acne, at whatever cost, I would recommend the Obagi Cleanziderm system (very pricey but worth it), or a product line called Vivant sold at skin care clinics.  I used to use Vivant but can&#x27;t find it anywhere where I live anymore as the clinic I went to closed.  It is an amazing product though if you can find the BP wash, Toner and Vitamin A.  I miss it so much!  It was the only thing that ever made my skin look great!  Oil of Olay, I have to say, this isn&#x27;t your best system.  I guess, I would pay the more expensive price for the better products out there!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 y/o and I have moderate acne. I&#x27;ve had it for over 7 years now. I can honestly say I&#x27;m the one who tries everything looking for \\&quot;the one\\&quot;. But this is not it folks. I did not like how the cleanser really didn&#x27;t make my face feel clean. After using the cleanser it felt as if my face had a film over it. The treatment smells great but that&#x27;s about it. The moisterizer is ok but I do not notice a difference in apperance. It claims that the moisterizer will fade scars and so on but nope not mine. I did not use this for the recommended 4 weeks but I did not see an improvement AT ALL in over 2 weeks of \\&quot;trying it out\\&quot;. I&#x27;m gonna start back to my old regiman which is from Acne.org. I use the cleanser and treatment cream and I noticed a significant difference in 2 days. My skin looked significantly better in 2 days than it did with over 2 weeks use of Pro-X Acne from Olay. Oh and btw the Pro-X made tiny zits pop up all over my forehead, yea that was a nice surprise NOT! I say go to Acne.org first before trying this product. If you have mild acne this product may work great for you. But for those of us who have less than perfect skin need Acne.org&#x27;s regiman first. Good Luck!</li>
            <li> This product has worked great on both my daughter AND my son&#x27;s acne problems with slightly oily and yet sensitive skin...other products/protocols have been way too irritating and drying...THIS is the system that works for us!!!  It took about 6 weeks of constant use to see the final result for my daughter and as long as she keeps up with it, it works and keeps her clear...if she gets busy or lets it go for a day or two, she pays for it with some break-outs, but resumed use brings her skin back under control again!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months. It is the only thing that keeps my skin consistently clear. It takes a few weeks to see results though, so stick with it! The price was great online, saved me $10. The one negative thing was the shipping. I ordered on a Mon. morning and the product wasn&#x27;t taken to the PO until Fri., slow processing! It&#x27;s not the PO&#x27;s fault. Once they had it, I received the item very quickly.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: Have been using this for 3 weeks now and it is definitely working.  I&#x27;ve had some small bumps that lasted about a day but nothing that turned into the deep under the skin acne (that won&#x27;t go away and scar) that I&#x27;ve been battling for over a year.  In addition, my old scars have faded to the point that I&#x27;m no longer self conscious about leaving the house without foundation.  So far, I&#x27;m happy with the protocol.  As another poster mentioned, I also see a reduction in the looks of my pores and overall face smoothing- a nice surprise. I am concerned that I will run out of the face wash before the other pieces in the protocol.  If that happens, I&#x27;ll simply look for a comparable cream based cleanser with salicylic acid in the Olay line and use that as a supplement.       Started using this a week ago and can say that some stubborn acne scarring is flattening out and lightening.  I do consider this a huge success because I was already on a 3 step regimen from Clinique for the last year (salicylic cleanser, salicylic toner and benzoyle peroxide face moisturizer) and was continuing to break out a week after my cycle.  In addition, I was using the Clinique \\&quot;Even Better Dark Spot Corrector\\&quot; and it was not working fast enough to heal and lighten those acne scars.  I didn&#x27;t have acne as a teenager (now in my late 30s) so dealing with this has been a nightmare and I&#x27;ve been constantly looking for solutions.  Long story short, I started using this a week ago and have seen significant improvement over my Clinique regimen (though I still love Clinique!).  I am waiting for the dreaded post-cycle week to see if I break out or not - I&#x27;ll update this review if I experience a breakout but right now, I&#x27;m hopeful that this protocol has solved my acne problem.</li>
            <li> I have had adult chin acne for years.  Prescription topicals and antibiotics would help for a short time before I would have acne appear again. I have been using these products since their release and no acne!  I don&#x27;t use the second step much as it is not needed, but the first step I use day and night.  I also only use the third step in the morning, and use a fading cream at night.  I would love to just be able to buy step 1 alone.</li>
            <li> The only active ingredient in this \\&quot;acne protocol\\&quot; is salicylic acid. The Cleanser contains 1.8% and the Skin Clearing Treatment contains 1.5%. The Complexion Renewing Lotion does not contain any salicylic acid or any other active ingredient. If you can control your acne with just salicylic acid then this product should work for you. (Most salicylic acid acne products you can get at the store contain anywhere between 1 - 2%)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cleanser and Skin Clearing Treatment felt good on my skin (not too heavy or greasy), but when I first applied the Complexion Renewing Lotion to my skin I had the strange feeling I was applying my hair product to my face so I checked the ingredient list and sure enough, the lotion contains dimethicone (a silicone) which is the main ingredient in my hair serum. I did not like the feel of this lotion on my face.</li>
            <li> Being myself about three or four decades past needing to worry about the problem which this product treats, I allowed my daughter to give it a try, with the following results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a woman I tend not to wear makeup unless its for a special occasion, however -- in my early 30&#x27;s I am still prone to acne flare-ups, brought on by hormones, stress, and occasional bad food choices. Which is slightly embarrassing and rather obvious, since I am usually sans make-up. My usual facial routine includes cleanser, toner, and a moisturizer, and zit-cream when needed. I have had a problem are with acne around my nostrils since I was well a teenager, it never goes away it only lessens or expand in size depending so it&#x27;ll be interesting if the Olay Professional Acne treatement system can get rid of it entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1 - 1st phase.&lt;br /&gt;I usually clean my face in the shower, heat &amp; Steam open up the pores something nice.&lt;br /&gt;Small amount on my finger tip, spread over face, massage in circles over face and neck, this is the nice part.&lt;br /&gt;It has no noticeable smell: I like that&lt;br /&gt;My face feels nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd phase -&lt;br /&gt;Tiny amount on the fingertip, spread evenly over problem areas and breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd phase -&lt;br /&gt;Small amount applied evenly over face.&lt;br /&gt;No noticeable fragrance, which I like&lt;br /&gt;My face does feel smooth and not greasy to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2&lt;br /&gt;Minor acne flare up&lt;br /&gt;Repeat phase 1,2,3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result - a month later, the redness around my nostrils is not gone but greatly diminished. I still get pimples but they are small and tend to disappear after a day or two. The adage that a little goes along way does apply to this product, a small daub on the tip of your finger and it is enough to cover your entire face and neck area. I still have plenty left.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is greasy and leaves my skin with a residue on it.  After using it the first time I had to wash my face again because it still felt dirty.  Didn&#x27;t like the leave on cream or the lotion either.  Wish I would not have wasted my money.  If you don&#x27;t like \\&quot;cream\\&quot; type cleansers don&#x27;t buy this.  It is not a \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; type cleanser and does not foam either.</li>
            <li> I bought this after I could no longer find the Olay Definity line in the stores. As that product worked great, I decided to stay with Olay and purchase this Protocol.  My skin is naturally oily and the cleanser does not leave my skin feeling sweaky clean. The Skin Clearing Treatment  works very well as it clears up acne within a few days.   The Complexion Renewing Lotion is not greasy but after using the full protocol for weeks, my skin got worse. I had multiple breakouts and my skin actually looked different.  I now only use the Skin Clearing Treatment on my acne when required.  I really wish Olay would resume the Definity line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv the last several months because my skin starting acting up out of no where. I&#x27;m 37 and have sensitive, very oily, acne prone skin with most breakouts being hormonal. I like Olay moisturizers so I thought I would lay off the Proactiv and give this new product a try.   I&#x27;ve been using the Olay kit for 4 days now and have 3 times the blackheads I did before I started using the Olay kit. I do like that the cleanser doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight and dry but I can&#x27;t say my face feels clean. My skin is oilier after using the Olay kit than when using Proactiv.   The bottles are very small, I&#x27;m assuming the kit is meant to last one month...however I haven&#x27;t used it that long so I&#x27;m not 100% sure.   I won&#x27;t buy this one again...I paid $40 for the kit which just isn&#x27;t worth it to me when the Proactiv kit costs me $60 for a 2 month cycle. So I guess I&#x27;ll go back to Proactiv. It&#x27;s just a bummer to be out $40 for my skin to be worse than it was before.  ******************************************************************************  Ok, It&#x27;s been more than 2 weeks now since I started using this product. I am stopping as of today. My skin has gotten worse the longer I&#x27;ve used it. I have oilier skin, more blackheads and red pimples then ever.   I guess I&#x27;ll be throwing this product into the trash. What a waste of time and money.   I went to the Olay site to review their guarantee, which stated I must have the UPC from the box. Unfortuntely, I only have the receipt and product necessary for the return since I threw the box away the day I opened the package. So I guess I&#x27;m out the $40 I spent. I did contact Olay but have not heard back from them as of yet.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers I have tried a lot of products for annoying teen and then adult acne. It was never terrible but never went away no matter what products I tried. I gave the Olay a shot since price wise it was similar to Practive, and shipping was free. It did take a few weeks to notice a pleasant change, and my skin has continued to improve over time.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much for the sulphur spot treatment, but Burt&#x27;s Bees has a great spot treatment that I use on occasion before I use the Olay treatment cream. Also, for all of those that ran out of the cream cleanser before the rest of the kit- I felt like there was more cream in the little tube that I couldn&#x27;t get to, and I cut the top of the cleanser container and there was easily another two weeks worth of cleanser that I could have thrown away when I couldn&#x27;t get it to squeeze out!

            <li> i was very excited about olay coming out with the new pro X clear. i purchased about 5, i just kept telling myself that the results would come. they didnt &#x3D;[. looking at photos of myself. olay pro x was making my blemishes worse. I have since tried a new product called AMBI (u can find it at walmart. in a pretty borwn and beige bottle johnson&amp;johnson make it). i noticed a huge difference over night! i have oily skin in my T-Zone and mainly breakout on my cheeks i also have hormonal breakouts (when im menstruating), im in my early 20&#x27;s and have been suffering since i was 12 from acne. im not 100% clear like i would love to be (its been about 4 days since i started AMBI) but maybe like 85% clear now. considering my entire face was broken out when u started. my face has done a complete turn around. i hope this helped. reviews are mainly what i base my purchases on and i rely on them greatly. i wish u all beautiful complexions &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I tried this for 3-4 days and it burned my cheeks horribly. It did help clear up my excessively oily t-zone, but be careful if you have combination skin. I&#x27;m not sure what step in the 3-step system burned my cheeks so badly, so I discontinued use of all three and still felt burning and had red/peeling skin for a good 3-4 days after. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great if you have acne, but severe combo skin, beware! I&#x27;ve switched to a Philosphy line and have had much better results.</li>
            <li> Traditional salicylic acid acne cream from other manufacturers are probably ok, as well, for cheaper. I was too lazy to continue the treatment to step 3 to reduce the blemishes. But, the main part is step 2 with the salicylic acid. I saw results in a week to ten days. Once the acne stopped, I discontinued the product except for step 1.</li>
            <li> LOVE this kit from Olay!  I used to be a die-hard fan of the Olay Total Effects anti-blemish anti-aging lotion and when they discontinued it a couple years ago I started looking for a replacement.  Tried Proactive, clean &amp; clear, neutrogena, ddf, and Bliss&#x27;s new \\&quot;no zit Sherlock\\&quot;, etc.  Nothing worked until this product.  Now, I&#x27;m on my 3rd box of this since it became available and I&#x27;ll never use anything else!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The details:&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 Cleanser - its a cream cleanser so it&#x27;s not great for eye makeup removal, BUT I still love it.  In the evening I just use a forming cleanser first to get all the makeup off my eyes, then follow with this cleanser all over.  Using this cream cleanser after using a different foaming cleanser is an extra step that I used to skip in the evening sometimes, but I found that it really makes a difference when I use it - my skin is more moisturized and even-looking when I used the cleanser step from this kit.  Now I use it morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2 lotion - this is a light lotion that contains the same anti-acne ingredient as the Total Effects lotion I used to love, and it is the secret to my clear skin!!!  I rarely have blemishes now, and no one believes me when I say I have \\&quot;problem skin\\&quot;.  Lol, little do they know - without this stuff my skin would be a disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 3 lotion - this product is the one that pleasantly surprised me.  Somehow, this super moisturizing lotion MAKES MY SKIN LESS OILY/ SHINY!!!  Talk about an unexpected benefit!!  Not only des it leave my skin feeling deeply hydrated (vs. tight and dry-feeling which is how my combination skin typically feels after using all the other acne lotions), but I swear that my skin gets less oily and shiny looking when I use this product.  It&#x27;s like it somehow moisturizes and absorbs oil simultaneously.  Awesome and exactly what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is clear, even-textured, and even luminous after using this for about 9 months.  I&#x27;m a satisfied customer for life!  Love my olay!!!  Please try this kit - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!y this kit - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I bought it when it has $10 coupon something so altogether $15.XX for the whole box. I was suspicious about products with such low price ( my bad:( ), so I did not use them when I first received them. I tried proactive and some other acne products before which charged me a lot more but did not really work on my case, so you understand why. Then recently, I suddenly remember to use them. First start with the cleaner, I used it with my Clarisonic mia since I run out of the face cleaner coming with the machine, my face feels very clean and refreshed after cleaning. The other 2 boxes are not bad too, not sting, irritate or dry out my skin, but seems calm it down, and after 3,4 days, my acne start fading away. I have some at the edge of both cheeks which are really hard to get rid of. Hmm, interesting, guess I will observe a little bit longer. But so far I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I have been a long-time Olay user. I remember when the pink bottle was the only Olay there was! (and can still remember that smell!) After they came out with the types for more sensitive skin, I switched to that. And there was their make-up line (which I LOVED!!!) but they discontinued that. :( I use the regenerist stuff every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my daughter wanted to get a skin regimen for her teenage break-out prone skin, I knew that I would try Olay before shelling out big bucks for much more expensive items. She loves it! Does it block every pimple from forming? No. But her skin is clear about 90% of the time...compared to about 60% before. She doesn&#x27;t have very troublesome skin, so if that is you, I don&#x27;t want to just take a guess as to if this fixes it or not. One good thing though, is that it isn&#x27;t super expensive so you don&#x27;t have to make a major investment just to try it. Different people seem to have different experiences with almost every product, especially cosmetics. This may be perfect for you, or you may have to try again. We really like it in our family. my son wants it now. :)</li>
            <li> I just had to say I LOVE THIS! I am a 20-something and I have been struggling with pretty bad acne since I was about 12. It has been a nightmare and I have tried countless washes and nothing has worked or even helped any more than the other. This stuff works so well! I still break out from time to time and I have found if I add a mask once or twice a week (any kind really) it helps keep things clear. I still feel like I need to wear makes up but much less...and it doesn&#x27;t make my oily skin extra oily or anything. Now if only it would fade scars!</li>
            <li> Ok first off I rarely leave reviews unless its something amazing. Now, I&#x27;ve suffered with acne, pimples, blackheads since I started my monthly lady dues around age 12. I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun including but not limited to: natures cure, pro active, clean n clear, Clinique, Murad and so on. Everything dried out my skin so extremely that I had to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first product I&#x27;ve been able to use twice per day and not have any kind of dryness what so ever! I can truly say my face is 100% clear after just one month of use! Now, I can&#x27;t stress enough... You HAVE to use it religiously for one full month before you will see the results your looking for. The reason people on here say it doesn&#x27;t work is only because they didn&#x27;t use it long enough!! TRY IT FOR ONE MONTH! YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISSAPOINTED!!</li>
            <li> This product might perform miracles for some customers but it completely DESTROYED my skin! My chin and jaw area broke out horribly that it took three weeks before my skin stopped looking like a red and inflamed brail board.</li>
            <li> After turning away from over the counter acne products and instead going to a Dermatologist, I found my skin to be overly sensitive, and overly dry.  I made the decision to stop using the prescription products, but found my forehead and cheeks breaking out like never before.  At the age of 47 I was tired of being embarrassed about my skin, and made the decision to give the Olay regemine a try, since it (finally) seemed to be specifically for mature skin.    As is usual when starting new products, my face at first broke out in places it hadn&#x27;t previously.  However, after about a week, my old acne began to clear up, and the new acne began to subside as well.  I have been using the regime for three weeks and although my skin is not completely clear yet, it is not at all sensitive or dry, and I do see improvement.  For this reason I am going to continue to use the product line, and may even try the face mask I saw offered.    One caveat.  I have never been able to use Oil of Olay moisturizer without breaking out, and the moisture lotion offered as part of this protocol is no acception.  I would be nice if it did work as I would like to be able to use it, but have instead turned to one I have used previously from another manufacturer.    As an update, I have bought the product twice, and have come to realize that Olay really, really needs to sell the products separately.  I have now run out of the cleanser prior to running out of the other products, and am going to have to buy the three pack again, just to be the cleanser.  If there are other options, I hope the Olay rep who is lurking around will let us all know what it is.</li>
            <li> Adult acne is embarrassing and this combo is working most of the time.  I&#x27;ve been using for about 6 months.  It&#x27;s helped to get rid of the malia (small white hard deposits) that were getting infected.  I&#x27;m using it along with Olay Exfoliating Cleanser and the Pro X scrubber that help with better cleansing.  The price is so much better than drug stores or Walmart.</li>
            <li> Wow! This regimen is amazing! I am 41 yrs old and have been battling acne for the last few years and recently my breakouts have been getting worse (welcome menopause years!) and it was getting really embarassing to go to work with teenager-like acne. It has been traumatic to say the least because I had perfect skin as a teenager and my confidence never suffered. Recently, it was horrible! I could not hide the breakouts no matter what I did and felt very self conscious interacting with people. I recently decided to try out this 3 step process and I cannot say enough good things about it. I could tell an immediate difference in the skin softening. In about 2-3 days, I could see the blemishes getting fewer and smaller. All my old acne scarring and hyperpigmentation has reduced dramatically. My skin is glowing! It is a regular regimen, not something you do occasionally. I have been using it for the last 3 weeks without missing a day and have seen such a dramatic improvement that I cannot see myself stopping it. It is somewhat pricey but I figured it&#x27;s a small price to pay for making such a big difference. I figured I can skip eating out a couple of times to pay for this. I have used other Olay products (like Definity) and have not seen such dramatic or immediate improvement in such a short time. I am curious if the improvement will continue to stay long term. I will report back in a couple months on this.</li>
            <li> I am 28-years-old and get acne 1-2 times/month...usually around the time I&#x27;m PMSing. I will admit that in general, I&#x27;m not consistent about using facial products or washing my face in the evenings. Also, I tend to touch my face a lot which I know is a no-no. With that said, I have used this quite a few times to wash up in the evenings, but not consistently. For me, it&#x27;s just too many steps. I want something that I can wash my face and be done with. This is three steps, and as I read in someone else&#x27;s review, this also does not have any SPF in the product nor does it seem to have any different \\&quot;features\\&quot; from a teenager acne cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using it, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my acne or not. It did not dry my face out like it warned it might, so that was good. I tend to have fairly normal skin...some oiliness, but nothing major in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, and this might simply be me being picky and not having used many different facial cleansers in the past but, it seemed like there weren&#x27;t enough directions or information on the box for the product. With 3 separate bottles in one box, I felt like there should be an information paper on the inside with instructions or something...explain the product and what it&#x27;s supposed to do. But all you get is the fine print on the side of the box. Step 1: Pore Clarifying Cleanser - to manage acne.  Step 2: Skin Clearing Treatment - to treat acne, clear up acne blemishes, and keep skin clear of new acne. Step 3: Complexion Renewing Lotion - there isn&#x27;t even a use listed on the side of the box with the other information, but on the back where they try to sell you with words like \\&quot;clinically\\&quot; and \\&quot;professionally\\&quot; this step is supposed to \\&quot;fade the look of spots and redness for an overall renewed appearance\\&quot;. Like I said, I&#x27;m not sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue using this product until it is gone, but I don&#x27;t intend on buying any more of it. If I use it and notice any difference I will update this review.</li>
            <li> I had clear skin as a teenager, but now in my twenties I experience severe, painful acne breakouts on a regular basis. I feel I&#x27;ve tried everything (even Proactiv and prescription ointments/medications). Everything dried my skin to the point of peeling, which in turn lead to more severe breakouts. ELLE featured this regimen a month ago, and I had nothing to lose. Within the first days of use, my medically dried and painful skin was soft and healthy again. My breakouts subsided for a few days, and then a week later my face was as bad as it had ever been. Now, a month later, I&#x27;m suffering from acne worse than ever before.     Nothing about my skin cleaning methods have changed over the course of the month. To avoid touching my face (your fingers produce a lot of oil, and that clogs pores), I apply the second and third step with cotton pads. I use all steps twice a day. As the cleanser does a poor job of removing makeup, I&#x27;ve added a remover. I keep my makeup light, and would prefer to just use tinted moisturizer if I didn&#x27;t require pounds of cover-up just to feel comfortable walking outside. I eat well, get exercise, change my pillow cases on a nearly daily basis... still, given all this work, I see no more progress. I&#x27;m only going to continue to use this product for one more month, and only because of the other encouraging reviews. I plan on adding a handheld cleansing scrubber so that I stop touching my face entirely.    Despite my difficulty, I do give Pro-X Clear two stars for a few positive reasons. Compared to Proactiv, the cost is good. I found that, with Proactiv, my shipments came later and later than my requested once a month, but I was billed on time (occassionally, I was billed for shipments I never received). Eventually I began running out of product a week or two before I received more, and customer service couldn&#x27;t have cared less. With Olay, I have the ability to purchase more product at my leisure. I agree with other reviews that the proportions of each step seem off, in that I will probably run out of one step long before two others (I wish each could be sold seperately).     In all, I&#x27;m disappointed. If I see better results in another month, I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
            <li> I am 22, and I have just been dealing with having annoying breakouts due to stress and hormones. I used other product before, but I found out the hard way that I am too sensitive to benzoyl peroxide (I got chemical burns.) When I came across this product, I noticed that it was salicylic acid, which  in the research I made is softer on the skin and good for mild cases. I purchased this a week ago, and already am seeing amazing results!   I have noticed that in some areas I have broken out more, but on Olay&#x27;s website they said you might break out more because it is unclogging everything and bringing it all to the surface. The cool thing is that every morning everything is not as red looking, and I am noticing less and less pimples.   I am right now LOVING this product. My skin feel amazing! I have never used Olay products, but I think I will be going for this for now! It has been the only thing that has worked for me! I am feeling more confident in my skin, and I am just so excited to see what my face will look like in four weeks!  It can be hard finding acne products that work on everyone, but for me, this so far has been the best. It is a good match for my skin!   The only bummer I am seeing about this product is that you cannot buy them separately, so if anyone knows if they are planning on doing that, or is there is a website that sells them separately, let me know :</li>
            <li> I am 32 years old and started getting acne around 8 years ago. I like that this product is made by Olay because I trust their products and research. I have used the product for nearly a month and I feel like it has helped to clear and prevent most of my acne. I&#x27;ve had a couple blemishes but they didn&#x27;t last long. One thing I don&#x27;t like is that there is no toner. I always feel like I get a better clean and fresh skin feeling when I use a toner before moisturizing. The clearing lotion is much more cream-like than the moisturizer which is like a clear serum and not so loition-like. My hands feel a little sticky and gross after applying it, but it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I am a 34 year old redhead with sensitive, oily skin and moderate adult acne. I bought this system and even enrolled in auto delivery because I was that confident in Olay.  This stuff is AWFUL!! My skin cracked, flaked, peeled and itched. I toughed it out for a couple of weeks thinking it would all level out eventually, but it never did. In fact, the irritation got progressively worse.  This might be a good line for you if your skin is not the least bit sensitive, but it DESTROYED my skin. Instead, try Philosophy Completely Clear Skincare System. I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I have been using Oil of Olay products for years for my oily skin and acne and I really thought that this product would clear my skin once and for all but I was so wrong. First off, the face wash leaves your skin feeling oily and unclean. The \\&quot;skin clearing treatment\\&quot; made me break out in such a horrible way - it brought tears to my eyes and well the moisturizer isn&#x27;t bad - no complaints there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I held out for 5 weeks as I kept telling myself that it will work - lo and behold it only got worse. So I stopped using it this week and I went back to my old regimen - which includes Oil of Olay oil reducing face wash, toner and night cream along with Vicco Tumeric Cream (they work really well for me - should have stuck to it) and my skin has started clearing up - so I could breathe a sigh of relief when I look into the mirror now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure my skin will always be oily (I think it&#x27;s my genes) and I would be prone to breakouts now and again but it&#x27;s not as prominent as when I used this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will still be using Oil of Olay products but not this particular one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for years and just thought I would try something new.  Within a few days I saw improvements.  You have to be consistent though.  If I skip a day without applying the treatment I will have a breakout.  My only issue is I don&#x27;t know how to use this with winkle treatments.  I use the Olay deep wrinkle treatment on a few lines on my forehead but I&#x27;m not sure if I should apply the acne lotion before or after the wrinkle treatment.  Or does it matter?  Either way, great product, I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 5 weeks ago and it is beyond great! I always have hormonal breakouts and this is the only thing to keep it under control. I absolutely love the improvement in my skin. My skin even from the first use looked much more clear and the difference is amazing. I would highly reccommend you use this system.</li>
            <li> I have had acne issues for 15 years &amp; have tried everything, including acutane, to no avail. After using this for over 3 months, I recommend this product with some reservations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I dont care much for the cleanser. Instead, I use the Boots gentle foam cleanser for sensitive skin (from Target) which actually cleans my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I finish this regimen with Acne Free terminator spot treatment (also Target).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The moisturizer is great! But doesnt have SPF, so make sure you add SPF too!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a while for my skin to improve, but it has finally started to clear up. I still get the occasional cystic acne, but my skin has made a vast improvement!</li>
            <li> Having not needing an acne product myself for four decades, my exposure has been limited to say the least.  So when my future daughter-in-law asked me to obtain this for her, I told her that she would have to let me know how it worked.&lt;br /&gt;Seeing her two months after her first using Olay Professional Pro-X Clear, I could see the results myself.  Guess she won&#x27;t need anymore until my son gets her hormones raging again.</li>
            <li> What I really liked about this system was that it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin like some others.  Since I&#x27;m 28, my skin is starting to age a bit and I prefer products that are gentle.  The cleanser is really gentle and while I like it, I don&#x27;t love it.  Sometimes I feel like it doesn&#x27;t get my skin as clean as I like.  I find the 2nd step, the treatment, to be pretty useless.  I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin when I use it, so I just stopped using it all together.  I prefer toner as my second step.  The lotion however, is probably the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  It moisturizes my skin even in winter, without breaking me out.  I used to use Clinique Dramatically Different Gel for years but it started breaking me out and stopped providing enough moisture.  This stuff is great.  In fact, I just shelled out the $30 for the kit even though all I want is the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;After I finished the kit, I noticed that my skin did have a more even tone and looked quite youthful (I&#x27;m giving credit to the lotion).  However, it did make me break out on my neck, which is weird since I&#x27;ve never had breakouts in that area before.  I really wish they would sell the lotion by itself.  They do sell the spf moisturizer by itself but I can&#x27;t wear liquid spf because it breaks me out (I prefer mineral spf).&lt;br /&gt;Right now, I&#x27;m using the Biore combination cleanser, Neutrogena rapid clear toner (although it&#x27;s a little harsh), Olay regenerist fragrence free serum, and the moisturizer from this kit.  It seems to be working pretty well and I haven&#x27;t really broken out.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, product was as expected. I will be making another purchase for the same itme because it is listed at a great price!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an acne product that is not made for teenagers. I am 34 and I have tried lots of acne products but this is the best product I have found. It does not dry my skin out at all and it keeps my acne under control. Since I have been using it I no longer have trouble with breakouts and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I am a 40 year old woman who suffers from summer acne living in a lake community. I don&#x27;t wear much make-up and I don&#x27;t really use products like this one, but I have liked Olay products I have tried in the past, so I gave ths one a try and was not disappointed at all! In just two days I noticed a very significant difference in my face. I didn&#x27;t always use step three, as in the summer it felt too heavy. But when one day by chance I got a sunburn on my forehead, step three worked wonders to keep it from peeling without breaking me out again. So love this product :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now and can&#x27;t really make up my mind on it.  I haven&#x27;t had acne before, but it started off and on in the last couple years after I turned 40.  I thought this might be a good product to try, but after using it I have mixed feelings about it.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the breakdown for me:  I like the treatment and lotion - both of these products seemed to help clear my skin and I have seen improvement. However,  I didn&#x27;t like the cleanser - my face felt oily and not clean after cleansing.  So I went back to my usual cleanser (Neutrogena deep clean) and used that with the treatment and lotion, and that has led to improvment.  My face feels smoother and clean and the breakouts have lessened significantly.  So I am mixed - thumbs up for skin clearing treatment and complexion renewing lotion, but thumbs down on the cleanser.  That&#x27;s my experience anyway.</li>
            <li> I love this product! The results have been absolutely wonderful and with the added benefit of no &#x27;medicine&#x27; smell.  My teenage son &#x27;absconded&#x27; with the kit and the results have been amazing for him as well.  Most acne products he has tried either do not work or have caused him a lot of skin irritation.  Now that he has been using the Olay Professional Pro-X his skin is clear without leaving him with a rash or dry irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I am a 48 tear old women who still broke out like a teenager until I bought this kit a month ago. I started using once a day then increased to 3 x a day but found that to be to harsh, so went back to once a day. The first day I noticed improvment. As the time went on yes my skin worsened but, I still continued. Now after one month of using all 3 products every day my skin has never been so clear and smooth. I have oily sensitive skin and an allergy to Parabens, about a year ago olay dicontinued their acne wrinkle moisterizer I wrote to them begging to bring it back since it contained no parabens and worked well. They did me one better, they gave me a whole regimen that really works.I do wish they would sell all the products sepratly and would make it available in stores. OH AND PLEASE DON&#x27;T DICONTINUE IT OR NEW AND IMPROVE IT ITS GREAT JUST HOW IT IS!</li>
            <li> ...I do get these bumps on my face. Not sure what they are (maybe whiteheads???). I just know they appear and don&#x27;t go away. Nothing has worked on them. I figured I could try this. I really like Olay products. Watched my grandmother use them all her life and she always looked younger than she was.&lt;br /&gt;On day 1 I didn&#x27;t notice anything, day 2 my bumps started turning red, day 3 I had an acne break out. What?!?! I thought this would prevent it! I kept using it and by day 6 my face was clear. Even of the regular bumps. Alas on day 10 the regular bumps where back. I used this for 3 weeks and decided to give up on it. Didn&#x27;t really help my \\&quot;bump\\&quot; problem. Would it work for a full blown acne problem? Possibly but can&#x27;t say for sure. The one break out I had that this product seemed to help cause cleared up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I saw a commercial for this product a couple of weeks ago and was drawn to it when they mentioned hormonal acne. I have never battled acne issues until the past year. I was switched from one bc pill to another, and as a result suffered from severe cystic acne. I finally found a bc pill that is best suited for me, but still have battled with the monthly breakouts. I decided to try this product, and after having been using it for about 2 weeks now, I am loving this product. My skin feels so amazingly clean when I use the cleanser. My face has been clear since using this product. As mentioned before, my bc pills have switched, so I&#x27;m not sure if this has to do with my face clearing up as well, but I do feel that my skin feels much more resilient and clean. I was apprehensive in purchasing it as it was kind of spendy, but it has been well worth it. Also, an added bonus is that Olay is offering a $15 rebate on this product right now. :)</li>
            <li> After using Pro-Active for 3 years and finding it less effective in the past few months I was fed up. I saw the commercial for the product and thought I should take a chance with something that might be better for my 25 year old skin. The first week I had breakouts from Pro-Active and this stuff cleared it up without causing more blemishes. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and I love it! No break-outs and my skin (a combination of oily and dry depending on the season) is finally balanced. I&#x27;ve also noticed my complexion becoming smoother and my red acne scars are fading away.</li>
            <li> Service, product and price. Very good! I like the fact that this product doesn&#x27;t dry the skin like Proactive does.</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and have been battling adult acne since I was 20. I&#x27;ve been using Pro-X for three weeks now and my acne and skin texture has improved tremendously. For the first two-weeks I had a pretty significant breakout and I wanted to stop using it but I read a review that suggested trying a toner after the cleanser. I added Neutrogena&#x27;s Pore Refining Toner to my regimen and at the end of week three my skin is almost completely clear and my normally huge pores are almost nonexistent. I learned you&#x27;ve got to follow the instructions, I use it twice a day and its fine on my sensitive skin. You only need a pea size of each product, doing so I think they&#x27;ll run out at about the same time. I wanted to give the product adequate time to work before I hastily demanded my money back as Olay gives a money back guarantee.  I&#x27;m pleased to have found an over the counter product that finally works without drying my skin out and harming my skin texture.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and I am in late twenties and I still get acne. I used proactive before but it used to dry out my skin. This prduct is excellent and I got very good results. It doesnt dry out the skin and prevents blemishes.</li>
            <li> This product is okay. It helps my acne to disappear faster but certainly doesn&#x27;t prevent it from forming.  I would suggest a product from your dermatologist and if you have insurance you may pay a lot less for the prescription.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.  I&#x27;ve tried ProActiv, Clearasil and several other acne fighting regimes. None of them have worked for me.  During the first week, I noticed that I was getting an increase in blackheads and other breakouts.  Typically these products clean out the pores so breakouts get worse before they get better.  However, these breakouts never went away.  It&#x27;s been three months and my skin actually looks worse than it did before I started using this product.  While it appears others have had better luck than me, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend spending the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my adult acne after having used Proactiv for years along with Olay Regererist when my skin became dry.  My skin was clear when I began using this due to the Proactiv, but I thought by getting the Olay Acne Protocol I could eliminate the Proactiv and just use the Olay.  WRONG!  THIS STUFF MADE MY FACE BREAK OUT WORSE THAN IT HAS IN YEARS!  I had been using it for about a week when I began getting these huge cysts on my face.  I could not believe it.  I was mortified! They say to give it a month to work.  No way I was going to continue using it if it did this much damage in one week! I immediately went back to using the Proactiv and even with that it took me about 3 weeks to get rid of the damage done by the Olay.  I cannot believe that they tested this on people, because there is no way this works.  What were they thinking?  I mean this was a total waste of money and time and the worst part was having to walk around with these huge sebaceous cysts on my face. Save your money! I never had any problem with the Olay Regenerist or Total Effects, but for acne, buy Proactiv.</li>
            <li> I am a thirty something with mild-moderate hormonal acne. It&#x27;s become more moderate in the past several months since I&#x27;ve stopped birth control. I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for years and it&#x27;s worked well but not perfectly. So I bought into Olay&#x27;s commercial about being specially formulated for \\&quot;adult acne\\&quot; and thought this product would be great. Boy, was I wrong. My skin was oily from the start. I&#x27;ve always had combination skin, but this was the oiliest feeling ever. I started having to blot every 10 minutes and started washing 3 times a day to get rid of the excess oil. Gross. And I broke out WORSE than ever before. On proactive, I had maybe one blemish here and there, but with the Olay my cheeks and chin were covered! It was horrible. I stopped using immediately and went to Acne.org&#x27;s regimen which cleared everything up in a matter of days. I&#x27;ll still with the regimen from now on. What a waste of $40!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mild acne my entire life--essentially uneven skin tone, combination skin with, blackheads on my nose, a few whiteheads and the occasional single big gem on my cheek or forehead.  Now at 20 years old, my acne has subsided for the most part (except the annual menstrual break out) and dark spots remain.  This product has done a wonderful job of evening out my skin tone, texture, clarity and has significantly lightened and evened the left over marks.  I still have the occasional pimple, but this has worked better for me than Murad, Proactiv, Clean &amp; Clear etc.</li>
            <li> This product caused me to develop daily blackheads and surface white heads from regular use. The blackheads are everywhere. I&#x27;ve never had this problem before. I bought this product for maintenance purposes, as I generally have pretty clear skin</li>
            <li> I tried this product in an effort to alleviate my adult acne.  Proactiv has stopped working for me as well as other over the counter cleansers/medications.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 10 weeks now and I have to stay that it has worked to a degree but not in the way I had hoped.  The dark spots are still there and I continue to break out although not as severely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, the seller was awesome and the product shipped early!</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I tried this Olay product. I read that Olay developed this for adult acne. This is my third order. My skin has cleared significantly. This along with my Clairsonic Mia makes a huge difference in the texture and clarity of  my skin, Couldn&#x27;t be happier. I cant find this Olay product in stores and hope it is not going to be discontinued!</li>
            <li> Bought this last October to try Olay&#x27;s adult acne product and have used it in varying routines since. No matter how often or seldom I used it, it burned and irritated my skin, and gave it a dull, shallow appearance. I finally developed a bad rash on my nose and quit using it altogether. Switched back to Proactive, and in 2 days, my skin is recovering and the rash is gone. From what I can tell, Olay&#x27;s acne treatment is only salicylic acid, no benzoyl peroxide at all. The moisturizer has some kind of talc-like substance suspended in it that makes your skin look dry and pasty. Would not recommend it to anyone who has acne and/or dry skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this kit but wish they sold the lotions separately. Skin history: oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin (usually bumpy pimples), slight blotchiness. I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars on other products and decided to invest in the Olay brand a couple of months ago and am glad I did. I had been keeping my pimples at bay by having regular extractions done at a dermatology center, but could not sustain this because it&#x27;s quite expensive (over $100 per session). The first time I used this, I had very large, almost cystic-like pimples on my cheeks and forehead that hurt  upon touching them. After the first application, I could feel the swelling go down and knew that it was gentle on my skin but strong against the acne. I held off on the third step for awhile because I was afraid it would somehow counter the effects of the other two lotions (for some odd reason), so I can&#x27;t say I followed the regimen to a \\&quot;T\\&quot; but it really worked! I would agree with the others when they say give this kit some time to work, because even though I felt it was working on the first application, it took at least two weeks to have noticeably clearer skin. I do continue to use my trusted Murad gel cleanser (which also has salycic acid)in combination with this kit because like others, i feel that if I don&#x27;t use the Olay cleanser on a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; face (usually with my Clarisonic), it doesn&#x27;t remove makeup or other build-up. I noticed that most of the 4 and 5 star reviews for this product are from slightly older women, but I&#x27;m 25 and it has worked marvelously for my skin as well. And until someone commented on the evenness of their skin tone/texture, did I realize that my skin does look less blotchy and more uniform in color.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I love Olay. I am 17 years old and I&#x27;ve used Olay (well the spf moisturizer as well as 2 different daily facial washes) since I was 14. When I was 12-14 I had bad breakouts, but now I only have the occasional breakouts. When I started using this product 5 weeks ago, I was in love. My oily face&#x27;s overall appearance cleared up drastically! My big pores (from picking my acne) were shrinking. but alas the good effects are now dwindling to an end! I started noticing that my pores has had a drastic increase of \\&quot;white tiny threadlike fat\\&quot; coming out EVERYWHERE  when i rub my face. After doing research online, turns out it is \\&quot;plugs of sebum and other form of cellular debris that just COAGULATED in MY pores.\\&quot; I read somewhere that it is because I have started using \\&quot;some comedogenic substance.\\&quot; This is the only product I use on my face. It seems that the magical effect it once had is diminishing. I break out when I menstruate, my pores are now filled yucky fatty stuff, and my face is still oily. I&#x27;m starting college in 2 weeks and I can&#x27;t keep buying this product with my college budget. I just ordered Dudu Osun black soap (I have heard wonderful things) and Olay spf 15 moisturizer (I&#x27;m giving you one more chance Olay). I hope this will get the job done and become my staple products.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I thought Olay would be reliable and a good brand to try. Before using this product my skin wasn&#x27;t perfect in the least bit but it just had a few minor breakouts every now and then. When I started using this product I started breaking out terribly! I tried to keep going with it (a week was long enough for me) and then I just had to stop. It&#x27;s been over a month since I used it and my skin is horrible now! It hasn&#x27;t been this bad since I was a teenager and I&#x27;m 23. I&#x27;m super upset about this. Now I need to see a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I am in my early twenties and I have suffered from a variety of skin conditions since I was a teenager. I have sensitive, fair, dry, clog-prone, acne-prone skin with a tendency for it to get blotchy and red. Basically, my skin is a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried almost every system geared towards combating acne, but they have always made my skin unbearably dry and I never saw as much improvement as I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered Olay Professional Pro-X Clear three months ago, and I have been using it twice a day since. It has been nothing short of a miracle! I had an initial purging that lasted about two or three weeks, but it was so worth it! My face is smooth and even-toned. Zero bumps and flakes and my acne marks and scars have faded almost entirely! I still have minor breakouts when I get overly stressed etc. but the big ones usually go away in 48 hours and the smaller ones vanish overnight! My skin actually looks healthy now and isn&#x27;t constantly in the back of my mind anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello, confidence!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the products themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANSER: This is the most sensitive and calming cleanser I have used, and I have used Cetaphil, FAB etc. My skin is never dry or tight after using the cleanser and actually feels a bit moisturized. The cleanser itself feel kind of greasy, but it comes off without leaving a residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TREATMENT: I am one of those people that think you need to FEEL it working on your skin to be reassured that it is actually performing its function. This treatment doesn&#x27;t do that at all. Treatments I have used in the past like benzoyl peroxide have always done more harm to my skin than good, so this salicylic acid acid has been a nice change.  It is very mild and just feels like putting on a light moisturizer. The treatment doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, and I actually feel it moisturizes more than the moisturizer itself and it REALLY does its job without causing irritation. The \\&quot;feeling it work\\&quot; thing has gone entirely out the window!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MOISTURIZER: This gel moisturizer is not greasy at all, but it can actually leave my face a shiny after wearing it for a few hours. It has helped tremendously with evening out my skin tone and keeping the redness at bay. It also feels like the moisturizer helps the treatment absorb into the skin more effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me about two and a half months to get through my first package ( a little goes a long way with each part of the system), so I definitely feel it is worth the price given the results I have had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product saved my skin and gave me an overwhelming amount of confidence. It really changed my life!</li>
            <li> The reason I had to give this a three star was because it made me break out. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all and so it was shocking to see that this made me break out. I noticed so far that this, garnier and Roc products don&#x27;t work well for my skin.</li>
            <li> As a teenager I had beautiful skin-it wasn&#x27;t until my early 20s/1st pregancy that it went wild. Mostly I had itchy acne around my jawline that nothing seemed to help. I went to the dermotologist &amp; tried every product on the shelves all to no avail. I figured why not try one more thing! I love this product! My face is clearer than it has been in 15 years! Would highly recommend. However I do not like that it can only be purchased as a kit. I use up the cleanser more quickly than I use the lotions so I end up having to buy a whole new kit. Now I have too much lotion to justify spending the money to buy a whole new kit. The company needs to listen to the reviews &amp; split the products up or increase the size of the cleanser.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written; I love this product!! I&#x27;m an African American female, 23. I have extremely oily skin and large, porous, acne-prone skin. The Olay Professional Pro-X Clear has worked WONDERS for my skin. I saw clearer skin literally over night! I wish I had taken before pictures, but I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting this product to work so well. I had an appointment to meet with a dermatologist before I purchased this product, after the first night, no need for that appointment! This stuff has well exceeded my expectations. I&#x27;ve tried so many different products to clear my skin, even my skin tone, and prevent breakouts and NOTHING has worked like this stuff works. This product even works for \\&quot;That-time-of-the-month\\&quot; breakouts. No product has EVER been able to help me when Mother Nature is doing her thing. I use this 3 step system in conjunction with an exfoliating glove and my Clairisonic (two other products that I love). I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve stumbled across this product. My grandmother, who hasn&#x27;t seen me in 2 months, had to know what I was using on my skin when she saw me. This product produces NOTICABLE results! I&#x27;m in love! I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who has acne-prone skin or anyone who even gets the occasional breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- It really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-You have different amounts of each product, so you will run out of one (or more) steps before you run out of the others and you&#x27;ll end up having to buy a new kit, as the don&#x27;t sell the steps separately.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a year and while I was skeptical at first I was amazed at the results.  I have adult acne and thanks to this product I was able to avoid most break outs.  Every morning I applied the \\&quot;clearing treatment\\&quot; and \\&quot;renewing lotion\\&quot; followed by Olay Moisturizer under my makeup and I used the Pro-X cleanser that came with it every at night to remove my make up.  To cleanse in the morning, I found it was faster to use the [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz]] in the shower.  Since a friend sells Mary Kay, I agreed to try the far more expensive Mary Kay products instead of the Pro-X Clear Acne product and while they worked were ten times more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine my disappointment when I came back to order the Pro-X clear from Amazon to find that the price had sky rocketed and only sold by sellers so I contacted Olay (via their website) who confirmed the product had been discontinued.  I&#x27;m going to now try [[ASIN:B001LF4BEY Olay Age Defying, Anti-Wrinkle Day Lotion with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum , SPF 15, 3.4 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] as it has the Salicylic Acid that I think was the cure for my adult acne all in one product (so I won&#x27;t need to apply the three products I was applying previously).  Hopefully, it works as well--I wish Olay still carried the Pro-X Acne products, I for one was extremely happy with them!</li>
            <li> I have had this about 2 weeks now. I use the acne face wash at night, followed by the acne treatment, but no longer use the accompanying lotion. The lotion seemed to make my skin extremely oily/greasy, &amp; contributed to more breakouts. So, now just use step 1 and 2. I also use step 2 in the morning by itself, after washing my face with regular Olay face wash. Olay actually sells an acne face wash by itself(that I was using prior to purchasing this), with a higher concentration of salicylic acid content than what comes in this package, with very small exfoliater beads in it. I wish Olay would sell the acne treatment by itself, as I will run out of that first, &amp; still have almost full step 1 and step 3, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seller was VERY prompt in their shipping, and I would definitely order from them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I&#x27;ve now had the product for almost 2 months. Shortly after my initial review, I had to stop using the product altogether. It seems the acne treatment(step 2) was making my acne worse unfortunately. I am back to using the Olay acne face face(sold by itself), Olay regenerist lotion, definity eye treatment, &amp; I use the step 3 to help fade some acne scars on my back. I went back to using my old acne medication w/benzyl peroxide for the actual acne treatment part.</li>
            <li> The product overall works well for my face. I have noticed a significant reduction in breakouts (almost none), and if I did get one or two blemishes, it would go away within a day or two, unlike before where it could even take up to a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also noticed that it has faded my old blemish scars, which has been difficult to deal with since the other products I&#x27;ve used tend to cause break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third step lotion they provided doesn&#x27;t really moisturize, especially when you have dry skin. After a while of using the trio, I started getting some more breakouts, then realized that it&#x27;s because my skin was becoming too dry and that dryness was causing the breakouts.  I don&#x27;t use the 3rd step lotion anymore, but have reverted back to my old face lotion - Elizabeth Arden Visible Difference. This combination seems to work the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would sell the face wash separately. I always run out of the face wash first and have tons left of the other two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a lot of acne regimens and this seems to have worked the best so far, and doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin at any time.</li>
            <li> Pro-X Acne Protocol is Olay&#x27;s leap into the world of acne treatment kits.  Acne treatment kits were first made successful by Proactive, and now it seems like everyone is selling these kits with 3-4 steps that promise \\&quot;clear beautiful skin.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt; Olay&#x27;s kit comes with three steps:&lt;br /&gt;1) Pore Clarifying Cleanser (2.5 Oz)&lt;br /&gt;2) Skin Clearing Treatment (1.7 Oz)&lt;br /&gt;3) Complexion Renewing Lotion (1.7 Oz)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step one: The Clarifying Cleanser. This is a cream face wash that is none foaming. Like all cleansers you wet your face, massage on the cleanser and rinse it off.  This step, according to the bottle, is supposed to \\&quot;reduce oil and penetrates pores to help prevent new acne from forming.\\&quot; The cleanser is happily free of the rough little beads other brands have in their cleanser step. Also, a little bit goes a long way. There is no need to glob this on, or you might run out of this step before the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step two: The Clearing Treatment. This is a leave on cream, according to the bottle, it is supposed to \\&quot;help bring acne under control and prevent future break outs.\\&quot;  The cream does have a slight scent; I didn&#x27;t find it to be a perfume smell, more of a soap scent.  I have even tried this as a spot treatment, and it definitely works for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step three: The Renewing Lotion. This is a gel lotion. It is, according to the bottle, supposed to \\&quot;sheer hydration helps fade the look of spots and redness for an overall renewed appearance.\\&quot;  I have to admit I was surprised when I discovered the lotion was gel, and I had my doubts. But it was very refreshing and didn&#x27;t burn or dry out my face. The gel also has a slight smell; again it&#x27;s not a perfume smell, more of a slight gel-like odor.  It did visibly helped fade some small, old acne scars I had on my chin, so this step also works really well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from stress related break outs; because of that I have had more issues with acne in my 20&#x27;s than I ever did as a teen.&lt;br /&gt;I started using Proactive 3 or 4 years ago; and it did clear up my skin. However, it was too harsh for my skin for daily use. So I tried to use it every 3 days, but after a couple weeks I would forget to use it and the break outs would start up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have successfully used Olay&#x27;s cleansers and moisturizers since I was a teen, so I was really excited when I found out they are now making an acne kit. I was a little surprised by the price, over $30 when it first came out (it has since come down), but I thought it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to use the products 1-3 times daily, but I only use it once in the morning, because I&#x27;m afraid of drying out my skin. I also follow it in the evenings with Olay&#x27;s moisturizer, just to make sure I stay moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I did see results within 3 weeks, and as long as I use it regularly it does seem to keep the break outs at bay. And so far I haven&#x27;t experienced any redness or drying out on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I get about 3 months use out of each kit, so for me it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love using this its so amazing for my face. I would reccomend anyone to use it if they&#x27;re seeking for a solution.</li>
            <li> I have tried other acne products for mature skin, including Proactive, but most made my skin red or burned it. I used this product for about six weeks, until most of it was gone. Unfortunately it did nothing to clear up my acne or reduce spots and redness as advertised. I actually had more breakouts than normal, which was very frustrating. I did not have any obvious redness or burning reactions to the product but it just did nothing positive for me. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product is great!!  Iam 36 years old and never had acne as a teen but for some reason i get it now along with cystic acne on my chin. I have tried many many products including proactiv that did nothing for me.  This cleared up my skin and the cystic acne so happy.  My problem is that i ran out and tried to buy more, i looked at local drugstores and the olay website.  Sad to say i couldnt find it.  I contacted olay and found that this product has been discontinued :(  I did search amazon and found a seller that had a couple so i snagged two boxes so i have it. After these are gone idk what im going to use..</li>
