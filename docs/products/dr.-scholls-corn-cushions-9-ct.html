            <li>So glad to find Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Corn Cushions.  </li>
            <li>ordering more today.</li>
            <li>These are a top brand for a reason - they work, they stay on and they are comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s easy to rub off afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Additionaly, the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s isn&#x27;t that easy to find.</li>
            <li>is effortless and easy.  </li>
            <li>would strongly recommend them</li>
            <li>These are the best corn cushions hands down.</li>
            <li>They also shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Saved my Mom a ton of money-fantastic bargain, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Great product, they really stay on toes long</li>
            <li>These cushions are far better than any I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>GREAT product and hard to find now in drugstores</li>
            <li>I wanted to try these but the first thing I see on the package is &amp;#34;latex&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>But these larger cushions are much better.</li>
            <li>They do exactly what they say they will do and have made it possible for me to wear some hither-to-for once comfortable shoes again!</li>
            <li>I was spending so much more money in the stores for one pack and these are the same but so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>They really work as well</li>
            <li>and they seem to stick very well</li>
            <li>#34;latex free&amp;#34; until getting ready to use.</li>
            <li>It really helped with my corn problem.</li>
            <li>THANKS.</li>
            <li>Much easier to buy in bulk and not have to think  about it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t put on a shoe, and once this little sticker goes on, magic, pain gone.</li>
            <li>recommend putting them on first thing in the morning, pressing them hard onto the skin and they&#x27;ll last two days -- even through a shower -- and your toes will be thrilled with the padding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Price is less than you&#x27;d pay in a store if it was available.</li>

            <li> Just like the other reviewer said...  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Best value ever! I wear it everyday. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> These cushions are far better than any I have ever used.  Better adhesive, more cushion, better all the way around.</li>
            <li> Great product...adhesive so much better than off-brands. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I never realized how much comfort these small things can bring to your feet. I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> These are the best corn cushions hands down. They stick for days, so I use them at least two days, get my money&#x27;s worth. They will stick longer than that but by then I throw them out... They really work as well, I have bad corns so painful I can&#x27;t put on a shoe, and once this little sticker goes on, magic, pain gone. They don&#x27;t even catch on pantyhose. Really an amazing product, can&#x27;t manage without it. Six pack lasts me a few months.</li>
            <li> Have ben using these for years and they seem to stick very well I can usually get 2-3 days out of them. A good price also buying in this quantity.</li>
            <li> GREAT product and hard to find now in drugstores so glad to have found them</li>
            <li> I used one other brand and was not happy with the quality of the adhesive.  These cushions stay on all day and I have not had any issue with them.  They also shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Saved my Mom a ton of money-fantastic bargain, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Just like the other reviewer said...  I gave up on store brand corn cushions a while ago because they don&#x27;t stay on.  And the stores don&#x27;t carry Dr. Scholls Corn Cushions anymore, so this is the place to buy them.  Price is less than you&#x27;d pay in a store if it was available.</li>
            <li> Sticks all day long! And can take it off for shower and put it back on and still stick!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try these but the first thing I see on the package is &amp;#34;latex&amp;#34;.  I know I searched &amp;#34;latex free&amp;#34; and did not see that these were NOT &amp;#34;latex free&amp;#34; until getting ready to use.</li>
            <li> It really helped with my corn problem. Stays on all day long.  Might leave a little bit of sticky residue when you take it off but that&#x27;s easy to rub off afterwards.  Great product!</li>
            <li> They are corn cushions that work.  They offer relief from pain and yes, they stay put for the entire day.</li>
            <li> great product! seems very hard to find Dr Scholls where I live and the other generic brands do not stick!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> This works well for me.  I wear a compression glove and it makes the space between my thumb and finger raw.  Placing one of this in that spot solves my problem.</li>
            <li> THESE WORK GREAT IF YOU NEED HELP. THANKS.</li>
            <li> These cushions stick so much better than the store brands which fell off even before I could get my stockings on. Additionaly, the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s isn&#x27;t that easy to find. Much easier to buy in bulk and not have to think  about it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected. Time delivery.</li>
            <li> when you use this Brand is the same that it´s Works , forget the pain in yours foot, i like</li>
            <li> I bought these to help with the hammer toes that hurt when I walk the golf course. They feel a little odd but they stay on and help&lt;br /&gt;to limit the pain.</li>
            <li> These are a top brand for a reason - they work, they stay on and they are comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> It sticks great through my 12+ hour shifts that I am on my feet. Sometimes it sticks too well and is a little painful to take off.</li>
            <li> wish the adhesive were a little stronger</li>
            <li> What can I say?  I have my grandfather&#x27;s feet and they are terrible.  This makes the pain bearable.  BUying by the bundle on Amazon is cheaper than getting from a store.</li>
            <li> These cushions are so great, the remain in place ,even when bathing.  Offers healing solution instantly.&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend them</li>
            <li> I was spending so much more money in the stores for one pack and these are the same but so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these anymore in any of the stores so I was so glad when I found them at Amazon.  The delivery was fast and the price was great.  So glad to find Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Corn Cushions.  The brands that they are selling in my local stores are not nearly as good.</li>
            <li> These are great corn cushions - always have them on hand!</li>
            <li> Item as described, Rapid delivery. Have used these for over 20 years. Will purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these Dr. Scholls corn cushions are disappearing from grocery and pharmacy shelves, and are being replaced with inferior products with store names imprinted on the packages.  I tried a store brand equivalent of this product and it didn&#x27;t last through the day.  Dr. Scholl&#x27;s adhesive is unmatched and the quality superb.</li>
            <li> ....i would be lost without these. ordering more today. they are perfect and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I previously used the small corn cushions and was initially disappointed when I could no longer find them. But these larger cushions are much better. They stay put even after several showers!</li>
            <li> If you HAVE to wear things like this, these are the ones to wear! They do exactly what they say they will do and have made it possible for me to wear some hither-to-for once comfortable shoes again!</li>
            <li> Used initially for several consecutive days, then at the first indication of soreness and it has helped to prevent it from getting worse.</li>
            <li> Great product, they really stay on toes long</li>
            <li> I wear heels, like a lot of women, and unfortunately that leads to corns.  It&#x27;s a sad reality when it comes to fashion.  Even though my heels have box toes so they don&#x27;t pinch my toes there&#x27;s still enough pressure to cause a bit of a calluses on my &amp;#34;ring&amp;#34; toes.  These help prevent all pain, make it so walking 10 miles a day in my heels is effortless and easy.  And they are essential.  Without them, I&#x27;m in pain all day.  With them, I don&#x27;t even notice my shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend putting them on first thing in the morning, pressing them hard onto the skin and they&#x27;ll last two days -- even through a shower -- and your toes will be thrilled with the padding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordering on Amazon is so much more cost effective than buying them in the store.</li>
            <li> Great price, can&#x27;t find anywhere else! Used it for plantar wart (not to get rid of, but to relieve pressure around it)</li>
            <li> They work. Good price for this 9 pack bundle. Always a brand name you can count on.</li>
            <li> Does the job it says it will do.</li>
            <li> I use these for my ripped up hands for crossfit kipping pullups. Put these around the popped blister then tape up.</li>
