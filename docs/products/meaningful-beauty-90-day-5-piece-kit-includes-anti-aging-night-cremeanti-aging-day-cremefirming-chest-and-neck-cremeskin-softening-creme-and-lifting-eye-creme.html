    <ol>
            <li>Best of all, I picked up 2 of these unused kits at a rummage sale for $15 each.  </li>
            <li>This company is not about helping you have great skin</li>
            <li>Just finished using the 30 day trial kit and am so happy with it.</li>
            <li>The moisturizers work good</li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>all them smell good or don&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
            <li>Price was good for what I got, but won&#x27;t reorder again.  </li>
            <li>Granted, I&#x27;ve been taking good care of my skin since I was a teenager (I&#x27;m 48).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People</li>
            <li>I have used meaningful beauty before from the acutal meaningful beauty website and it&#x27;s a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>The seller describes this product as a 90 day kit of meaningful beauty but beware!</li>
            <li>I have an oily t zone and I started noticing more oil (ugh!), but I kept on using it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any evidence that it reduced wrinkles, but it had a nice silky feel.</li>
            <li>It was almost as nice as the L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift serum (which DID have a noticeable effect on the appearance of my wrinkles)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They seem to be effective and I liked them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m 41 and have always had fairly nice skin</li>
            <li>Draw your own conclusions.</li>
            <li>Sincerely and with warm regards,&lt;br /&gt;R.</li>
            <li>I cannot say that I am noticing a huge difference in wrinkles, BUT with that being said, I am noticing my skin is softer and smoother, but the biggest difference is my BUMPS!  </li>
            <li>When I was using it before, I got so many compliments on my complexion and</li>
            <li>I would have gotten a better price on Amazon.)</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by the commercials, ads all of that bogus stuff from Meaningful Beauty.</li>
            <li>I still have all transactions from my online banking of where meaningful beauty has taken money out of my account without my permission even after cancelling and has not sent me any product after stealing money from my account.</li>
            <li>Even though there isn&#x27;t a spot remover/brightener that I can tell in the products I&#x27;ve been using, my skin tone is much more even everywhere.</li>
            <li>Not any better than what I was using.</li>
            <li>and they couldn&#x27;t have been nicer or more helpful.</li>
            <li>I have to say I&#x27;m completely satisfied with my customer service experience with them.</li>
            <li>Well after 2 weeks of using meaningful beauty, they are GONE.  </li>
            <li>, I love my skin now, and even will go without makeup ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pain, sure, but if you read the website before you sign up, you should know this stuff.</li>
            <li>I started using Meaningful beauty products about a month ago.  </li>
            <li>This makes your skin feel great and really makes your skin shine!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only in my twenties but still, when you hear so many good things about your skin, it sounds so nice!    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and my skin looks bright.  </li>
            <li>I would love it if this product were just available in stores.</li>
            <li>, I was lucky to get all of my money returned and back in my account within a week of filing a dispute because my bank did a great job investigating this!!!!</li>
            <li>I hope they are true to their word and do not send me anything else, including a bill!</li>
            <li>I kept using the products anyway and very quickly that went away.</li>
            <li>I purchased thinking it was for the full amount through amazon but then noticed this Meaningful Beauty Company charged my card 39.95 instead of the full price!</li>
            <li>$80 for a real 90 day kit is a great deal but $80 for a travel kit, not so much!</li>
            <li>and I have a hard time finding products that I can use but meaningful beauty is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I began to get upset on the phone asking them to explain how a magical sum of $150 just showed up after they already took the original $40 and havent even shipped yet since I called to cancel so quickly.</li>
            <li>My wife loves the product especially the night cream &amp;#34;Happy wife Happy life&amp;#34; nuff said.</li>
            <li>(I just use a light tinted</li>
            <li>also received two free gifts from the vendor and a hand written note thanking my for my purchase</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think these products are effective in improving the appearance of older skin (unless you weren&#x27;t using any moisturizer to begin</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very soft and smooth - feels nice to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Most things I order on Amazon are exactly how they are described and I have no issues with anything</li>
            <li>first I started breaking out just as many people have noted.</li>
            <li>On the meaningful beauty website you can purchase a real 90 day kit for $119.95 and it comes with 3 free gifts.</li>
            <li>I love the meaningful beauty line, I have sensitive skin and have problems finding products I can use.</li>
            <li>I just recd this today and wanted to let everyone know they are FULL SIZED products.</li>
            <li>It seemed o.k., but after trying the face wash, and neck, &amp; decolletage products I noticed they smelled kind of old.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see my wrinkles drastically improving, but my skin feels more REFINED and just nicer.</li>
            <li>but you may be sent to a voice mailbox (That is full)</li>
            <li>they did not believe me and would not give me a full refund.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ships super fast price is much better then anywhere else we could find.</li>
            <li>only product I liked was the anti-wrinkle capsules that came as a free gift in my kit.</li>
            <li>I will more likely buy more from Amazon, eBay or Craigslist to avoid the hassle.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, it was delivered in another 5 days.  </li>
            <li>know I&#x27;m getting current up to date products that I know won&#x27;t be out of date right from Meaningful Beauty!</li>
            <li>but the way it is sold through Guthrie Renker is a HUGE scam and a real pain when you want to cancel...</li>
            <li>It was an anniversary gift and was a success.</li>
            <li>I never have written a review but wanted to share my experience with this product because I think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>The product smells old, but seems to be working ok.</li>
            <li>I am a bit nervous about ordering more directly from the company on their autoship program given the reviews I am reading.  </li>
            <li>When you go through all of this pain, does it really matter if the product works or not, stick to natural stuff: honey, almond, avocado oils and grated potato, glycerine and cucumber puree masks for thirty minutes :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure it will be different for everyone, but I think it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>Totally gone, and all I can see is a smooth, bump free forehead.  </li>
            <li>I have great italian skin and have an occasional bump once in a while, but nothing like this.  </li>
            <li>so the only thing that actually smells good and feels nice wont even last you a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 45 years old and have fine lines around my eyes and roughness on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>Before I ordered it, I checked the weights against the weights on Meaningful Beauty&#x27;s site and they are exactly the same.</li>
            <li>but that actually work at making your skin look better.</li>
            <li>$150 for a 3 month supply-they send one box and then charge 69.95 the first month and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the size of a travel kit that surely will not last 90 days, not even 30 days.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I believed it was exactly how it was described.</li>
            <li>Now my neck has a deep crease with way more wrinkles</li>
            <li>All over my back, head, face and mostly on my chest where I applied the neck cream/sunscreen.</li>
            <li>My cheeks are almost clear up and the skin is smooth and so soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>am I able to send the product back (with no paid for shipping label or box by the way).</li>
            <li>bought this product from the actual meaningful beauty site and they did not even have it in stock.  </li>
            <li>i had to give them the numbers on the bottom of each bottle and tell them the exact product...</li>
            <li>They are amazing and make your skin so soft, but you only get 5 as a sample..</li>
            <li>I love to try new products and there are soooo many others cheaper or more expensive</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say so much about the product because it is my first time to use it..</li>
            <li>And the seller was very quick to respond and get me a refund once I sent the product back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used and loved Murad products...very nice, very expensive,</li>
            <li>This is pure thievery.</li>
            <li>You can find much better products in the drug store (such as Cetaphil cleanser, Oil of Olay, and L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift serum), especially if you are older and need advanced ingredients to fight wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>really wish I read all these reviews before I bought this kit.</li>
            <li>but I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li>(you really have to wait until they absorb before applying makeup).</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see any real results using this product.  </li>
            <li>They make me very self conscience and even make up doesn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Honestly,, I feel it has taken a few years of age off of my skin.  </li>
            <li>The serum was pretty good, but the face cream and face washes smelled like chemicals and were not pleasant.  </li>
            <li>After ordering the startup kit and using it faithfully for 20 days, I knew it was no more effective than a $4 bottle of lotion from Target.  </li>
            <li>I kind of expected this considering I read a similar comment on Amazon before calling.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m slowly starting to notice that even my t zone is becoming more refined and my pores look a little smaller.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother getting Meaningful beauty-the products themselves are over priced and dried out my skin with out making any difference whatsoever....</li>
            <li>&quot; I didn&#x27;t know Amazon sold this and didn&#x27;t see the reviews until after my purchase, but maybe they got in some trouble over the practices described in so many of the reviews.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your kit but do not be surprised if you fall victim to someone who just somehow accidentally had an account created and now receive BILLS every month for products you did not even ask to be shipped!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Cleanser is terrible, day cream is absolutely nothing special, day glo same thing, eye cream-not good, melon cream seems ok...</li>
            <li>how young I look!</li>
            <li>My skin is incredibly soft, my eye lines are softened and less noticeable, my forehead is smooth.  </li>
            <li>A HUGE waste of money.</li>
            <li>Clearly it was NOT the product I ordered and received a piece of paper stating at the bottom NOT A BILL</li>
            <li>The real 90 day kit will last you about 5 months, using it every day morning and night, well it did me!</li>
            <li>Another clue that these products were not designed for mature women is the labels themselves.</li>
            <li>I have not made it that far.</li>
            <li>Sign me up for the class action lawsuit.</li>
            <li>and it actually made my skin look older, so</li>
            <li>I had since closed the account, which apparently was not done on my first request.</li>
            <li>I have used proactive in the past and other facial products and have never broken out like I did with Meaningful Beauty&lt;br</li>
            <li>What they fail to inform you is that if you purchase a product from their company you can expect them to just pick and send you more products that cost upwards of $139 without you ordering it or even requesting it to be sent!</li>
            <li>Upon opening it I see the same form with the same account number they somehow set up and a due amount of $139.14 and again in bold letters</li>
            <li>It made my skin look oily rather than bright, and the stickiness made me feel dirty and sweaty all day (</li>
            <li>I agree with someone who said there is a weird smell to some of the products and kind of sticky</li>
            <li>But the way they work is pretty typical of any online product club you join.  </li>
            <li>yet it is a bill because below that is a total amount due for $139 -$39.95 for the first purchase (through Amazon by the way NOT their website).</li>
            <li>Also for a 90 day kit, they ONLY send you a FEW days worth of wrinkle smoothing capsules.</li>
            <li>Just like other reviews, they signed me up on a subscription and when I called to cancel when I received my product and saw that I was on auto pay,  they wanted to charge me a large cancellation fee and told me I still needed to pay the next month of product.  </li>
            <li>The only thing in the bag that was worth the money is the small purple beads with wrinkle reducing serum.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Totally gone, and all I can see is a smooth, bump free forehead.  </li>
            <li> I have great italian skin and have an occasional bump once in a while, but nothing like this.  </li>
            <li> so the only thing that actually smells good and feels nice wont even last you a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 years old and have fine lines around my eyes and roughness on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> Before I ordered it, I checked the weights against the weights on Meaningful Beauty&#x27;s site and they are exactly the same.</li>
            <li> but that actually work at making your skin look better.</li>
            <li> $150 for a 3 month supply-they send one box and then charge 69.95 the first month and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the size of a travel kit that surely will not last 90 days, not even 30 days.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I believed it was exactly how it was described.</li>
            <li> Now my neck has a deep crease with way more wrinkles</li>
            <li> All over my back, head, face and mostly on my chest where I applied the neck cream/sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My cheeks are almost clear up and the skin is smooth and so soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> am I able to send the product back (with no paid for shipping label or box by the way).</li>
            <li> bought this product from the actual meaningful beauty site and they did not even have it in stock.  </li>
            <li> i had to give them the numbers on the bottom of each bottle and tell them the exact product...</li>
            <li> They are amazing and make your skin so soft, but you only get 5 as a sample..</li>
            <li> I love to try new products and there are soooo many others cheaper or more expensive</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say so much about the product because it is my first time to use it..</li>
            <li> And the seller was very quick to respond and get me a refund once I sent the product back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used and loved Murad products...very nice, very expensive,</li>
            <li> This is pure thievery.</li>
            <li> You can find much better products in the drug store (such as Cetaphil cleanser, Oil of Olay, and L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift serum), especially if you are older and need advanced ingredients to fight wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> really wish I read all these reviews before I bought this kit.</li>
            <li> but I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li> (you really have to wait until they absorb before applying makeup).</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any real results using this product.  </li>
            <li> They make me very self conscience and even make up doesn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Honestly,, I feel it has taken a few years of age off of my skin.  </li>
            <li> The serum was pretty good, but the face cream and face washes smelled like chemicals and were not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> After ordering the startup kit and using it faithfully for 20 days, I knew it was no more effective than a $4 bottle of lotion from Target.  </li>
            <li> I kind of expected this considering I read a similar comment on Amazon before calling.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m slowly starting to notice that even my t zone is becoming more refined and my pores look a little smaller.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother getting Meaningful beauty-the products themselves are over priced and dried out my skin with out making any difference whatsoever....</li>
            <li> &quot; I didn&#x27;t know Amazon sold this and didn&#x27;t see the reviews until after my purchase, but maybe they got in some trouble over the practices described in so many of the reviews.</li>
            <li> Enjoy your kit but do not be surprised if you fall victim to someone who just somehow accidentally had an account created and now receive BILLS every month for products you did not even ask to be shipped!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Cleanser is terrible, day cream is absolutely nothing special, day glo same thing, eye cream-not good, melon cream seems ok...</li>
            <li> how young I look!</li>
            <li> My skin is incredibly soft, my eye lines are softened and less noticeable, my forehead is smooth.  </li>
            <li> A HUGE waste of money.</li>
            <li> Clearly it was NOT the product I ordered and received a piece of paper stating at the bottom NOT A BILL</li>
            <li> The real 90 day kit will last you about 5 months, using it every day morning and night, well it did me!</li>
            <li> Another clue that these products were not designed for mature women is the labels themselves.</li>
            <li> I have not made it that far.</li>
            <li> Sign me up for the class action lawsuit.</li>
            <li> and it actually made my skin look older, so</li>
            <li> I had since closed the account, which apparently was not done on my first request.</li>
            <li> I have used proactive in the past and other facial products and have never broken out like I did with Meaningful Beauty&lt;br</li>
            <li> What they fail to inform you is that if you purchase a product from their company you can expect them to just pick and send you more products that cost upwards of $139 without you ordering it or even requesting it to be sent!</li>
            <li> Upon opening it I see the same form with the same account number they somehow set up and a due amount of $139.14 and again in bold letters</li>
            <li> It made my skin look oily rather than bright, and the stickiness made me feel dirty and sweaty all day (</li>
            <li> I agree with someone who said there is a weird smell to some of the products and kind of sticky</li>
            <li> But the way they work is pretty typical of any online product club you join.  </li>
            <li> yet it is a bill because below that is a total amount due for $139 -$39.95 for the first purchase (through Amazon by the way NOT their website).</li>
            <li> Also for a 90 day kit, they ONLY send you a FEW days worth of wrinkle smoothing capsules.</li>
            <li> Just like other reviews, they signed me up on a subscription and when I called to cancel when I received my product and saw that I was on auto pay,  they wanted to charge me a large cancellation fee and told me I still needed to pay the next month of product.  </li>
            <li> The only thing in the bag that was worth the money is the small purple beads with wrinkle reducing serum.  </li>
            <li> but over the past year (it seems very drastic)</li>
            <li> I used her products long before I saw that list and sent them back.</li>
            <li> My nose became dry and red, started peeling.  </li>
            <li> after several tries you may eventually get a representative.</li>
            <li> I stated that their unauthorized withdrawals from my account were causing problems with my other bills and causing financial hardship</li>
            <li> But I do have dry</li>
            <li> All other products were a huge fail.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to stick with this product cause of the \\&quot;bump\\&quot; issue but after using it for the full 90 days, I found that it just dried my skin out too badly.  </li>
            <li> Shame on Cindy for using her name to promote this product that does NOTHING but empty your wallet.</li>
            <li> It made my skin itchy, dried, and then a red rash broke out.</li>
            <li> Oh and I am NOT willing to spend another $30 for 3 \\&quot;free\\&quot; gifts</li>
            <li> The day cream has a date of Apr 2015, so I don&#x27;t know why those other products would be put in beyond the expiration date.</li>
            <li> I def will be getting a refund as it is money back if not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I noticed a small difference within a week and a big difference at about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been billed for this product at least 4 times and have only received 1 time.</li>
            <li> The bottles I received had less oz.</li>
            <li> This product is a travel kit for $80 and no free gifts.</li>
            <li> It dried my face out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked my skin in the t zone and it&#x27;s only gotten worse over the past year where my pores look a million miles wide.</li>
            <li> The lettering is a pale lavender on white plastic, which is difficult to read even with my reading glasses.</li>
            <li> Do not listen to late nite promises for youthful skin, NOT TRUE.</li>
            <li> This is the most horrible business I have ever dealt with!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered the line without reading the Amazon reviews (usually I look at reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it is going to take to cancel.</li>
            <li> I have always had problems with small raised bumps on my forehead that looks like a rash, also on my chin and cheeks.  </li>
            <li> The product I received was past expiration date.</li>
            <li> I do not know how their product is because they sent me the wrong product that I did not order initially and once I did receive the product I thought</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint (aside from the high price for a small amount of product)is that the creams have a sticky, tacky feel, and an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not super expensive.  </li>
            <li> For the amount of product you get, it seems to be less expensive than buying comparable products from Oil of Olay or L&#x27;Oreal at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li> It has been 3 weeks and no word from them, but I would not recommend this product to anyone and would seriously discourage you from purchasing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m permanently scarred by my bad decision, don&#x27;t make the same mistake.</li>
            <li> It is not so much that i hated this product, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> SOOOO NOT worth it!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a review to warn people of the compnay behind this product.</li>
            <li> I read on the internet where this whole line is listed on the worst skin care list.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, they had no reason for the charge and told me to no worry about it.</li>
            <li> They are merely a bunch of thieves.</li>
            <li> are complaining about how difficult it is to cancel a membership.  </li>
            <li> This product should be called meaningless</li>
            <li> The refund was tedious...</li>
            <li> What a waste and disappointment!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways i used the products and after 5 days my face broke out like crazy.  </li>
            <li> incase I hear from them that there was a bad shipment.  </li>
            <li> It was so painful.</li>
            <li> Companies like this are dangerous, irresponsible, are downright a scam!</li>
            <li> worst product in the kit (in my opinion) is the decolette (chest and neck) brightening cream.</li>
            <li> I was so disgusted.  </li>
            <li> I broke out in a horrible itchy rash on my neck an chest after using the Cream designed for it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Ships super fast price is much better then anywhere else we could find. My wife loves the product especially the night cream &amp;#34;Happy wife Happy life&amp;#34; nuff said.</li>
            <li> I just recd this today and wanted to let everyone know they are FULL SIZED products. Before I ordered it, I checked the weights against the weights on Meaningful Beauty&#x27;s site and they are exactly the same. I couldn&#x27;t tell you how the products work yet, but I will get back to you. Oh and I am NOT willing to spend another $30 for 3 \\&quot;free\\&quot; gifts</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother getting Meaningful beauty-the products themselves are over priced and dried out my skin with out making any difference whatsoever....but the way it is sold through Guthrie Renker is a HUGE scam and a real pain when you want to cancel...I love to try new products and there are soooo many others cheaper or more expensive but that actually work at making your skin look better. Cleanser is terrible, day cream is absolutely nothing special, day glo same thing, eye cream-not good, melon cream seems ok...certainly much more expensive then you are led to believe. $150 for a 3 month supply-they send one box and then charge 69.95 the first month and then 39.95 the 2 consecutive months...SOOOO NOT worth it!!!!</li>
            <li> The seller describes this product as a 90 day kit of meaningful beauty but beware! It is smaller than the 30 day kit! It&#x27;s the size of a travel kit that surely will not last 90 days, not even 30 days. I have used meaningful beauty before from the acutal meaningful beauty website and it&#x27;s a wonderful product! I have very sensitive skin and I have a hard time finding products that I can use but meaningful beauty is wonderful. When I was using it before, I got so many compliments on my complexion and how young I look! I&#x27;m only in my twenties but still, when you hear so many good things about your skin, it sounds so nice!    On the meaningful beauty website you can purchase a real 90 day kit for $119.95 and it comes with 3 free gifts. Look for yourself at [...] . This product is a travel kit for $80 and no free gifts. The real 90 day kit will last you about 5 months, using it every day morning and night, well it did me! So you do the math. I ordered this because I believed it was exactly how it was described. $80 for a real 90 day kit is a great deal but $80 for a travel kit, not so much! Under the description it even had the oz. of the products and I checked the bottles when I received this product with what it says online and it&#x27;s not the same. The bottles I received had less oz. than the description states.     Most things I order on Amazon are exactly how they are described and I have no issues with anything but just beware of this product. And the seller was very quick to respond and get me a refund once I sent the product back. So I did not have any issues with the seller just the product description!</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint (aside from the high price for a small amount of product)is that the creams have a sticky, tacky feel, and an unpleasant smell. It feels like the cream is sitting on the skin rather than moisturizing it. I don&#x27;t think these products are effective in improving the appearance of older skin (unless you weren&#x27;t using any moisturizer to begin with.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst product in the kit (in my opinion) is the decolette (chest and neck) brightening cream. It made my skin look oily rather than bright, and the stickiness made me feel dirty and sweaty all day (my hair and the dust in the air stuck to my neck and chest). The eye cream irritated my eyes, so I stopped using it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only product I liked was the anti-wrinkle capsules that came as a free gift in my kit. I didn&#x27;t see any evidence that it reduced wrinkles, but it had a nice silky feel. It was almost as nice as the L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift serum (which DID have a noticeable effect on the appearance of my wrinkles)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish I read all these reviews before I bought this kit. (It was on my local news as a \\&quot;deal of the day\\&quot; but it wasn&#x27;t a deal at all. I would have gotten a better price on Amazon.) You can find much better products in the drug store (such as Cetaphil cleanser, Oil of Olay, and L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift serum), especially if you are older and need advanced ingredients to fight wrinkles.  Another clue that these products were not designed for mature women is the labels themselves. The lettering is a pale lavender on white plastic, which is difficult to read even with my reading glasses.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say so much about the product because it is my first time to use it..&lt;br /&gt;But I hope it works on me.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> This is a review to warn people of the compnay behind this product. My wife made the mistake of calling them up after watching the infomercial and ordered some 4 or 5 piece set. The person told my wife it would be a recurring payment process at the end of the call and stated that it would be $40 as advertised on tv. Once I found out, I called back within 24 hrs to cancel. Once I spoke to the representative, he stated that the account was cancelled but that there was a balance of $150 that remains. I kind of expected this considering I read a similar comment on Amazon before calling. I began to get upset on the phone asking them to explain how a magical sum of $150 just showed up after they already took the original $40 and havent even shipped yet since I called to cancel so quickly. Needless to say, they had no reason for the charge and told me to no worry about it. I obviously knew they were trying to pull something so I immediatly called my bank and put a stop payment on my account to prevent them from trying to take anymore out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the commercials, ads all of that bogus stuff from Meaningful Beauty. They are merely a bunch of thieves. DO NOT SHOP FROM THEM!!!!This is what I wrote to them never got a response! I have been billed for this product at least 4 times and have only received 1 time. I called my bank and changing my account # also had my bank investigate you, I was lucky to get all of my money returned and back in my account within a week of filing a dispute because my bank did a great job investigating this!!!! I cancelled this product but have been charged a couple times a month since. I still have all transactions from my online banking of where meaningful beauty has taken money out of my account without my permission even after cancelling and has not sent me any product after stealing money from my account. Make sure you keep a record of all transactions, phone calls you made to this fake company and write a dispute letter to file with your bank. I stated that their unauthorized withdrawals from my account were causing problems with my other bills and causing financial hardship This is the most horrible business I have ever dealt with!!! the company has been stealing over $80 a month from my account!!! BEWARE!!! When you go through all of this pain, does it really matter if the product works or not, stick to natural stuff: honey, almond, avocado oils and grated potato, glycerine and cucumber puree masks for thirty minutes :) Can&#x27;t beat that!!</li>
            <li> This company is a scam,  I would recommend never to order from them.  Just like other reviews, they signed me up on a subscription and when I called to cancel when I received my product and saw that I was on auto pay,  they wanted to charge me a large cancellation fee and told me I still needed to pay the next month of product.  Ugh.  I was so disgusted.  Also the product made my face break out (not all face creams work for people the same way)  and they wanted me to try using it for 3 months so my face could &amp;#34;get used to it.&amp;#34;  The serum was pretty good, but the face cream and face washes smelled like chemicals and were not pleasant.  I will not use these again.  I gave 2 stars for the eye cream and the serum in the kit. They seem to be effective and I liked them.  All other products were a huge fail.</li>
            <li> The moisturizers work good but, I saw no improvement on my wrinkles. Also for a 90 day kit, they ONLY send you a FEW days worth of wrinkle smoothing capsules. They make it look like a big jar on TV but, it&#x27;s really tiny. The only item that seems it would last 3 months is the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beef is that when I ordered, I had agreed to pay for a 30 day kit, per each month. They said if I stayed three months, I&#x27;d get a bonus. I have not made it that far. I canceled my order &#x27;cause what I got was their (one) 90 day joke and am now being charged monthly for it. I did not order this and had been expecting a 30 day kit, like their infomercial and customer service promised. I don&#x27;t like it when people lie about my money.</li>
            <li> Good. It was an anniversary gift and was a success. Thank you. Take care. Sincerely and with warm regards,&lt;br /&gt;R. E. K.</li>
            <li> I have not purchased this product through Amazon a friend gave me some to try and I was unimpressed. She is having a horror story getting out of them shipping this product and charging her bank account. This is pure thievery.</li>
            <li> It seemed o.k., but after trying the face wash, and neck, &amp; decolletage products I noticed they smelled kind of old. I looked on the decolletage product, and that had an expiration date of Apr 2013! Was a bit upset over that. The day cream has a date of Apr 2015, so I don&#x27;t know why those other products would be put in beyond the expiration date. Guess I&#x27;d rather pay extra, and know I&#x27;m getting current up to date products that I know won&#x27;t be out of date right from Meaningful Beauty!</li>
            <li> I never have written a review but wanted to share my experience with this product because I think it&#x27;s worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 41 and have always had fairly nice skin but over the past year (it seems very drastic) I&#x27;ve noticed crepey skin over my eyes and (gulp!) my neck. I&#x27;ve never liked my skin in the t zone and it&#x27;s only gotten worse over the past year where my pores look a million miles wide. I ordered the line without reading the Amazon reviews (usually I look at reviews but I really wanted this to work so I claimed blissful ignorance). Then I peeked at the reviews and they weren&#x27;t good.&lt;br /&gt;I received the kit...lower hopes. I agree with someone who said there is a weird smell to some of the products and kind of sticky (you really have to wait until they absorb before applying makeup). I also didn&#x27;t like the cleanser because it seems flimsy (I&#x27;ve changed my mind on it now).  I&#x27;ve used and loved Murad products...very nice, very expensive, all them smell good or don&#x27;t smell at all. I decided to just follow through with MB no matter what for a month.&lt;br /&gt;At first I started breaking out just as many people have noted. I kept using the products anyway and very quickly that went away. I have an oily t zone and I started noticing more oil (ugh!), but I kept on using it. After 1 1/2 weeks I noticed that the sides of my face, cheeks, and forehead just started looking NICER. My t zone kept on looking the same (big pores, no refinement). I started thinking I might need to use Murad on my tzone and MB everywhere else, what a pain that would be. But now it&#x27;s been another 1 1/2 weeks and I&#x27;m slowly starting to notice that even my t zone is becoming more refined and my pores look a little smaller. It&#x27;s hard to describe...I don&#x27;t really see my wrinkles drastically improving, but my skin feels more REFINED and just nicer. Even though there isn&#x27;t a spot remover/brightener that I can tell in the products I&#x27;ve been using, my skin tone is much more even everywhere. I wake up in the morning and feel like I could almost get away without foundation (I just use a light tinted moisturizer).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it will be different for everyone, but I think it&#x27;s worth a try. I haven&#x27;t had to deal with my order through MB yet...I hope that doesn&#x27;t go sideways. I would love it if this product were just available in stores.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any real results using this product.  Price was good for what I got, but won&#x27;t reorder again.  Not any better than what I was using.</li>
            <li> Product is garbage. A HUGE waste of money. Shame on Cindy for using her name to promote this product that does NOTHING but empty your wallet.</li>
            <li> I bought the 7 piece kit after months of changing the channel when the infomercial came on. I decided to give it a try. It made my skin itchy, dried, and then a red rash broke out. The company sent me an email after about 2 weeks of my purchase, and I told them about the rash (allergic reaction?) They emailed me back and then called yesterday. I explained the issues, gave them the requested lot numbers, etc. and they couldn&#x27;t have been nicer or more helpful. I offered to send everything back, including the unused \\&quot;gifts\\&quot; but was told not to spend the money on shipping. They are supposedly refunding my money and cancelling my \\&quot;membership.\\&quot; I didn&#x27;t know Amazon sold this and didn&#x27;t see the reviews until after my purchase, but maybe they got in some trouble over the practices described in so many of the reviews. I hope they are true to their word and do not send me anything else, including a bill! Will update if it&#x27;s the SOS as described by others who reviewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - I was told it would be 7-10 days before my refund showed up on my credit card statement, but it was there the next day- I have to say I&#x27;m completely satisfied with my customer service experience with them. I will give them a 5 for customer service. It&#x27;s just a shame the product affected me the way it did.</li>
            <li> It is not so much that i hated this product, but it did not work for me. It dried my face out.  when i tried to cancel it somehow it was never recorded.  Last product I received was last October and I paid it off canceled the product.  Still getting invoices, and a threat of a collection agency trying to ruin my credit for a product that does not work for me.  Do not listen to late nite promises for youthful skin, NOT TRUE.</li>
            <li> I broke out in a horrible itchy rash on my neck an chest after using the Cream designed for it. I immediately washed it off but it has left a permanent scar on my neck.  Now my neck has a deep crease with way more wrinkles then I started.  I&#x27;m permanently scarred by my bad decision, don&#x27;t make the same mistake. Don&#x27;t buy this product!!!</li>
            <li> I read on the internet where this whole line is listed on the worst skin care list. Draw your own conclusions. I used her products long before I saw that list and sent them back.</li>
            <li> I made mistake of ordering before I read reviews. I called 10 minutes after placing order and with buyer s remorse told them I wanted to cancel the order. They refused. Said to call back in 48 hours. They could not cancel my order. This is against state law and visa MasterCard regulations. This company is not about helping you have great skin they are about stealing your money. Sign me up for the class action lawsuit. Shame on you Cindy Crawford.</li>
            <li> I began itching from the second day. All over my back, head, face and mostly on my chest where I applied the neck cream/sunscreen. Benadryl has not helped. I have hives and blotchy red areas all over my neck and chest. My breasts are itchy too. I will stop this and hope the itching stops. I def will be getting a refund as it is money back if not satisfied.</li>
            <li> After ordering the startup kit and using it faithfully for 20 days, I knew it was no more effective than a $4 bottle of lotion from Target.  I tried to cancel. I had set my automatic farther out than 30 just for this reason. It had already shipped, the agent said, and I would have to pay for it.  After a lengthy conversation with this agent, I asked for a supervisor and was told the same thing. He did say he would send a return label.  Imagine my surprise when, a week later, I see another charge on my checking account for another shipment. I had changed the time to their maximum because NO WHERE on the site are you given the opportunity to CANCEL.  I call again this morning and again was told I cannot cancel because it has already shipped. I still do not have the return labels the supervisor SUPPOSEDLY sent. I&#x27;m not sure what it is going to take to cancel. I&#x27;ve always been leerly of Guthy Renker and wish I&#x27;d never fallen for their hype.  I will never order anything from Guthy Renker again and may yet have to take them to court.</li>
            <li> Just finished using the 30 day trial kit and am so happy with it. I cannot say that I am noticing a huge difference in wrinkles, BUT with that being said, I am noticing my skin is softer and smoother, but the biggest difference is my BUMPS!  I have always had problems with small raised bumps on my forehead that looks like a rash, also on my chin and cheeks.  Similar to rosesca but not red just raised rash like bumps.  They make me very self conscience and even make up doesn&#x27;t help.  Well after 2 weeks of using meaningful beauty, they are GONE.  Totally gone, and all I can see is a smooth, bump free forehead.  My cheeks are almost clear up and the skin is smooth and so soft.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, I am sold, I will continue to use this from now on. I don&#x27;t know what it is doing but whatever it is I will take it, I love my skin now, and even will go without makeup ...&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE...I really wanted to stick with this product cause of the \\&quot;bump\\&quot; issue but after using it for the full 90 days, I found that it just dried my skin out too badly.  That is probably why the bumps disappeared.  I started to flake and it actually made my skin look older, so I had to quit using it...</li>
            <li> The product I received was past expiration date. I decided to use it anyway. The product smells old, but seems to be working ok.</li>
            <li> Buyers beware of this product! I purchased what I thought was this 5-piece kit through Amazon. I purchased thinking it was for the full amount through amazon but then noticed this Meaningful Beauty Company charged my card 39.95 instead of the full price! Why? Because I was automatically signed up for their so called \\&quot;premium membership\\&quot; 30 days later after ordering this product I get it in the Cindy Crawford box only to see a 90 day supply of PILLS to help with my facial needs (the pills by the way smelled like vomit and fish). Clearly it was NOT the product I ordered and received a piece of paper stating at the bottom NOT A BILL yet it is a bill because below that is a total amount due for $139 -$39.95 for the first purchase (through Amazon by the way NOT their website). Then I call and cancel the product and only after I force it out of the customer service agent am I able to send the product back (with no paid for shipping label or box by the way). So I tell the agent to CLOSE THE ACCOUNT. 2 Weeks after this conversation another box comes this time the 5-Piece Kit that I ordered months ago arrives. Upon opening it I see the same form with the same account number they somehow set up and a due amount of $139.14 and again in bold letters NOT A BILL (how is it not a bill if it is a recurring month-to-month membership!) So I call and get a hold of a representative who is helpful (Ashley) and she closes the account (or so I hope) refunding me for the money and e-mailed a pre-paid mailing label. Quite frankly no answer could be provided as to how I was set up on a continuous membership. What they fail to inform you is that if you purchase a product from their company you can expect them to just pick and send you more products that cost upwards of $139 without you ordering it or even requesting it to be sent! They just send box after box of products every 30 days while charging your card $39.99 per month on a membership that THEY themselves created through a purchase youmade. I do not know how their product is because they sent me the wrong product that I did not order initially and once I did receive the product I thought I had since closed the account, which apparently was not done on my first request. I DO NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING THROUGH OR FROM THIS COMPANY! They say they have a 24/7 customer care but you may be sent to a voice mailbox (That is full) after several tries you may eventually get a representative. Companies like this are dangerous, irresponsible, are downright a scam! Enjoy your kit but do not be surprised if you fall victim to someone who just somehow accidentally had an account created and now receive BILLS every month for products you did not even ask to be shipped!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  It makes my skin very soft and smooth - feels nice to the touch.  I got the 30 Day kit after signing up for the membership on their site.  It&#x27;s been about 45 days and I haven&#x27;t QUITE finished it all yet to open up the 90 Day supply.  It&#x27;s gentle and my skin looks bright.  Granted, I&#x27;ve been taking good care of my skin since I was a teenager (I&#x27;m 48).  I&#x27;ve never used soap on it and have always moisturized.  I&#x27;ve never been a sun worshipper or smoker either.  I don&#x27;t have a ton of issues to fix.  But I do have dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not super expensive.  For the amount of product you get, it seems to be less expensive than buying comparable products from Oil of Olay or L&#x27;Oreal at the grocery store.  $50 a month for the membership.  It&#x27;s a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People are complaining about how difficult it is to cancel a membership.  But the way they work is pretty typical of any online product club you join.  They all want you to call to cancel.  It&#x27;s a pain, sure, but if you read the website before you sign up, you should know this stuff.</li>
            <li> I started using Meaningful beauty products about a month ago.  I&#x27;m 45 years old and have fine lines around my eyes and roughness on my forehead.  I use the products at night-the eye cream, serum, night creme, neck creme and the cleansing wash.  I noticed a small difference within a week and a big difference at about 3 weeks. My skin is incredibly soft, my eye lines are softened and less noticeable, my forehead is smooth.  Honestly,, I feel it has taken a few years of age off of my skin.  Best of all, I picked up 2 of these unused kits at a rummage sale for $15 each.  Can&#x27;t beat that!  I am a bit nervous about ordering more directly from the company on their autoship program given the reviews I am reading.  I will more likely buy more from Amazon, eBay or Craigslist to avoid the hassle.  I definitely would recommend these products.</li>
            <li> What a waste and disappointment!!!! This product should be called meaningless beauty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product from the actual meaningful beauty site and they did not even have it in stock.  I found this out after waiting 10 days for my shipment and received nothing... not an email or even a phone call.  So I called them.  They said it was on back order but would be delivered in 5 days.  Luckily, it was delivered in another 5 days.  Also something to remember if you buy the product from their site they automatically set you up for monthly shipments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the products immediately.  The only thing in the bag that was worth the money is the small purple beads with wrinkle reducing serum.  They are amazing and make your skin so soft, but you only get 5 as a sample.. so the only thing that actually smells good and feels nice wont even last you a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways i used the products and after 5 days my face broke out like crazy.  I have great italian skin and have an occasional bump once in a while, but nothing like this.  I used the product as directed on my neck and my neck broke out too. My nose became dry and red, started peeling.  It was so painful. I have used proactive in the past and other facial products and have never broken out like I did with Meaningful Beauty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I took pictures just incase they did not believe me and would not give me a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called them, explained what happened and they refunded the purchase price, but not the shipping.  The refund was tedious... i had to give them the numbers on the bottom of each bottle and tell them the exact product... don&#x27;t they already have this information?  They told me to hold onto the product for a month incase I hear from them that there was a bad shipment.  It has been 3 weeks and no word from them, but I would not recommend this product to anyone and would seriously discourage you from purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could post pictures of howbad this product was for me.</li>
            <li> I love the meaningful beauty line, I have sensitive skin and have problems finding products I can use. This makes your skin feel great and really makes your skin shine!&lt;br /&gt;I also received two free gifts from the vendor and a hand written note thanking my for my purchase, you don&#x27;t get a lot of service like that anymore!</li>
