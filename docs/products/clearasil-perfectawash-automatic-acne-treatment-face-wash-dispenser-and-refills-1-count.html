    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This feature is so wonderful because all I have to do is hold out my hand and the perfect face wash amount is dispensed.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to get this product to try!</li>
            <li>I agree with another reviewer in that this isn&#x27;t a &#x27;must have&#x27; product, but is a wonderful convenience.</li>
            <li>The Clearasil Perfect Wash Automatic Face Wash Dispenser and Refill  is an acne face washing system that works well and will appeal to adolescents.  </li>
            <li>For face wash, this is a perfect idea since it&#x27;s easier to have the thing dispense it to you instead of having to fumble with the face wash tube and all of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the PERFECT product!</li>
            <li>But to my dismay, the amount dispensed is anything but \\&quot;Perfect</li>
            <li>As I said it is one of the best products I have used, I got mine from Five Below</li>
            <li>A wonderful appliance to have in the home, and not too shabby to look at.</li>
            <li>My curiousity got the best of me and I ordered it from Amazon and got it on Monday,January 9, 2011.</li>
            <li>This is the best my skin has been in months.</li>
            <li>perfect!</li>
            <li>, the price is the best I have found and we recived it before the date given that we were suppose to.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome.</li>
            <li>Great Great!!!!</li>
            <li>The option to turn the motion detector on and off is great if you&#x27;re like me, swinging your hands around while washing them at the sink.</li>
            <li>Quite happily, batteries are included.  </li>
            <li>This is a great way to dispense liquid soap.</li>
            <li>This is a great idea in skin care.</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>The dispenser itself was great.</li>
            <li>Lol not to mention my hands look like aligator gloves after each use.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products but this is the BEST!!</li>
            <li>The size is perfect for sitting on the counter top, close to the sink.</li>
            <li>It worked perfectly and I love the idea of having an automatic dispenser.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant aroma, but is a bit drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the price and the awesomeness of the dispenser, I&#x27;d consider it a good buy.</li>
            <li>But, assuming it works for the Clearasil product, it&#x27;s a good way to refill without having to damage the container at all.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing and makes your skin feel wonderful and really does deliver the perfect dose.</li>
            <li>If you like the idea of hands free, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>Clearasil makes good products.  </li>
            <li>fairly quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the hands free dispenser and the Clearasil soap is excellent too !</li>
            <li>The idea of this product is excellent, a quick dispenser for when you need to wash your face.  </li>
            <li>I just feel there are better out there and the automatic dispenser is great.</li>
            <li>He has been plagued by breakouts since he was in his teens (he is now in his 40&#x27;s), had tried a multitude of products over the years and the results he experienced with this product was definitely better than average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I am happy with this product, and I hope I can find more refills when the time comes.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I also use acne free kit at night and those combined got rid of my acne!!</li>
            <li>and it comes in nice smelling wash.</li>
            <li>The face washes included with the dispenser have nice scents and are not drying.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if Clearasil allowed for refilling of the cartridges.  </li>
            <li>This product is really nice.</li>
            <li>Overall excellent product, convenient, smells great, works well.</li>
            <li>I hope someone posts a review that says whether or not the product is effective on acne outbreaks.</li>
            <li>guess they want to keep the good reviews pouring in to make the product look better.</li>
            <li>2 is because it smells nice</li>
            <li>I love being able to put my hand under it and have a good amount of face wash placed in my hand.  </li>
            <li>love the fact that this product is hands free!!</li>
            <li>I love being able to hold my hand out and have the soap come to me!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a way to jury rig stuff so you can make your own useable refills, but that requires more motivation than I have.  </li>
            <li>The refill works only with the hard-to-find dispenser, so I was happy to find this great deal.  </li>
            <li>Easy to set up and use  Face wash smelled nice  Cons:</li>
            <li>This product seems much more sanitary, as it prevents the spreading of germs, that cause pimples, from the tube to the face.  </li>
            <li>Most of this information comes from YouTube how-to videos regarding the Lysol Healthy Touch Hand Soap system ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Duct tape works better, but is not so esthetically pleasing.  </li>
            <li>This is the only hack I tried and works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>(I imagine if I did this I&#x27;d be able to get the soap into the container, but I&#x27;d have soap all over the place as well).  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this idea.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I do love this idea</li>
            <li>and I know Clearasil is mostly known for fighting acne</li>
            <li>Set up of the dispenser entails nothing more than installing the batteries and placing one of the two product bottles included in the kit on the dispenser.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s ok to bring it with you when you travel.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>You may just want to dig a hole to solve your Acne issues : ) or go to the craft store...</li>
            <li>Love that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve said at the top of this review</li>
            <li>so I think after I finish them, I would refill the dispenser with my favorite soap instead.  </li>
            <li>The dispenser would be perfect for a public bathroom where the owner doesn&#x27;t want to have any permanent fixture on the wall.</li>
            <li>The dispenser does deliver an appropriate amount of cleanser.</li>
            <li>The dispenser sold me more than the cleanser itself.  </li>
            <li>This compounded my dissatisfaction because the packaging made a big fuss on the \\&quot;Perfect</li>
            <li>It was an ok product.</li>
            <li>Created more acne</li>
            <li>I am still dealing with peeling and itchiness and a lot more pimples</li>
            <li>Great soap dispenser, can&#x27;t really beat the price.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>- I think I&#x27;ve been washing my face more often after having this on my coutnertop and a seperate soap in the shower.</li>
            <li>I like the hands-free aspect, but it&#x27;s not the most convenient when you have to keep all of your stuff in a cubby in a dorm bathroom.</li>
            <li>Everyones skin is different, but out of all the face washes I have neen through this product is the best.</li>
            <li>The soap is pleasant smelling, not too strong but mild just the way I like it.</li>
            <li>bought it for my husband and he initially laughed at it (as if one couldn&#x27;t just squeeze it from a tube, right?), but once he went through the 2 reserves, he asked for more.</li>
            <li>This is handy since most people manually dispense more product than needed and this product ensures you get the full number of washes you should get.</li>
            <li>but it does leave my face nice and clean</li>
            <li>The most attractive feature about Clearasil&#x27;s Perfectawash is the fact that it is completely hands free!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool to just have to put your hand under it to get the cleaner, but I find a bottle to be just as handy.  </li>
            <li>It would be awesome for me if it was slender enough to fit my shower rack because that is where I wash my face.</li>
            <li>The face wash clicks in at the top and through the magic of the sensor light</li>
            <li>It is really convenient to use, it&#x27;s much easier and faster to just hold your hand and get the perfect amount of face wash.</li>
            <li>The face wash is smooth, refreshing, and makes your face feel \\&quot;cleaner.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I like the hands-free dispenser, although I wish it was a bit narrower so that it would fit better in my shower.  </li>
            <li>You may just want to dig a hole to solve your Acne issues : ) or go to the craft store...to the sides of the cap; keeping each screw driver in place on each tap until they were all free.  </li>
            <li>These types of auto-dispensers are becoming popular--we also tried, through Vine, the Lysol kitchen system.</li>
            <li>If your one of those folks who because of time constraints have continually put off a to visit your dermatologist, then Clearasil&#x27;s PerfectaWash may be just the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Designed to treat pimples and restore your skin the handy automatic dispenser gives you just the right amount of product to wash you face.  </li>
            <li>The gadget is really easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>The perfect skin cleanser is effective, gentle, doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, and is inexpensive.</li>
            <li>(I did use a moisturizer afterward because my skin, although oily, dries out easily).</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest these as they are strong, these will never get rid of your skin issues the way a trip to the dermatologist will.</li>
            <li>My adult son, on the other hand used it, experienced no redness and had very good results.  </li>
            <li>If it dispensed half of the amount it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t have any skin irritations, this would work fine for you.</li>
            <li>I have been an loyal clearasil user since I was 18, and this does not dissapoint!</li>
            <li>It is a reasonably attractive unit with a mallard-like profile that sits easily atop a counter or on the back of a sink.</li>
            <li>This is just a little annoyance compared to how it dispenses the perfect amount of face wash and saves me money considering I&#x27;m not wasting any face wash.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Its a little weighty for keeping in my shower, perfect for the countertop tho.  </li>
            <li>should mention that the three family members who would most likely be affected by acne have, on the whole, very good skin.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to worry about disposing of huge plastic jugs.</li>
            <li>My bathroom sink isn&#x27;t huge</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in my complexion or any lessening of my acne.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great item.</li>
            <li>The Salicylic \\&quot;Acid\\&quot; will continue to keep working while also, the moisturizer will be available to help the harshness of the acid.  </li>
            <li>keeping each screw driver in place on each tap until they were all free.  </li>
            <li>(The Superfruit Splash one which smells fantastic btw.)</li>
            <li>I like the idea of hands free dispensor and limiting the messiness of soap dishes.  </li>
            <li>Great gift for a teen girl.</li>
            <li>and I like the fact that it touch free</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I love that the dispenser pumps out the right amount of face wash.</li>
            <li>How nice it would be if they&#x27;d release a formulation of cleanser/exfoliator/toner for older skin, too.</li>
            <li>The Clearail Perfectawash Automatic Face Wash Dispenser makes washing the face fun!</li>
            <li>I love the design of the automatic dispenser and it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product, I used it once a day for a week and here are the results:  </li>
            <li>then I originally had,</li>
            <li>Also liked the product I have normal skin</li>
            <li>and it works great, lasts a very long time and cleans and prevents acne.</li>
            <li>you leave you feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>On the positive side, my kids seem to love this unit and it has encouraged them to wash their face twice per day.</li>
            <li>I truly enjoy this product for ease of use and for the fresh, clean feeling that one gets from the cleansing formula included int he package.  </li>
            <li>I tend to overuse my face wash, leaving me buying more than I really need.  </li>
            <li>Lysol Healthy Touch Hand Soap, Starter Kit Stainless, Aloe,</li>
            <li>but they want to be able to change out the types of liquid it dispenses could really have something going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hope the batteries that came with it last a good while.</li>
            <li>I only have good things to say about the product my daughter loves it</li>
            <li>-I can&#x27;t deal with scented things that well, but the other wash that came with it is great.</li>
            <li>The wash itself leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh</li>
            <li>I love the fact that you don&#x27;t have to open or unscrew a top off.</li>
            <li>For those with mild to severe acne, this may not be an issue for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the Soothing Plant Extracts one so far, and it feels good on my skin and really cleans.</li>
            <li>Because the primary blemish fighting ingredient in both bottles is good old salicylic acid, which causes skin to shed more readily, folks with sensitive skin may experience some redness/dryness from using it, as I did.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with the results, and my 17 year old son was surprised at how quickly his skin texture improved after he began using</li>
            <li>It takes up bathroom space (a precious commodity where I live), and requires you use the special-designed refills.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, the face wash itself is not harsh - the active ingedient is Salicylic Acid, which is the best and safest ingredient for keeping skin clear and healthy at any age.</li>
            <li>That in and of itself makes this a useful investment.  </li>
            <li>Even if you decide to substitute another skin care product, the Clearasil automatic dispenser alone is worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li>Our family of five includes three adolescents/young adults, and we&#x27;ve all tried this to see if it&#x27;s worth recommending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is hands free, and gives you the actual portion you need each time.  </li>
            <li>Fun for teens to use.</li>
            <li>but my skin does get blackheads and occasional zits, plus I love the feeling of having my face clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>but they dont seem very strong and havent really prevented acne or help to clear it up</li>
            <li>My dermatologist was right about this.</li>
            <li>I always have issues finding products that do not over dry my skin but that will also work effectively.</li>
            <li>Most people will react negatively to at least one of these; and as you age those being effective may change too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You should be able to know for sure in a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Whether this is worth it or not depends on how much energy you want to invest in the system.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it doesn&#x27;t have the high-technology appeal/auto-dispensing properties of the Perfectawash, but the soap works just the same...</li>
            <li>/&gt;But overall, it is not a terrible product.</li>
            <li>The company that recognizes that people only want one dispenser (or, at most, two)</li>
            <li>I had it on automatic at first but accidentally dispensed it when reaching for my shampoo a couple of times</li>
            <li>The best news is that my skin doesn&#x27;t break out into a rash or turn red which some products have done in the past.  </li>
            <li>First, this is a compact product so if you have space issues, this could work for you.</li>
            <li>, you run your hand under the head and the exact \\&quot;dose\\&quot; dispenses.</li>
            <li>We tried the Splash first.</li>
            <li>I love the dispenser not having to open and close the bottle is a time saver, by seconds but still a time saver.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it!</li>
            <li>When I wash my face I like to rinse off with water first</li>
            <li>However, be aware that what works for one person may not work for another.</li>
            <li>So even though the disspensor looks cool and works great, it was not great for me.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser makes it easy to use, although the automatic dose is a little more than I need for my face since this cleanser is very sudsy!  </li>
            <li>This is good because it&#x27;s often easy to waste a lot of cleanser if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>And this is just as good and half the price!</li>
            <li>It works very well because it dispenses the right amount of soap every time.</li>
            <li>The face wash itself is a very drying, I have mixed skin, some parts dry and some oily and this dried it out a bit when used twice a day, but it&#x27;s nice when I need a good cleaning if I follow up with rich moisturizer after.</li>
            <li>cleanser itself is pleasant, not strong scented, and works decently, being from Clearasil.  </li>
            <li>and it was gentle enough to use on my sensitive skin, which was nice.  </li>
            <li>This is why I think it&#x27;d be great for young kids who are just starting to worry about washing their face, especially since the motion detector makes it a bit</li>
            <li>The sensitivity was pretty high at first, but it seems to have lessened now (?).  </li>
            <li>Also, if you will have to find a similar soap (2% salicylic acid) if you want to retain the acne fighting properties of the Clearasil product...  1) EASY:  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t try this as I don&#x27;t have a 60 milliliter syringe handy and, even though it isn&#x27;t evident in the video, it strikes me as being a bit messy</li>
            <li>The refills aren&#x27;t large, but they are inexpensive to purchase separately.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the dispenser.</li>
            <li>On the whole, this is a reasonable unit for promoting hygiene for your kids.  </li>
            <li>You can then fill up an empty ketchup dispenser or syringe with soap and refill the canister from the top.  </li>
            <li>but I really do like the convenience and sleekness of the dispenser.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t care much for the fruity wash</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s establish that straight up.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>really dont like that</li>
            <li>Thanks Clearasil.</li>
            <li>and it is gentle on my skin</li>
            <li>My face has cleared up so much.</li>
            <li>I love the dispenser getting the right amount and not having to touch/squeeze there by not getting the bottle sticky and messy.</li>
            <li>many many years, I don&#x27;t have a serious Acne problem anymore, THANK GOD!</li>
            <li>Both kinds of soap have different pleasant, but slightly perfumey, fragrances.  </li>
            <li>Three stars because I love the dispenser, it will never receive the other two from me because the cleanser ruined my face.</li>
            <li>Not so sure the scents would appeal to a teen boy as it includes a pink bottle of super fruit splash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very basic cleanser, nothing special at all.  </li>
            <li>This dispenser is a neat little gadget, but I think it would be more useful for young folks.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product that truely clears the face.</li>
            <li>I dont have acne, but I do have prone areas where blackheads live, and this works!  </li>
            <li>The dispenser is well made and easy to use while taking up the minimal amount of space.</li>
            <li>Using an empty ketchup dispenser makes refills easy.  </li>
            <li>I am currently using the green refill and it smells gorgeous.</li>
            <li>However, it shoots out big globs which is more than enough need for a face wash.</li>
            <li>Salicylic Acid works mainly by controlling skin oil.</li>
            <li>If it was a bit more expensive and didn&#x27;t use proprietary inserts, sure, I&#x27;d say go for it.  </li>
            <li>I will continue  to still use the product as it keeps my skin smooth, but i will try using it once a day instead of twice and add my old regime back in once a day, maybe that will help with the acne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>the price isn&#x27;t too high.  </li>
            <li>This might save the customer a little money and would be better for the environment.  </li>
            <li>I wish the description on this page would&#x27;ve spelled out the ingredients a little better.  </li>
            <li>Easy to wash off, does not dry out skin, seems to help improve the overall look of my skin in regards to acne</li>
            <li>The first few days I used it I was fine,</li>
            <li>However, I found the size of the dispenser too large to place next to the sink - just an item to be aware of when considering where you will store this in the bathroom or vanity.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin but its also sensitive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had fairly severe acne for the past several years (I&#x27;m 19 now)</li>
            <li>I smiled one day and my face cracked down the middle.</li>
            <li>The cap now looks normal from the outside and pops off with a simple 1/4 twist making the bottle easily refillable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cap now looks normal from the outside and pops off with a simple 1/4 twist making the bottle easily refillable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the dispenser so easy and convenient, unfortunately my face has suffered dramatically.</li>
            <li>Drill two holes at the top of the canister, the first large (for adding soap) and a second small hole for ventilation.  </li>
            <li>I put this dispenser in my shower since I didn&#x27;t love the idea of everyone seeing my face wash in plain sight.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used many acne products in the past, and while some helped more than others, this one is really a waste of money.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it, but hope that Clearasil will revamp their scents or come out with some new ones.</li>
            <li>Indeed, it&#x27;s one of those things you don&#x27;t know you need until you try it, and then find out you can no longer live without it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Seems to come back on quickly and be ready to dispense in a short period of time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;With such an easy application method and overall positive results, you can expect me to be using Clearasil&#x27;s Perfectawash Automatic Face Wash Dispenser in the future.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>An addition to the above points: this product does dry out my skin a little more than is comfortable for me.</li>
            <li>An addition to the above points: this product does dry out my skin a little more than is comfortable for me.</li>
            <li>Dose\\&quot;  that Clearsil science knows the right amount of product is key to clear skin...  </li>
            <li>I only have acne when I eat too much chocolate, which is not very often, so I can&#x27;t see myself keeping this permanently filled with acne cleanser,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a small unit though, so you do need to make room on your counter for it.  </li>
            <li>I am always in a rush when showering, so not having to open the cap of my face wash is a plus I am willing to pay.  </li>
            <li>used the face wash for the last 2 weeks I can say that it has been very gentle for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe they will make a new formula for sensitive skin?  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Super fruits\\&quot; smells a bit better/sweeter but still not much like any fruit I&#x27;ve ever seen.  </li>
            <li>This product has only made me break out (much) more after less than a week of use.</li>
            <li>I have found, personally, that honey has worked more for me and it a lot less drying.</li>
            <li>Trying to find the refills in stores is a little hard-item not that available yet.</li>
            <li>I have used other battery powered soap dispensers before, this one works very well, the inferred sensor is instant feeding soap without waiting, a check valve prevents the soap from returning into the tank so you always have a quick response.</li>
            <li>and I am still seeing breakouts which don&#x27;t usually clear up in 12 hours.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt her skin, but it didn&#x27;t clear up her Acne.  </li>
            <li>If you do, stay clear from it.</li>
            <li>but this issue is easily fixed by turning the dispenser off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Clearasil&#x27;s face wash so far is doing all of that and is meeting my expectations.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The sensor on the dispenser is fairly sensitive so it will go off even when you don&#x27;t put your hand underneath it.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>As someone with sensitive skin, the two bottles of face wash did not cause any breakouts or reactions.</li>
            <li>The dispenser&#x27;s sensor is quite sensitive and often pumps out unwanted face wash whenever a hand is near it.</li>
            <li>The unit motion sensor functions well--it dispenses the soap with a close range wave of the hand but does not misfire if the motion occurs farther away from the unit.  </li>
            <li>Automatic Face Wash Refill Soothing Plant Extracts Ultra Rapid Action Face Wash Salicylic Acid 2% Acne Medication (5 fl Ounce)]]  </li>
            <li>I decided to forgo tape and avoided filling the dispenser completely.  </li>
            <li>but they haven&#x27;t gone away completely.  </li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t work at all, it&#x27;s really just a marketing campaign with a generic paste they try to sell as treatment.</li>
            <li>But at the same time, do you really need it?  </li>
            <li>So far it has done just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One thing not on my list so far is \\&quot;CLAY\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>One thing not on my list so far is \\&quot;CLAY\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Especially at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Clearsil paid too much money to their marketing folks and not enough on engineering...</li>
            <li>Oddly enough it is cheaper to buy the whole setup vs buying just the refills I have found from looking around online.</li>
            <li>As a 13 year old girl I have acne.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to worry about adding anything to this order, it comes complete.  </li>
            <li>The individual refills to say that they contain salicylic acid, but there only 2 different refills available - both of which come with the dispensor when you buy it.  </li>
            <li>Would not recommend for those sensitive to dyes and perfumes.</li>
            <li>and so far nothing I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>The soap&#x27;s active ingredient is 2% salicylic acid, which is a mild anti-acne agent that isn&#x27;t too drying.  </li>
            <li>Note that at the time of writing this review, purchasing two soap refills costs two dollars less than purchasing the full unit with two refills.]  </li>
            <li>I am long past my acne stage in life, but I&#x27;ve found this to be a fast and easy way to wash my face after washing my hands.</li>
            <li>Overall decent product with novelty dispenser.</li>
            <li>The unit is generally sturdy, but is completely made out of plastic--</li>
            <li>I can tell, though, that it would be a lot better for younger and less dry skin than my sixty-year-old face sports.</li>
            <li>It makes it very convenient, especially if you have younger folks in the home who are concerned about their complexion.  </li>
            <li>I really hope Clearasil stands behind supporting this product, because they really do have a winner on their hands.  </li>
            <li>My main concern is whether or not Clearasil is committed to this product for long term sustainability.  </li>
            <li>The dispenser definitely works as advertised and the soap is reasonably effective (along with the other usual anti-acne measures).  </li>
            <li>Also be aware that in addition to the salicylic acid, both bottles contain methylparaben a commonly used chemical preservative used in cosmetics that is readily absorb through the skin and which some scientific studies say may disrupt the bodies endocrine system.</li>
            <li>I would steer clear of this product, I will no longer use anything Clearasil especially after they denied my review of this product for no reason..</li>
            <li>However I do not really like how much the dispenser dispenses per use.</li>
            <li>Only problem is sometimes would get product dispensed when setting something near dispenser.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;One con, besides the refils being clearasil only, is that on my unit the sensor seemed almost too sensitive.  </li>
            <li>So sensitive that I can&#x27;t actually wear makeup without my eyes feeling like they&#x27;re burning out of my sockets.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend has allergic reactions to salicylic acid, so I assumed there would be a soap for sensitive skin like the regular clearasil makes.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, and I can use salicylic acid products without over-drying or irritation, but I find it necessary to rotate products from time to time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confused by that, but it doesn&#x27;t cause any more accidents</li>
            <li>Assuming that this will work, you&#x27;d have to be very careful to avoid damaging the container or the lid--if there is a compromise in the seal the whole system will leak.  </li>
            <li>The only complaint I have about this feature is that it is super sensitive and will go out when I brush my teeth</li>
            <li>The sensor in it is real sensitive so be careful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still not sure if any of this is really worth it.  </li>
            <li>Are THE most common active ingredients in Acne products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it is cleaner and clear BUT it is also so dry.</li>
            <li>, I hope that they (or another company) may come out with a face wash for sensitive or dry skin too!</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This feature is so wonderful because all I have to do is hold out my hand and the perfect face wash amount is dispensed.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to get this product to try!</li>
            <li> I agree with another reviewer in that this isn&#x27;t a &#x27;must have&#x27; product, but is a wonderful convenience.</li>
            <li> The Clearasil Perfect Wash Automatic Face Wash Dispenser and Refill  is an acne face washing system that works well and will appeal to adolescents.  </li>
            <li> For face wash, this is a perfect idea since it&#x27;s easier to have the thing dispense it to you instead of having to fumble with the face wash tube and all of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the PERFECT product!</li>
            <li> But to my dismay, the amount dispensed is anything but \\&quot;Perfect</li>
            <li> As I said it is one of the best products I have used, I got mine from Five Below</li>
            <li> A wonderful appliance to have in the home, and not too shabby to look at.</li>
            <li> My curiousity got the best of me and I ordered it from Amazon and got it on Monday,January 9, 2011.</li>
            <li> This is the best my skin has been in months.</li>
            <li> perfect!</li>
            <li> , the price is the best I have found and we recived it before the date given that we were suppose to.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.</li>
            <li> Great Great!!!!</li>
            <li> The option to turn the motion detector on and off is great if you&#x27;re like me, swinging your hands around while washing them at the sink.</li>
            <li> Quite happily, batteries are included.  </li>
            <li> This is a great way to dispense liquid soap.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea in skin care.</li>
            <li> Works great</li>
            <li> The dispenser itself was great.</li>
            <li> Lol not to mention my hands look like aligator gloves after each use.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products but this is the BEST!!</li>
            <li> The size is perfect for sitting on the counter top, close to the sink.</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly and I love the idea of having an automatic dispenser.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant aroma, but is a bit drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the price and the awesomeness of the dispenser, I&#x27;d consider it a good buy.</li>
            <li> But, assuming it works for the Clearasil product, it&#x27;s a good way to refill without having to damage the container at all.  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing and makes your skin feel wonderful and really does deliver the perfect dose.</li>
            <li> If you like the idea of hands free, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Clearasil makes good products.  </li>
            <li> fairly quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the hands free dispenser and the Clearasil soap is excellent too !</li>
            <li> The idea of this product is excellent, a quick dispenser for when you need to wash your face.  </li>
            <li> I just feel there are better out there and the automatic dispenser is great.</li>
            <li> He has been plagued by breakouts since he was in his teens (he is now in his 40&#x27;s), had tried a multitude of products over the years and the results he experienced with this product was definitely better than average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I am happy with this product, and I hope I can find more refills when the time comes.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> I also use acne free kit at night and those combined got rid of my acne!!</li>
            <li> and it comes in nice smelling wash.</li>
            <li> The face washes included with the dispenser have nice scents and are not drying.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if Clearasil allowed for refilling of the cartridges.  </li>
            <li> This product is really nice.</li>
            <li> Overall excellent product, convenient, smells great, works well.</li>
            <li> I hope someone posts a review that says whether or not the product is effective on acne outbreaks.</li>
            <li> guess they want to keep the good reviews pouring in to make the product look better.</li>
            <li> 2 is because it smells nice</li>
            <li> I love being able to put my hand under it and have a good amount of face wash placed in my hand.  </li>
            <li> love the fact that this product is hands free!!</li>
            <li> I love being able to hold my hand out and have the soap come to me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a way to jury rig stuff so you can make your own useable refills, but that requires more motivation than I have.  </li>
            <li> The refill works only with the hard-to-find dispenser, so I was happy to find this great deal.  </li>
            <li> Easy to set up and use  Face wash smelled nice  Cons:</li>
            <li> This product seems much more sanitary, as it prevents the spreading of germs, that cause pimples, from the tube to the face.  </li>
            <li> Most of this information comes from YouTube how-to videos regarding the Lysol Healthy Touch Hand Soap system ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Duct tape works better, but is not so esthetically pleasing.  </li>
            <li> This is the only hack I tried and works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> (I imagine if I did this I&#x27;d be able to get the soap into the container, but I&#x27;d have soap all over the place as well).  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this idea.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I do love this idea</li>
            <li> and I know Clearasil is mostly known for fighting acne</li>
            <li> Set up of the dispenser entails nothing more than installing the batteries and placing one of the two product bottles included in the kit on the dispenser.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s ok to bring it with you when you travel.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> You may just want to dig a hole to solve your Acne issues : ) or go to the craft store...</li>
            <li> Love that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve said at the top of this review</li>
            <li> so I think after I finish them, I would refill the dispenser with my favorite soap instead.  </li>
            <li> The dispenser would be perfect for a public bathroom where the owner doesn&#x27;t want to have any permanent fixture on the wall.</li>
            <li> The dispenser does deliver an appropriate amount of cleanser.</li>
            <li> The dispenser sold me more than the cleanser itself.  </li>
            <li> This compounded my dissatisfaction because the packaging made a big fuss on the \\&quot;Perfect</li>
            <li> It was an ok product.</li>
            <li> Created more acne</li>
            <li> I am still dealing with peeling and itchiness and a lot more pimples</li>
            <li> Great soap dispenser, can&#x27;t really beat the price.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> - I think I&#x27;ve been washing my face more often after having this on my coutnertop and a seperate soap in the shower.</li>
            <li> I like the hands-free aspect, but it&#x27;s not the most convenient when you have to keep all of your stuff in a cubby in a dorm bathroom.</li>
            <li> Everyones skin is different, but out of all the face washes I have neen through this product is the best.</li>
            <li> The soap is pleasant smelling, not too strong but mild just the way I like it.</li>
            <li> bought it for my husband and he initially laughed at it (as if one couldn&#x27;t just squeeze it from a tube, right?), but once he went through the 2 reserves, he asked for more.</li>
            <li> This is handy since most people manually dispense more product than needed and this product ensures you get the full number of washes you should get.</li>
            <li> but it does leave my face nice and clean</li>
            <li> The most attractive feature about Clearasil&#x27;s Perfectawash is the fact that it is completely hands free!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool to just have to put your hand under it to get the cleaner, but I find a bottle to be just as handy.  </li>
            <li> It would be awesome for me if it was slender enough to fit my shower rack because that is where I wash my face.</li>
            <li> The face wash clicks in at the top and through the magic of the sensor light</li>
            <li> It is really convenient to use, it&#x27;s much easier and faster to just hold your hand and get the perfect amount of face wash.</li>
            <li> The face wash is smooth, refreshing, and makes your face feel \\&quot;cleaner.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I like the hands-free dispenser, although I wish it was a bit narrower so that it would fit better in my shower.  </li>
            <li> You may just want to dig a hole to solve your Acne issues : ) or go to the craft store...to the sides of the cap; keeping each screw driver in place on each tap until they were all free.  </li>
            <li> These types of auto-dispensers are becoming popular--we also tried, through Vine, the Lysol kitchen system.</li>
            <li> If your one of those folks who because of time constraints have continually put off a to visit your dermatologist, then Clearasil&#x27;s PerfectaWash may be just the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Designed to treat pimples and restore your skin the handy automatic dispenser gives you just the right amount of product to wash you face.  </li>
            <li> The gadget is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The perfect skin cleanser is effective, gentle, doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, and is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> (I did use a moisturizer afterward because my skin, although oily, dries out easily).</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest these as they are strong, these will never get rid of your skin issues the way a trip to the dermatologist will.</li>
            <li> My adult son, on the other hand used it, experienced no redness and had very good results.  </li>
            <li> If it dispensed half of the amount it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t have any skin irritations, this would work fine for you.</li>
            <li> I have been an loyal clearasil user since I was 18, and this does not dissapoint!</li>
            <li> It is a reasonably attractive unit with a mallard-like profile that sits easily atop a counter or on the back of a sink.</li>
            <li> This is just a little annoyance compared to how it dispenses the perfect amount of face wash and saves me money considering I&#x27;m not wasting any face wash.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Its a little weighty for keeping in my shower, perfect for the countertop tho.  </li>
            <li> should mention that the three family members who would most likely be affected by acne have, on the whole, very good skin.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to worry about disposing of huge plastic jugs.</li>
            <li> My bathroom sink isn&#x27;t huge</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in my complexion or any lessening of my acne.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great item.</li>
            <li> The Salicylic \\&quot;Acid\\&quot; will continue to keep working while also, the moisturizer will be available to help the harshness of the acid.  </li>
            <li> keeping each screw driver in place on each tap until they were all free.  </li>
            <li> (The Superfruit Splash one which smells fantastic btw.)</li>
            <li> I like the idea of hands free dispensor and limiting the messiness of soap dishes.  </li>
            <li> Great gift for a teen girl.</li>
            <li> and I like the fact that it touch free</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I love that the dispenser pumps out the right amount of face wash.</li>
            <li> How nice it would be if they&#x27;d release a formulation of cleanser/exfoliator/toner for older skin, too.</li>
            <li> The Clearail Perfectawash Automatic Face Wash Dispenser makes washing the face fun!</li>
            <li> I love the design of the automatic dispenser and it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product, I used it once a day for a week and here are the results:  </li>
            <li> then I originally had,</li>
            <li> Also liked the product I have normal skin</li>
            <li> and it works great, lasts a very long time and cleans and prevents acne.</li>
            <li> you leave you feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> On the positive side, my kids seem to love this unit and it has encouraged them to wash their face twice per day.</li>
            <li> I truly enjoy this product for ease of use and for the fresh, clean feeling that one gets from the cleansing formula included int he package.  </li>
            <li> I tend to overuse my face wash, leaving me buying more than I really need.  </li>
            <li> Lysol Healthy Touch Hand Soap, Starter Kit Stainless, Aloe,</li>
            <li> but they want to be able to change out the types of liquid it dispenses could really have something going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hope the batteries that came with it last a good while.</li>
            <li> I only have good things to say about the product my daughter loves it</li>
            <li> -I can&#x27;t deal with scented things that well, but the other wash that came with it is great.</li>
            <li> The wash itself leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you don&#x27;t have to open or unscrew a top off.</li>
            <li> For those with mild to severe acne, this may not be an issue for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the Soothing Plant Extracts one so far, and it feels good on my skin and really cleans.</li>
            <li> Because the primary blemish fighting ingredient in both bottles is good old salicylic acid, which causes skin to shed more readily, folks with sensitive skin may experience some redness/dryness from using it, as I did.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with the results, and my 17 year old son was surprised at how quickly his skin texture improved after he began using</li>
            <li> It takes up bathroom space (a precious commodity where I live), and requires you use the special-designed refills.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, the face wash itself is not harsh - the active ingedient is Salicylic Acid, which is the best and safest ingredient for keeping skin clear and healthy at any age.</li>
            <li> That in and of itself makes this a useful investment.  </li>
            <li> Even if you decide to substitute another skin care product, the Clearasil automatic dispenser alone is worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li> Our family of five includes three adolescents/young adults, and we&#x27;ve all tried this to see if it&#x27;s worth recommending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is hands free, and gives you the actual portion you need each time.  </li>
            <li> Fun for teens to use.</li>
            <li> but my skin does get blackheads and occasional zits, plus I love the feeling of having my face clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> but they dont seem very strong and havent really prevented acne or help to clear it up</li>
            <li> My dermatologist was right about this.</li>
            <li> I always have issues finding products that do not over dry my skin but that will also work effectively.</li>
            <li> Most people will react negatively to at least one of these; and as you age those being effective may change too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You should be able to know for sure in a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Whether this is worth it or not depends on how much energy you want to invest in the system.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it doesn&#x27;t have the high-technology appeal/auto-dispensing properties of the Perfectawash, but the soap works just the same...</li>
            <li> /&gt;But overall, it is not a terrible product.</li>
            <li> The company that recognizes that people only want one dispenser (or, at most, two)</li>
            <li> I had it on automatic at first but accidentally dispensed it when reaching for my shampoo a couple of times</li>
            <li> The best news is that my skin doesn&#x27;t break out into a rash or turn red which some products have done in the past.  </li>
            <li> First, this is a compact product so if you have space issues, this could work for you.</li>
            <li> , you run your hand under the head and the exact \\&quot;dose\\&quot; dispenses.</li>
            <li> We tried the Splash first.</li>
            <li> I love the dispenser not having to open and close the bottle is a time saver, by seconds but still a time saver.</li>
            <li> I really recommend it!</li>
            <li> When I wash my face I like to rinse off with water first</li>
            <li> However, be aware that what works for one person may not work for another.</li>
            <li> So even though the disspensor looks cool and works great, it was not great for me.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser makes it easy to use, although the automatic dose is a little more than I need for my face since this cleanser is very sudsy!  </li>
            <li> This is good because it&#x27;s often easy to waste a lot of cleanser if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> And this is just as good and half the price!</li>
            <li> It works very well because it dispenses the right amount of soap every time.</li>
            <li> The face wash itself is a very drying, I have mixed skin, some parts dry and some oily and this dried it out a bit when used twice a day, but it&#x27;s nice when I need a good cleaning if I follow up with rich moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> cleanser itself is pleasant, not strong scented, and works decently, being from Clearasil.  </li>
            <li> and it was gentle enough to use on my sensitive skin, which was nice.  </li>
            <li> This is why I think it&#x27;d be great for young kids who are just starting to worry about washing their face, especially since the motion detector makes it a bit</li>
            <li> The sensitivity was pretty high at first, but it seems to have lessened now (?).  </li>
            <li> Also, if you will have to find a similar soap (2% salicylic acid) if you want to retain the acne fighting properties of the Clearasil product...  1) EASY:  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try this as I don&#x27;t have a 60 milliliter syringe handy and, even though it isn&#x27;t evident in the video, it strikes me as being a bit messy</li>
            <li> The refills aren&#x27;t large, but they are inexpensive to purchase separately.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the dispenser.</li>
            <li> On the whole, this is a reasonable unit for promoting hygiene for your kids.  </li>
            <li> You can then fill up an empty ketchup dispenser or syringe with soap and refill the canister from the top.  </li>
            <li> but I really do like the convenience and sleekness of the dispenser.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t care much for the fruity wash</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s establish that straight up.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> really dont like that</li>
            <li> Thanks Clearasil.</li>
            <li> and it is gentle on my skin</li>
            <li> My face has cleared up so much.</li>
            <li> I love the dispenser getting the right amount and not having to touch/squeeze there by not getting the bottle sticky and messy.</li>
            <li> many many years, I don&#x27;t have a serious Acne problem anymore, THANK GOD!</li>
            <li> Both kinds of soap have different pleasant, but slightly perfumey, fragrances.  </li>
            <li> Three stars because I love the dispenser, it will never receive the other two from me because the cleanser ruined my face.</li>
            <li> Not so sure the scents would appeal to a teen boy as it includes a pink bottle of super fruit splash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very basic cleanser, nothing special at all.  </li>
            <li> This dispenser is a neat little gadget, but I think it would be more useful for young folks.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product that truely clears the face.</li>
            <li> I dont have acne, but I do have prone areas where blackheads live, and this works!  </li>
            <li> The dispenser is well made and easy to use while taking up the minimal amount of space.</li>
            <li> Using an empty ketchup dispenser makes refills easy.  </li>
            <li> I am currently using the green refill and it smells gorgeous.</li>
            <li> However, it shoots out big globs which is more than enough need for a face wash.</li>
            <li> Salicylic Acid works mainly by controlling skin oil.</li>
            <li> If it was a bit more expensive and didn&#x27;t use proprietary inserts, sure, I&#x27;d say go for it.  </li>
            <li> I will continue  to still use the product as it keeps my skin smooth, but i will try using it once a day instead of twice and add my old regime back in once a day, maybe that will help with the acne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> the price isn&#x27;t too high.  </li>
            <li> This might save the customer a little money and would be better for the environment.  </li>
            <li> I wish the description on this page would&#x27;ve spelled out the ingredients a little better.  </li>
            <li> Easy to wash off, does not dry out skin, seems to help improve the overall look of my skin in regards to acne</li>
            <li> The first few days I used it I was fine,</li>
            <li> However, I found the size of the dispenser too large to place next to the sink - just an item to be aware of when considering where you will store this in the bathroom or vanity.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin but its also sensitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had fairly severe acne for the past several years (I&#x27;m 19 now)</li>
            <li> I smiled one day and my face cracked down the middle.</li>
            <li> The cap now looks normal from the outside and pops off with a simple 1/4 twist making the bottle easily refillable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cap now looks normal from the outside and pops off with a simple 1/4 twist making the bottle easily refillable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the dispenser so easy and convenient, unfortunately my face has suffered dramatically.</li>
            <li> Drill two holes at the top of the canister, the first large (for adding soap) and a second small hole for ventilation.  </li>
            <li> I put this dispenser in my shower since I didn&#x27;t love the idea of everyone seeing my face wash in plain sight.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many acne products in the past, and while some helped more than others, this one is really a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it, but hope that Clearasil will revamp their scents or come out with some new ones.</li>
            <li> Indeed, it&#x27;s one of those things you don&#x27;t know you need until you try it, and then find out you can no longer live without it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Seems to come back on quickly and be ready to dispense in a short period of time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;With such an easy application method and overall positive results, you can expect me to be using Clearasil&#x27;s Perfectawash Automatic Face Wash Dispenser in the future.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> An addition to the above points: this product does dry out my skin a little more than is comfortable for me.</li>
            <li> An addition to the above points: this product does dry out my skin a little more than is comfortable for me.</li>
            <li> Dose\\&quot;  that Clearsil science knows the right amount of product is key to clear skin...  </li>
            <li> I only have acne when I eat too much chocolate, which is not very often, so I can&#x27;t see myself keeping this permanently filled with acne cleanser,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a small unit though, so you do need to make room on your counter for it.  </li>
            <li> I am always in a rush when showering, so not having to open the cap of my face wash is a plus I am willing to pay.  </li>
            <li> used the face wash for the last 2 weeks I can say that it has been very gentle for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe they will make a new formula for sensitive skin?  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Super fruits\\&quot; smells a bit better/sweeter but still not much like any fruit I&#x27;ve ever seen.  </li>
            <li> This product has only made me break out (much) more after less than a week of use.</li>
            <li> I have found, personally, that honey has worked more for me and it a lot less drying.</li>
            <li> Trying to find the refills in stores is a little hard-item not that available yet.</li>
            <li> I have used other battery powered soap dispensers before, this one works very well, the inferred sensor is instant feeding soap without waiting, a check valve prevents the soap from returning into the tank so you always have a quick response.</li>
            <li> and I am still seeing breakouts which don&#x27;t usually clear up in 12 hours.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt her skin, but it didn&#x27;t clear up her Acne.  </li>
            <li> If you do, stay clear from it.</li>
            <li> but this issue is easily fixed by turning the dispenser off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> Clearasil&#x27;s face wash so far is doing all of that and is meeting my expectations.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The sensor on the dispenser is fairly sensitive so it will go off even when you don&#x27;t put your hand underneath it.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> As someone with sensitive skin, the two bottles of face wash did not cause any breakouts or reactions.</li>
            <li> The dispenser&#x27;s sensor is quite sensitive and often pumps out unwanted face wash whenever a hand is near it.</li>
            <li> The unit motion sensor functions well--it dispenses the soap with a close range wave of the hand but does not misfire if the motion occurs farther away from the unit.  </li>
            <li> Automatic Face Wash Refill Soothing Plant Extracts Ultra Rapid Action Face Wash Salicylic Acid 2% Acne Medication (5 fl Ounce)]]  </li>
            <li> I decided to forgo tape and avoided filling the dispenser completely.  </li>
            <li> but they haven&#x27;t gone away completely.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work at all, it&#x27;s really just a marketing campaign with a generic paste they try to sell as treatment.</li>
            <li> But at the same time, do you really need it?  </li>
            <li> So far it has done just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One thing not on my list so far is \\&quot;CLAY\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> One thing not on my list so far is \\&quot;CLAY\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Especially at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Clearsil paid too much money to their marketing folks and not enough on engineering...</li>
            <li> Oddly enough it is cheaper to buy the whole setup vs buying just the refills I have found from looking around online.</li>
            <li> As a 13 year old girl I have acne.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to worry about adding anything to this order, it comes complete.  </li>
            <li> The individual refills to say that they contain salicylic acid, but there only 2 different refills available - both of which come with the dispensor when you buy it.  </li>
            <li> Would not recommend for those sensitive to dyes and perfumes.</li>
            <li> and so far nothing I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> The soap&#x27;s active ingredient is 2% salicylic acid, which is a mild anti-acne agent that isn&#x27;t too drying.  </li>
            <li> Note that at the time of writing this review, purchasing two soap refills costs two dollars less than purchasing the full unit with two refills.]  </li>
            <li> I am long past my acne stage in life, but I&#x27;ve found this to be a fast and easy way to wash my face after washing my hands.</li>
            <li> Overall decent product with novelty dispenser.</li>
            <li> The unit is generally sturdy, but is completely made out of plastic--</li>
            <li> I can tell, though, that it would be a lot better for younger and less dry skin than my sixty-year-old face sports.</li>
            <li> It makes it very convenient, especially if you have younger folks in the home who are concerned about their complexion.  </li>
            <li> I really hope Clearasil stands behind supporting this product, because they really do have a winner on their hands.  </li>
            <li> My main concern is whether or not Clearasil is committed to this product for long term sustainability.  </li>
            <li> The dispenser definitely works as advertised and the soap is reasonably effective (along with the other usual anti-acne measures).  </li>
            <li> Also be aware that in addition to the salicylic acid, both bottles contain methylparaben a commonly used chemical preservative used in cosmetics that is readily absorb through the skin and which some scientific studies say may disrupt the bodies endocrine system.</li>
            <li> I would steer clear of this product, I will no longer use anything Clearasil especially after they denied my review of this product for no reason..</li>
            <li> However I do not really like how much the dispenser dispenses per use.</li>
            <li> Only problem is sometimes would get product dispensed when setting something near dispenser.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;One con, besides the refils being clearasil only, is that on my unit the sensor seemed almost too sensitive.  </li>
            <li> So sensitive that I can&#x27;t actually wear makeup without my eyes feeling like they&#x27;re burning out of my sockets.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has allergic reactions to salicylic acid, so I assumed there would be a soap for sensitive skin like the regular clearasil makes.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and I can use salicylic acid products without over-drying or irritation, but I find it necessary to rotate products from time to time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused by that, but it doesn&#x27;t cause any more accidents</li>
            <li> Assuming that this will work, you&#x27;d have to be very careful to avoid damaging the container or the lid--if there is a compromise in the seal the whole system will leak.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about this feature is that it is super sensitive and will go out when I brush my teeth</li>
            <li> The sensor in it is real sensitive so be careful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure if any of this is really worth it.  </li>
            <li> Are THE most common active ingredients in Acne products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it is cleaner and clear BUT it is also so dry.</li>
            <li> , I hope that they (or another company) may come out with a face wash for sensitive or dry skin too!</li>
            <li> The green and pink liquids are pretty similar and they last quite a bit.</li>
            <li> The low-waste dispensing system is offset by the fact that you can&#x27;t refill the dispenser from a large bottle, but you have to buy small refill bottles.</li>
            <li> The only soap that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin is a locally handmade soap in my area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But in our household, there was no major outbreak while using this product, and the concensus was that the cleanser did improve complexions a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s not advertised on the packaging, this product also has a very, very mild moisturizer to help keep the acids drying effect at bay; you can faintly feal it as you wash your face</li>
            <li> Even moving the unit slightly would sometimes dispense it unexpectedly.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint really is it very drying</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides others in the household who have had their acne helped by Perfecta, my main attraction was a cool soap dispenser that I was hopeful to find a way to refill with less expensive soap.  </li>
            <li> why I only used it once a day other than the recommended two)Then the last day I used it before bed</li>
            <li> you do not harshly react to the Salicylic Acid in the soap; marked by red - dry skin, and you want to maximize effect, try to leave a tiny bit of the product behind as you rinse(but</li>
            <li> It worked well enough that I didn&#x27;t have the expected puddles of soap accumulating in front of the dispenser.  </li>
            <li> M. Caylor left a comment at the end of my review, noting that there are ways to &#x27;hack&#x27; the system and refill the empty soap canisters, thereby saving a lot of money.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t realize that this contained acne fighting ingredients when I requested this item from Amazon Vine and perhaps my skin is sensitive but this really really dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> They wouldn&#x27;t have been in business this long if their products didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> The product did not clear up my acne at all.</li>
            <li> Plain old cellophane tape works, but may not stick well if you have some soap residue at the opening.</li>
            <li> being said, this soap was no different from any other store-bought chemical soap I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> just dry</li>
            <li> I am an older Acne sufferer who didn&#x27;t start with Acne until my late 20&#x27;s and it has continued into my 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with the actual product itself is that it dried out my skin a lot.</li>
            <li> Words like Soothing Plant Extract might make it seem less abrasive, but those were just names to describe the extra aromatic features of the soap.  </li>
            <li> but luckily it isn&#x27;t as noticeable as before, maybe this was just a random occurrence</li>
            <li> I only gave it for stars because it does dry my hands and face out a little bit.</li>
            <li> the next few my skin was terribly dry</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this either, but it involves prying off the bottom lid with a flat tool (a small screw driver or utility knife), refilling the container, and popping the lid back on.  </li>
            <li> my skin isn&#x27;t overly sensitive just a bit dry and oily, I don&#x27;t want to drive anyone away from this product just for warn people as to what might/can happen, it&#x27;s not a wonderful feeling being stuck inside all day not wanting people to see what this did to my face, just a warning to people who might have sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> You shouldn&#x27;t fill the syringe totally, as you need to suck out a little air form the container before you put your soap in as there&#x27;s no vent hole and you need to equalize the pressure.  </li>
            <li> I have had allergies to certain soaps and cleansers in the past and usually use the St. Ives Peach scrub formulas in my shower.  </li>
            <li> I love the automatic dispenser but the face wash itself is a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those with sensitive or delicate skin</li>
            <li> In addition, even though the bottles appear small, they last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I like not having to fumble with opening things when my hands are wet as I tend to drop them</li>
            <li> Just put your wet hand underneath and it dispenses automatically.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not really going to review the liquid inside the dispenser.  </li>
            <li> I actually like the face wash cleaner it cleared up my acne within a few days.</li>
            <li> can refill the unit with a bit of careful work.  </li>
            <li> This takes some careful work.  </li>
            <li> This takes some careful work.  </li>
            <li> the end of the day, all the marketing fluff is just that</li>
            <li> , fluff.  </li>
            <li> I had some blotchiness on my cheeks along with those obnoxious pimples that never really come to the surface.</li>
            <li> , my hands are now wet so with this Clearasil face-wash dispenser all I do now</li>
            <li> you react to the Salicylic harshly, either this product is not for you or you need to use less soap, less frequently and rinse thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I used 3 very small flat head screw drivers to carefully pry open the release tabs built into the sides of the cap;</li>
            <li> I like automatic pumps and my only complaint about them would be that I manage to trigger the pump when I am cleaning my countertops, a minor issue.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel dry or tight after a wash, just clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With two kids actively using the dispenser, this means that we went through about a cartridge per month.  </li>
            <li> My forehead and chin tend to get very dry when I use harsh soaps.</li>
            <li> - the pink one contains fruit extracts, the green a floral/herbal combination).  </li>
            <li> It looked like it had been kicked down the street by a mob.</li>
            <li> One would hope they got the dispenser down to a science by now...</li>
            <li> The soap smells a little off compared to other face soaps I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> not too dry not too oily not many complaints...and the products works</li>
            <li> It over dried my face like other products.</li>
            <li> There is nothing I hate more than a company that makes a proprietary item (dispenser in this case) and then after you get it, they stop making refills within a few months or a year.  </li>
            <li> Also the bottle takes up less space.  </li>
            <li> Throughout using this product for less than a week my acne is basically ALL GONE except for one pimple.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have to do with the product itself, but the packaging was a mess when we received this.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a little bit less on the blackhead front</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re trying to cut down on plastic waste, not become dependent on using more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all methods will take a little time/effort and trial/error on your part.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little concerned about \\&quot;the delivery system\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> , I found it a little bulky.  </li>
            <li> This is slightly inconvenient though because you have to wait for the blinking lights to stop blinking before it is ready to be used.  </li>
            <li> one crash to the floor and the unit would likely be broken.  </li>
            <li> just wanted a product that would keep the few breakouts I did get at bay,</li>
            <li> when I woke up it was COMPLETELY dried out.</li>
            <li> but I still wanted to take care of the few I had.</li>
            <li> I tried the product again one month later only to arrive at the same ugly results!</li>
            <li> Even putting a small amount of the face wash on cheeks caused a little stinging in the eyes from the strength.  </li>
            <li> No more messy makeup remover bottles and tubes.</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s hard to note improvement if there&#x27;s little to improve on.</li>
            <li> The dispenser is about 7 1/4 inches high with rounded square base that is 3 1/2 inches wide.</li>
            <li> for the actual face wash that comes with the dispenser, I was not completely impressed with it.  </li>
            <li> I also like that the refills from this product are small</li>
            <li> It did dry out my skin pretty awfully though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> HARD:  </li>
            <li> And the refills ARE hard to find.</li>
            <li> And the refills ARE hard to find.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to say whether or not it would work for anyone else.</li>
            <li> The cartridges are not refillable and the refills--at least as of the date of the writing of this review--are expensive(see alternatives below).  </li>
            <li> Without the challenge of a serious acne problem to test this on, it was hard to gauge its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Im also a big fan of Proactive but its so expensive!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, refills are hard to find and not cheap.</li>

            <li> Seriously, it&#x27;s been used for generations on skin.  </li>
            <li> Formula-wise, the cleaner is a very standard 2% BHA based surfactant base but a few extract thrown in there for window addressing.  </li>

            <li> Not a good idea for a soap product.  </li>
            <li> The sad fact is it seems to be disconnected, at least that is what the company sites states.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the only product that truely clears the face. I have tried many products but this is the BEST!!</li>
            <li> The most attractive feature about Clearasil&#x27;s Perfectawash is the fact that it is completely hands free! I hate it when I have to mess with caps and squeeze to get what I need out of containers. It can be especially hard for someone who wear contacts, for I take them out before I wash my face and am so blind that I find myself trying to do everything one handed and blind. This feature is so wonderful because all I have to do is hold out my hand and the perfect face wash amount is dispensed. The only complaint I have about this feature is that it is super sensitive and will go out when I brush my teeth but this issue is easily fixed by turning the dispenser off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used the face wash for the last 2 weeks I can say that it has been very gentle for my sensitive skin. Easy to wash off, does not dry out skin, seems to help improve the overall look of my skin in regards to acne and it comes in nice smelling wash. I always have issues finding products that do not over dry my skin but that will also work effectively. Clearasil&#x27;s face wash so far is doing all of that and is meeting my expectations. You can&#x27;t expect miracles but I do see a 60% improvement over my last brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With such an easy application method and overall positive results, you can expect me to be using Clearasil&#x27;s Perfectawash Automatic Face Wash Dispenser in the future.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to get this product to try! I love the fact that you don&#x27;t have to open or unscrew a top off. Your hands never have to touch the dispenser while washing your face. The fact that it has different types and scents of cleanser is a plus. The size is perfect for sitting on the counter top, close to the sink. The sensor in it is real sensitive so be careful.</li>
            <li> This product has only made me break out (much) more after less than a week of use. I tried the product again one month later only to arrive at the same ugly results!</li>
            <li> I agree with another reviewer in that this isn&#x27;t a &#x27;must have&#x27; product, but is a wonderful convenience. I am long past my acne stage in life, but I&#x27;ve found this to be a fast and easy way to wash my face after washing my hands. The dispenser is well made and easy to use while taking up the minimal amount of space. It is motion controlled which means depending where you put it you may get some &#x27;accidental discharges&#x27;. There are several washes to choose from and all tned you leave you feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> My teenager loves uses it every day and her acne is gone and has not come back.</li>
            <li> A review from my wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that this product is hands free!! I love being able to put my hand under it and have a good amount of face wash placed in my hand.  I tend to overuse my face wash, leaving me buying more than I really need.  This stops me from doing that!&lt;br /&gt;The sensor on the dispenser is fairly sensitive so it will go off even when you don&#x27;t put your hand underneath it.  This can be avoided by turning the dispenser off and turning it back on when you want to use it.  This is slightly inconvenient though because you have to wait for the blinking lights to stop blinking before it is ready to be used.  This is just a little annoyance compared to how it dispenses the perfect amount of face wash and saves me money considering I&#x27;m not wasting any face wash.&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual face wash that comes with the dispenser, I was not completely impressed with it.  I have sensitive skin and it was gentle enough to use on my sensitive skin, which was nice.  However, it did nothing to help my acne.  Granted, I used it once a day for a couple months and didn&#x27;t see any differences.  Perhaps if I used it in the morning and at night and for an extended period of time, my results regarding my acne would be different.  I&#x27;m just hesitant to stray away from my current face wash as it has been working quite well for me.  For the price and the awesomeness of the dispenser, I&#x27;d consider it a good buy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since December and I really like the dispenser. The option to turn the motion detector on and off is great if you&#x27;re like me, swinging your hands around while washing them at the sink. The face wash itself is a very drying, I have mixed skin, some parts dry and some oily and this dried it out a bit when used twice a day, but it&#x27;s nice when I need a good cleaning if I follow up with rich moisturizer after. The green and pink liquids are pretty similar and they last quite a bit. I like not having to fumble with opening things when my hands are wet as I tend to drop them a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those with sensitive or delicate skin I wouldn&#x27;t suggest these as they are strong, these will never get rid of your skin issues the way a trip to the dermatologist will.</li>
            <li> I love the automatic dispenser but the face wash itself is a little disappointing. I&#x27;ve been using the product for just over one month and I am still seeing breakouts which don&#x27;t usually clear up in 12 hours. If Clearasil comes out with a different strength I would consider trying the product again.</li>
            <li> The Clearail Perfectawash Automatic Face Wash Dispenser makes washing the face fun! I love that the dispenser pumps out the right amount of face wash. No more messy makeup remover bottles and tubes. This product seems much more sanitary, as it prevents the spreading of germs, that cause pimples, from the tube to the face.  The face washes included with the dispenser have nice scents and are not drying. As someone with sensitive skin, the two bottles of face wash did not cause any breakouts or reactions. In addition, even though the bottles appear small, they last for a long time.  I would recommend this product, as it had only one fault. The dispenser&#x27;s sensor is quite sensitive and often pumps out unwanted face wash whenever a hand is near it.</li>
            <li> The Clearasil Perfect Wash Automatic Face Wash Dispenser and Refill  is an acne face washing system that works well and will appeal to adolescents.  The dispenser is about 7 1/4 inches high with rounded square base that is 3 1/2 inches wide. It  has an on-off switch in the back and a motion sensor in the front.  It is a reasonably attractive unit with a mallard-like profile that sits easily atop a counter or on the back of a sink. Quite happily, batteries are included.  Once you snap on the soap cartridge and flip the switch to the on position, the unit dispenses soap in nickel-sized spurts.  The unit motion sensor functions well--it dispenses the soap with a close range wave of the hand but does not misfire if the motion occurs farther away from the unit.  It worked well enough that I didn&#x27;t have the expected puddles of soap accumulating in front of the dispenser.  The soap cartridge refills that come with the unit are of two varieties: Superfruit Splash and Soothing Plant Extracts.  Both kinds of soap have different pleasant, but slightly perfumey, fragrances.  The soap&#x27;s active ingredient is 2% salicylic acid, which is a mild anti-acne agent that isn&#x27;t too drying.  On the positive side, my kids seem to love this unit and it has encouraged them to wash their face twice per day. The dispenser definitely works as advertised and the soap is reasonably effective (along with the other usual anti-acne measures).  On the downside, the size of a soap cartridge is only 5 ounces.  With two kids actively using the dispenser, this means that we went through about a cartridge per month.  The cartridges are not refillable and the refills--at least as of the date of the writing of this review--are expensive(see alternatives below).  [click here for pricing: [[ASIN:B005QZQ9IG Clearasil PerfectaWash Automatic Face Wash Refill Soothing Plant Extracts Ultra Rapid Action Face Wash Salicylic Acid 2% Acne Medication (5 fl Ounce)]]  Note that at the time of writing this review, purchasing two soap refills costs two dollars less than purchasing the full unit with two refills.]  It would have been nice if Clearasil allowed for refilling of the cartridges.  This might save the customer a little money and would be better for the environment.  The unit is generally sturdy, but is completely made out of plastic--one crash to the floor and the unit would likely be broken.  On the whole, this is a reasonable unit for promoting hygiene for your kids.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey for what it is, but soap+technology seems to increase interest in face washing for my kids.  That in and of itself makes this a useful investment.  ********************  ALTERNATIVES TO BUYING REFILLS/SOAP HACKS:  M. Caylor left a comment at the end of my review, noting that there are ways to &#x27;hack&#x27; the system and refill the empty soap canisters, thereby saving a lot of money.  Most of this information comes from YouTube how-to videos regarding the Lysol Healthy Touch Hand Soap system ([[ASIN:B004QX68SK Lysol Healthy Touch Hand Soap, Starter Kit Stainless, Aloe, 8.50-Ounce]])and all methods will take a little time/effort and trial/error on your part.  Whether this is worth it or not depends on how much energy you want to invest in the system.  WARNING: None of these methods comes with a guarantee.  If you decide to try them realize that the replacement soap will need to have a similar viscosity to the Clearasil brand--if not you&#x27;ll gum up the works.  Moreover, there may be a danger of building up soap residue over time which may also compromise the system. (One website recommended that you only reuse containers twice for this reason.  Also, if you will have to find a similar soap (2% salicylic acid) if you want to retain the acne fighting properties of the Clearasil product...  1) EASY:  Drill two holes at the top of the canister, the first large (for adding soap) and a second small hole for ventilation.  You can then fill up an empty ketchup dispenser or syringe with soap and refill the canister from the top.  This one is a no-brainer, but does leave you with an open system and the possibility of spills. If you want to seal the container, you can use tape.  Plain old cellophane tape works, but may not stick well if you have some soap residue at the opening. Duct tape works better, but is not so esthetically pleasing.  This is the only hack I tried and works perfectly.  I decided to forgo tape and avoided filling the dispenser completely.  Using an empty ketchup dispenser makes refills easy.  2) MODERATE:  I haven&#x27;t tried this on the Clearasil product, but one video showed how to refill the Lysol product by using a 60 milliliter syringe from a medical supply store.  You cut an angled groove on the end and shove the tip into the hole in the base of the refill container.  Once in you have to angle the syringe a bit to push away the gasket and refill.  You shouldn&#x27;t fill the syringe totally, as you need to suck out a little air form the container before you put your soap in as there&#x27;s no vent hole and you need to equalize the pressure.  The authors suggest that you put your replacement soap in a bowl and suck it into the syringe from there.  I didn&#x27;t try this as I don&#x27;t have a 60 milliliter syringe handy and, even though it isn&#x27;t evident in the video, it strikes me as being a bit messy (I imagine if I did this I&#x27;d be able to get the soap into the container, but I&#x27;d have soap all over the place as well).  But, assuming it works for the Clearasil product, it&#x27;s a good way to refill without having to damage the container at all.  3) HARD:  I haven&#x27;t tried this either, but it involves prying off the bottom lid with a flat tool (a small screw driver or utility knife), refilling the container, and popping the lid back on.  Assuming that this will work, you&#x27;d have to be very careful to avoid damaging the container or the lid--if there is a compromise in the seal the whole system will leak.  I&#x27;m still not sure if any of this is really worth it.  The fact is, thatif you buy a simple soap pump you can fill the thing up with any soap that you desire.  Sure, it doesn&#x27;t have the high-technology appeal/auto-dispensing properties of the Perfectawash, but the soap works just the same...</li>
            <li> I used this for about 3 months. It did seem to work..some. It was a bit drying, though. I have found, personally, that honey has worked more for me and it a lot less drying. I had completly switched to honey. I even tried mixing the two together - it still didn&#x27;t make any different. I suppose Salicylic Acid is not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, it is not a terrible product. I just feel there are better out there and the automatic dispenser is great.</li>
            <li> The idea of this product is excellent, a quick dispenser for when you need to wash your face.  However, I found the size of the dispenser too large to place next to the sink - just an item to be aware of when considering where you will store this in the bathroom or vanity.  The product itself is a bit harsh for non-acne troubled skin since it contains 2% SA.  My concern is the strength of this wash being so close to the eyes.  Even putting a small amount of the face wash on cheeks caused a little stinging in the eyes from the strength.  For those with mild to severe acne, this may not be an issue for you.</li>
            <li> ...that they are going to be making different washing formulations for this. I only have acne when I eat too much chocolate, which is not very often, so I can&#x27;t see myself keeping this permanently filled with acne cleanser, but I really do like the convenience and sleekness of the dispenser. Yes, there are a lot of soap dispensers coming out now. The company that recognizes that people only want one dispenser (or, at most, two) but they want to be able to change out the types of liquid it dispenses could really have something going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the Soothing Plant Extracts one so far, and it feels good on my skin and really cleans. I can tell, though, that it would be a lot better for younger and less dry skin than my sixty-year-old face sports. How nice it would be if they&#x27;d release a formulation of cleanser/exfoliator/toner for older skin, too. Or perhaps a third party would make refills for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope the batteries that came with it last a good while. That would be my only reason for not using this dispenser on a regular basis, if it eats batteries. I can&#x27;t see that it would, though.</li>
            <li> I truly enjoy this product for ease of use and for the fresh, clean feeling that one gets from the cleansing formula included int he package.  My main concern is whether or not Clearasil is committed to this product for long term sustainability.  Are they going to keep providing refills for the product, or is it going to be phased out?  There is nothing I hate more than a company that makes a proprietary item (dispenser in this case) and then after you get it, they stop making refills within a few months or a year.  I really hope Clearasil stands behind supporting this product, because they really do have a winner on their hands.  The face wash is smooth, refreshing, and makes your face feel \\&quot;cleaner.\\&quot;  It makes it very convenient, especially if you have younger folks in the home who are concerned about their complexion.  Overall, a great item.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have acne but my skin does get blackheads and occasional zits, plus I love the feeling of having my face clean and fresh.  I have had allergies to certain soaps and cleansers in the past and usually use the St. Ives Peach scrub formulas in my shower.  I put this dispenser in my shower since I didn&#x27;t love the idea of everyone seeing my face wash in plain sight.  I had it on automatic at first but accidentally dispensed it when reaching for my shampoo a couple of times so now I just turn it on when needed which is not an inconvenience at all.  The wash itself leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh and I have noticed a little bit less on the blackhead front but they haven&#x27;t gone away completely.  The best news is that my skin doesn&#x27;t break out into a rash or turn red which some products have done in the past.  I also like that the refills from this product are small so I don&#x27;t have to worry about disposing of huge plastic jugs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last two weeks and have had no blemishes.  I tend to have acne along my jawline and it is painful and embarassing.  No breakouts in the area since starting this cleanser and it isn&#x27;t drying.  I&#x27;m a little concerned about \\&quot;the delivery system\\&quot;.  Its a little weighty for keeping in my shower, perfect for the countertop tho.  It would be awesome for me if it was slender enough to fit my shower rack because that is where I wash my face.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this idea. I have an automatic dispenser just like this but for hand soap. For face wash, this is a perfect idea since it&#x27;s easier to have the thing dispense it to you instead of having to fumble with the face wash tube and all of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize that this contained acne fighting ingredients when I requested this item from Amazon Vine and perhaps my skin is sensitive but this really really dried out my skin. I don&#x27;t have problems with acne, just dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I do love this idea and I know Clearasil is mostly known for fighting acne, I hope that they (or another company) may come out with a face wash for sensitive or dry skin too!</li>
            <li> If your one of those folks who because of time constraints have continually put off a to visit your dermatologist, then Clearasil&#x27;s PerfectaWash may be just the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Designed to treat pimples and restore your skin the handy automatic dispenser gives you just the right amount of product to wash you face.  Set up of the dispenser entails nothing more than installing the batteries and placing one of the two product bottles included in the kit on the dispenser. - the pink one contains fruit extracts, the green a floral/herbal combination).  Because the primary blemish fighting ingredient in both bottles is good old salicylic acid, which causes skin to shed more readily, folks with sensitive skin may experience some redness/dryness from using it, as I did.  My adult son, on the other hand used it, experienced no redness and had very good results.  He has been plagued by breakouts since he was in his teens (he is now in his 40&#x27;s), had tried a multitude of products over the years and the results he experienced with this product was definitely better than average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of it exfoliating properties, I would definitely recommend the use of moisturizer and/or a sunscreen after using it. Also be aware that in addition to the salicylic acid, both bottles contain methylparaben a commonly used chemical preservative used in cosmetics that is readily absorb through the skin and which some scientific studies say may disrupt the bodies endocrine system. Even if you decide to substitute another skin care product, the Clearasil automatic dispenser alone is worth the purchase price. Because of the measured amount it dispenses you will probably save enough money by not overusing another costly skin care product to justify the cost of the dispenser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never using another face wash again. This is the PERFECT product! It smells amazing and makes your skin feel wonderful and really does deliver the perfect dose.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work at all, it&#x27;s really just a marketing campaign with a generic paste they try to sell as treatment. Not only did it not help at all with acne, but I actually think it made it worse.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many acne products in the past, and while some helped more than others, this one is really a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product is really nice. I am an older Acne sufferer who didn&#x27;t start with Acne until my late 20&#x27;s and it has continued into my 30&#x27;s. The gadget is really easy to use. Just put your wet hand underneath and it dispenses automatically. I am currently using the green refill and it smells gorgeous. It also works well to keep my Acne under control. My teenage son also uses the product and likes it too. Maybe he&#x27;ll start to steal my moisturisers too!  Overall excellent product, convenient, smells great, works well. What more could you ask for!</li>
            <li> I like the hands-free dispenser, although I wish it was a bit narrower so that it would fit better in my shower.  The biggest problem with it is the scent of the wash itself.  The green \\&quot;Soothing plant extracts\\&quot; smells very medicinal, not the mint or aloe the color and name would lead you to think.  The \\&quot;Super fruits\\&quot; smells a bit better/sweeter but still not much like any fruit I&#x27;ve ever seen.  I would recommend it, but hope that Clearasil will revamp their scents or come out with some new ones.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to dispense liquid soap. It works very well because it dispenses the right amount of soap every time. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love being able to hold my hand out and have the soap come to me! It&#x27;s not a small unit though, so you do need to make room on your counter for it.  The refills aren&#x27;t large, but they are inexpensive to purchase separately.  It dispense a generous amount to wash your face with. If you like the idea of hands free, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea in skin care. Easy to use. didn&#x27;t care much for the fruity wash-I can&#x27;t deal with scented things that well, but the other wash that came with it is great. Trying to find the refills in stores is a little hard-item not that available yet. But Clearasil lives up to its history-clean skin w/o overdrying and keeps breakouts under control. So far so good.</li>
            <li> Clearasil makes good products.  Let&#x27;s establish that straight up.  They wouldn&#x27;t have been in business this long if their products didn&#x27;t work.  So I&#x27;m not really going to review the liquid inside the dispenser.  Instead I will focus on the dispenser itself.&lt;br /&gt;Straight off the bat, I found it a little bulky.  My bathroom sink isn&#x27;t huge so I found it getting in the way often.  That lead to another problem of it dispensing itself without a hand there to catch it!  The sensitivity was pretty high at first, but it seems to have lessened now (?).  I&#x27;m confused by that, but it doesn&#x27;t cause any more accidents so I can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;It does respond well to being turned on and off.  Seems to come back on quickly and be ready to dispense in a short period of time.  So it&#x27;s ok to bring it with you when you travel.&lt;br /&gt;Also the price isn&#x27;t too high.  But at the same time, do you really need it?  It&#x27;s cool to just have to put your hand under it to get the cleaner, but I find a bottle to be just as handy.  Also the bottle takes up less space.  So while it&#x27;s neat and all, I doubt I&#x27;ll buy refills once I run out.</li>
            <li> I actually like the face wash cleaner it cleared up my acne within a few days. However I do not really like how much the dispenser dispenses per use. If it dispensed half of the amount it would be perfect. However, it shoots out big globs which is more than enough need for a face wash. And will have you buying refills after refills.</li>
            <li> SCHOOLS IN SEASON&lt;br /&gt;Salicylic Acid, Benzoyl Peroxide, Alcohol, Acetone, Resorcinol, Sulfur, glycolic acid, lactic acid. Are THE most common active ingredients in Acne products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dealing with Acne one should systematically try these ingredients finding the match for you. Most people will react negatively to at least one of these; and as you age those being effective may change too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfecta Wash uses Salicylic Acid. Salicylic Acid works mainly by controlling skin oil. Although it&#x27;s not advertised on the packaging, this product also has a very, very mild moisturizer to help keep the acids drying effect at bay; you can faintly feal it as you wash your face clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVERYONE&#x27;S DIFFERENT (really!)&lt;br /&gt;If you do not harshly react to the Salicylic Acid in the soap; marked by red - dry skin, and you want to maximize effect, try to leave a tiny bit of the product behind as you rinse(but not your dirty skin oil). The Salicylic \\&quot;Acid\\&quot; will continue to keep working while also, the moisturizer will be available to help the harshness of the acid.  This won&#x27;t work for everybody! (so don&#x27;t say this review was not helpful if this is you, you&#x27;ve been warned)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you react to the Salicylic harshly, either this product is not for you or you need to use less soap, less frequently and rinse thoroughly. You should be able to know for sure in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERSONAL REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;After many many years, I don&#x27;t have a serious Acne problem anymore, THANK GOD! I bought this with the idea of keeping the occasional zit at bay.  So far it has done just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides others in the household who have had their acne helped by Perfecta, my main attraction was a cool soap dispenser that I was hopeful to find a way to refill with less expensive soap.  I DID!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LIQUID SOAP REFILL TRICKS&lt;br /&gt;You can refill the unit with a bit of careful work.  I used 3 very small flat head screw drivers to carefully pry open the release tabs built into the sides of the cap; keeping each screw driver in place on each tap until they were all free.  This takes some careful work.  Once the cap was off there are 2 plastic tabs molded into the threads on the bottle (not the cap) that keep you from twisting the cap off.  I used a razor blade to cut them both off.  The cap now looks normal from the outside and pops off with a simple 1/4 twist making the bottle easily refillable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE FRUSTRATION&lt;br /&gt;Although you want those zits gone now, be patient and try each of the ingredients I listed.  You are almost assured to find some level of help.  One thing not on my list so far is \\&quot;CLAY\\&quot;.  Seriously, it&#x27;s been used for generations on skin.  You may just want to dig a hole to solve your Acne issues : ) or go to the craft store...to the sides of the cap; keeping each screw driver in place on each tap until they were all free.

            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this dispenser and the face wash by Clearasil. First, this is a compact product so if you have space issues, this could work for you. The face wash clicks in at the top and through the magic of the sensor light, you run your hand under the head and the exact \\&quot;dose\\&quot; dispenses. This is handy since most people manually dispense more product than needed and this product ensures you get the full number of washes you should get. Love that. It comes with two face washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the face wash itself is not harsh - the active ingedient is Salicylic Acid, which is the best and safest ingredient for keeping skin clear and healthy at any age. I didn&#x27;t feel dry or tight after a wash, just clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve said at the top of this review, I can&#x27;t say enough about this face wash and dispenser. Try it. You&#x27;ll love it! Especially at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love the design of the automatic dispenser and it works pretty well.  Two bottles of Clearasil were included, but I don&#x27;t like the smell of Clearasil so I think after I finish them, I would refill the dispenser with my favorite soap instead.  The dispenser would be perfect for a public bathroom where the owner doesn&#x27;t want to have any permanent fixture on the wall.</li>
            <li> The perfect skin cleanser is effective, gentle, doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, and is inexpensive. Skin products can break the bank, and a lot of them don&#x27;t deliver on their promises. Our family of five includes three adolescents/young adults, and we&#x27;ve all tried this to see if it&#x27;s worth recommending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that the three family members who would most likely be affected by acne have, on the whole, very good skin. So, it&#x27;s hard to note improvement if there&#x27;s little to improve on. Nonetheless:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The dispenser comes with two different product containers: Superfruit Splash and Plant Extracts. We tried the Splash first. It has a pleasant aroma, but is a bit drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The dispenser does deliver an appropriate amount of cleanser. This is good because it&#x27;s often easy to waste a lot of cleanser if you&#x27;re not careful. No worries on that score here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Without the challenge of a serious acne problem to test this on, it was hard to gauge its effectiveness. But in our household, there was no major outbreak while using this product, and the concensus was that the cleanser did improve complexions a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. This doesn&#x27;t have to do with the product itself, but the packaging was a mess when we received this. It looked like it had been kicked down the street by a mob. I was a bit concerned that the casing would be cracked, and therefore useless, but everything worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. These types of auto-dispensers are becoming popular--we also tried, through Vine, the Lysol kitchen system. Unfortunately, refills are hard to find and not cheap. The low-waste dispensing system is offset by the fact that you can&#x27;t refill the dispenser from a large bottle, but you have to buy small refill bottles. We&#x27;re trying to cut down on plastic waste, not become dependent on using more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. I hope someone posts a review that says whether or not the product is effective on acne outbreaks. In the meantime, it would be great if Clearasil offered a refill for this dispenser that addressed a non-acne sufferer consumer base. That way, everyone in the family could use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. An addition to the above points: this product does dry out my skin a little more than is comfortable for me. And the refills ARE hard to find. So I revised my rating to 2 instead of 3 stars.Clearasil offered a refill for this dispenser that addressed a non-acne sufferer consumer base.

            <li> Dispenser works as advertised.  Only problem is sometimes would get product dispensed when setting something near dispenser.  Face wash itself seemed to work well for my teenage daughter.  Overall decent product with novelty dispenser.</li>
            <li> I am always in a rush when showering, so not having to open the cap of my face wash is a plus I am willing to pay.  Formula-wise, the cleaner is a very standard 2% BHA based surfactant base but a few extract thrown in there for window addressing.  It&#x27;s a very basic cleanser, nothing special at all.  The dispenser sold me more than the cleanser itself.  But to my dismay, the amount dispensed is anything but \\&quot;Perfect Dose\\&quot; as Clearsil claims.  Even after sufficient amount of priming, the dispenser would squirt just a pea size cleaner on one actuation and a giant puddle on the next actuation.  This compounded my dissatisfaction because the packaging made a big fuss on the \\&quot;Perfect Dose\\&quot;  that Clearsil science knows the right amount of product is key to clear skin...  Clearsil paid too much money to their marketing folks and not enough on engineering...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, all the marketing fluff is just that, fluff.  The parent company Reckitt Benckiser tried to market the dispenser in multiple ways, making no-touch products under Lysol as well.  One would hope they got the dispenser down to a science by now...but I guess not.</li>
            <li> This dispenser is a neat little gadget, but I think it would be more useful for young folks.  It takes up bathroom space (a precious commodity where I live), and requires you use the special-designed refills.  If it was a bit more expensive and didn&#x27;t use proprietary inserts, sure, I&#x27;d say go for it.  I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a way to jury rig stuff so you can make your own useable refills, but that requires more motivation than I have.  Daily face washing goes through the product fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser itself is pleasant, not strong scented, and works decently, being from Clearasil.  This is why I think it&#x27;d be great for young kids who are just starting to worry about washing their face, especially since the motion detector makes it a bit snazzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One con, besides the refils being clearasil only, is that on my unit the sensor seemed almost too sensitive.  Even moving the unit slightly would sometimes dispense it unexpectedly.  I turn mine off after each use now, but that seems to defy the point of it being hands-free, somewhat.</li>
            <li> As I said it is one of the best products I have used, I got mine from Five Below and it works great, lasts a very long time and cleans and prevents acne. The sad fact is it seems to be disconnected, at least that is what the company sites states. Oddly enough it is cheaper to buy the whole setup vs buying just the refills I have found from looking around online.</li>
            <li> This product can not go into the shower....  Not a good idea for a soap product.  I wish I had know that.</li>
            <li> It was an ok product. I heard of it from a friend and gave it a try. I only bought it once never bought a refil after that. It over dried my face like other products. I guess the only feature was the automatic dispenser which saved me from over using it.</li>
            <li> A wonderful appliance to have in the home, and not too shabby to look at. This is the way all daily products should be served up in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Just like it says it&#x27;s all there. Works great Got here in 2 days and I would defiantly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The dispenser itself was great. It worked perfectly and I love the idea of having an automatic dispenser. The product did work because it did start to get rid of my acne. I would definitely recommend this to my friend. The only problem I have with the actual product itself is that it dried out my skin a lot.</li>
            <li> I have been an loyal clearasil user since I was 18, and this does not dissapoint! I dont have acne, but I do have prone areas where blackheads live, and this works!  I love the fact that it is hands free, and gives you the actual portion you need each time.  I am a permanent switcher and recommmnd anyone tp try.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product, I used it once a day for a week and here are the results:  Pros: Easy to set up and use  Face wash smelled nice  Cons: Dried out my skin horribly  Created more acne then it got rid of  Caused a rash on my face that was red and itchy.  Where to start...I didn&#x27;t have bad acne to begin with I just wanted a product that would keep the few breakouts I did get at bay, The first few days I used it I was fine, the next few my skin was terribly dry afterwards(hence why I only used it once a day other than the recommended two)Then the last day I used it before bed I noticed horrible red itchy rashes on my chin area...it basically destroyed the skin around that area I am still dealing with peeling and itchiness and a lot more pimples then I originally had, but luckily it isn&#x27;t as noticeable as before, maybe this was just a random occurrence and my skin couldn&#x27;t handle it even tho my skin isn&#x27;t overly sensitive just a bit dry and oily, I don&#x27;t want to drive anyone away from this product just for warn people as to what might/can happen, it&#x27;s not a wonderful feeling being stuck inside all day not wanting people to see what this did to my face, just a warning to people who might have sensitive skin...I would steer clear of this product, I will no longer use anything Clearasil especially after they denied my review of this product for no reason..I didn&#x27;t break any guidelines...guess they want to keep the good reviews pouring in to make the product look better.</li>
            <li> Great soap dispenser, can&#x27;t really beat the price.  The product itself didn&#x27;t work for my wife, but that&#x27;s not saying the product doesn&#x27;t work for others.  It didn&#x27;t hurt her skin, but it didn&#x27;t clear up her Acne.  That all being said, i would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> I brought this about a month ago from Walmart and I really like it. I have very oily skin but its also sensitive. I only gave it for stars because it does dry my hands and face out a little bit. After I wash my face I follow with Olay lotion and Jergens (a must have) on my hands. Im also a big fan of Proactive but its so expensive! And this is just as good and half the price! 04/21/12 Im back with to up date. After about two months I decide to part ways with this product. I smiled one day and my face cracked down the middle. Lol not to mention my hands look like aligator gloves after each use. This was not for me!</li>
            <li> I love the dispenser not having to open and close the bottle is a time saver, by seconds but still a time saver. I like the smells of the product but they dont seem very strong and havent really prevented acne or help to clear it up - it didnt make me break out. I will continue  to still use the product as it keeps my skin smooth, but i will try using it once a day instead of twice and add my old regime back in once a day, maybe that will help with the acne.&lt;br /&gt;I really dont like that the way it is designed you have to use the face wash it comes with...</li>
            <li> After seeing juicystar07 review this on Youtube I was intrigued although it was a sponsored video. My curiousity got the best of me and I ordered it from Amazon and got it on Monday,January 9, 2011. Every morning and every night since then I have been using it (The Superfruit Splash one which smells fantastic btw.) As a 13 year old girl I have acne. I had some blotchiness on my cheeks along with those obnoxious pimples that never really come to the surface. Additonally, I had a couple pimples on my forehead and one on my nose. Although my acne isn&#x27;t that severe my skin was my biggest insecurity. As I said, there was one pimple on my nose. I used the that night and when I woke up it was COMPLETELY dried out. Throughout using this product for less than a week my acne is basically ALL GONE except for one pimple. This is the best my skin has been in months. I use the cleanser accompanied by the pHisoderm oil-free moisturizer too. If you are a teen with combination skin and acne I really recommend it! Thanks Clearasil. (Btw, I will be posting a review on youtube soon of this product!) :)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. So sensitive that I can&#x27;t actually wear makeup without my eyes feeling like they&#x27;re burning out of my sockets. My forehead and chin tend to get very dry when I use harsh soaps. The only soap that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin is a locally handmade soap in my area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this soap was no different from any other store-bought chemical soap I&#x27;ve used. I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in my complexion or any lessening of my acne. It did dry out my skin pretty awfully though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you don&#x27;t have any skin irritations, this would work fine for you. If you do, stay clear from it. No pun intended.</li>
            <li> I like the hands free dispenser and the Clearasil soap is excellent too ! When I wash my face I like to rinse off with water first, my hands are now wet so with this Clearasil face-wash dispenser all I do now is run my hands under the dispenser and just enough soap flows out into my hands, perfect! The soap is pleasant smelling, not too strong but mild just the way I like it. The dispenser comes with two different refills so you&#x27;ll be set for a while, it also includes batteries so you don&#x27;t have to worry about adding anything to this order, it comes complete.  I have used other battery powered soap dispensers before, this one works very well, the inferred sensor is instant feeding soap without waiting, a check valve prevents the soap from returning into the tank so you always have a quick response.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of hands free dispensor and limiting the messiness of soap dishes.  But I was dissappointed to see that the dispensor only came with 2 different scented blends of soap that contained salicylic acid.  My girlfriend has allergic reactions to salicylic acid, so I assumed there would be a soap for sensitive skin like the regular clearasil makes.  But I couldn&#x27;t find any that were designed for this disspensor.  So even though the disspensor looks cool and works great, it was not great for me.  I wish the description on this page would&#x27;ve spelled out the ingredients a little better.  The individual refills to say that they contain salicylic acid, but there only 2 different refills available - both of which come with the dispensor when you buy it.  Words like Soothing Plant Extract might make it seem less abrasive, but those were just names to describe the extra aromatic features of the soap.  Maybe they will make a new formula for sensitive skin?  Hope so.</li>
            <li> I love the dispenser getting the right amount and not having to touch/squeeze there by not getting the bottle sticky and messy. Also liked the product I have normal skin not too dry not too oily not many complaints...and the products works, it is cleaner and clear BUT it is also so dry. Only complaint really is it very drying but I use a moisturizer after cleaning up so its not a big problem for me. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I like automatic pumps and my only complaint about them would be that I manage to trigger the pump when I am cleaning my countertops, a minor issue. Fun for teens to use. Great gift for a teen girl. Not so sure the scents would appeal to a teen boy as it includes a pink bottle of super fruit splash. Would not recommend for those sensitive to dyes and perfumes. Contains 2% salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> Indeed, it&#x27;s one of those things you don&#x27;t know you need until you try it, and then find out you can no longer live without it!&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my husband and he initially laughed at it (as if one couldn&#x27;t just squeeze it from a tube, right?), but once he went through the 2 reserves, he asked for more. It is really convenient to use, it&#x27;s much easier and faster to just hold your hand and get the perfect amount of face wash. Willy-nilly, I will buy it again, cause now the hubby loves it!</li>
            <li> Love it!  My daughter loves it.  Would recommend.  However, be aware that what works for one person may not work for another.</li>
            <li> I only use this in the morning and I think it does the job!!! I also use acne free kit at night and those combined got rid of my acne!!</li>
            <li> The soap smells a little off compared to other face soaps I&#x27;ve used but it does leave my face nice and clean - I like the handsfree aspect - I think I&#x27;ve been washing my face more often after having this on my coutnertop and a seperate soap in the shower.</li>
            <li> The product did not clear up my acne at all. I&#x27;ve had fairly severe acne for the past several years (I&#x27;m 19 now) and so far nothing I&#x27;ve tried has worked too well, so it&#x27;s hard to say whether or not it would work for anyone else. I guess it&#x27;s time to give in and get medicine from the dermatologist. The only reason why I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars rather than 2 is because it smells nice and it is gentle on my skin (I did use a moisturizer afterward because my skin, although oily, dries out easily). I like the hands-free aspect, but it&#x27;s not the most convenient when you have to keep all of your stuff in a cubby in a dorm bathroom.</li>
            <li> I bought this dispenser and 12 refills for it last year. My acne was moderate but I still wanted to take care of the few I had. I absolutely love the dispenser so easy and convenient, unfortunately my face has suffered dramatically. I had to discontinue use because my face has been horribly broken out since I started using it. Would not recommend for all skin types at all. I am so disappointed I may have to go to a dermatologist because of what this has done to my face, I&#x27;ve never been to one before and have had no need too. Three stars because I love the dispenser, it will never receive the other two from me because the cleanser ruined my face. Still upset I guess..</li>
            <li> I only have good things to say about the product my daughter loves it and I like the fact that it touch free, the price is the best I have found and we recived it before the date given that we were suppose to. Great Great!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. My face has cleared up so much. My dermatologist was right about this. Everyones skin is different, but out of all the face washes I have neen through this product is the best.</li>
            <li> I searched Amazon for this dispenser after buying the refill on clearance.  I have extremely sensitive skin, and I can use salicylic acid products without over-drying or irritation, but I find it necessary to rotate products from time to time.  The refill works only with the hard-to-find dispenser, so I was happy to find this great deal.  I am happy with the results, and my 17 year old son was surprised at how quickly his skin texture improved after he began using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser makes it easy to use, although the automatic dose is a little more than I need for my face since this cleanser is very sudsy!  Otherwise, I am happy with this product, and I hope I can find more refills when the time comes.</li>
