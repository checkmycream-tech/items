    <ol>
            <li>They are of excellent quality and a box lasts for months.</li>
            <li>Regardless of price (they are the cheapest), they work the best for me.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I am delighted with the pricing also.</li>
            <li>The product came in time and in good condition.</li>
            <li>Would be a good company to take off your list of vendors.</li>
            <li>.&lt;br /&gt;Are as good or better than top brands.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite place to purchase those needed items and I am glad to let anyone know this Seller is Tops!</li>
            <li>It is nice to be able to get it here and easier re-order.</li>
            <li>Why spend more?</li>
            <li>Everything is ok.</li>
            <li>These are almost as good as the best HA batteries, but at a small fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>The price is right, the delivery is quick and the ordering process is pleasant without any complications.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to order</li>
            <li>I received my package 4 days early according to the determined arrival date, but when I looked inside the bag it was sent in the box was torn apart and the batteries were lose in the bag, I&#x27;m sure the batteries are still good...</li>
            <li>They are cheap, and they work just fine.</li>
            <li>this is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are lasting very well, just as good or better than the brand name batteries.  </li>
            <li>for\\&quot; how true it is in this case.</li>
            <li>Due to the fact our daughter has hearing aids we have been using this brand with great success.</li>
            <li>the price is right.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My purchase was based on price, availability and hope for no problems as this is my first purchase</li>
            <li>installedthe first one yesterday.</li>
            <li>I normally get 5 to 6 days.</li>
            <li>They have been working well for my mother, I don&#x27;t know if they are the longest lasting, but they definitely are not the shortest, my mother gets about 1-2 days use from each battery, maybe more depending on total use.  </li>
            <li>batteries are a clear winner with our daughter and we will continue to purchase them.</li>
            <li>And... I&#x27;m still not quite sure if it might have been caused by poor connections on the battery in my aids.</li>
            <li>More than half of these were either DOA or lasted a few hours.</li>

            <li> Have had 2 batteries out of about 100 that I have used that did not last very long at all.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;These are quality batteries, but with a slightly shorter life span, in my experience, that Rayovac (by about 3 days), but about the same as what I was getting with Duracell and energizers.</li>
            <li> I received them within only a few days: 10 packs of 6 batteries each and were packaged well.</li>
            <li> Either would not work at all or died within a few hours of use.</li>

            <li> These are almost as good as the best HA batteries, but at a small fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> What can I say? They are cheap, and they work just fine. Why spend more?</li>
            <li> About half of the lot I purchased were duds lasting 1 hour to 1 day. I normally get 5 to 6 days. I am now forced to carry batteries at all times. Never again.</li>
            <li> These batteries seem to last somewhat longer than the previous hearing aid batteries I was using. I received them within only a few days: 10 packs of 6 batteries each and were packaged well. I am delighted with the pricing also. Thanks!</li>

            <li> They have been working well for my mother, I don&#x27;t know if they are the longest lasting, but they definitely are not the shortest, my mother gets about 1-2 days use from each battery, maybe more depending on total use.  I would recommend you try these batteries.</li>
            <li> My purchase was based on price, availability and hope for no problems as this is my first purchase o these from you.&lt;br /&gt;I installedthe first one yesterday.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of icell Tech batteries.  They are of excellent quality and a box lasts for months.</li>
            <li> I have returned again and again to this company to purchase iCell Tech batteries.  It is my favorite place to purchase those needed items and I am glad to let anyone know this Seller is Tops!</li>
            <li> I am happy with this purchase. Buying a future. The product came in time and in good condition. Everything is ok.</li>
            <li> These are lasting very well, just as good or better than the brand name batteries.  It will be a while before running out of batteries, but will purchase them again when needed.</li>
            <li> More than half of these were either DOA or lasted a few hours. The rest didn&#x27;t last long, so I threw them all away. Too bad-great price.</li>
            <li> When I was first fitted with hearing aids, a year ago, I started shopping for a lower priced alternative to the small packs sold in drug stores, etc. These are one of those bulk purchases I made. They work as well as the high priced, except occasionally one would die quickly (less than an hour) but I&#x27;ve gotten the habit of carrying a small container (came with my Phonak aids) with a couple spares for each side. It works and saves me a bunch of money. And... I&#x27;m still not quite sure if it might have been caused by poor connections on the battery in my aids.</li>
            <li> I received my package 4 days early according to the determined arrival date, but when I looked inside the bag it was sent in the box was torn apart and the batteries were lose in the bag, I&#x27;m sure the batteries are still good... we&#x27;ll find out.</li>
            <li> I bought a box of 60 of the size 13 and have had to throw away about eight or ten of them. Either would not work at all or died within a few hours of use. I&#x27;ve always heard \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; how true it is in this case. Would be a good company to take off your list of vendors.</li>
            <li> Regardless of price (they are the cheapest), they work the best for me. Last 2 weeks or so  .&lt;br /&gt;Are as good or better than top brands.</li>
            <li> The worst thing for a deaf person is to run out of hearing aid batteries, so buying in bulk like this is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these now for about 5 weeks now. I&#x27;ve been wearing hearing aids for about 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are quality batteries, but with a slightly shorter life span, in my experience, that Rayovac (by about 3 days), but about the same as what I was getting with Duracell and energizers. (probably closest comparison is Walgreens store brand)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, for the price, there is no comparison!</li>
            <li> like that I have them when I need them and the price is right.  Have had 2 batteries out of about 100 that I have used that did not last very long at all.  Otherwise, I like them.</li>
            <li> Easy to order and this is something that is&lt;br /&gt;hard to find.  It is nice to be able to get it here and easier re-order.</li>
