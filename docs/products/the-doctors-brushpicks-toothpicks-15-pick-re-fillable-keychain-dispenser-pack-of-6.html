            <li>Great way to carry toothpicks in the pocket or purse.</li>
            <li>Really great product.</li>
            <li>These also make great &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; gift items (stocking stuffers, etc...).</li>
            <li>It was a great idea.</li>
            <li>However the holder was great idea</li>
            <li>Toothpicks of all sorts are great cleaning aids, and have saved millions of teeth for centuries.</li>
            <li>The toothpicks themselves work great for between teeth and dentures.</li>
            <li>These picks are great,  one end is&#x27; feathered&#x27; and gets lodged food out,  even under permanent bridges.  </li>
            <li>Very handy.</li>
            <li>Therefore a good investment.</li>
            <li>I had one of these holders for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Also good for those with gum problems.  </li>
            <li>I need something handy because of bridge work that collects some foods, and Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks have a nice flexible &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; that is great for cleaning under a bridge and between teeth.</li>
            <li>My hygienist said my teeth were amazing for someone wearing braces.  </li>
            <li>I bought these knowing in advance what they were and that they weren&#x27;t quite as nice as my orginal ones but wanted the cases.</li>
            <li>quality tooth brush always handy if you have some problems in your teeth that require a tooth pick after every</li>
            <li>I have one issue - the cap turns on its own and sometime a pick will fall out.</li>
            <li>Nice to have .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a dentist, and I recommend these to patients because they are very effective, easily found in drug stores and very cheap.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this perfect example of planned obsolescence.</li>
            <li>Brush picks are really useful and the container is very handy.  </li>
            <li>They work great and fit in your shirt pocket fine</li>
            <li>I love these pics.</li>
            <li>Better than wood toothpicks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a favorite.</li>
            <li>that on some of the containers I can&#x27;t pull off the top and have to refill the container through the dispenser hole.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I feel they are more beneficial then floss.  </li>
            <li>So glad I found these.</li>
            <li>So these do help and for me work better than wood picks but</li>
            <li>I also love the batter powered Power Flosser it&#x27;s called</li>
            <li>Also I could get about 4-5 more piks into the cases without having them stop up because there was too many also.</li>
            <li>Was introduced to this product by a friend and was glad he did.  </li>
            <li>Nothing aggrevates me more than having something inbetween my teeth while you&#x27;re out to dinner and dont have floss with</li>
            <li>dispenser if perfect for the pocket, briefcase, tackle box, desk drawer, purse, travel kit, key chain,  etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the brushpicks themselves and I thought these would be a neat way to carry them and give some away.  </li>
            <li>I always keep one in the car to make sure I don&#x27;t have any food between my teeth before I go into a meeting.  </li>
            <li>I bought the holder on a keyring and love it.</li>
            <li>The 60 picks is more practical....</li>
            <li>I love to give them as gifts.</li>
            <li>I carefully removed mine from each package to test the swivel head, and each worked flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>when on the keychain, the chain easily breaks but can&#x27;t beat for the price&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly as well.</li>
            <li>I just love the way these toothpicks clean my teeth between brushings.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Keychain with brushpicks  is more for fun because you do need to buy more brushpicks for refill  after the 15 picks are used...</li>
            <li>About 3-4 of the set of 6 are fine.</li>
            <li>so no choice of colors but fine.</li>
            <li>These little keychain dispensers are awesome, too.  </li>
            <li>The keychain container is in purse and is available to me any time I need them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Treat yourself and buy a bunch of &#x27;em and enjoy.</li>
            <li>It seems so cheap</li>
            <li>Amazing how much gunk can get stuck and smelly,  try this product,  the doctor(s) who designed these picks knew how to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have found this particular product (the toothpicks in a holder), and was pleased with the quickness of the transaction.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these....very handy.</li>
            <li>Makes my teeth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a neat and clean way to carry toothpicks.</li>
            <li>Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks have helped keep my gums healthy for years, and I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>Very effective in removing food easily with minimum effort and least  amount of gum irritation.</li>
            <li>These things are the best kept secret around.</li>
            <li>but I like my old package better...</li>
            <li>It was nice to get a six pack so that I could give a couple away and still have enough to have one at the office and here and there.  </li>
            <li>In addition, now these handy carriers I can add them to all my locations without having the larger 250 plus one there.  </li>
            <li>but now they come in one color and the material is just right in terms of strength vs bendiness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was right.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s so happy now; It&#x27;s the little things in life!</li>
            <li>I actually like much better.</li>
            <li>I have bought so many different things to prod and poke between teeth that if I listed them it would take me ...</li>
            <li>they however do not do much for the upper teeth areas which floss does better if you can figure out how to pull it off.</li>
            <li>It was easy enough to get the toothpicks out.  </li>
            <li>This little &amp;#34;bullet&amp;#34; is so handy to have in your purse.</li>
            <li>I also have a huge refill pack that I use in the house and to refill my key chain.  </li>
            <li>They keep your teeth much cleaner after meals.</li>
            <li>You must check regularly to make sure the dispenser top  doesn&#x27;t rotate to the open position or the Brushpicks will fall out of the dispenser if it is hanging vertically from a key ring.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I move my purse around an unusual amount</li>
            <li>I use these picks all the  time,  I really like them.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Cant beat the price and reasonable shipping cost.</li>
            <li>but they have really held up.</li>
            <li>Clever idea and very practical</li>
            <li>Anyway still they are good just not thin enough to work between my tight teeth during brace work.</li>
            <li>This is such a cool product.  </li>
            <li>An older brace patient and</li>
            <li>Shipping it back to the U.S. would have cost more than the actual product, so I just recycled it.</li>
            <li>but  it is very sticky to open and close but very convenient in  having it ready where ever you are at work etc.</li>
            <li>the same good picks as usual</li>
            <li>These are great little toothpicks with a pick on one end and tiny brush to get in between on the other.  </li>
            <li>I also note if you refill from bottom hole instead of pulling off the top they last longer and less chance of breaking them too.</li>
            <li>Hard to find, thus pleased to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>so I was surprised to have lost it.  </li>
            <li>WOW do they work well getting between your teeth.</li>
            <li>excellent design, inexpensive, fits in a tight space, easy to open and dispense the product, all the other kinds were very uncomfortable to carry or find</li>
            <li>My 74 yr old father-in-law never leaves the house without his tube of brush picks since he can&#x27;t stand wooden tooth picks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got at least 14 year old case of 150 piks that are very close to these Doctors brand</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using The Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks Toothpicks for years, and they&#x27;re getting harder to find locally.  </li>
            <li> The little plastic dispenser is terrific, and I keep one in the glove compartment of my car.</li>
            <li> Total waste of time and energy and spoil the mission or purpose of use.aste of time and energy and spoil the mission or purpose of use.</li>
            <li> I have the key chain, bought a few for friends and take it with me everywhere.  </li>
            <li> The pick end is curved and starts out flat but then expands and has little ribs to help remove plaque.  </li>
            <li> Also lose the teeth on the other end because all they do is grab my braces when I try to use them.</li>

            <li> My only complaint is</li>
            <li> The seller either doesn&#x27;t have black or doesn&#x27;t care about customer satisfaction as when I requested they exchange my order with black ones</li>

            <li> the same good picks as usual</li>
            <li> when on the keychain, the chain easily breaks but can&#x27;t beat for the price&lt;br /&gt;Have ortho treatment so always need it</li>
            <li> Great way to carry toothpicks in the pocket or purse. I need something handy because of bridge work that collects some foods, and Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks have a nice flexible &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; that is great for cleaning under a bridge and between teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years and recently lost my dispenser.  I ordered the 6 pack since I&#x27;ll probably lose them again at some point.  When I got my order I was disappointed that it was not black as the picture on the listing indicated.  Instead, I got 4 purple and 2 red dispensers.  The seller either doesn&#x27;t have black or doesn&#x27;t care about customer satisfaction as when I requested they exchange my order with black ones they told me to return the items instead.</li>
            <li> Very handy. I leave it on my keychain. The quality from dispenser to dispenser is variable. The \\&quot;knob\\&quot; that is turned to open it can be loose or too tight, depending. About 3-4 of the set of 6 are fine.</li>
            <li> I love these pics. They keep your teeth much cleaner after meals. Therefore a good investment. I could no longer find them in retail. :0(</li>
            <li> Better than wood toothpicks. Bill</li>
            <li> This little &amp;#34;bullet&amp;#34; is so handy to have in your purse. Fits in your pocket. And is refillable! It&#x27;s a favorite.</li>
            <li> This is such a cool product.  Brush picks are really useful and the container is very handy.  When people see me pull out the dispenser, they often ask me where to get one (so I often carry an extra one to give away).  My only complaint is that on some of the containers I can&#x27;t pull off the top and have to refill the container through the dispenser hole.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a toothpick after eating.With the Brushpicks in this dispenser I have attached it to my key ring and always have one when I need it! You must check regularly to make sure the dispenser top  doesn&#x27;t rotate to the open position or the Brushpicks will fall out of the dispenser if it is hanging vertically from a key ring.</li>
            <li> Really great product. My dentist had never seen them before, and asked me to get him some, to give to his patients. These also make great &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; gift items (stocking stuffers, etc...). I only wish that I had been the one to dream them up!</li>
            <li> I had braces for 2 years and HATED using a floss threader.  I finally started using The Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks and tossed the floss threaders out.  My hygienist said my teeth were amazing for someone wearing braces.  These little keychain dispensers are awesome, too.  I bought the 6 pack to give out to my friends who wear braces.  :)</li>
            <li> I use dr picks every day. I feel they are more beneficial then floss.  The keychain container is in purse and is available to me any time I need them.  It was a great idea.</li>
            <li> Product was just as advertised.Have bought these before and am very happy with this order also</li>
            <li> excellent design, inexpensive, fits in a tight space, easy to open and dispense the product, all the other kinds were very uncomfortable to carry or find</li>
            <li> perfect for a pocket or purse&lt;br /&gt;and the brush picks couldn&#x27;t be better!&lt;br /&gt;I give them as gifts to my friends</li>
            <li> These are really great ! I had them before and could not find them until I seen on Amazon</li>
            <li> i bought these brushpick holder and leave them in purses, cars, etc.  everyone in my family is hooked on brushpicks, and this is a convenient and subtle way to carry them.</li>
            <li> I used one of these.  It was easy enough to get the toothpicks out.  However, on day 3 I went to get a toothpick and the bottom of the holder had fallen off somewhere.  I don&#x27;t think I move my purse around an unusual amount so I was surprised to have lost it.  Will try another one and see what happens</li>
            <li> The product itself is one of the best toothpicks that I have ever used.  Very effective in removing food easily with minimum effort and least  amount of gum irritation. However the holder was great idea but  it is very sticky to open and close but very convenient in  having it ready where ever you are at work etc.</li>
            <li> These things are the best kept secret around. WOW do they work well getting between your teeth. So glad I found these. I pass them out like candy to friends and all who receive it also appreciate how well the do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treat yourself and buy a bunch of &#x27;em and enjoy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got at least 14 year old case of 150 piks that are very close to these Doctors brand I actually like much better. They are similar in size and do the same thing thin on one side and with a bit of brush to the other end. Orthodontist gave me a few of these but I like my old package better...don&#x27;t know if they are still made or perhaps got sold to this maker. Anyway still they are good just not thin enough to work between my tight teeth during brace work. An older brace patient and this is scary about keeping teeth and gums healthy during the process. So these do help and for me work better than wood picks but not as well as some of the others out there. I also love the batter powered Power Flosser it&#x27;s called I think. It&#x27;s not a water pik but it&#x27;s a little battery powered pick that fits between your teeth along the gum line...they however do not do much for the upper teeth areas which floss does better if you can figure out how to pull it off. I&#x27;ve got rins on back teeth molars and that prevents any flossing there so these help reach areas in the back of teeth that even the water pik does not work well and the battery flosser can&#x27;t quite reach well either with the braces in my teeth. I bought these knowing in advance what they were and that they weren&#x27;t quite as nice as my orginal ones but wanted the cases. I bought 6 cases for what 2 individual ones were selling for a that time on Amazon...so no choice of colors but fine. I also note if you refill from bottom hole instead of pulling off the top they last longer and less chance of breaking them too. So that&#x27;s what I do. Also I could get about 4-5 more piks into the cases without having them stop up because there was too many also. I do like it when there is a case to carry these kinds of things about. So like the case and wish the picks themselves were a lot thinner on the thin end. I have very tight teeth. Also lose the teeth on the other end because all they do is grab my braces when I try to use them. Total waste of time and energy and spoil the mission or purpose of use.aste of time and energy and spoil the mission or purpose of use.</li>
            <li> These carry cases are so hard to find! My 74 yr old father-in-law never leaves the house without his tube of brush picks since he can&#x27;t stand wooden tooth picks. When his last pocket case broke... Let&#x27;s just say panic set in! I ordered the 6 pack so he can have one in every vehicle plus a spare! He&#x27;s so happy now; It&#x27;s the little things in life!</li>
            <li> I use these picks all the  time,  I really like them.  Makes my teeth feel so clean.  I  would recommend these picks&lt;br /&gt;to anyone &amp; I will be giving some of these for Christmas presents.  Stocking stuffers.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I have bought so many different things to prod and poke between teeth that if I listed them it would take me ...oh ...47 seconds. Life is short so a cut to the chase says that these things are terrific. They used to come in different colors which might, or might not, have had something to do with the size or material or something but now they come in one color and the material is just right in terms of strength vs bendiness.&lt;br /&gt;If you try them you will not look back except with regret that you didn&#x27;t find them earlier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dentist, and I recommend these to patients because they are very effective, easily found in drug stores and very cheap.  Toothpicks of all sorts are great cleaning aids, and have saved millions of teeth for centuries.</li>
            <li> Was introduced to this product by a friend and was glad he did.  We use these almost exclusively over floss.  The pick end is curved and starts out flat but then expands and has little ribs to help remove plaque.  The Brush end gets inbetween those hard to access area without having to see-saw floss and tear up your gums. Nothing aggrevates me more than having something inbetween my teeth while you&#x27;re out to dinner and dont have floss with you.&lt;br /&gt;This dispenser if perfect for the pocket, briefcase, tackle box, desk drawer, purse, travel kit, key chain,  etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this \\&quot;6 pack\\&quot; of refillable dispensers to introduce this marvelous device to my friends.  Received 4 pinkish purple and 2 in red.  I carefully removed mine from each package to test the swivel head, and each worked flawlessly.  Cant beat the price and reasonable shipping cost. Arrived very quickly as well.</li>
            <li> Clever idea and very practical&lt;br /&gt;Good quality tooth brush always handy if you have some problems in your teeth that require a tooth pick after every meal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is also very good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using The Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks Toothpicks for years, and they&#x27;re getting harder to find locally.  I&#x27;m glad to have found this particular product (the toothpicks in a holder), and was pleased with the quickness of the transaction.  Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks have helped keep my gums healthy for years, and I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I love the brushpicks themselves and I thought these would be a neat way to carry them and give some away.  I was right.  It was nice to get a six pack so that I could give a couple away and still have enough to have one at the office and here and there.  I got purples and reds in my pack.  I broke one of them trying to do the refill thing by taking the cap off.  But now I just refill them through the small hole, it only take a minute.  My picks always stay inside the container even when the thing is rolling around in my bag or in my pocket.  It seems so cheap but they have really held up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a neat and clean way to carry toothpicks. The toothpicks themselves work great for between teeth and dentures. They are great!</li>
            <li> I had one of these holders for years and loved it.  Eventually I lost it.  Finally found these.  Great for me!!</li>
            <li> These picks are great,  one end is&#x27; feathered&#x27; and gets lodged food out,  even under permanent bridges.  The pointed end  is perfect for a lodged seed.  Hard to find, thus pleased to find them on Amazon. If you have any dental work, especially permanent bridges this product will keep your teeth cleaner.  Also good for those with gum problems.  Amazing how much gunk can get stuck and smelly,  try this product,  the doctor(s) who designed these picks knew how to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend recommended them when his dental assistant told him it would reverse his gum problems.  It did spare him painful and expensive gum surgery.</li>
            <li> These are great little toothpicks with a pick on one end and tiny brush to get in between on the other.  I have the key chain, bought a few for friends and take it with me everywhere.  I also have a huge refill pack that I use in the house and to refill my key chain.  I highly recommend these....very handy.</li>
            <li> I just love the way these toothpicks clean my teeth between brushings.  I always keep one in the car to make sure I don&#x27;t have any food between my teeth before I go into a meeting.  The little plastic dispenser is terrific, and I keep one in the glove compartment of my car.</li>
            <li> Best tooth picks bar none.  In addition, now these handy carriers I can add them to all my locations without having the larger 250 plus one there.  Works great in my backpack!</li>
            <li> I have been addicted to The Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks since my dentist introduced  me to them. Then you could buy them in any Walmart but no more. I bought the holder on a keyring and love it. It works well. I have one issue - the cap turns on its own and sometime a pick will fall out. Otherwise, great item!</li>
            <li> They work great and fit in your shirt pocket fine</li>
            <li> A fellow frequent-traveler recommended these as a replacement for conventional floss packs. I bought into her advice and found my case broke as soon as I landed. Shipping it back to the U.S. would have cost more than the actual product, so I just recycled it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this perfect example of planned obsolescence.</li>
            <li> The 60 picks is more practical....&lt;br /&gt;Keychain with brushpicks  is more for fun because you do need to buy more brushpicks for refill  after the 15 picks are used...&lt;br /&gt;Also, the opening for disbursing the toothpicks is kind of awkward</li>
            <li> I love to give them as gifts. I carry one in my purse and in the glove compartment.  Nice to have .</li>
