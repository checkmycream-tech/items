            <li>Great size for travel</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, so the  1/2 inch is great for me.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for travel, so the size is great.  </li>
            <li>Purse size , great for travel or just to touch up at the end of the day before leaving work to go out.</li>

            <li>This is great iron for travel</li>
            <li>I am so happy with my BaBylissPro Nano Mini Irons.</li>

            <li>WHICH IS GREAT FOR TRAVELING</li>
            <li>made a great stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li>Its great for travel</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>Babyliss always has great reviews.</li>
            <li>but it worked great on my chin length</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for when my bangs get rained on.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced it pulling my hair at all.  </li>
            <li>Great when you 1st get it..</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Love it!!  </li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>It is amazing!</li>
            <li>This iron is okay but for the price it was not the best I found.  </li>
            <li>It is the perfect size and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>If you get one of the heat resistant gloves you should be good to go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ideal for travel, but I anticipate this replacing the full-sized Remington model I have since it makes my hair look so much better.</li>
            <li>was good...</li>
            <li>The price is good and it serves its purpose, like it..</li>
            <li>Without it, it&#x27;s still good for me.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go...</li>
            <li>Good for travel, but I use it at home too.</li>
            <li>Good value for money!&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a good idea for travelling</li>
            <li>and I would have loved</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>I consider it a good value for the money.</li>
            <li>maybe I am not that good at using it...</li>
            <li>Good for travel you have everything you need on one spot.</li>
            <li>These things are good.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, I recommend it 100%, very useful.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, and it&#x27;s perfectly portable.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect iron for travel and quick touchups.</li>
            <li>However, after using this item, it was perfect for precise straightening and very easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>Price was great, I love Babyliss product, so I keep this iron</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>and I am very satisfied with the device.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with how the flatiron performs.  </li>
            <li>This is probably useful if you&#x27;re one of those people that have perfect hair all day and have a rogue curly section every now and then.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it would be great for someone on the go or traveling.</li>
            <li>Still, I was very pleased with the performance.</li>
            <li>Great if you need a quick bang fix but not so great for all over use...unless you have an hour.&lt;br /&gt;Iron</li>
            <li>recommend excellent buy thank you very much</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>and I love the shine it leaves!</li>

            <li>I love this thing!  </li>
            <li>I love them!...</li>
            <li>It heats quickly and does the job brilliantly.</li>
            <li>This was easy to manage and it does great.</li>
            <li>but the result is amazing, I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tolerable low-key color, too, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t style my own hair a lot</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and is perfect for my bangs and traveling.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if you could control the heat levels.</li>
            <li>I never thought I could style my own hair</li>
            <li>Nice travel size.</li>
            <li>It glides through hair nicely and leaves it silky</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really tiny, but it works great - perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>but honestly I ended up just buying a 30 EURO straightener there which did the trick and made my life easier.</li>
            <li>and it really works great!!</li>
            <li>and I wanted something that I could make to my own degrees.</li>
            <li>Heat up really nice and smooths out my hair.  </li>
            <li>These are the best minis ive used very gentle on my hair i love them</li>
            <li>It doesnt work quite as well as my full sized babybliss, but still did a great job straightening my otherwise wavy hair.</li>
            <li>It heats up extremely quickly (we&#x27;re talking seconds) and does a great job.</li>
            <li>Good size and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>very easy to work with</li>
            <li>I even love it more than my instyler!</li>
            <li>Size is right, works great and priced nicely.  </li>
            <li>A good, cheap alternative to full-sized models.</li>
            <li>comfortable, good weight and size</li>
            <li>Works great excellent for travel not occupy much space which makes it very convenient.</li>
            <li>She just turned 10, and I&#x27;ve decided, after too many morning battles, that it&#x27;s time for her to learn to do her own hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and my hair holds the style all day.</li>
            <li>as I&#x27;m sure most people who own a straightener do.  </li>
            <li>this is perfect, works great and so easy travel with due to is compact size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Okay so I got this to reach my hair edges that are out when i do my weave.</li>
            <li>I decided to try a mini straightener to see if that would help and so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love baby bliss products</li>
            <li>I bought this Iron because the reviews and opinions i read,.. and i have to say it filled all my expectations!</li>
            <li>Perfect for short hair.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>THAT I HAVE MORE THAN</li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention when I made a purchase.  </li>
            <li>It is so cute.</li>
            <li>The size is so handy, so light.</li>
            <li>This is certainly a wonderful mini-straightener for a comparatively low price.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have short hair, so the 1/2 inch plate is perfect.</li>
            <li>it seems like there could have been more insulation around the handle part.</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>They work better then I thought and they arrived on time.</li>
            <li>, I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I get worried about those metal plates getting too close to the counter top and scorching/melting/burning it.</li>
            <li>to use and store, especially handy for short hair.</li>
            <li>I found one at TJ Maxx for 10 bucks that I like better.</li>
            <li>use it for touching up my bangs after getting caught in the rain and for going out after work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I love the Baby Bliss.  </li>
            <li>I love this iron, my hair lasts longer.</li>
            <li>I have the larger version that I&#x27;ve used for years, but this one wasn&#x27;t the greatest for travel.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>Better than nothing to stick in your bag.</li>
            <li>Love this lil iron.</li>
            <li>so when I started growing it out, I needed something but didn&#x27;t see the need to invest in a big one, this travel size is just perfect.</li>
            <li>Thankfully we have a granite counter top in our bathroom</li>
            <li>Make sure you understand what that means...</li>
            <li>Just be sure to leave plenty of time to straighten your hair...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have nappy curly frizzy hair and it gets it so silky and smooth!</li>
            <li>Again, pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Many days I straighten my hair at home, just to walk out the door &amp; find it raining</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great size and it heats up really well.</li>
            <li>Perfect for bangs, short hair, or getting close to the scalp.</li>
            <li>At home I use a 1.5 inch version of this straightener which I absolutely love.  </li>
            <li>but it is still able to get the job done.</li>
            <li>The platforms (those that are close to the heating pans) get pretty hot, but if you don&#x27;t touch those parts when using it, it is perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li>it had it worked more than one time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for people with short hair</li>
            <li>Love this iron.  </li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me by my girl friend who enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>(Make sure you bring a plug adapter.)  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this BaBylissPro mini...</li>
            <li>Glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>This is the most adorable straightner.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s tourmaline and this brand is one I&#x27;ve trusted for many years.</li>
            <li>Excellent travel flat iron.</li>
            <li>Best flat iron in the world</li>
            <li>This flat iron is the  best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Honestly looks are deceiving cuz it looks tiny almost like a toy but its actually amazing how good it works.</li>
            <li>The iron is perfect for medium or long hair, and for travel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Pretty good price too.</li>
            <li>I am planning a long trip and this will be great !</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, it&#x27;s portable, and the titanium surface glides nicely through my hair.  </li>
            <li>Handy to carry, quick to heat up.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot, very fast and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>it gets hot quickly and is just great.</li>
            <li>I love that it heats up quickly and straightens my hair with a nice smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful color, works well, very light weight I use this daily not just for travel.</li>
            <li>I have also found it to be great to control frizz near my scalp.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and I&#x27;m going to enjoy the hell out of it.</li>
            <li>Good for touch ups, but doesn&#x27;t get super hot!</li>
            <li>OTHERWISE--it&#x27;s awesome-goes through my hair smoothly, heats up quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li>Other than that, very good buy!</li>
            <li>I have tried other minis and this is for me the best.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate.  </li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly too.  </li>
            <li>Easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>Easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>2 the scalp and is easy 2 use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient for traveling as it easily fits inside my purse.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>(450 F, I believe), very quickly.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m have, and it is so... easy to use.</li>
            <li>I opted for the BaByliss because the reviews were so strong, it was so portable and</li>
            <li>This seems to work OK, but not as well as my full sized one.</li>
            <li>Great heat up very fast and is very portable.</li>
            <li>&amp; I have FINE hair.</li>
            <li>it´s fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It straightens effectively on my fine + wavy hair.</li>
            <li>is it), but fine for my purposes.</li>
            <li>I have kinda fine hair</li>
            <li>this does the job just fine...  </li>
            <li>, it is just fine</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, this might not be a problem.  </li>
            <li>A WHILE IT WILL CURL YOUR HAIR, THE IRON JUST HAVE TO BE REALLY HOT OVERALL AWESOME PRODUCT I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE</li>
            <li>For longer hair it won&#x27;t be better but should be adequate for travel.</li>

            <li>That&#x27;s probably my own ineptitude, and it certainly seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the little flips I want in my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have very easy to style hair (like it takes curl and straightening well, and it took me forever to get straight hair using this!</li>
            <li>Works perfect for those stubborn little hairs.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s light weight</li>

            <li>, I really liked is very practical.</li>
            <li>Works really great on my short hair.</li>
            <li>I had no issues with getting it to glide through my hair smoothly or burning my hair.  </li>
            <li>- this is not going to be an effective way to do your whole head of hair, ladies &amp; gents.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of hair irons and stylets, this by far is the best.</li>
            <li>, YOU CAN FIT IT IN YOUR PURSE</li>
            <li>great tool for short hair.</li>
            <li>Good so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things about Babyliss irons, but this one completely fried the front of my hair.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for getting to the roots which definitely helps with keeping my hair straight between relaxers.  </li>
            <li>This straightener, being so small, is perfect for those with short hair, but it also serves as a great travel straightener.</li>
            <li>Easy to take on a trip or keep in your handbag for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li>She loves how easy it is to use, and quick.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly, and works great on my really short hair.</li>
            <li>FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE MORE HAIR THAN ANYONE.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using the BaByliss nano, and I love it.</li>
            <li>It really gets the job done! :-)</li>
            <li>Original Review - August, 2013</li>
            <li>was so excited receiving it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for me because I&#x27;m under 5&#x27; tall with small hands.</li>
            <li>I was quite pleased with the results after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I can get all around my ears almost perfectly with this because it&#x27;s so small.</li>
            <li>I have very fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>and I really want to look good for the whole day.</li>
            <li>The size, etc. are fine, but the temperature was way too hot for my fine hair, and there is no way to adjust the it.</li>
            <li>I love it how it heats up pretty much quickly.</li>
            <li>I knew it would be a great purchase since I own the bigger version of this iron which worked fantastic with my big afro</li>
            <li>she was right!</li>
            <li>TO LIKE TEN ITS HOT LOL.</li>
            <li>and it gets nice and hot fast.</li>
            <li>It really leaves your hair perfectly manageable and expensive-shiny, and creates a very sleek look in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>but it never seems to stay straight for more than five minutes.</li>
            <li>there is no temperature adjustment, the packaging stated that the iron reaches a max of 430 degrees and based upon the steam coming from it, I assume that it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>I w/still use my full size iron.</li>
            <li>Had one (different brand) before and loved it... bought this for my daughter to take to college with her.</li>
            <li>or if you just do your bangs and don&#x27;t need a full straightening iron.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s able to get very close to the scalp.  </li>
            <li>Good travel iron or for short hairstyles.</li>
            <li>This nano size is much easier &amp; leaves hair looking better.</li>
            <li>Have to stick with my full size.</li>
            <li>I imagine it would be time consuming to use on a full head of wavy/coarse hair.</li>
            <li>it was still wavy and not laying down as nicely as he would have liked.</li>
            <li>This flat iron was perfect for a trip to Europe where packing lightly was essential.</li>
            <li>My hair slides right through smoothly.</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly and gets quite hot.  </li>
            <li>this flat iron does a good job in keep my roots in tack.</li>
            <li>Also, even though the temperature setting can&#x27;t be controlled, it&#x27;s still a really good flat iron.  </li>
            <li>daughter had Conair before and loved the mini flat iron for her bangs</li>
            <li>Other than that, it heats up quickly and works great on my bangs.</li>

            <li>Heats up quickly (one temp) - gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>gets nice a hot and works great, solid product, just a super super tiny plate.</li>
            <li>This flat iron, because of its width, is perfect for my short hair.  </li>
            <li>and it is very hot</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to heat up very hot either.  </li>
            <li>the size and heat from this flat iron is perfect for straightening short wavy hair.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s just what you need to tidy up the short ends.  </li>
            <li>Fast and does the job; however, probably best for short to mid length hair.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for domestic and international travel - Does the job, very portable</li>
            <li>If it actually worked, it would be a nice product for travel.  </li>
            <li>Good quality, it was as we expected and we can recommend it.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy</li>

            <li>Nice and hot tool to straighten edges and short hair.</li>
            <li>my only problem is that it gets really hot to the point where you cant hold it without using some kind of towel or oven mitt type barrier.</li>
            <li>Great little hair straightener for travelling!  </li>
            <li>it is a great little product!  </li>
            <li>Just wish they were better able to insulate the handle above &amp; very near to the plates</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s really small, but that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s great for travel.  </li>
            <li>get the full sized Babybliss flat iron,  a million times better.</li>
            <li>the size is good, however the reason of the 3 stars is this cannot be slide smoothly down.</li>
            <li>, I USE THIS LITTLE ONE THE MOST AND SO LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t use a straightener on my hair very often, but this size (it really is nano, reallllly small) is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Already have other items of this brand &amp; loved this one just the same! :-)</li>
            <li>The other reviews say it can get very hot but to be honest</li>
            <li>This iron heats up super fast</li>
            <li>Just a quick swipe over my roots and my hair is shiny, silky and straight.</li>
            <li>This is really a great straightener, especially for beginners and guys (or girls with short hair).</li>

            <li>Heats very fast and does work well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to have an iron that can do the job of a full size, and still be small enough to take it on vacation with me and have fabulous hair.  </li>
            <li>and so far i used it over a year and still works fine</li>
            <li>I have short hair and this flat iron works great.</li>
            <li>This flat iron works great on my hair in the back.</li>
            <li>so it comes in very handy, but I even use it at home instead of my regular size flat iron.</li>
            <li>It is screaming hot, and there is no way to adjust, but It does glide effortlessly through my hair.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, this was a great buy!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what i need.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>The same iron was about $4 more, not to mention the sales tax.</li>
            <li>This is even smaller than I pictured; okay for touch-ups</li>
            <li>It does get hot though, and was better than nothing for my recent trip overseas.</li>
            <li>I set this on my dryer while hot to avoid burning anything.  </li>
            <li>It is tiny and really cute.</li>
            <li>it gets too hot for childs hair.  </li>
            <li>They get hot n seconds....</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m paranoid, but those plates DO get pretty hot....</li>
            <li>The BaBylissPro Nano Titanium 1/2&amp;#34; Mini Iron I received is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Exterior gets way too hot and it doesn&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li>but if he is willing to get up to straighten it, then oh well.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s exactly the length of a dollar bill.</li>
            <li>it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>, exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Temperature is one setting and way too hot</li>
            <li>and the description of this item was exact.</li>
            <li>...the paint comes off of it after awhile because it&#x27;s so hot</li>
            <li>(I have pretty thick/coarse hair)</li>
            <li>It works okay for my short hair cut, though.  </li>
            <li>but most likely will just sit and collect dust.</li>
            <li>IT DOES EXACTLY</li>
            <li>This is not  fake review</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot to me at all...</li>
            <li>and it gets hot and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li>For those with thick hair I think this will work great for you.</li>
            <li>it gets too hot.</li>
            <li>; It gets so hot that I see steam rise from my hair after I use it.</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mostly for ppl with very short hair.</li>
            <li>It gets extremely hot.</li>
            <li>It is very small - since I just got my hair cut super short it was ideal for quick use.</li>
            <li>and it fits right into your clutch for touching up your hair after a long night.</li>
            <li>read many reviews for many different flat irons and chose these and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>My hair is short in the back so this size flat iron is perfect.</li>
            <li>My hair is short for most girls, but a pretty long for most guys.</li>
            <li>I love it, but it pulls your hair if your using it at the end of the flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Sooo glad I bought this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron !  </li>
            <li>All the same it is such a good buy.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is perfect for my short edges that my large flat iron can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li>To make this little gadget even more amazing is how fast it heats up, it barely takes a minute.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it and worth the price</li>
            <li>It is just the right size and heats up ready fast.</li>
            <li>I got this to use on my bangs, but my hair is pretty fine (and short)</li>
            <li>I have short wavy hair and it isn&#x27;t easy as I thought it would be, but that is not the fault of the flatiron.</li>
            <li>Gets hot pretty fast, and I use it mainly on my bangs.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser strongly recommended this, since she has one and uses it daily.</li>
            <li>Also, if you style or straighten a large portion of your hair</li>
            <li>YOU SERIOUSLY MAKE THE BEST FLAT IRONS EVER.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The barrel does get very hot but there are soft rubber finger grips, so just remember where to hold it.</li>
            <li>Other flat irons are too big to try and corral my bangs, but this is the perfect size.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful item especially for short hair, black hair....</li>
            <li>perfect, durable little flat iron - we had to get a second one because my daughter is always taking it to her bathroom ;)</li>
            <li>Nice little travel iron.</li>
            <li>I pretty much put it away and suck it up and bring my regular size straightener with me everyone since its worth it!</li>
            <li>A great little tool for short hair.</li>
            <li>This iron is obviously not meant to replace your actual straightening iron, but it&#x27;s amazing for touch ups</li>
            <li>&amp; it really heats up fast.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast, but there&#x27;s no temperature setting so you cannot adjust the temp.</li>
            <li>A WHOLE LOT</li>
            <li>BECAUSE IF IT COULD DO WONDERS ON MY HAIR, IT REALLY CAN DO WONDERS</li>
            <li>SO MUCH BABYLISS</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t work for my hair, I can&#x27;t imagine it working for anyone who really needs a straightener bc of frizzy or curly hair.</li>
            <li>If I did my whole head</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair very well while I&#x27;m straightening.</li>
            <li>Heated up fast</li>
            <li>Has an on-off switch and red LED light, but is not temperature adjustable.</li>
            <li>One problem: The iron doesn&#x27;t stand up very well (like how it does in the picture here).</li>
            <li>The plates seem to catch on my hair which might be what has damaged it so much.</li>
            <li>For $20 I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>this straightener  works very well for me.</li>
            <li>it heats up fast and is very compact</li>
            <li>Very compact as well in case you want to take it with you.</li>
            <li>so I just wanted something to pull my bang straight...  </li>
            <li>Heats up really fast.</li>
            <li>I am a flight attendant</li>
            <li>Very durable and convenient.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it would work real well as a travel iron.</li>
            <li>I really bought this</li>
            <li>It really does not heat up to temperature as claimed.</li>
            <li>Dual voltage really helps when you are traveling.</li>
            <li>It works really well and holds my hair.  </li>
            <li>heats up so fast.</li>
            <li>naps straight.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair to begin with</li>
            <li>and it does not get the crimp that I was really looking for..</li>
            <li>Gets my hair really straight all the way to the root, without drying it out.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended it to all my clients in need and some have even purchased while I was still styling their hair because they could believe how straight their roots could get.</li>
            <li>My hair was straight.</li>
            <li>I really like this mini</li>
            <li>I like it to much</li>
            <li>No problems gliding through my fine hair, and it&#x27;s much handier than my full-sized flat iron.</li>
            <li>This little flat iron is excellent for my short hair.</li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s still a great little flat iron esp.</li>
            <li>The flat iron works fine.</li>
            <li>The mini flat works just fine.</li>
            <li>but honestly, I have long hair and it was just too tiny and would too easily pull my fine wavy hair since it was so small.</li>
            <li>We use the iron to tame a cowlick and give her hair a nice finish.  </li>
            <li>So far I LOVE this mini flat iron!  </li>
            <li>and I love that there&#x27;s a button for you to turn it on and off, extremely convenient.</li>
            <li>After getting my haie cut into a pixie cut I had to shop around for flat iron that really fit my needs.</li>
            <li>I actually like it better than my usual hair straightener because I think it gives me more control.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this because I needed something with dual voltage for a European trip.</li>
            <li>This mighty mouse of a flat iron does just that!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s small enough to carry in your pocket book or and over nite bag so happy I bought this.</li>
            <li>Small, easy to pack and did a great job for being so small</li>
            <li>It is a nice size and worked well the one single time it actually worked.  </li>
            <li>It does get a bit hot but my hair is short and does not take long to do (I mostly do just the front.)</li>
            <li>This BaByliss is comparable in how soft and straight it leaves my hair, and for a fraction of the cost and size!</li>
            <li>I will be able to use globally and at the same time something that will not take too much room in my suitcase.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, not too hot like the chi, and not too cool!</li>
            <li>It is exactly the right size to fit her small hands.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to pack up and use, with the extra long cord.  </li>
            <li>IF YOU LIVE IN SOUTHEAST LOUISIANA ON THE NORTHSHORE, YOU MAY KNOW WHO I AM!  </li>
            <li>My son wanted to grow out his hair a bit, since it had always been super short (Sigh... teens...).</li>
            <li>Only wish it had a temperature range (hot or hot</li>
            <li>Works wonders especially if you use Blue Magic hair dressing</li>
            <li>Takes a little bit longer than a 1&amp;#34; straightener, but still heats up very quickly and gets really hot.</li>
            <li>Just took this little baby on my 2 week Italian vacation and with my little converter plug, it worked perfectly the whole time.</li>
            <li>However, I would not use daily or even weekly, as the temp gets very hot &amp; is not adjustable.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight, gets nice and hot and gives me a lot different look that I usually have.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>, I think it works better than my bigger flat iron.</li>
            <li>I find I use it much, much more than my regular flat iron and wanted to leave one in my travel bag and have one for home use.</li>
            <li>She said it gets hot fast and is small so easy to pack.</li>
            <li>I purchased this little flat iron to tame fly-aways and smooth my roots, so far , so good!.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to order one of the mini&#x27;s, but I think I like it even better than the full-size 1\\&quot; I had before.</li>
            <li>Love this little iron.  </li>
            <li>Love this little guy.</li>
            <li>Cute little complement to my full-size BaByliss straightener.</li>
            <li>They heat up very quickly, in a minute or less, and curl my hair very well.</li>
            <li>I have to admit I was skeptical after reading all the reviews, these irons are a great product and make my hair look shiny and sleek.</li>
            <li>However, his hair is amazingly thick and wavy and stubborn, and on its own he looks like Albert Einstein with the wild hair photo - except twice as much hair.</li>
            <li>I was able to flat iron my 1/2 inch new growth with ease something I had difficulty doing with my 1 inch flat iron.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got very fine hair, so the small size isn&#x27;t a hardship.</li>
            <li>and it is small so easy to handle!</li>
            <li>It get&#x27;s hot right away, so be careful</li>
            <li>This Flatiron requires minimal effort and straightens hair super fast.</li>
            <li>In other words, if the iron was really constructed with double insulation the US plug would most probably not be polarized.  </li>
            <li>Just the right size for short hair or bangs.</li>
            <li>I was only able to use it for a few minutes because it gets too hot to handle.</li>
            <li>It does not have an adjustable heat setting, so if you have brittle hair or hair that is very heat sensitive (gets fried easily), then this little iron probably isn&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mine also was advertised as new, but came out the package with fingerprints and scratches and appeared to be used.</li>
            <li>I have coarse hair and it can be a real job sometimes getting my hair straight as I want</li>
            <li>I love this little straightener!</li>
            <li>I love this little iron!</li>
            <li>Very professional.</li>
            <li>My hair is very, very curly and coarse.  </li>
            <li>Since the ends of my hair still have the remnants of a perm, I need a flat iron to help smooth this new short haircut.</li>
            <li>and it is hot on the outside</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>It usually flops sideways on the counter top.</li>
            <li>have to say that it seemed to take more time than usual to receive it.  </li>
            <li>Hot enough for my stubborn hair</li>
            <li>It does get hot, only 1 setting, watch your fingers.</li>
            <li>love how small the straightener is,</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for for my daughters short hair.</li>
            <li>It takes about 1 min to get hot enough to untangle your face hair.</li>
            <li>(think Nia Long, Halle Berry hair style) and I need an iron that is small, gets really hot and easy to handle - this is it!  </li>
            <li>so I thought this little one would be easy to handle and control</li>
            <li>This product works great for my short hair- especially getting the little hairs in the back close to the scalp/neck.</li>
            <li>It heated up quickly, and was very hot, but didn&#x27;t work as well as my Chi on my thick hair.</li>
            <li>I use my larger flat iron for the rest of my hair, but this really does the trick for those fine, short hairs.</li>
            <li>However, as previous reviewers have mentioned, the hair does not glide smoothly between the plates.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this iron about a week ago, thinking this would be a nice small version of the larger one (which my stylist uses)</li>
            <li>It would never work in someone&#x27;s thick hair, you cant fit much hair in it!</li>
            <li>This flat iron can give body to the hair more so than any other.  </li>
            <li>The only down side is not being able to regulate the temperature.</li>
            <li>Flat iron gets too hot to hold.</li>
            <li>They are pretty small but my hair is about 3 inches long on top and the irons are just</li>
            <li>This was my first mini flat iron.</li>
            <li>This flat iron get hot as H-E-double hockey sticks.  </li>
            <li>But if you need something quick for your bangs or short hair, this is definitely it.</li>
            <li>Wanted to thank all the previous reviews - it really helped me to make the right choice for what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I cut off all my hair and needed something to smooth out the little curl I get at times.</li>
            <li>People with bigger hands may find this a little challenging to maneuver.</li>
            <li>I love my mini BaByliss it works well on my edges and hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li>It does heat quickly so for me I use about 45 seconds after it&#x27;s been plugged in so its not extremely hot.</li>
            <li>My BKT new growth would not be as straight as it is w/o this flat iron.</li>
            <li>But, I would not recommend for frequent use.</li>
            <li>and I thought, wow I should get one of those things.</li>
            <li>I went to a professional beauty supply store where you must be licensed to buy items there.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and enjoy traveling with it.</li>
            <li>Wow, I got a deal.  </li>
            <li>Heat up fast and very portable to take on domestic and international trips.</li>
            <li>I have Asian pin straight hair</li>
            <li>I use it to straighten my edges when I have protective style (weave) in my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I like this so much that I&#x27;m ordering a second one to keep in my office.</li>
            <li>but this is the only one that get those edges straight.</li>
            <li>It takes too long to see a good result with such a small plate.</li>
            <li>If I can find one with heat settings I like and have good reviews and not to expensive</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t cool down nearly as fast.</li>
            <li>I have always had these short little baby hairs on the sides of my head that I&#x27;ve never been able to really straighten with a regular-sized flat iron.</li>
            <li>Love this little flat iron!</li>
            <li>I went to a hair stylist who recommended this cute little flat iron to take care of those hairs, and it works so well!</li>
            <li>The iron was easy to glide through my hair but it was too small.  </li>
            <li>I have fine coarse Asian hair and as I&#x27;m trying to grow it long, the ends tends to curl up.</li>
            <li>I can plug it in, dampen my bangs and the flat iron is ready.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is a must for getting those roots straight with one passing.</li>
            <li>it does get pretty hot, so you may want to pack a pot holder or small towel to wrap it in if you need to do your hair and pack up, other than that it was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>If you want to buy a real BaByliss flat iron go on their website!</li>
            <li>this is the most ridiculous smallest straigtener..</li>
            <li>It is good for thick coarse hair but not for fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>and when I ran it through my hair it would straighten it a little bit,  but not the way the full version does.  </li>
            <li>I got this to add some texture to my super thick, straight, pixie-cut hair.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s one way to cool it down faster!</li>
            <li>I have very short, fine hair and this speedy little iron</li>
            <li>I have really long straight hair</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it for people with long hair as it&#x27;s going to take forever for you to straighten your hair.</li>
            <li>Wanted something small and light that I could take to Europe</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty powerful for such a small iron.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re like me, your whole head gets nappy after a long trip anywhere.</li>
            <li>I think it would take too long to do my whole head.</li>
            <li>Even though he had his hair straightened to calm it down  </li>
            <li>; mini iron had made all the difference in allowing him to calm down the remaining wave and have the hair be presentable in public.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I lived in a dry climate, I was able to mostly tame the cowlick with hair products.</li>
            <li>love this tiny little flat iron.</li>
            <li>This is usually done to keep the hot side of the circuitry away from the user (for example, in screw-in type incandescent light sockets it is the center button terminal that is hot, so the outer metal threads on the incandescent bulb is not hot).  </li>
            <li>The BKT that I use instructs that the hair be flat ironed at high heat to seal the BKT into the hair.</li>
            <li>Worked very well with a simple converter on a recent trip to Germany and Belgium.</li>
            <li>I really like the short barrel because it works well with short hair.</li>
            <li>For that reason, maybe it&#x27;s not something you want to use for everyday, but just as a quick straightening device, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the butt of the cord attached to the straightening is does not swivel, so it&#x27;s a bit awkward setting it down, but none the less it&#x27;s still a great product :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using a normal flat iron for it</li>
            <li>The exterior doesn&#x27;t get hot like my other one either, so I no longer burn my hand while using it.</li>
            <li>I have three other BaByliss irons, but this one doesn&#x27;t get hot as the others, so doesn&#x27;t work all that well.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed with this small iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, compact, heats up great - but note that it is only 1/2 an inch thick.  </li>
            <li>I had used other brand iron like Gama and Hot Tool</li>
            <li>Extremely hot you have to be very careful with it</li>
            <li>The cord itself is the bulkiest thing about it, but it&#x27;s not one of those super stiff cords and you could probably save additional space by winding it around the appliance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It heats up rapidly (around a minute) to about 430 degrees fahrenheit, and its titanium makeup is much better for hair than other materials that may snag or damage hair or heat it unevenly.</li>
            <li>I hate to say I really don&#x27;t do a very good job using it.</li>
            <li>It is very small and easy to carry in my make up bag when traveling.</li>
            <li>I let him use my Chi straightener, but the 1 inch plate was simply too much for him to use on hair that was 1-3 inches long.</li>
            <li>and since I am in the middle of transition ( relaxed to natural)</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised with the size, as it turned out to be smaller than I had thought.  </li>
            <li>so when using an adapter there with this iron you lose the polarization that the manufacturer apparently intended for this iron.  </li>
            <li>and I think I spent as much on a case as I did on the iron.</li>
            <li>Tired of hauling around my straightening iron in my purse, I&#x27;ve been looking for something more practical that fits in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>It packed small and worked so well that upon returning home I decided to order a full size one to start using at home.</li>
            <li>Agree with other reviewers that this is good for travel due to the small size of the unit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really not big on styling my hair, I prefer to leave it as natural as I can bare to leave it, however my bangs always want to stand up on end in the mornings, so I bought this mini/travel size flat iron in order to calm them down before I go off to work.</li>
            <li>It gets hot immediately like 30 seconds or less</li>
            <li>But European plugs are typically not polarized and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and compact and gets the job done quickly.  </li>
            <li>This straightens my thick wavy hair better than my larger and more expensive irons.</li>
            <li>My hair is abundant but very thin with no body, so I&#x27;ve used curling irons for years.</li>
            <li>I was worried because it was so much cheaper than all the others, but decided to take the risk after reading the other reviews.  </li>
            <li>This product is very small and could fit in your purse easity.</li>
            <li>This is by far the smallest flat iron I have ever see.  </li>
            <li>I was new to the flat iron since I&#x27;ve worn my hair short for 15 yrs.</li>
            <li>but I need some weight and dept to this product so I can do my natural african american hair</li>
            <li>We have natural African American hair and it makes our edges look like we relaxed our hair.</li>
            <li>Though, definitely worth it if you&#x27;re looking for something small and quick to straighten small sections of hair with.</li>
            <li>recommended for ironing tweaks to travel and people with thin or scanty hair, heat is powerful and very practical.</li>
            <li>I have to use this thing at least twice as long as my normal straightener because it doesn&#x27;t get vEry hot.</li>
            <li>This darling little thing is EXACTLY what I needed to fix the problem areas.</li>
            <li>A little to hot for what I needed</li>
            <li>Although the iron is small it heats up very quickly and you get the same result as if you would by using your regular size flat iron, for about the same duration of time.</li>
            <li>well it has these little pads right around the middle for your fingers - if you use these you won&#x27;t burn your fingers or get any blue on them.</li>
            <li>I keep my hair very short and this iron has just the right size blades to give a little extra body and shine to it.</li>
            <li>I had to return a flatiron because it didn&#x27;t heat up hot enough for coarse black hair.  </li>
            <li>I only rated it 4 stars because it gets a little to hot for my hair.</li>
            <li>Its super mini and hard to hold in your hand to do anything to your hair.</li>
            <li>The only challenge is that with the small size you have to have some patience because it simply takes bit longer than with your full size flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Since I recently decided to transition from relaxed to my natural 4b hair, I needed a flat iron that gets really hot, is small enough to maneuever and gets close to the scalp.</li>
            <li>I am not a flat iron person</li>
            <li>but I guess I am not a flat iron person.  </li>
            <li>My hair is super thick and short.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast (a couple minutes to full heat) and is small enough to get around small patches of hair without burning yourself.</li>
            <li>My only rather large complaint is the on light is not very bright.</li>

            <li> Very good quality, very good price.</li>
            <li> but my bangs are incredibly unruly.</li>
            <li> Works great, I do alot of traveling for work and this works perfectly in packing in a carryon bag.  </li>
            <li> The size is perfect and I use it every day and it will be great for travel too</li>
            <li> but this is definitely great for shorter hair, touch ups and perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> Ideal to take a trip and retouch drying.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for travel, fits in my carry on and still works great</li>

            <li> Loved it!</li>
            <li> Really good price for a great hair straightener!</li>
            <li> I had a great FHI that I lost at a casino, and then I had a less-desirable Remington that made my hair meh.</li>
            <li> Probably great for bangs, too.</li>
            <li> Works great with my hair.</li>
            <li> Works great in Germany with an adapter.  </li>
            <li> It is great.  </li>
            <li> It is a great size for traveling</li>
            <li> I am so happy I found the babyliss in a 1/2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I am happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great size for travel</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, so the  1/2 inch is great for me.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for travel, so the size is great.  </li>
            <li> Purse size , great for travel or just to touch up at the end of the day before leaving work to go out.</li>
            <li> this works great.</li>
            <li> it works great.</li>
            <li> Also, a wonderful product as you can adjust the temperature and create silky styles without heat damage and tons of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this product to all of my co-workers and 4 have now purchased and are loving the results.</li>
            <li> This is great iron for travel</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my BaBylissPro Nano Mini Irons.</li>
            <li> , IT DOES GREAT WITH STRAIGHTENING YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li> WHICH IS GREAT FOR TRAVELING</li>
            <li> made a great stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> Its great for travel</li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> Babyliss always has great reviews.</li>
            <li> but it worked great on my chin length</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for when my bangs get rained on.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced it pulling my hair at all.  </li>
            <li> Great when you 1st get it..</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> Love it!!  </li>
            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> It is amazing!</li>
            <li> This iron is okay but for the price it was not the best I found.  </li>
            <li> It is the perfect size and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> If you get one of the heat resistant gloves you should be good to go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ideal for travel, but I anticipate this replacing the full-sized Remington model I have since it makes my hair look so much better.</li>
            <li> was good...</li>
            <li> The price is good and it serves its purpose, like it..</li>
            <li> Without it, it&#x27;s still good for me.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go...</li>
            <li> Good for travel, but I use it at home too.</li>
            <li> Good value for money!&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a good idea for travelling</li>
            <li> and I would have loved</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> I consider it a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> maybe I am not that good at using it...</li>
            <li> Good for travel you have everything you need on one spot.</li>
            <li> These things are good.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I recommend it 100%, very useful.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, and it&#x27;s perfectly portable.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect iron for travel and quick touchups.</li>
            <li> However, after using this item, it was perfect for precise straightening and very easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> Price was great, I love Babyliss product, so I keep this iron</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> and I am very satisfied with the device.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with how the flatiron performs.  </li>
            <li> This is probably useful if you&#x27;re one of those people that have perfect hair all day and have a rogue curly section every now and then.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it would be great for someone on the go or traveling.</li>
            <li> Still, I was very pleased with the performance.</li>
            <li> Great if you need a quick bang fix but not so great for all over use...unless you have an hour.&lt;br /&gt;Iron</li>
            <li> recommend excellent buy thank you very much</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>

            <li> I love this thing!  </li>
            <li> I love them!...</li>
            <li> It heats quickly and does the job brilliantly.</li>
            <li> This was easy to manage and it does great.</li>
            <li> but the result is amazing, I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tolerable low-key color, too, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t style my own hair a lot</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and is perfect for my bangs and traveling.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if you could control the heat levels.</li>
            <li> I never thought I could style my own hair</li>
            <li> Nice travel size.</li>
            <li> It glides through hair nicely and leaves it silky</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really tiny, but it works great - perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> but honestly I ended up just buying a 30 EURO straightener there which did the trick and made my life easier.</li>
            <li> and it really works great!!</li>
            <li> and I wanted something that I could make to my own degrees.</li>
            <li> Heat up really nice and smooths out my hair.  </li>
            <li> These are the best minis ive used very gentle on my hair i love them</li>
            <li> It doesnt work quite as well as my full sized babybliss, but still did a great job straightening my otherwise wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It heats up extremely quickly (we&#x27;re talking seconds) and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Good size and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> very easy to work with</li>
            <li> I even love it more than my instyler!</li>
            <li> Size is right, works great and priced nicely.  </li>
            <li> A good, cheap alternative to full-sized models.</li>
            <li> comfortable, good weight and size</li>
            <li> Works great excellent for travel not occupy much space which makes it very convenient.</li>
            <li> She just turned 10, and I&#x27;ve decided, after too many morning battles, that it&#x27;s time for her to learn to do her own hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and my hair holds the style all day.</li>
            <li> as I&#x27;m sure most people who own a straightener do.  </li>
            <li> this is perfect, works great and so easy travel with due to is compact size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Okay so I got this to reach my hair edges that are out when i do my weave.</li>
            <li> I decided to try a mini straightener to see if that would help and so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love baby bliss products</li>
            <li> I bought this Iron because the reviews and opinions i read,.. and i have to say it filled all my expectations!</li>
            <li> Perfect for short hair.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> THAT I HAVE MORE THAN</li>
            <li> OK.  </li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention when I made a purchase.  </li>
            <li> It is so cute.</li>
            <li> The size is so handy, so light.</li>
            <li> This is certainly a wonderful mini-straightener for a comparatively low price.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have short hair, so the 1/2 inch plate is perfect.</li>
            <li> it seems like there could have been more insulation around the handle part.</li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> They work better then I thought and they arrived on time.</li>
            <li> , I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> I get worried about those metal plates getting too close to the counter top and scorching/melting/burning it.</li>
            <li> to use and store, especially handy for short hair.</li>
            <li> I found one at TJ Maxx for 10 bucks that I like better.</li>
            <li> use it for touching up my bangs after getting caught in the rain and for going out after work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I love the Baby Bliss.  </li>
            <li> I love this iron, my hair lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I have the larger version that I&#x27;ve used for years, but this one wasn&#x27;t the greatest for travel.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> Better than nothing to stick in your bag.</li>
            <li> Love this lil iron.</li>
            <li> so when I started growing it out, I needed something but didn&#x27;t see the need to invest in a big one, this travel size is just perfect.</li>
            <li> Thankfully we have a granite counter top in our bathroom</li>
            <li> Make sure you understand what that means...</li>
            <li> Just be sure to leave plenty of time to straighten your hair...</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have nappy curly frizzy hair and it gets it so silky and smooth!</li>
            <li> Again, pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Many days I straighten my hair at home, just to walk out the door &amp; find it raining</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great size and it heats up really well.</li>
            <li> Perfect for bangs, short hair, or getting close to the scalp.</li>
            <li> At home I use a 1.5 inch version of this straightener which I absolutely love.  </li>
            <li> but it is still able to get the job done.</li>
            <li> The platforms (those that are close to the heating pans) get pretty hot, but if you don&#x27;t touch those parts when using it, it is perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> it had it worked more than one time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for people with short hair</li>
            <li> Love this iron.  </li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my girl friend who enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> (Make sure you bring a plug adapter.)  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this BaBylissPro mini...</li>
            <li> Glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the most adorable straightner.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s tourmaline and this brand is one I&#x27;ve trusted for many years.</li>
            <li> Excellent travel flat iron.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron in the world</li>
            <li> This flat iron is the  best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Honestly looks are deceiving cuz it looks tiny almost like a toy but its actually amazing how good it works.</li>
            <li> The iron is perfect for medium or long hair, and for travel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Pretty good price too.</li>
            <li> I am planning a long trip and this will be great !</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, it&#x27;s portable, and the titanium surface glides nicely through my hair.  </li>

            <li> I love that it heats up quickly and straightens my hair with a nice smooth finish.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful color, works well, very light weight I use this daily not just for travel.</li>
            <li> I have also found it to be great to control frizz near my scalp.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and I&#x27;m going to enjoy the hell out of it.</li>
            <li> Good for touch ups, but doesn&#x27;t get super hot!</li>
            <li> OTHERWISE--it&#x27;s awesome-goes through my hair smoothly, heats up quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li> Other than that, very good buy!</li>
            <li> I have tried other minis and this is for me the best.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate.  </li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly too.  </li>

            <li> I opted for the BaByliss because the reviews were so strong, it was so portable and</li>
            <li> This seems to work OK, but not as well as my full sized one.</li>
            <li> Great heat up very fast and is very portable.</li>
            <li> &amp; I have FINE hair.</li>
            <li> it´s fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It straightens effectively on my fine + wavy hair.</li>

            <li> , it is just fine</li>

            <li> , I really liked is very practical.</li>
            <li> Works really great on my short hair.</li>
            <li> I had no issues with getting it to glide through my hair smoothly or burning my hair.  </li>
            <li> - this is not going to be an effective way to do your whole head of hair, ladies &amp; gents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of hair irons and stylets, this by far is the best.</li>
            <li> , YOU CAN FIT IT IN YOUR PURSE</li>
            <li> great tool for short hair.</li>
            <li> Good so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things about Babyliss irons, but this one completely fried the front of my hair.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for getting to the roots which definitely helps with keeping my hair straight between relaxers.  </li>
            <li> This straightener, being so small, is perfect for those with short hair, but it also serves as a great travel straightener.</li>
            <li> Easy to take on a trip or keep in your handbag for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li> She loves how easy it is to use, and quick.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly, and works great on my really short hair.</li>
            <li> FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE MORE HAIR THAN ANYONE.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using the BaByliss nano, and I love it.</li>
            <li> It really gets the job done! :-)</li>
            <li> Original Review - August, 2013</li>
            <li> was so excited receiving it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for me because I&#x27;m under 5&#x27; tall with small hands.</li>
            <li> I was quite pleased with the results after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I can get all around my ears almost perfectly with this because it&#x27;s so small.</li>
            <li> I have very fine straight hair.</li>
            <li> and I really want to look good for the whole day.</li>
            <li> The size, etc. are fine, but the temperature was way too hot for my fine hair, and there is no way to adjust the it.</li>
            <li> I love it how it heats up pretty much quickly.</li>
            <li> I knew it would be a great purchase since I own the bigger version of this iron which worked fantastic with my big afro</li>
            <li> she was right!</li>
            <li> TO LIKE TEN ITS HOT LOL.</li>
            <li> and it gets nice and hot fast.</li>
            <li> It really leaves your hair perfectly manageable and expensive-shiny, and creates a very sleek look in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> but it never seems to stay straight for more than five minutes.</li>
            <li> there is no temperature adjustment, the packaging stated that the iron reaches a max of 430 degrees and based upon the steam coming from it, I assume that it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> I w/still use my full size iron.</li>

            <li> and so far i used it over a year and still works fine</li>
            <li> I have short hair and this flat iron works great.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works great on my hair in the back.</li>
            <li> so it comes in very handy, but I even use it at home instead of my regular size flat iron.</li>

            <li> Needless to say, this was a great buy!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what i need.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> The same iron was about $4 more, not to mention the sales tax.</li>
            <li> This is even smaller than I pictured; okay for touch-ups</li>
            <li> It does get hot though, and was better than nothing for my recent trip overseas.</li>
            <li> I set this on my dryer while hot to avoid burning anything.  </li>
            <li> It is tiny and really cute.</li>
            <li> it gets too hot for childs hair.  </li>
            <li> They get hot n seconds....</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m paranoid, but those plates DO get pretty hot....</li>
            <li> The BaBylissPro Nano Titanium 1/2&amp;#34; Mini Iron I received is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Exterior gets way too hot and it doesn&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li> but if he is willing to get up to straighten it, then oh well.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s exactly the length of a dollar bill.</li>
            <li> it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> , exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Temperature is one setting and way too hot</li>
            <li> and the description of this item was exact.</li>
            <li> ...the paint comes off of it after awhile because it&#x27;s so hot</li>
            <li> (I have pretty thick/coarse hair)</li>
            <li> It works okay for my short hair cut, though.  </li>
            <li> but most likely will just sit and collect dust.</li>
            <li> IT DOES EXACTLY</li>
            <li> This is not  fake review</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot to me at all...</li>
            <li> and it gets hot and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li> For those with thick hair I think this will work great for you.</li>
            <li> it gets too hot.</li>
            <li> ; It gets so hot that I see steam rise from my hair after I use it.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mostly for ppl with very short hair.</li>
            <li> It gets extremely hot.</li>
            <li> It is very small - since I just got my hair cut super short it was ideal for quick use.</li>
            <li> and it fits right into your clutch for touching up your hair after a long night.</li>
            <li> read many reviews for many different flat irons and chose these and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> My hair is short in the back so this size flat iron is perfect.</li>
            <li> My hair is short for most girls, but a pretty long for most guys.</li>
            <li> I love it, but it pulls your hair if your using it at the end of the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Sooo glad I bought this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron !  </li>
            <li> All the same it is such a good buy.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is perfect for my short edges that my large flat iron can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> To make this little gadget even more amazing is how fast it heats up, it barely takes a minute.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it and worth the price</li>
            <li> It is just the right size and heats up ready fast.</li>
            <li> I got this to use on my bangs, but my hair is pretty fine (and short)</li>
            <li> I have short wavy hair and it isn&#x27;t easy as I thought it would be, but that is not the fault of the flatiron.</li>
            <li> Gets hot pretty fast, and I use it mainly on my bangs.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser strongly recommended this, since she has one and uses it daily.</li>
            <li> Also, if you style or straighten a large portion of your hair</li>
            <li> YOU SERIOUSLY MAKE THE BEST FLAT IRONS EVER.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The barrel does get very hot but there are soft rubber finger grips, so just remember where to hold it.</li>
            <li> Other flat irons are too big to try and corral my bangs, but this is the perfect size.  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful item especially for short hair, black hair....</li>
            <li> perfect, durable little flat iron - we had to get a second one because my daughter is always taking it to her bathroom ;)</li>
            <li> Nice little travel iron.</li>
            <li> I pretty much put it away and suck it up and bring my regular size straightener with me everyone since its worth it!</li>
            <li> A great little tool for short hair.</li>
            <li> This iron is obviously not meant to replace your actual straightening iron, but it&#x27;s amazing for touch ups</li>
            <li> &amp; it really heats up fast.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast, but there&#x27;s no temperature setting so you cannot adjust the temp.</li>
            <li> A WHOLE LOT</li>
            <li> BECAUSE IF IT COULD DO WONDERS ON MY HAIR, IT REALLY CAN DO WONDERS</li>
            <li> SO MUCH BABYLISS</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work for my hair, I can&#x27;t imagine it working for anyone who really needs a straightener bc of frizzy or curly hair.</li>
            <li> If I did my whole head</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair very well while I&#x27;m straightening.</li>
            <li> Heated up fast</li>
            <li> Has an on-off switch and red LED light, but is not temperature adjustable.</li>
            <li> One problem: The iron doesn&#x27;t stand up very well (like how it does in the picture here).</li>
            <li> The plates seem to catch on my hair which might be what has damaged it so much.</li>
            <li> For $20 I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> this straightener  works very well for me.</li>
            <li> it heats up fast and is very compact</li>
            <li> Very compact as well in case you want to take it with you.</li>
            <li> so I just wanted something to pull my bang straight...  </li>
            <li> Heats up really fast.</li>
            <li> I am a flight attendant</li>
            <li> Very durable and convenient.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would work real well as a travel iron.</li>
            <li> I really bought this</li>
            <li> It really does not heat up to temperature as claimed.</li>
            <li> Dual voltage really helps when you are traveling.</li>
            <li> It works really well and holds my hair.  </li>
            <li> heats up so fast.</li>
            <li> naps straight.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair to begin with</li>
            <li> and it does not get the crimp that I was really looking for..</li>
            <li> Gets my hair really straight all the way to the root, without drying it out.  </li>
            <li> I have recommended it to all my clients in need and some have even purchased while I was still styling their hair because they could believe how straight their roots could get.</li>
            <li> My hair was straight.</li>
            <li> I really like this mini</li>
            <li> I like it to much</li>
            <li> No problems gliding through my fine hair, and it&#x27;s much handier than my full-sized flat iron.</li>
            <li> This little flat iron is excellent for my short hair.</li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s still a great little flat iron esp.</li>
            <li> The flat iron works fine.</li>
            <li> The mini flat works just fine.</li>
            <li> but honestly, I have long hair and it was just too tiny and would too easily pull my fine wavy hair since it was so small.</li>
            <li> We use the iron to tame a cowlick and give her hair a nice finish.  </li>
            <li> So far I LOVE this mini flat iron!  </li>
            <li> and I love that there&#x27;s a button for you to turn it on and off, extremely convenient.</li>
            <li> After getting my haie cut into a pixie cut I had to shop around for flat iron that really fit my needs.</li>
            <li> I actually like it better than my usual hair straightener because I think it gives me more control.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this because I needed something with dual voltage for a European trip.</li>
            <li> This mighty mouse of a flat iron does just that!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s small enough to carry in your pocket book or and over nite bag so happy I bought this.</li>
            <li> Small, easy to pack and did a great job for being so small</li>
            <li> It is a nice size and worked well the one single time it actually worked.  </li>
            <li> It does get a bit hot but my hair is short and does not take long to do (I mostly do just the front.)</li>
            <li> This BaByliss is comparable in how soft and straight it leaves my hair, and for a fraction of the cost and size!</li>
            <li> I will be able to use globally and at the same time something that will not take too much room in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, not too hot like the chi, and not too cool!</li>
            <li> It is exactly the right size to fit her small hands.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to pack up and use, with the extra long cord.  </li>
            <li> IF YOU LIVE IN SOUTHEAST LOUISIANA ON THE NORTHSHORE, YOU MAY KNOW WHO I AM!  </li>
            <li> My son wanted to grow out his hair a bit, since it had always been super short (Sigh... teens...).</li>
            <li> Only wish it had a temperature range (hot or hot</li>
            <li> Works wonders especially if you use Blue Magic hair dressing</li>
            <li> Takes a little bit longer than a 1&amp;#34; straightener, but still heats up very quickly and gets really hot.</li>
            <li> Just took this little baby on my 2 week Italian vacation and with my little converter plug, it worked perfectly the whole time.</li>
            <li> However, I would not use daily or even weekly, as the temp gets very hot &amp; is not adjustable.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight, gets nice and hot and gives me a lot different look that I usually have.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> , I think it works better than my bigger flat iron.</li>
            <li> I find I use it much, much more than my regular flat iron and wanted to leave one in my travel bag and have one for home use.</li>
            <li> She said it gets hot fast and is small so easy to pack.</li>
            <li> I purchased this little flat iron to tame fly-aways and smooth my roots, so far , so good!.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to order one of the mini&#x27;s, but I think I like it even better than the full-size 1\\&quot; I had before.</li>
            <li> Love this little iron.  </li>
            <li> Love this little guy.</li>
            <li> Cute little complement to my full-size BaByliss straightener.</li>
            <li> They heat up very quickly, in a minute or less, and curl my hair very well.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was skeptical after reading all the reviews, these irons are a great product and make my hair look shiny and sleek.</li>
            <li> However, his hair is amazingly thick and wavy and stubborn, and on its own he looks like Albert Einstein with the wild hair photo - except twice as much hair.</li>
            <li> I was able to flat iron my 1/2 inch new growth with ease something I had difficulty doing with my 1 inch flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very fine hair, so the small size isn&#x27;t a hardship.</li>
            <li> and it is small so easy to handle!</li>
            <li> It get&#x27;s hot right away, so be careful</li>
            <li> This Flatiron requires minimal effort and straightens hair super fast.</li>
            <li> In other words, if the iron was really constructed with double insulation the US plug would most probably not be polarized.  </li>
            <li> Just the right size for short hair or bangs.</li>
            <li> I was only able to use it for a few minutes because it gets too hot to handle.</li>
            <li> It does not have an adjustable heat setting, so if you have brittle hair or hair that is very heat sensitive (gets fried easily), then this little iron probably isn&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine also was advertised as new, but came out the package with fingerprints and scratches and appeared to be used.</li>
            <li> I have coarse hair and it can be a real job sometimes getting my hair straight as I want</li>
            <li> I love this little straightener!</li>
            <li> I love this little iron!</li>
            <li> Very professional.</li>
            <li> My hair is very, very curly and coarse.  </li>
            <li> Since the ends of my hair still have the remnants of a perm, I need a flat iron to help smooth this new short haircut.</li>
            <li> and it is hot on the outside</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> It usually flops sideways on the counter top.</li>
            <li> have to say that it seemed to take more time than usual to receive it.  </li>
            <li> Hot enough for my stubborn hair</li>
            <li> It does get hot, only 1 setting, watch your fingers.</li>
            <li> love how small the straightener is,</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for for my daughters short hair.</li>
            <li> It takes about 1 min to get hot enough to untangle your face hair.</li>
            <li> (think Nia Long, Halle Berry hair style) and I need an iron that is small, gets really hot and easy to handle - this is it!  </li>
            <li> so I thought this little one would be easy to handle and control</li>
            <li> This product works great for my short hair- especially getting the little hairs in the back close to the scalp/neck.</li>
            <li> It heated up quickly, and was very hot, but didn&#x27;t work as well as my Chi on my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I use my larger flat iron for the rest of my hair, but this really does the trick for those fine, short hairs.</li>
            <li> However, as previous reviewers have mentioned, the hair does not glide smoothly between the plates.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this iron about a week ago, thinking this would be a nice small version of the larger one (which my stylist uses)</li>
            <li> It would never work in someone&#x27;s thick hair, you cant fit much hair in it!</li>
            <li> This flat iron can give body to the hair more so than any other.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is not being able to regulate the temperature.</li>
            <li> Flat iron gets too hot to hold.</li>
            <li> They are pretty small but my hair is about 3 inches long on top and the irons are just</li>
            <li> This was my first mini flat iron.</li>
            <li> This flat iron get hot as H-E-double hockey sticks.  </li>
            <li> But if you need something quick for your bangs or short hair, this is definitely it.</li>
            <li> Wanted to thank all the previous reviews - it really helped me to make the right choice for what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I cut off all my hair and needed something to smooth out the little curl I get at times.</li>
            <li> People with bigger hands may find this a little challenging to maneuver.</li>
            <li> I love my mini BaByliss it works well on my edges and hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> It does heat quickly so for me I use about 45 seconds after it&#x27;s been plugged in so its not extremely hot.</li>
            <li> My BKT new growth would not be as straight as it is w/o this flat iron.</li>
            <li> But, I would not recommend for frequent use.</li>
            <li> and I thought, wow I should get one of those things.</li>
            <li> I went to a professional beauty supply store where you must be licensed to buy items there.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and enjoy traveling with it.</li>
            <li> Wow, I got a deal.  </li>
            <li> Heat up fast and very portable to take on domestic and international trips.</li>
            <li> I have Asian pin straight hair</li>
            <li> I use it to straighten my edges when I have protective style (weave) in my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I like this so much that I&#x27;m ordering a second one to keep in my office.</li>
            <li> but this is the only one that get those edges straight.</li>
            <li> It takes too long to see a good result with such a small plate.</li>
            <li> If I can find one with heat settings I like and have good reviews and not to expensive</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t cool down nearly as fast.</li>
            <li> I have always had these short little baby hairs on the sides of my head that I&#x27;ve never been able to really straighten with a regular-sized flat iron.</li>
            <li> Love this little flat iron!</li>
            <li> I went to a hair stylist who recommended this cute little flat iron to take care of those hairs, and it works so well!</li>
            <li> The iron was easy to glide through my hair but it was too small.  </li>
            <li> I have fine coarse Asian hair and as I&#x27;m trying to grow it long, the ends tends to curl up.</li>
            <li> I can plug it in, dampen my bangs and the flat iron is ready.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is a must for getting those roots straight with one passing.</li>
            <li> it does get pretty hot, so you may want to pack a pot holder or small towel to wrap it in if you need to do your hair and pack up, other than that it was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> If you want to buy a real BaByliss flat iron go on their website!</li>
            <li> this is the most ridiculous smallest straigtener..</li>
            <li> It is good for thick coarse hair but not for fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> and when I ran it through my hair it would straighten it a little bit,  but not the way the full version does.  </li>
            <li> I got this to add some texture to my super thick, straight, pixie-cut hair.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s one way to cool it down faster!</li>
            <li> I have very short, fine hair and this speedy little iron</li>
            <li> I have really long straight hair</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it for people with long hair as it&#x27;s going to take forever for you to straighten your hair.</li>
            <li> Wanted something small and light that I could take to Europe</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty powerful for such a small iron.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re like me, your whole head gets nappy after a long trip anywhere.</li>
            <li> I think it would take too long to do my whole head.</li>
            <li> Even though he had his hair straightened to calm it down  </li>
            <li> ; mini iron had made all the difference in allowing him to calm down the remaining wave and have the hair be presentable in public.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I lived in a dry climate, I was able to mostly tame the cowlick with hair products.</li>
            <li> love this tiny little flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is usually done to keep the hot side of the circuitry away from the user (for example, in screw-in type incandescent light sockets it is the center button terminal that is hot, so the outer metal threads on the incandescent bulb is not hot).  </li>
            <li> The BKT that I use instructs that the hair be flat ironed at high heat to seal the BKT into the hair.</li>
            <li> Worked very well with a simple converter on a recent trip to Germany and Belgium.</li>
            <li> I really like the short barrel because it works well with short hair.</li>
            <li> For that reason, maybe it&#x27;s not something you want to use for everyday, but just as a quick straightening device, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the butt of the cord attached to the straightening is does not swivel, so it&#x27;s a bit awkward setting it down, but none the less it&#x27;s still a great product :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using a normal flat iron for it</li>
            <li> The exterior doesn&#x27;t get hot like my other one either, so I no longer burn my hand while using it.</li>
            <li> I have three other BaByliss irons, but this one doesn&#x27;t get hot as the others, so doesn&#x27;t work all that well.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed with this small iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, compact, heats up great - but note that it is only 1/2 an inch thick.  </li>
            <li> I had used other brand iron like Gama and Hot Tool</li>
            <li> Extremely hot you have to be very careful with it</li>
            <li> The cord itself is the bulkiest thing about it, but it&#x27;s not one of those super stiff cords and you could probably save additional space by winding it around the appliance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It heats up rapidly (around a minute) to about 430 degrees fahrenheit, and its titanium makeup is much better for hair than other materials that may snag or damage hair or heat it unevenly.</li>
            <li> I hate to say I really don&#x27;t do a very good job using it.</li>
            <li> It is very small and easy to carry in my make up bag when traveling.</li>
            <li> I let him use my Chi straightener, but the 1 inch plate was simply too much for him to use on hair that was 1-3 inches long.</li>
            <li> and since I am in the middle of transition ( relaxed to natural)</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised with the size, as it turned out to be smaller than I had thought.  </li>
            <li> so when using an adapter there with this iron you lose the polarization that the manufacturer apparently intended for this iron.  </li>
            <li> and I think I spent as much on a case as I did on the iron.</li>
            <li> Tired of hauling around my straightening iron in my purse, I&#x27;ve been looking for something more practical that fits in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> It packed small and worked so well that upon returning home I decided to order a full size one to start using at home.</li>
            <li> Agree with other reviewers that this is good for travel due to the small size of the unit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not big on styling my hair, I prefer to leave it as natural as I can bare to leave it, however my bangs always want to stand up on end in the mornings, so I bought this mini/travel size flat iron in order to calm them down before I go off to work.</li>
            <li> It gets hot immediately like 30 seconds or less</li>
            <li> But European plugs are typically not polarized and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and compact and gets the job done quickly.  </li>
            <li> This straightens my thick wavy hair better than my larger and more expensive irons.</li>
            <li> My hair is abundant but very thin with no body, so I&#x27;ve used curling irons for years.</li>
            <li> I was worried because it was so much cheaper than all the others, but decided to take the risk after reading the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> This product is very small and could fit in your purse easity.</li>
            <li> This is by far the smallest flat iron I have ever see.  </li>
            <li> I was new to the flat iron since I&#x27;ve worn my hair short for 15 yrs.</li>
            <li> but I need some weight and dept to this product so I can do my natural african american hair</li>
            <li> We have natural African American hair and it makes our edges look like we relaxed our hair.</li>
            <li> Though, definitely worth it if you&#x27;re looking for something small and quick to straighten small sections of hair with.</li>
            <li> recommended for ironing tweaks to travel and people with thin or scanty hair, heat is powerful and very practical.</li>
            <li> I have to use this thing at least twice as long as my normal straightener because it doesn&#x27;t get vEry hot.</li>
            <li> This darling little thing is EXACTLY what I needed to fix the problem areas.</li>
            <li> A little to hot for what I needed</li>
            <li> Although the iron is small it heats up very quickly and you get the same result as if you would by using your regular size flat iron, for about the same duration of time.</li>
            <li> well it has these little pads right around the middle for your fingers - if you use these you won&#x27;t burn your fingers or get any blue on them.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair very short and this iron has just the right size blades to give a little extra body and shine to it.</li>
            <li> I had to return a flatiron because it didn&#x27;t heat up hot enough for coarse black hair.  </li>
            <li> I only rated it 4 stars because it gets a little to hot for my hair.</li>
            <li> Its super mini and hard to hold in your hand to do anything to your hair.</li>
            <li> The only challenge is that with the small size you have to have some patience because it simply takes bit longer than with your full size flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Since I recently decided to transition from relaxed to my natural 4b hair, I needed a flat iron that gets really hot, is small enough to maneuever and gets close to the scalp.</li>
            <li> I am not a flat iron person</li>
            <li> but I guess I am not a flat iron person.  </li>
            <li> My hair is super thick and short.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast (a couple minutes to full heat) and is small enough to get around small patches of hair without burning yourself.</li>
            <li> My only rather large complaint is the on light is not very bright.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t typically need a high setting.</li>
            <li> once it&#x27;s air dried  - pull my bangs out straight with this flat iron in 5 - 10 mins..</li>
            <li> I use to think I needed a flat iron that had a switch to convert from 110 to 220, but since this adapts to the European current automatically, I don&#x27;t have to be concerned about forgetting to switch it.</li>
            <li> I only use it for my roots and use my larger flat iron for the remainder of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have owned three Conair flat irons of the same size, and they&#x27;ve all quit working after 3-6 months.  </li>
            <li> I cut my hair and needed a smaller Flat iron.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to another flat iron ever.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical when i bought it, since I already had the regular size Nano flat iron.</li>
            <li> I like this BabylissPro mini flat iron, it doesn&#x27;t have the power of the larger BabylissPro Nano Titanium</li>
            <li> I use it to do my daughter&#x27;s hair (1/2 Af-Am) by using it to get to the roots, then I use my regular flat iron to straighten the rest of her hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this one since I wanted a smaller flat iron for travel instead of taking my Chi everywhere.  </li>
            <li> However, this flat iron struggled to straighten even my short hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of these tiny flat irons</li>
            <li> This mini-straightener may be small, but it certainly packs a punch.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A TINY FLAT IRON LIKE FOR A DOLL!!</li>
            <li> or the humidity is so high, that it was a waste of time.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard not to touch the hot part-</li>
            <li> and it is so small that there isn&#x27;t really any way to hold it without getting burnt.</li>
            <li> My friend is a stylist and one day after he cut my hair, I asked him about using a flat iron like he does on his hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron to use specifically for at home brazilian keratin treatments.</li>
            <li> - I think it works well for a travel flat iron and</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron a while ago but never got around to writing the review.  </li>
            <li> I got this mini flat iron for my daughter and I to flat iron our edges.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron to replace my Chi.</li>
            <li> this is my 1st flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I also purchased the 1 inch ultra slim flat iron as well for my ends and styling.</li>
            <li> I just dampen my bangs with water, pull the flat iron through</li>
            <li> THIS FLAT IRON</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this flat iron to anyone who is looking to buy a 1/2&amp;#34; iron.</li>
            <li> flat iron user</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping this one will last as long.</li>
            <li> Have had this flat iron before and payed twice the price.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked to make my hair behave until I found this mini flat iron.</li>
            <li> It also only takes about five strokes and my bangs stay flat for a really long time.</li>
            <li> I own a very expensive, salon-quality flat iron.</li>
            <li> You could, though, if you don&#x27;t have a ton of hair and were willing to go slowly and take the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had brought this because my full sized babybliss iron was broken by my mom stepping on it,  </li>
            <li> Nothing fancy here, just a travel flat iron that can be used in Europe!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this flat iron!</li>
            <li> Mostly use for my bangs and it is so narrow it can straighten them without the dreaded &amp;#34;poof.&amp;#34; I have course, thick hair with Brazilain Blowout Straightening and this little flat iron works like a charm (I blow dry the rest of my hair with a large round brush).</li>
            <li> Small size can make everyday styling difficult as your hand will cramp up over time, but for travel as intended, great iron.</li>
            <li> so I shouldn&#x27;t been surprised by this little number.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product but do want to let people know that this is REALLY small.</li>
            <li> So far, this Babyliss Pro Nano hasn&#x27;t let me down!</li>
            <li> so it takes too long to straighten</li>
            <li> and when I do it is only minimal so this will work for now;</li>
            <li> /&gt;The BaByliss doesn&#x27;t take long to heat up - about 30 seconds</li>
            <li> I have long in use it, and work  correctly.</li>
            <li> The bigger irons have a tendency to be harder to manipulate.  </li>
            <li> Careful not to burn yourself as this is very tiny.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to straighten really long hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well it would be for long hair.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is there is no clasp or clip to keep it closed</li>
            <li> I would not recommend for really long hair.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair or a lot of hair then this is not for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to having this on my long trip, since I can&#x27;t pack a full-size iron.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thick hair that needs that much heat.</li>
            <li> but I think a more one will be less expensive in the end...</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a full size, dual voltage flat iron with a heat-resistant cover to aid with traveling because this BaBlyiss was just useless.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not HOT at all or not enough for me to straigtening out my hair</li>
            <li> This is a very small and convenient straight iron.</li>
            <li> I read some other reviews that say they burned their fingers using it and that the blue came off on their fingers -</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll go with the other one again.</li>
            <li> (one prong is larger than the other)</li>
            <li> The only reason I took a star is due to the size-</li>
            <li> I had a larger flat iron but it was hard to use on my short hair &amp; left my hair sticking out.  </li>
            <li> I have very long curly &amp;#34;Shakira&amp;#34; hair and</li>
            <li> - it waves up when I air dry...</li>
            <li> I have very short, thin and really frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Aside from the fact that it&#x27;s small, and can reach the root of my bangs where those unruly hairs are (the only reason I got this and gave it 2 stars), it barely holds a heat at all.</li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t flat iron my entire head with this little guy, but it works for the styling I need to do (bangs, crown and sides).  </li>
            <li> EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT HAS DONE ANYTHING TO MY HAIR FOR ME, CUT OR COLOR OR WHATEVER, HAS TOLD ME</li>
            <li> The big one can&#x27;t quite tame the halo of psycho frizz along my hairline, but the mini can get close enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> The cord is a decent length, like 4 feet (in the description it says 6 inches, but I think they mean the length of the iron itself), so no worries there.</li>
            <li> the temperature is not adjustable and it takes a longer than usual time before it completely warms up.</li>
            <li> unfortunately I could not afford to replace my full size one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to flatten my curly roots too, other flat irons just don&#x27;t get close enough!</li>
            <li> I am black with short hair</li>
            <li> and it actually heats up to 430degree, which is needed for Black hair.  </li>
            <li> I unplug it when not in use and only use it 1-2 times a week for less then 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> ; light is on one side, so if you put it down the wrong way you might leave it on by accident.</li>
            <li> I wanted something small to just do my bangs instead of using a regular flat iron.</li>
            <li> I tried it the morning before work and there was no way I was going to finish in 30 minutes with this tiny little thing.  </li>
            <li> Small tiny flat iron that packs a lot of heat and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I emailed the seller and will update with their response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background: I use this to straighten the little hairs on the back of my pixie cut.</li>
            <li> it is hard to use on adult hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that its only heat setting is &amp;#34;scorching.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> so be careful when using it.</li>
            <li> No auto shut off, so be careful.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected</li>
            <li> There is no temperature adjustment and no clasp or lock for keeping it closed when not in use, but that wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, not course transitioning african american shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> Only down side ( yup there is a down  side)</li>
            <li> Not recommended for dry hair long or heavy</li>
            <li> this little flat iron</li>
            <li> It´s a very very small flat iron and it´s not even an inch wide, if you want it only for your bangs or if you want to spend hours with it getting your hair done</li>
            <li> This is not real at all!</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Initially when I received the product I thought it was too small.  </li>
            <li> It was difficult to transport in my bag when it was hot, so I had to buy a case for it.  </li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t have any other exp.</li>
            <li> I will buy other items from this brand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No... Color rubs off and it&#x27;s just like all other irons in supply store</li>
            <li> opted for this brand after reading reviews about other babyliss products.</li>
            <li> I like the small length of the product but the blades should be no smaller than an inch for my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve has the same one in the past and used to it&#x27;s dying day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough that I can grab the hairs around my nape.</li>
            <li> so I needed a flat iron small enough to travel with for small touch ups and</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first, this little iron does the job and takes up minimal space.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small flat iron</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t clamp tight, hair slips out and holding it closed</li>
            <li> size, I currently have the 1.5&amp;#34; and it has worked wonders for me in the past, now i have it&#x27;s little mini me to go with it.</li>
            <li> (we didn&#x27;t want the Japanese straightening because it is so hard on hair)</li>
            <li> - I feel like I have to hold it down extra hard</li>
            <li> NOT ONLY DO I HAVE A LOT OF HAIR, BUT IT HAS THICK CURLS.  </li>
            <li> I have very short thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with my bangs.  </li>
            <li> Basically threw the money down the drain.</li>
            <li> Did work on overseas outlets without a step down converter though.</li>
            <li> AND IF YOU START GETTING A LOT OF SALES FROM DOWN HERE, YES, IT IS BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME</li>
            <li> I always had to pace myself to ensure that it cooled down before I could pack it</li>
            <li> meaning that one side is hot and the other is cold.  </li>
            <li> the heating plate is half the size in width AND length than your average 1\\&quot; straightener.  </li>
            <li> With this iron a can get my hair done in about 20-25 minutes with little effort, I must say though that the iron is really little and thin so you can only take little strands of hair at once, so if you have a lot of hair you might want to consider getting one that&#x27;s bigger because otherwise you might lose your patience.</li>
            <li> If you have chin/shoulder length hair and want to get your hair done in less than an hour, then this straightner is not for you.  </li>
            <li> I showed my friend and he could not believe that I could get it for less at Amazon than what he could get it for.   </li>
            <li> For less than $20 you can&#x27;t beat it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this seems to be typical.</li>
            <li> It takes up less space and is easier to pull out to use.</li>
            <li> its dual voltage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought a small flat iron would suffice since I have thin Chinese hair</li>
            <li> This thing also gets crazy hot to the touch</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have to mess with voltage issues.  </li>
            <li> At first I was afraid that I would burn myself, but that has not happened.  </li>
            <li> not good for curly coarse hair</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed... rather light weight</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and this worked like a charm.  </li>
            <li> It will take a very long time to do your hair if you have a thick head of hair...</li>
            <li> I use little claw clips to separate my hair and keep the rest out of the way while I do a side at a time.</li>
            <li> I just had my hair cut to a little shorter than shoulder length.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it, waste of money.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> a few times</li>
            <li> on I have had ..both stopped working within a few months..</li>
            <li> was a little to small.</li>
            <li> his short hair was MUCH less time-consuming and expensive -</li>
            <li> A smaller bunch of hair straightens quicker and keeps you from getting frustrated when you keep doing the same piece over and over.</li>
            <li> which is super annoying because I find paint chips in my hair.</li>
            <li> does very little.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> YOUR BABYLISS IRONS SERIOUSLY CUT MY STRAIGHTENING TIME IN HALF</li>
            <li> Its way to small.</li>
            <li> I have been using it at home just to check it out before taking it on vacation and, because I just got a haircut and my hair is shorter than usual</li>
            <li> The straightening plate itself is small</li>
            <li> It works well for making small ringlets and I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning her like I would with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> but I have a travel iron that is not this small.  </li>
            <li> I needed a small iron for my gym bag.  </li>
            <li> Another thing about the size is the fact that the grip section is small-</li>
            <li> ITS REALLY SMALL</li>
            <li> Is a bit small</li>
            <li> not what I thought too small</li>
            <li> It is small and practical.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so small...</li>
            <li> Small and works as described.</li>
            <li> I knew it was going to be small, but not that small.</li>
            <li> so small and convenient.</li>
            <li> But if you need something small to travel with and do touch ups, this will work.  </li>
            <li> The trick is doing small clumps at a time.</li>
            <li> Also, because it&#x27;s so small it doesn&#x27;t have settings, just on and off.  </li>
            <li> Will recommend this product to anyone looking for a small straighting iron.</li>
            <li> I thought the 1st was just a defective product but when the 2nd one failed I understood there is defective switch.</li>
            <li> Well, is small and if you wanna do all your hair you will need time</li>
            <li> Even with thick hair, you can use this (it just takes a few run throughs).</li>
            <li> Small and compact.</li>
            <li> It is really small -</li>
            <li> I can tame my cowlick in under a minute and my hair behaves for the rest of the day (at least 14 hours).</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my trip to Europe and tried it before hand, it was really hard to use and just way too small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a small one</li>
            <li> and I hate that the thumb rest gets too hot.  </li>
            <li> My hair is hard to straighten but Babyliss always gets it done.</li>
            <li> bob to straighten out the few weird little waves and bedhead</li>
            <li> AT LEAST.  </li>
            <li> This item I keep in my purse for when I am running late to work</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of thick hair, this will never do the job for you.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick</li>
            <li> Too small for a gift!</li>
            <li> Very very very small.</li>
            <li> this is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Seriously, im legit.</li>
            <li> Not good ... Give it away</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Not functioning after 2 use, poor quality</li>
            <li> it is not ideal.</li>
            <li> Not impressed by this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I bought it.  </li>
            <li> THE UNFORTUNATE PART IS</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting the cord and letting my son pretend</li>
            <li> When I got it in the mail, I was very very disappointed at how small it is.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, the &amp;#34;return window&amp;#34; ran out :(  </li>
            <li> Now I can use my BaBylissPro once I get to work &amp; not have to worry about looking like a mad scientist.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I am disappointed</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I got this.</li>
            <li> this thing is worthless.</li>
            <li> I hate that feeling of &amp;#34;did</li>
            <li> it covers your hand every time you use it, sort of just annoying.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I also have a terrible cowlick.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this is the most ridiculous smallest straigtener.. I have very short hair &amp; this thing is worthless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. The other reviews say it can get very hot but to be honest it&#x27;s not HOT at all or not enough for me to straigtening out my hair &amp; I have FINE hair.</li>
            <li> It is a lot smaller that I had anticipated.  It is screaming hot, and there is no way to adjust, but It does glide effortlessly through my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very short, thin and really frizzy hair. With this iron a can get my hair done in about 20-25 minutes with little effort, I must say though that the iron is really little and thin so you can only take little strands of hair at once, so if you have a lot of hair you might want to consider getting one that&#x27;s bigger because otherwise you might lose your patience.</li>
            <li> This flat iron was perfect for a trip to Europe where packing lightly was essential. It doesnt work quite as well as my full sized babybliss, but still did a great job straightening my otherwise wavy hair.</li>
            <li> This Flatiron requires minimal effort and straightens hair super fast. I have AA 4B hair and it straightens it so quickly and always adds shine. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Okay so I got this to reach my hair edges that are out when i do my weave. Its pretty good actually. But dont turn it on and leave it. It gets hot immediately like 30 seconds or less and it is hot on the outside so be careful when using it. If you get one of the heat resistant gloves you should be good to go. And oh yeah when it clamps the plates dont touch.</li>
            <li> I had a great FHI that I lost at a casino, and then I had a less-desirable Remington that made my hair meh. So I picked this up, hoping for the perfect gloss look. I&#x27;ve got very fine hair, so the small size isn&#x27;t a hardship. It really leaves your hair perfectly manageable and expensive-shiny, and creates a very sleek look in a short amount of time. It&#x27;s ideal for travel, but I anticipate this replacing the full-sized Remington model I have since it makes my hair look so much better. A good, cheap alternative to full-sized models. Probably great for bangs, too.</li>
            <li> Every hair is properly ironed</li>
            <li> I loved this too! I am black with short hair (think Nia Long, Halle Berry hair style) and I need an iron that is small, gets really hot and easy to handle - this is it!  I knew it would be a great purchase since I own the bigger version of this iron which worked fantastic with my big afro (before I cut my hair)  If tried other ones and honestly nothing compares!</li>
            <li> This is a very small and convenient straight iron. I use it to help control my beard, and it seems to do the trick. The cord is a decent length, like 4 feet (in the description it says 6 inches, but I think they mean the length of the iron itself), so no worries there. It heats up fast (a couple minutes to full heat) and is small enough to get around small patches of hair without burning yourself. It&#x27;s a tolerable low-key color, too, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Not good ... Give it away</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still going, I take it when I travel. So compact!</li>
            <li> I have really long straight hair but my bangs are incredibly unruly. I&#x27;ve tried using a normal flat iron for it but it never seems to stay straight for more than five minutes. I decided to try a mini straightener to see if that would help and so glad I did. This iron heats up super fast and I love that there&#x27;s a button for you to turn it on and off, extremely convenient. It also only takes about five strokes and my bangs stay flat for a really long time. I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it for people with long hair as it&#x27;s going to take forever for you to straighten your hair. But if you need something quick for your bangs or short hair, this is definitely it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this little flat iron to tame fly-aways and smooth my roots, so far , so good!. I love baby bliss products so I shouldn&#x27;t been surprised by this little number. It get&#x27;s hot right away, so be careful, it&#x27;s light weight and since I am in the middle of transition ( relaxed to natural) this flat iron does a good job in keep my roots in tack. Only down side ( yup there is a down  side) there is no temperature adjustment, the packaging stated that the iron reaches a max of 430 degrees and based upon the steam coming from it, I assume that it&#x27;s true. Needless to say, this was a great buy!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. I have thick hair so it takes too long to straighten</li>
            <li> If you want to take 40 minutes to straighten your hair, this is it! :/ Not impressed by this. Basically threw the money down the drain. My suggestion is don&#x27;t buy... I have very easy to style hair (like it takes curl and straightening well, and it took me forever to get straight hair using this!</li>
            <li> Good so far but the light no longer comes on.... Still working tho</li>
            <li> I bought this Iron because the reviews and opinions i read,.. and i have to say it filled all my expectations! I reall y recommend it and the bigger versions.</li>
            <li> This was such a great buy.  I love my new straightener.  It has worked perfectly for me.  I was worried because it was so much cheaper than all the others, but decided to take the risk after reading the other reviews.  It was such a great buy.  It does exactly what i need.  It&#x27;s great to have an iron that can do the job of a full size, and still be small enough to take it on vacation with me and have fabulous hair.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This flat iron, because of its width, is perfect for my short hair.  It heats up quickly, it&#x27;s portable, and the titanium surface glides nicely through my hair.  I have owned three Conair flat irons of the same size, and they&#x27;ve all quit working after 3-6 months.  So far, this Babyliss Pro Nano hasn&#x27;t let me down!</li>
            <li> I love it how it heats up pretty much quickly. I have classes in the morning and I really want to look good for the whole day. This iron definitely gets the hair done.</li>
            <li> Good for touch ups, but doesn&#x27;t get super hot!</li>
            <li> Great heat up very fast and is very portable. Great for anyone with short lenght hair. Because of the heat the blue paint come off of the hair straightener.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it, waste of money. It&#x27;s too smal.</li>
            <li> This is what my stylist uses and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase and I love the shine it leaves!</li>
            <li> Works great with my hair. My only gripe is that it has no heat regulation. My hair slides right through smoothly. It never feels like it is overheating my hair, burning or causing any heat damage. It is very small and easy to carry in my make up bag when traveling.</li>
            <li> After getting my haie cut into a pixie cut I had to shop around for flat iron that really fit my needs. I have to admit I was skeptical after reading all the reviews, these irons are a great product and make my hair look shiny and sleek.</li>
            <li> It´s a very very small flat iron and it´s not even an inch wide, if you want it only for your bangs or if you want to spend hours with it getting your hair done it´s fine.</li>
            <li> These are the best minis ive used very gentle on my hair i love them</li>
            <li> Love it!!  Size is right, works great and priced nicely.  Told a friend about it and now she has also ordered one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a recent trip to Italy and it worked well. I have thick, long hair so it was rather taxing to use because of it&#x27;s size. It heated up quickly, and was very hot, but didn&#x27;t work as well as my Chi on my thick hair. I did appreciate, however, that it could be used with an adapter, and without a converter.</li>
            <li> My stylist told me this was the same one they used in salon &amp; the quality was good...she was right! I like the smaller size &amp; it really heats up fast. I will reccomend to friends.</li>
            <li> Perfect for short hair. It does exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Works great in Germany with an adapter.  Takes a little bit longer than a 1&amp;#34; straightener, but still heats up very quickly and gets really hot.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Nice and hot tool to straighten edges and short hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron about a week ago, thinking this would be a nice small version of the larger one (which my stylist uses) but I was disappointed. It heats up fast, but there&#x27;s no temperature setting so you cannot adjust the temp. Mine also was advertised as new, but came out the package with fingerprints and scratches and appeared to be used. I don&#x27;t style my own hair a lot and when I do it is only minimal so this will work for now; But, I would not recommend for frequent use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and compact and gets the job done quickly.  The price is good and it serves its purpose, like it..</li>
            <li> It is great.  Easy to operate.  Works great on short hair.  Easy to take on a trip or keep in your handbag for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li> The iron is perfect for medium or long hair, and for travel.&lt;br /&gt;I am still in the practice mode. I hate to say I really don&#x27;t do a very good job using it. I don&#x27;t know how, but I am learning. I have short wavy hair and it isn&#x27;t easy as I thought it would be, but that is not the fault of the flatiron. I like the fact that I don&#x27;t get burned using it.&lt;br /&gt;I would reccommend.</li>
            <li> Very very very small. Like if you&#x27;re hair is longer than a couple inches this is ridiculous. Did work on overseas outlets without a step down converter though.</li>
            <li> The small size of this iron is great for travel or saving space. Durable, heats up quickly, great for short hair.</li>
            <li> If you have chin/shoulder length hair and want to get your hair done in less than an hour, then this straightner is not for you.  I tried it the morning before work and there was no way I was going to finish in 30 minutes with this tiny little thing.  Heats up quick but I need some weight and dept to this product so I can do my natural african american hair well and in 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Small and compact, works great.</li>
            <li> this is perfect, works great and so easy travel with due to is compact size.</li>
            <li> My friend is a stylist and one day after he cut my hair, I asked him about using a flat iron like he does on his hair. I&#x27;d never had it done before. In about 4 minutes, my hair was nice and straight and I thought, wow I should get one of those things. He used the same iron for himself and guys with shorter hair. I went to a professional beauty supply store where you must be licensed to buy items there. The same iron was about $4 more, not to mention the sales tax. I used the amazon shopping app on my iPhone and scanned the iron and it came in cheaper, no sales tax and free shipping. I showed my friend and he could not believe that I could get it for less at Amazon than what he could get it for.   It&#x27;s a perfect size for shorter hair. Very lightweight, gets nice and hot and gives me a lot different look that I usually have. I love this thing. It is well worth the $20, which is about the price of a haircut. It probably is too small for longer hair, but it works great on mine.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU BABYLISS!  YOU SERIOUSLY MAKE THE BEST FLAT IRONS EVER.  I ACTUALLY HAVE 2 OF THIS SPECIFIC IRON AND A BIGGER TITANIUM FROM Y&#x27;ALL.  I USED THE CHI FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS, AND IT DID THE JOB, BUT I BURNED MYSELF A WHOLE LOT AND IT TOOK FOREVER TO GET THE JOB DONE.  LET ME TELL YOU.  FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE MORE HAIR THAN ANYONE.  EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT HAS DONE ANYTHING TO MY HAIR FOR ME, CUT OR COLOR OR WHATEVER, HAS TOLD ME THAT I HAVE MORE THAN THEY HAVE EVER WORKED WITH.  NOT ONLY DO I HAVE A LOT OF HAIR, BUT IT HAS THICK CURLS.  IF YOU LIVE IN SOUTHEAST LOUISIANA ON THE NORTHSHORE, YOU MAY KNOW WHO I AM!  YOUR BABYLISS IRONS SERIOUSLY CUT MY STRAIGHTENING TIME IN HALF AT LEAST.  I THINK BECAUSE NOW I HAVE AN INVERTED-BOB HAIR CUT, I USE THIS LITTLE ONE THE MOST AND SO LOVE IT.  I HAVE PUSHED THE BABYLISS NAME TO EVERYONE I KNOW BECAUSE IF IT COULD DO WONDERS ON MY HAIR, IT REALLY CAN DO WONDERS ON ANYBODY&#x27;S HAIR.  OK.  THANK YOU SO MUCH BABYLISS AND IF YOU START GETTING A LOT OF SALES FROM DOWN HERE, YES, IT IS BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME WHAT I USE TO STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR!  THANK YOU AS WELL AMAZON</li>
            <li> This is even smaller than I pictured; okay for touch-ups but that&#x27;s about it. It does get hot though, and was better than nothing for my recent trip overseas. (I bought it for the dual wattage option.)</li>
            <li> I have very fine straight hair. I do not even need a straightener but I like to use it to straighten just the end of my hair. I have to use this thing at least twice as long as my normal straightener because it doesn&#x27;t get vEry hot. It is a great size for traveling but I am disappointed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it doesn&#x27;t work for my hair, I can&#x27;t imagine it working for anyone who really needs a straightener bc of frizzy or curly hair. Try something else!</li>
            <li> Works well and leaves my hair straightened and with body.  I bought these to try out before the big purchase of the larger ones.  Definitely will purchase the others.</li>
            <li> It was not at like I pictured it, but its my fault for not paying attention. Its way to small.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using the BaByliss nano, and I love it. It really gets the job done! :-)</li>
            <li> I love this little straightener! Worked very well with a simple converter on a recent trip to Germany and Belgium. Although smaller, it compares well to my Chi in terms of heat and function. I will be bringing it along everywhere I travel in the future!</li>
            <li> This is not real at all! If you want to buy a real BaByliss flat iron go on their website!</li>
            <li> I like it but only thing I don&#x27;t like about this iron :  this does not have heat setting.  This iron can not go lower heat than what it said.  It is good for thick coarse hair but not for fine, thin hair.  I should have paid more attention when I made a purchase.  Price was great, I love Babyliss product, so I keep this iron but I will look for another mini iron comes with different heat setting.</li>
            <li> Love this little flat iron! Pleasantly surprised with the size, as it turned out to be smaller than I had thought.  It heats quickly and does the job brilliantly.</li>
            <li> It is so cute. The size is so handy, so light. I knocked off a star coz the temperature is not adjustable and it takes a longer than usual time before it completely warms up. All the same it is such a good buy. I dont iron all parts of my hair, just the front and ends so this size is perfect for me!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron to use specifically for at home brazilian keratin treatments. The BKT that I use instructs that the hair be flat ironed at high heat to seal the BKT into the hair. Since I recently decided to transition from relaxed to my natural 4b hair, I needed a flat iron that gets really hot, is small enough to maneuever and gets close to the scalp. This mighty mouse of a flat iron does just that! I was able to flat iron my 1/2 inch new growth with ease something I had difficulty doing with my 1 inch flat iron. My BKT new growth would not be as straight as it is w/o this flat iron.</li>
            <li> This mini-straightener may be small, but it certainly packs a punch. It heats up rapidly (around a minute) to about 430 degrees fahrenheit, and its titanium makeup is much better for hair than other materials that may snag or damage hair or heat it unevenly. This straightener, being so small, is perfect for those with short hair, but it also serves as a great travel straightener. This is certainly a wonderful mini-straightener for a comparatively low price.</li>
            <li> Love it. Heats up fast and is perfect for my bangs and traveling. No auto shut off, so be careful. I set this on my dryer while hot to avoid burning anything.  If I did my whole head I&#x27;d buy the larger one, too.</li>
            <li> I like everything about this flatiron except for the grip - I feel like I have to hold it down extra hard and it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair very well while I&#x27;m straightening. Other than that, it heats up quickly and works great on my bangs.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair and needed a smaller Flat iron. I am so happy I found the babyliss in a 1/2&amp;#34; size, I currently have the 1.5&amp;#34; and it has worked wonders for me in the past, now i have it&#x27;s little mini me to go with it.</li>
            <li> Original Review - August, 2013 - I think it works well for a travel flat iron and the size is perfect. It is tiny and really cute. It does get a bit hot but my hair is short and does not take long to do (I mostly do just the front.) I read some other reviews that say they burned their fingers using it and that the blue came off on their fingers - well it has these little pads right around the middle for your fingers - if you use these you won&#x27;t burn your fingers or get any blue on them. I have been using it at home just to check it out before taking it on vacation and, because I just got a haircut and my hair is shorter than usual, I think it works better than my bigger flat iron. For longer hair it won&#x27;t be better but should be adequate for travel. For less than $20 you can&#x27;t beat it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - March 18, 2014 - I liked it so much I ordered a second one. I find I use it much, much more than my regular flat iron and wanted to leave one in my travel bag and have one for home use. If it had temperature control it would be totally perfect. Without it, it&#x27;s still good for me.</li>
            <li> I love it, but it pulls your hair if your using it at the end of the flat iron.</li>
            <li> Received this today, used it and love it! I have short hair, so the 1/2 inch plate is perfect. Heated up fast and it is small so easy to handle!</li>
            <li> Extremely hot you have to be very careful with it</li>
            <li> it gets too hot for childs hair.  it is hard to use on adult hair.</li>
            <li> love this tiny little flat iron. it&#x27;s great! leaves my bangs looking awesome and gets close to the roots. my only problem is that it gets really hot to the point where you cant hold it without using some kind of towel or oven mitt type barrier. it seems like there could have been more insulation around the handle part. but i wouldn&#x27;t consider that a deterrent from buying it--it&#x27;s still a great little flat iron esp. for the price</li>
            <li> They get hot n seconds.... I have very short thick hair. These babyliss pros did the job plus some... I love them and I&#x27;m very happy I purchased them.&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t have any complaints. They work better then I thought and they arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I hate that feeling of &amp;#34;did I turn off my iron&amp;#34; so I wish this one had an auto off system like my curling iron.  Other than that, I LOVE it.  Works perfect for those stubborn little hairs.</li>
            <li> Excellent travel flat iron. It puts out a lot of heat. I w/still use my full size iron. Using this for touch up or if I&#x27;m in pinch</li>
            <li> Works great, I do alot of traveling for work and this works perfectly in packing in a carryon bag.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Had one (different brand) before and loved it... bought this for my daughter to take to college with her. I tried it and it only worked once.... unfortunately, the &amp;#34;return window&amp;#34; ran out :(  Next time I&#x27;ll go with the other one again.</li>
            <li> No problems gliding through my fine hair, and it&#x27;s much handier than my full-sized flat iron. Heats up quickly, and it&#x27;s perfectly portable. Has an on-off switch and red LED light, but is not temperature adjustable. It has dual voltage in the sense that when you travel overseas, all you need is an electrical plug adapter, not a full-on electrical converter. I have yet to test this out.    One problem: The iron doesn&#x27;t stand up very well (like how it does in the picture here). It usually flops sideways on the counter top. I get worried about those metal plates getting too close to the counter top and scorching/melting/burning it. Maybe I&#x27;m paranoid, but those plates DO get pretty hot....</li>
            <li> Great little hair straightener for travelling!  Compact enough for even the smallest washbag.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and store, especially handy for short hair.</li>
            <li> comfortable, good weight and size, I really liked is very practical.</li>
            <li> Works really great on my short hair. The size is perfect and I use it every day and it will be great for travel too</li>
            <li> I love this little iron! It gets very hot, very fast and does a great job.  I had no issues with getting it to glide through my hair smoothly or burning my hair.  This iron is obviously not meant to replace your actual straightening iron, but it&#x27;s amazing for touch ups or if you just do your bangs and don&#x27;t need a full straightening iron.  It does not have an adjustable heat setting, so if you have brittle hair or hair that is very heat sensitive (gets fried easily), then this little iron probably isn&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat the deal for this iron - also an awesome travel iron.</li>
            <li> I use this every day. And it does perfectly every day.  It doesn&#x27;t have an adjustable heat setting, which I knew when I bought it. I was a little hesitant to order one of the mini&#x27;s, but I think I like it even better than the full-size 1\\&quot; I had before. It&#x27;s able to get very close to the scalp.  The exterior doesn&#x27;t get hot like my other one either, so I no longer burn my hand while using it. Great product.</li>
            <li> The BaBylissPro Nano Titanium 1/2&amp;#34; Mini Iron I received is exactly what I wanted.  I am happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that it seemed to take more time than usual to receive it.  However, I got the product I ordered.</li>
            <li> Go this in 2 days shipping from Amazon prime. It heats up super quick. It does the job, but catches &amp; pulls my hair. I found one at TJ Maxx for 10 bucks that I like better. I recommend that one, the brand name is Ionika.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things about Babyliss irons, but this one completely fried the front of my hair. I bought it to touch up my bob while at work, since I commute via foot and bus. The plates seem to catch on my hair which might be what has damaged it so much. This thing also gets crazy hot to the touch and it is so small that there isn&#x27;t really any way to hold it without getting burnt.</li>
            <li> I used the big one so rhis one is easer ti use and trvel with.  I recomended it</li>
            <li> Exterior gets way too hot and it doesn&#x27;t work well.  I&#x27;m sorry I bought it.  I wish I had saved the packaging so I could return it, but I threw it out because I purchased this based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and did not anticipate any issues.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron a while ago but never got around to writing the review.  It has worked quite well for my hair, which is non-relaxed, color- treated chin length  hair.  I love that it heats up quickly and straightens my hair with a nice smooth finish.  I may invest in the larger size as my hair continues to grow.  Also, even though the temperature setting can&#x27;t be controlled, it&#x27;s still a really good flat iron.  Very easy to pack up and use, with the extra long cord.  I like it!</li>
            <li> I own a very expensive, salon-quality flat iron. This BaByliss is comparable in how soft and straight it leaves my hair, and for a fraction of the cost and size! You have my solid recommendation on this one.</li>
            <li> My son wanted to grow out his hair a bit, since it had always been super short (Sigh... teens...). However, his hair is amazingly thick and wavy and stubborn, and on its own he looks like Albert Einstein with the wild hair photo - except twice as much hair. Even though he had his hair straightened to calm it down  (we didn&#x27;t want the Japanese straightening because it is so hard on hair) it was still wavy and not laying down as nicely as he would have liked. I let him use my Chi straightener, but the 1 inch plate was simply too much for him to use on hair that was 1-3 inches long. The BaBylissPro 1/2&amp;#34; mini iron had made all the difference in allowing him to calm down the remaining wave and have the hair be presentable in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, hoping he will outgrow this stage soon..... his short hair was MUCH less time-consuming and expensive - but if he is willing to get up to straighten it, then oh well.</li>
            <li> Very professional. Hot enough for my stubborn hair</li>
            <li> I have always had these short little baby hairs on the sides of my head that I&#x27;ve never been able to really straighten with a regular-sized flat iron. I went to a hair stylist who recommended this cute little flat iron to take care of those hairs, and it works so well! I use my larger flat iron for the rest of my hair, but this really does the trick for those fine, short hairs.</li>
            <li> A great little tool for short hair. My two peeves: wish it were a bit longer and that I could control the temperature. I use it everyday and enjoy traveling with it.</li>
            <li> Tired of hauling around my straightening iron in my purse, I&#x27;ve been looking for something more practical that fits in my makeup bag. The BaByliss is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give you an idea of scale, it&#x27;s exactly the length of a dollar bill. The cord itself is the bulkiest thing about it, but it&#x27;s not one of those super stiff cords and you could probably save additional space by winding it around the appliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BaByliss doesn&#x27;t take long to heat up - about 30 seconds or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It straightens effectively on my fine + wavy hair. The straightening plate itself is small - this is not going to be an effective way to do your whole head of hair, ladies &amp; gents. You could, though, if you don&#x27;t have a ton of hair and were willing to go slowly and take the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for touching up my bangs after getting caught in the rain and for going out after work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love the Baby Bliss.  I purchased it because my hair dresser uses it in her salon.  It would be nice if you could control the heat levels.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my trip to Europe and tried it before hand, it was really hard to use and just way too small. I returned it and bought the 1 inch, which worked perfectly for me!</li>
            <li> This product definitely meets my needs.  It&#x27;s a wonder for short hair.  Heats up very quickly and gets quite hot.  It&#x27;s just what you need to tidy up the short ends.  Very happy with my purchase cause it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I wish they were a bigger size. Other than that, very good buy!</li>
            <li> Heats well. Great size for travel but it doesn&#x27;t clamp tight, hair slips out and holding it closed does very little.</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with my bangs.  I needed something to control them and this is perfect.  Other flat irons are too big to try and corral my bangs, but this is the perfect size.  It works great for small jobs.  I also use it to curl my daughters hair.  It works well for making small ringlets and I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning her like I would with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> The iron was easy to glide through my hair but it was too small.  I know this was a mini but I have a travel iron that is not this small.  It would never work in someone&#x27;s thick hair, you cant fit much hair in it! it is a perfect purse size iron.</li>
            <li> Wanted something small and light that I could take to Europe so I wouldn&#x27;t have to mess with voltage issues.  Mostly use for my bangs and it is so narrow it can straighten them without the dreaded &amp;#34;poof.&amp;#34; I have course, thick hair with Brazilain Blowout Straightening and this little flat iron works like a charm (I blow dry the rest of my hair with a large round brush). I may find I use it when I get back home, too. Fits in your purse!  Only wish it had a temperature range (hot or hot is it), but fine for my purposes. For $20 I can&#x27;t really complain. I hope it holds up.</li>
            <li> This item I keep in my purse for when I am running late to work I can get to work and use it in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is perfect for my short edges that my large flat iron can&#x27;t reach. It&#x27;s great! I love it!!</li>
            <li> I never thought I could style my own hair but BaBylissPro makes it a lot easier.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, so the  1/2 inch is great for me.  At first I was afraid that I would burn myself, but that has not happened.  I find the heat is just right so that I don&#x27;t scorch my hair.  I think anyone could work with this.  Pretty good price too.</li>
            <li> I bought it for travel, so the size is great.  It heats up very quickly too.  However, as previous reviewers have mentioned, the hair does not glide smoothly between the plates.  For that reason, maybe it&#x27;s not something you want to use for everyday, but just as a quick straightening device, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I find the BaByliss PRO Nano Titanium - Blue- 1/2&amp;#34;...just what I needed. I am very pleased with it. I recently had my hair cut very short and this straightener  works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my travel gear, and used it for the first time this past weekend.  it is a great little product!  it heats up fast and is very compact, exactly what I was looking for.  it does get pretty hot, so you may want to pack a pot holder or small towel to wrap it in if you need to do your hair and pack up, other than that it was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Just wish they were better able to insulate the handle above &amp; very near to the plates but this seems to be typical. Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron in the world</li>
            <li> perfect, durable little flat iron - we had to get a second one because my daughter is always taking it to her bathroom ;)</li>
            <li> Bought for a Christmas gift and my mom said it works great!</li>
            <li> Good travel iron or for short hairstyles. Small size can make everyday styling difficult as your hand will cramp up over time, but for travel as intended, great iron.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. This product is perfect, it has all characteristics indicated. I have long in use it, and work  correctly.</li>
            <li> Initially when I received the product I thought it was too small.  However, after using this item, it was perfect for precise straightening and very easy to handle.  The bigger irons have a tendency to be harder to manipulate.  I love this iron, my hair lasts longer.</li>
            <li> she uses it as a profesional tool because she is a hair dresser. its of very good quality and durable.</li>
            <li> It looks as described. I have not put it to use yet.The only down side is not being able to regulate the temperature. I like it though.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this for use when traveling in Europe.  However we did not bring it on our recent trip because the US type plug came polarized (one prong is larger than the other) meaning that one side is hot and the other is cold.  This is usually done to keep the hot side of the circuitry away from the user (for example, in screw-in type incandescent light sockets it is the center button terminal that is hot, so the outer metal threads on the incandescent bulb is not hot).  But European plugs are typically not polarized and so when using an adapter there with this iron you lose the polarization that the manufacturer apparently intended for this iron.  In other words, if the iron was really constructed with double insulation the US plug would most probably not be polarized.  We&#x27;ll use it on domestic trips.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is the  best I have ever used.  This flat iron can give body to the hair more so than any other.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I got this to use on my bangs, but my hair is pretty fine (and short) so it works on all of my hair. Careful not to burn yourself as this is very tiny. I now keep it at the gym/office to use on rainy days or after working out.</li>
            <li> I almost purchased an iron at the price of $75.00 from a local business.  Wow, I got a deal.  I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful gets really hot and straightens the roots well.</li>
            <li> Purse size , great for travel or just to touch up at the end of the day before leaving work to go out. or at the gym. Perfect for straightening bangs.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  I have the larger version that I&#x27;ve used for years, but this one wasn&#x27;t the greatest for travel.  I always had to pace myself to ensure that it cooled down before I could pack it and, it is heavier than I like in a suitcase.  This mini was a perfect solution.  It works great, cools down fast and is easy to pack.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful item especially for short hair, black hair.... I would recommend this to anyone with very short hair.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair very short and this iron has just the right size blades to give a little extra body and shine to it.</li>
            <li> for that stray curly hair that in my short hair cut. Handy to carry, quick to heat up. Love them!</li>
            <li> Flat iron gets too hot to hold. Temperature is one setting and way too hot so it fried my hair.Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got this mini flat iron for my daughter and I to flat iron our edges.  It works great!  We have natural African American hair and it makes our edges look like we relaxed our hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron to replace my Chi. I was only able to use it for a few minutes because it gets too hot to handle. Going back to my Chi!</li>
            <li> Really good price for a great hair straightener! Very compact as well in case you want to take it with you.</li>
            <li> The flat iron works fine. It was sent to me without the box or directions. That was never mentioned in the listing.</li>
            <li> I needed a small iron for my gym bag.  This seems to work OK, but not as well as my full sized one. It doesn&#x27;t seem to straighten hair quite as well.  I also wish it came with a travel bag or carrying case of some sort.  It was difficult to transport in my bag when it was hot, so I had to buy a case for it.  It&#x27;s hard to find a small one and I think I spent as much on a case as I did on the iron.</li>
            <li> been using for a couple of weeks now.. I have kinda fine hair - it waves up when I air dry... so I just wanted something to pull my bang straight...  this does the job just fine...  this is my 1st flat iron.  so don&#x27;t have any other exp. to compare with.. but this product is doing the job I wanted it for... I can wash my hair - once it&#x27;s air dried  - pull my bangs out straight with this flat iron in 5 - 10 mins.. and I&#x27;m good to go...</li>
            <li> very excellent quality item. I enjoyed using it. I will buy other items from this brand.&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited receiving it and the description of this item was exact.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to straighten really long hair but this is definitely great for shorter hair, touch ups and perfect for travel. Heats up really fast.</li>
            <li> Wanted to thank all the previous reviews - it really helped me to make the right choice for what I was looking for. I have fine coarse Asian hair and as I&#x27;m trying to grow it long, the ends tends to curl up. This darling little thing is EXACTLY what I needed to fix the problem areas. I have also found it to be great to control frizz near my scalp. Because its so small I can get pretty darn close to my scalp without any burning incident unlike a regular curling iron. I highly recommend this product but do want to let people know that this is REALLY small. It&#x27;s perfect for me because I&#x27;m under 5&#x27; tall with small hands. People with bigger hands may find this a little challenging to maneuver.</li>
            <li> I had a larger flat iron but it was hard to use on my short hair &amp; left my hair sticking out.  This nano size is much easier &amp; leaves hair looking better.</li>
            <li> I have three other BaByliss irons, but this one doesn&#x27;t get hot as the others, so doesn&#x27;t work all that well. Better than nothing to stick in your bag.</li>
            <li> ...the paint comes off of it after awhile because it&#x27;s so hot which is super annoying because I find paint chips in my hair. OTHERWISE--it&#x27;s awesome-goes through my hair smoothly, heats up quickly and effectively. I have tried other minis and this is for me the best.</li>
            <li> This product is very small and could fit in your purse easity. It seems to heat up quickly and work well.</li>
            <li> This little flat iron is excellent for my short hair. It heats up quickly and glides through my hair making it straight the first time through. It is easy to use and very convenient to slip in my overnight bag for traveling.</li>
            <li> I am not a flat iron person so I thought this little one would be easy to handle and control, it is just fine but I guess I am not a flat iron person.  It is just sitting in my drawer but I recommend it for those that do use one.  Nice travel size.</li>
            <li> Love this lil iron. I cut off all my hair and needed something to smooth out the little curl I get at times. This was easy to manage and it does great.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a trip with the wife.  She loves it.  She said it gets hot fast and is small so easy to pack.</li>
            <li> Although I did not know it, I have been looking for this product all my life!  I have very short, fine hair and this speedy little iron gives me all the lift I need in a couple of minutes.  I can add a bit of curl with a flick of my wrist. Thank you,,,</li>
            <li> I am a flight attendant so I needed a flat iron small enough to travel with for small touch ups and this works great. I have short hair and just need a bit here and there. I don&#x27;t know how well it would be for long hair.</li>
            <li> Small tiny flat iron that packs a lot of heat and gets the job done! My hair is hard to straighten but Babyliss always gets it done. I was not disappointed with this small iron.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a trip to Europe and I&#x27;m so glad I found it!  This straightens my thick wavy hair better than my larger and more expensive irons.</li>
            <li> This product works great for my short hair- especially getting the little hairs in the back close to the scalp/neck. The only reason I took a star is due to the size- it works since I have short, but for someone w/ longer hair- it is not ideal. It glides through hair nicely and leaves it silky (I have pretty thick/coarse hair) Another thing about the size is the fact that the grip section is small- so it&#x27;s hard not to touch the hot part- and it is very hot</li>
            <li> Love this little iron.  Fast and does the job; however, probably best for short to mid length hair.  Easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I am going to be traveling &amp; this mini is perfect. I have coarse, curly hair &amp; it works great. It does get hot, only 1 setting, watch your fingers.</li>
            <li> No... Color rubs off and it&#x27;s just like all other irons in supply store</li>
            <li> This is a must have item!  I purchased two at Christmas; gave one as a gift and kept one.  I just purchased a third one to give as a gift.  It is the perfect size and easy to manage.  Great travel size too!  I do wish it had come with a carrying pouch.  ;O)</li>
            <li> Very tiny but works amazing</li>
            <li> it does give you option for different temp and it does its work. and so far i used it over a year and still works fine</li>
            <li> I love this thing!  Easy to travel with.  This is the second one I buy.  The first one I bout about 6 years ago and IT IS STILL WORKING!  Very durable and convenient.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly, and works great on my really short hair. Great product!</li>
            <li> Not functioning after 2 use, poor quality</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really tiny, but it works great - perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A TINY FLAT IRON LIKE FOR A DOLL!!</li>
            <li> I was new to the flat iron since I&#x27;ve worn my hair short for 15 yrs. so when I started growing it out, I needed something but didn&#x27;t see the need to invest in a big one, this travel size is just perfect. Good for travel, but I use it at home too.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy here, just a travel flat iron that can be used in Europe!</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first, this little iron does the job and takes up minimal space.  &amp;#34;On&amp;#34; light is on one side, so if you put it down the wrong way you might leave it on by accident.</li>
            <li> The same as my review on the Eurosurge. Just what I will need. I use to think I needed a flat iron that had a switch to convert from 110 to 220, but since this adapts to the European current automatically, I don&#x27;t have to be concerned about forgetting to switch it.</li>
            <li> great good on bangs and short thin hair only and great for traveling.</li>
            <li> The entire unit heats up leaving the user two thumb sized spots to hold the iron without getting burned.</li>
            <li> I have very long curly &amp;#34;Shakira&amp;#34; hair and I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of hair irons and stylets, this by far is the best. Heats up quickly, not too hot like the chi, and not too cool! It&#x27;s small enough to flatten my curly roots too, other flat irons just don&#x27;t get close enough! I even love it more than my instyler!</li>
            <li> recommend excellent buy thank you very much</li>
            <li> not good for curly coarse hair</li>
            <li> Good value for money!&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Excellent for domestic and international travel - Does the job, very portable and I am very satisfied with the device.</li>
            <li> Perfect little flat iron for getting close to your roots and around the edges. While it does not have an adjustable temperature gauge, it does not scortch hair if used properly. I have thick, not course transitioning african american shoulder length hair. Just a quick swipe over my roots and my hair is shiny, silky and straight. I also purchased the 1 inch ultra slim flat iron as well for my ends and styling. Also, a wonderful product as you can adjust the temperature and create silky styles without heat damage and tons of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this product to all of my co-workers and 4 have now purchased and are loving the results. The claim that this iron straightens from the inside of the hair shaft outward sealing in moisture and creating shiny results is definitely the truth in my opinion. I will never go back to another flat iron ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not big on styling my hair, I prefer to leave it as natural as I can bare to leave it, however my bangs always want to stand up on end in the mornings, so I bought this mini/travel size flat iron in order to calm them down before I go off to work. It works great! I just dampen my bangs with water, pull the flat iron through and I&#x27;m good to go. I&#x27;ve even begun curling a bit of the short pieces in the back when I wear my hair up. To make this little gadget even more amazing is how fast it heats up, it barely takes a minute. I can plug it in, dampen my bangs and the flat iron is ready. The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t cool down nearly as fast. Thankfully we have a granite counter top in our bathroom so I can leave it unplugged on the counter without fear of ruining anything while I&#x27;m not at home. Also, if you style or straighten a large portion of your hair I don&#x27;t think it would work real well as a travel iron. Though, definitely worth it if you&#x27;re looking for something small and quick to straighten small sections of hair with.</li>
            <li> Nice little travel iron. Works like the big ones but saves a lot of space.</li>
            <li> This is by far the smallest flat iron I have ever see.  It works okay for my short hair cut, though.  If you have a lot of thick hair, this will never do the job for you.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to heat up very hot either.  There&#x27;s just the on and off switch, no settings.</li>
            <li> I got this specifically for the dual voltage feature for my travels.  It&#x27;s small, compact, heats up great - but note that it is only 1/2 an inch thick.  Make sure you understand what that means... the heating plate is half the size in width AND length than your average 1\\&quot; straightener.  If you have fine hair, this might not be a problem.  It will take a very long time to do your hair if you have a thick head of hair... as I&#x27;m sure most people who own a straightener do.  On the plus side, because this forces my lazy self to straighten small sections of hair at a time, my hair always comes out looking much better than it does with my every day straightener.  This is great iron for travel and I would get it again in a heartbeat.  Just be sure to leave plenty of time to straighten your hair...</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my BaBylissPro Nano Mini Irons. They heat up very quickly, in a minute or less, and curl my hair very well. I have coarse hair and it can be a real job sometimes getting my hair straight as I want but these are doing the job quite well. They are pretty small but my hair is about 3 inches long on top and the irons are just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read many reviews for many different flat irons and chose these and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a good idea for travelling but honestly, I have long hair and it was just too tiny and would too easily pull my fine wavy hair since it was so small. I pretty much put it away and suck it up and bring my regular size straightener with me everyone since its worth it! I thought it would be good to use when travelling to Europe after reading other reviews but honestly I ended up just buying a 30 EURO straightener there which did the trick and made my life easier. I would only probably use if I needed for backpacking or anything but most likely will just sit and collect dust.</li>
            <li> I HAVE SHORT HAIR SO THIS FLAT IRON BEST FITS MY TYPE HAIR, IT DOES GREAT WITH STRAIGHTENING YOUR HAIR IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS, IT HEATS UP VERY FAST BY THE TIME YOU COUNT TO LIKE TEN ITS HOT LOL. ITS REALLY SMALL WHICH IS GREAT FOR TRAVELING, YOU CAN FIT IT IN YOUR PURSE IT CAN ALSO CURL YOUR HAIR UNDER, LIKE IF YOU PUT IT ON YOUR HAIR AND TUCK IT UNDER FOR A WHILE IT WILL CURL YOUR HAIR, THE IRON JUST HAVE TO BE REALLY HOT OVERALL AWESOME PRODUCT I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE WHOSE THINKING OF BUYING IT :D</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I recommend it 100%, very useful. Is a bit small but it does its job, I like it</li>
            <li> the size and heat from this flat iron is perfect for straightening short wavy hair. highly recommend it and worth the price</li>
            <li> very easy to work with and it gets nice and hot fast. great tool for short hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product would recommend 100%</li>
            <li> This iron is amazing for short hair  as well as your &amp;#34;edges&amp;#34;. It makes your hair look silky, and straightens with ease. It&#x27;s pretty powerful for such a small iron. I&#x27;d recommend this flat iron to anyone who is looking to buy a 1/2&amp;#34; iron.</li>
            <li> Works great on my Bettie Bangs! Happy Customer! Not an option to adjust heat temperature but nothing that I&#x27;m worried about.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd BabyByliss PRO Nano I&#x27;ve bought. I love it. It is just the right size and heats up ready fast.</li>
            <li> Sooo glad I bought this flat iron.  Im a 1st time flat iron user and I dont have the longest hair so the size was perfect it gets super close 2 the scalp and is easy 2 use. Honestly looks are deceiving cuz it looks tiny almost like a toy but its actually amazing how good it works. I have nappy curly frizzy hair and it gets it so silky and smooth! Now that I know how well it works im deff going to invest in a larger one of these! Seriously, im legit. This is not  fake review I really bought this and it really works great!! If u are considering a flat iron but aren&#x27;t sure about which 2 get the Babyliss Pro titanium is such an awesome flat iron I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> not what I thought too small</li>
            <li> I have short hair and this little iron does a great job straighting my hair LOVE this little flat iron and it&#x27;s small enough to carry in your pocket book or and over nite bag so happy I bought this.</li>
            <li> I love them!...Just what I expected</li>
            <li> Bought this for our trip overseas. It packed small and worked so well that upon returning home I decided to order a full size one to start using at home. The voltage range allowed us to avoid buying a converter for Europe.</li>
            <li> I just received my mini babyliss today and it works great! I would recommend this product to others who would like to try it.</li>
            <li> Love this little guy. I took it to Russia with me and it was perfect. Small, easy to pack and did a great job for being so small and I have a lot of hair. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is there is no clasp or clip to keep it closed you have to wrap the cord around it.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical when i bought it, since I already had the regular size Nano flat iron.However I needed something for travelling that  I will be able to use globally and at the same time something that will not take too much room in my suitcase. I was quite pleased with the results after the first time I used it. Although the iron is small it heats up very quickly and you get the same result as if you would by using your regular size flat iron, for about the same duration of time.</li>
            <li> recommended for ironing tweaks to travel and people with thin or scanty hair, heat is powerful and very practical. not recommended for curls</li>
            <li> This is a perfect iron for travel and quick touchups. It has only one heat setting but gets the job done.  I would not recommend for really long hair. This iron is tiny.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and this worked like a charm.  I did not have to bother with converters while travelling to Europe (this automatically detects the voltage and adjusts accordingly) and it heated up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Works great excellent for travel not occupy much space which makes it very convenient.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with how the flatiron performs.  It lives up to its reputation.  It does get close to the scalp and it actually heats up to 430degree, which is needed for Black hair.  I had to return a flatiron because it didn&#x27;t heat up hot enough for coarse black hair.  My hair is very, very curly and coarse.  Again, pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, very good price. Well packaged.  was a little to small. But perfect to take it for a trip in you bag</li>
            <li> It is small and practical. Ideal to take a trip and retouch drying. Not recommended for dry hair long or heavy</li>
            <li> Many days I straighten my hair at home, just to walk out the door &amp; find it raining or the humidity is so high, that it was a waste of time.  Now I can use my BaBylissPro once I get to work &amp; not have to worry about looking like a mad scientist.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the purpose of travel. It&#x27;s a great size and it heats up really well. I actually like it better than my usual hair straightener because I think it gives me more control. Loved it!</li>
            <li> Perfect for bangs, short hair, or getting close to the scalp. Hoewever the plate is short so it doesnt get alot of hair at once and sometimes ur hair gets caught between the plastic non-plate part which kinda hurts. So wouldnt reccomend unless ur hair is extremely short. My hair is a chin length bob and i only use this for my really short areas.</li>
            <li> daughter had Conair before and loved the mini flat iron for her bangs but it broke after about 2 years. opted for this brand after reading reviews about other babyliss products. so far so good. shipped quickly and arrived before Christmas. made a great stocking stuffer. thanx!</li>
            <li> This straightening iron is teeny tiny, but it works.  Small enough to easily fit in your carry on, this is a great product for travel!</li>
            <li> Heat up fast and very portable to take on domestic and international trips.</li>
            <li> I have Asian pin straight hair and I bought this to straighten my bang. the size is good, however the reason of the 3 stars is this cannot be slide smoothly down. I had used other brand iron like Gama and Hot Tool so I know is not my hair problem.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect if you want to straighten Barbie hair. (Don&#x27;t actually try that.) It&#x27;s so small... This is probably useful if you&#x27;re one of those people that have perfect hair all day and have a rogue curly section every now and then. But if you&#x27;re like me, your whole head gets nappy after a long trip anywhere. This thing would take me hours to straighten out all the curls. I ended up cutting the cord and letting my son pretend it&#x27;s an alligator.</li>
            <li> Great if you need a quick bang fix but not so great for all over use...unless you have an hour.&lt;br /&gt;Iron gets nice a hot and works great, solid product, just a super super tiny plate.</li>
            <li> Agree with other reviewers that this is good for travel due to the small size of the unit. However, I would not use daily or even weekly, as the temp gets very hot &amp; is not adjustable. Even just getting the unit close to my scalp feels like it could burn.</li>
            <li> My daughter LOVED it!!!</li>
            <li> size is just what i needed for my short afro hair straightening</li>
            <li> At home I use a 1.5 inch version of this straightener which I absolutely love.  I got this one for my gym bag but it just doesn&#x27;t cut it.  I like the small length of the product but the blades should be no smaller than an inch for my hair I think.  It takes too long to see a good result with such a small plate.</li>
            <li> excellent your product</li>
            <li> I could have bought a $14.99 mini and it would have worked just as well.  It really does not heat up to temperature as claimed.</li>
            <li> Cute little complement to my full-size BaByliss straightener. The big one can&#x27;t quite tame the halo of psycho frizz along my hairline, but the mini can get close enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> I like this BabylissPro mini flat iron, it doesn&#x27;t have the power of the larger BabylissPro Nano Titanium but it is still able to get the job done. Its great for travel and it fits right into your clutch for touching up your hair after a long night.</li>
            <li> I love my mini BaByliss it works well on my edges and hard to reach places.  I wish it had a temperature gadge and I hate that the thumb rest gets too hot.  Ouch</li>
            <li> I bought this so that I can take it with me when I go swimming. It works great. Heats up almost instantly and leaves hair shiny. The platforms (those that are close to the heating pans) get pretty hot, but if you don&#x27;t touch those parts when using it, it is perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> Small and works as described.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product and I would have loved it had it worked more than one time.  It is a nice size and worked well the one single time it actually worked.  There is no temperature adjustment and no clasp or lock for keeping it closed when not in use, but that wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me.  If it actually worked, it would be a nice product for travel.  Good luck if you buy this product.</li>
            <li> I knew it was going to be small, but not that small. If you have long hair or a lot of hair then this is not for you.</li>
            <li> Works great on bangs!</li>
            <li> This little straightener works great. My only rather large complaint is the on light is not very bright.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second iron, and I have to say I love it ! so small and convenient. Dual voltage really helps when you are traveling. Gets hot pretty fast, and I use it mainly on my bangs.</li>
            <li> Too small for a gift!</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t seem to work on my hair. This was my first mini flat iron. Have to stick with my full size.</li>
            <li> I had brought this because my full sized babybliss iron was broken by my mom stepping on it,  unfortunately I could not afford to replace my full size one so I got this to tie me over.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot to me at all...and when I ran it through my hair it would straighten it a little bit,  but not the way the full version does.  It pulls my hair as well.  I do not recommend this,  get the full sized Babybliss flat iron,  a million times better.</li>
            <li> This flat iron get hot as H-E-double hockey sticks.  It&#x27;s perfect for people with short hair and/or if you want to get close to straighten the roots.  It is very tiny, so if you have a lot of hair, this is probably not for you.  But if you need something small to travel with and do touch ups, this will work.  I use it to do my daughter&#x27;s hair (1/2 Af-Am) by using it to get to the roots, then I use my regular flat iron to straighten the rest of her hair.</li>
            <li> Love this iron.  It gets really hot and quickly.  It works really well and holds my hair.  My hair is very fine and my hair holds the style all day.</li>
            <li> Already have other items of this brand &amp; loved this one just the same! :-) I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Just took this little baby on my 2 week Italian vacation and with my little converter plug, it worked perfectly the whole time. It is very small - since I just got my hair cut super short it was ideal for quick use. I have naturally super curly hair and this straightened it with no problems. The trick is doing small clumps at a time. I use little claw clips to separate my hair and keep the rest out of the way while I do a side at a time. Start with the bottom layers and then undo clips as you go up and around. A smaller bunch of hair straightens quicker and keeps you from getting frustrated when you keep doing the same piece over and over.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for short hair or bangs. heats up so fast. I do wish it would have come with a case.</li>
            <li> I wanted something small to just do my bangs instead of using a regular flat iron. It said it went from 240-420 but it only went to one setting which was 420 and I wanted something that I could make to my own degrees. A little to hot for what I needed but I&#x27;m sure it would be great for someone on the go or traveling. Babyliss always has great reviews.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my girl friend who enjoyed using it. I like this product because I can take it with me where ever I go. In addition it helps to keep my edges and neck naps straight. I even purchased one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a trip to Italy and it worked great!  (Make sure you bring a plug adapter.)  It&#x27;s a small flat iron but it worked great on my chin length bob to straighten out the few weird little waves and bedhead I get each morning.  It heated up perfectly.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I seen this in the salon for 5 times the price on Amazon. And that was a reduced price. It heats up very fast. And, I carry it in my purse. It&#x27;s great for when my bangs get rained on. Or a refresh. My hair is thick I think it would take too long to do my whole head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really small, but that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s great for travel.  I have tried it (before my trip) a few times and it gets hot and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  The only challenge is that with the small size you have to have some patience because it simply takes bit longer than with your full size flat iron.  I&#x27;m looking forward to having this on my long trip, since I can&#x27;t pack a full-size iron.</li>
            <li> love how small the straightener is, it&#x27;s perfect for my bangs and fits in my purse! Gets hot really quickly, and works well. Low price too!</li>
            <li> I use my Babyliss pro nano titanium 1/2\\&quot; mini and travel straightening iron in between hair salon visits.  I&#x27;m on my second one because it works!</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and straightens my hair well.  I have straight hair to begin with so that&#x27;s a consideration.  Also, because it&#x27;s so small it doesn&#x27;t have settings, just on and off.  Still, I was very pleased with the performance.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t use a straightener on my hair very often, but this size (it really is nano, reallllly small) is perfect for me. My hair is short for most girls, but a pretty long for most guys. Heats up really quick, has an on and off switch. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the butt of the cord attached to the straightening is does not swivel, so it&#x27;s a bit awkward setting it down, but none the less it&#x27;s still a great product :)</li>
            <li> Works well , but mine typically last only a year or two and then I replace.</li>
            <li> The BaByliss Pro Nano 1/2&amp;#34; mini iron gets very hot. I only rated it 4 stars because it gets a little to hot for my hair. I don&#x27;t have thick hair that needs that much heat. For those with thick hair I think this will work great for you. It does heat quickly so for me I use about 45 seconds after it&#x27;s been plugged in so its not extremely hot. If I can find one with heat settings I like and have good reviews and not to expensive I will probably get that one next.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for for my daughters short hair. The product was in excellent shape.  Will recommend this product to anyone looking for a small straighting iron.</li>
            <li> My order came on time. The mini flat works just fine. I&#x27;ve has the same one in the past and used to it&#x27;s dying day. I&#x27;m hoping this one will last as long. I only use it to help flatten the roots of my bangs since I have curly hair.</li>
            <li> I use it to straighten my edges when I have protective style (weave) in my natural hair. Works wonders especially if you use Blue Magic hair dressing</li>
            <li> Good quality, it was as we expected and we can recommend it. I will buy again if we need anothe one.</li>
            <li> So far I LOVE this mini flat iron!  It is perfect for getting to the roots which definitely helps with keeping my hair straight between relaxers.  My mini iron has pads for my thumb and pointer finger so that I don&#x27;t burn myself while using it.  This iron does get very hot so use with caution.  I only use it for my roots and use my larger flat iron for the remainder of my hair.  I haven&#x27;t experienced it pulling my hair at all.  It&#x27;s convenient for traveling as it easily fits inside my purse.  I consider it a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser strongly recommended this, since she has one and uses it daily. She loves how easy it is to use, and quick. However, I personally can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to properly use it. That&#x27;s probably my own ineptitude, and it certainly seems to work fine. I do like that it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to handle. Just wish I knew what to do with it.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed... rather light weight and it does not get the crimp that I was really looking for..maybe I am not that good at using it...</li>
            <li> Have had this flat iron before and payed twice the price. Use if for mens styles or short hair. Worth the buy and the seller was prompt.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron !  it is perfect size for traveling!  I am planning a long trip and this will be great !</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this BaBylissPro mini... Gets my hair really straight all the way to the root, without drying it out.  My hair is short and it does wonders.  Travels well too!  Glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd on I have had ..both stopped working within a few months.. I thought the 1st was just a defective product but when the 2nd one failed I understood there is defective switch. Great when you 1st get it..the best but I think a more one will be less expensive in the end...</li>
            <li> Convenient and works well!! Straightens hair, salon style!</li>
            <li> Super powerful for it&#x27;s size</li>
            <li> No temp control and it gets too hot.</li>
            <li> This is the most adorable straightner. Beautiful color, works well, very light weight I use this daily not just for travel. It takes up less space and is easier to pull out to use. Excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> Good overall, fast heat up, but while ironing and moving it it gets caught on my hair</li>
            <li> Good for travel you have everything you need on one spot. Brought this with me to Cancun and it was ahhh-mazing!</li>
            <li> Well, is small and if you wanna do all your hair you will need time but the result is amazing, I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair at all!</li>
            <li> I got this to add some texture to my super thick, straight, pixie-cut hair. It works perfectly! It&#x27;s small enough that I can grab the hairs around my nape. My only complaint is that its only heat setting is &amp;#34;scorching.&amp;#34; It gets so hot that I see steam rise from my hair after I use it.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and this flat iron works great. I travel a lot so it comes in very handy, but I even use it at home instead of my regular size flat iron. Just wish it had automatic shut off</li>
            <li> Bought this one since I wanted a smaller flat iron for travel instead of taking my Chi everywhere.  Heat up really nice and smooths out my hair.  A keeper!!!</li>
            <li> I have short but feminine hair. I also have a terrible cowlick. When I lived in a dry climate, I was able to mostly tame the cowlick with hair products. I moved to a humid climate and the cowlick was just out of control. Nothing worked to make my hair behave until I found this mini flat iron. It is amazing! It heats up extremely quickly (we&#x27;re talking seconds) and does a great job. I can tame my cowlick in under a minute and my hair behaves for the rest of the day (at least 14 hours). I don&#x27;t even need to use hair spray. I like this so much that I&#x27;m ordering a second one to keep in my office.</li>
            <li> This is really a great straightener, especially for beginners and guys (or girls with short hair). I can get all around my ears almost perfectly with this because it&#x27;s so small. Mine heats up in 15-30 seconds. Even with thick hair, you can use this (it just takes a few run throughs). Just know that this gets very hot (450 F, I believe), very quickly.</li>
            <li> Works great. Small and compact. Perfect for the little flips I want in my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Love it, heats quickly and does the job well.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT DIED AFTER ONE USE!!!!! THE UNFORTUNATE PART IS I BOUGHT IT IN DECEMBER AND DID NOT USE IT UNTIL MARCH WHEN I TRAVELED.</li>
            <li> I just had my hair cut to a little shorter than shoulder length. Since the ends of my hair still have the remnants of a perm, I need a flat iron to help smooth this new short haircut. I opted for the BaByliss because the reviews were so strong, it was so portable and its dual voltage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought a small flat iron would suffice since I have thin Chinese hair and I don&#x27;t typically need a high setting. However, this flat iron struggled to straighten even my short hair. I ended up buying a full size, dual voltage flat iron with a heat-resistant cover to aid with traveling because this BaBlyiss was just useless.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightening iron for my daughter&#x27;s birthday.  She just turned 10, and I&#x27;ve decided, after too many morning battles, that it&#x27;s time for her to learn to do her own hair.  It is exactly the right size to fit her small hands.  Heats up quickly (one temp) - gets the job done.  I think I&#x27;ll borrow it when I travel for work...  Her hair is straight and fine, by the way.  We use the iron to tame a cowlick and give her hair a nice finish.  It is really small - I imagine it would be time consuming to use on a full head of wavy/coarse hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is super thick and short. I have an a-line hair cut. This flat iron works great on my hair in the back. I wish I would of purchase this sooner.</li>
            <li> The size, etc. are fine, but the temperature was way too hot for my fine hair, and there is no way to adjust the it. Don&#x27;t let it touch your skin!</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job but the blue paint gets everywhere it covers your hand every time you use it, sort of just annoying.</li>
            <li> These things are good. They get super super hot. Perfect!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of these tiny flat irons but this is the only one that get those edges straight. As a stylist with a lot of unrelaxed hair clients. This flat iron is a must for getting those roots straight with one passing. I had to buy 4 because I refuse to be without this iron as I use it daily on my clients. I have recommended it to all my clients in need and some have even purchased while I was still styling their hair because they could believe how straight their roots could get. Yes it&#x27;s hot but it&#x27;s tourmaline and this brand is one I&#x27;ve trusted for many years.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put relaxer on my hair anymore.  My hair was straight.</li>
            <li> I travel to AL once a month for work, and the humidity kills my hair!  This is perfect for travel, fits in my carry on and still works great</li>
            <li> This item is a must-have for those who want to grow a fu-man-shoe. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m have, and it is so... easy to use. It takes about 1 min to get hot enough to untangle your face hair. I love this product, and I&#x27;m going to enjoy the hell out of it.</li>
            <li> Aside from the fact that it&#x27;s small, and can reach the root of my bangs where those unruly hairs are (the only reason I got this and gave it 2 stars), it barely holds a heat at all. And if I dare run it through my entire head of hair, the hair actually seems to suck heat away from it. That&#x27;s one way to cool it down faster! I already threw away the box and receipt, otherwise I would send it back.</li>
            <li> I really like this mini it gets hot quickly and is just great. However about 4 weeks into using mine it is not always turning on when i flip the switch. sometimes i have to turn it on 2-3 times to get it to start. I emailed the seller and will update with their response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background: I use this to straighten the little hairs on the back of my pixie cut. I unplug it when not in use and only use it 1-2 times a week for less then 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my travel bag</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I got this. I needed a travel size iron and thought this would be the perfect one. When I got it in the mail, I was very very disappointed at how small it is. I guess they don&#x27;t call it mini for nothing. I can&#x27;t do anything with this iron. Its super mini and hard to hold in your hand to do anything to your hair. It&#x27;s mostly for ppl with very short hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for traveling and it works wonders.  I have VERY thick hair.  So I can&#x27;t flat iron my entire head with this little guy, but it works for the styling I need to do (bangs, crown and sides).  It gets VERY hot, so there is no problem with heat.  I would recommend this flat iron!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this because I needed something with dual voltage for a European trip. My hair is abundant but very thin with no body, so I&#x27;ve used curling irons for years. My hairdresser uses a flatiron to also get curl, so I decided to try it at home. This works perfect. I like it to much I use it every day, not just for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The barrel does get very hot but there are soft rubber finger grips, so just remember where to hold it. I really like the short barrel because it works well with short hair. It&#x27;s actually easier to use than a curling iron because I can grab the hair at the roots and twist and pull, compared to having to start at the end and curl inwards. The results are the same and this is easier on my wrist. At my age, that&#x27;s a valuable quality.</li>
            <li> Good size and easy to use.  Heats very fast and does work well</li>
            <li> My hair is short in the back so this size flat iron is perfect. It gets extremely hot. My hair stylist uses this same one at her salon.</li>
            <li> This iron is okay but for the price it was not the best I found.  I found one at TJ Maxx for $13 dollars that heats up just has well.  Shop around has they are making minis that are comparable to this one even though the name may carry weight I don&#x27;t see how the price makes up for it.</li>
