            <li>Great plate, excellent engravings, cute designs.</li>
            <li>My problem is the issue of getting a good transfer from stamp to nail, but thats probably just my stamper.</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>but this has so much more!</li>
            <li>I purchased this plate along with 2 others (all Cheeky brand) and I am so pleased with the quality and value!</li>
            <li>They look amazing</li>
            <li>the plate itself is really nice</li>
            <li>Nice diverse collection of geometric and feminine designs.</li>
            <li>It has really great designs and the images come out nice and crisp.</li>
            <li>This plate is really cute for anyone who loves Europe (I got it for the Eiffel Tower), would recommend.</li>
            <li>I love the images.</li>
            <li>My favorite stamping plate.</li>
            <li>Top of the line.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to add these cheeky image plates to my collection .</li>
            <li>I will be buying more for myself and for Christmas presents .</li>
            <li>One of my favorite nail art plates.</li>
            <li>I love this stamping plate, i&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of it, but the images come out clean.</li>
            <li>The designs are cute and the overall size of the full size stamps are great.  </li>
            <li>With 63 images your sure to have fun.</li>
            <li>If my nails were longer the images would fit with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>super easy to use.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this in the mail.  </li>
            <li>But, I knew that when I bought it and the plate is true to what is pictured.</li>
            <li>images on this plate are fun and original.</li>
            <li>The images that I LOVED are totally worth the cost of the entire plate.</li>
            <li>Warning: while the full nail designs are very large (a good thing), the images WITHIN the full nail design is also very large, so if you have small nails, you will not be able to fit some of the full nail images on your nail.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>, well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>This plate is definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>The designs inside the full size nail image should be smaller and repeat more often.</li>
            <li>This is such a cute plate with clean crisp designs a must have for the plate collector music notes crisscross patterns</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and I will definitely be buying more plates from this series!</li>
            <li>I normally LOVE Cheeky plates because the images are larger others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>I have tested out every design and all of them have transferred crisply and</li>
            <li>Who knows, I may change my mind about the English pea pods and USSR symbol... :)&lt;</li>
            <li>A very adorable plate, worth it even if you have small nails.</li>
            <li>Such a shame b/c there would be a lot of good designs on this plate if they were only smaller within the full size stamps.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to find plates with the Eiffel Tower</li>
            <li>Otherwise than that I really like all the images.</li>
            <li>definitely appreciate the overall image size and would not want to see those reduced, but these would have worked much better if the images WITHIN had been smaller and repeated more often.</li>
            <li>I admit that, compared to images on the other plates I purchased, this plate has more that aren&#x27;t really my style.</li>
            <li>But the designs that make up the full sized nail stamps are too big to transfer to my fingernails correctly.</li>
            <li>The small images are perfect for small nails though.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this plate.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s upsetting because the patterns were all so cute, but it turned out to be a waste of my money.</li>
            <li>For example: the single leaning tower of Pisa will fit on small nails but the full nail image of leaning towers is far too large.</li>
            <li>large specific designs.</li>
            <li>The full size nail designs measure a bit over 1/2 inch across and 3/4 inch up &amp; down.</li>
            <li>I tried to use it the first night that it arrived, but the grooves in the plate don&#x27;t appear to be deep enough for the polish to stay in them.  </li>
            <li>For example on the European plate, the \\&quot;repeating windmill\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;leaning tower of Pisa\\&quot; images are too big won&#x27;t fit on my nails, the center windmill is about 1/2 x 1/2 inch.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t  matter if it is being shipped from Hong Kong or America they always come faster than expected and the plates are deeply etched and easy to stamp with my larger stamper and my smaller ones.</li>
            <li>The large image plates were framed in pink.</li>
            <li>These are large enough for long nails and yet still work for short nails also.</li>
            <li>I purchased this plate specifically for a trip to France and none of the images I wanted were small enough to work well on my fingers - even if they fit, the image was too big to look attractive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, a few of the full nail images are much larger than I expected (especially the windmills and bicycles).</li>

            <li> I love this stamping plate, i&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of it, but the images come out clean. My problem is the issue of getting a good transfer from stamp to nail, but thats probably just my stamper. This plate is really cute for anyone who loves Europe (I got it for the Eiffel Tower), would recommend.</li>
            <li> I just received the European Romance and the Tropical Holiday plate.  The designs are cute and the overall size of the full size stamps are great.  But the designs that make up the full sized nail stamps are too big to transfer to my fingernails correctly. The designs inside the full size nail image should be smaller and repeat more often. For example on the European plate, the \\&quot;repeating windmill\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;leaning tower of Pisa\\&quot; images are too big won&#x27;t fit on my nails, the center windmill is about 1/2 x 1/2 inch.  The full size nail designs measure a bit over 1/2 inch across and 3/4 inch up &amp; down. Such a shame b/c there would be a lot of good designs on this plate if they were only smaller within the full size stamps.  Also, the plates took 18 days to get to me and now if I want to return them for a refund I have to pay for return shipping ($12.75) back to China to get a $20 refund.  So looks like I have to try and sell it myself to recoup my money or just take a loss. I haven&#x27;t used these for stamping yet as I thought I would return them, so I can&#x27;t speak to how well they stamp or the engraving quality.</li>
            <li> Quality images. Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work!  The engraving is not deep enough, so that when you attempt to pick up the design, it does not show up.</li>
            <li> They took forever to get here, but I finally got them. They look amazing, well worth the wait. I love them!</li>
            <li> the plate itself is really nice I love the images. They stamp well as well. The company however I will never buy from again it took for forever to get to me. I have ordered things overseas before and it has never taken over a month to get there. Also I needed to return other items and they gave me a hard time about it. I just ended up throwing them out it&#x27;s not worth the few dollars.</li>
            <li> These plates are perfect just what I was looking for,the images are a nice size and are perfect for my pedicures.</li>
            <li> it was a simple to use product. super easy to use. it is just what it describes. large specific designs.</li>
            <li> This is such a cute plate with clean crisp designs a must have for the plate collector music notes crisscross patterns</li>
            <li> My favorite stamping plate. Side Note: Mine came in bent in all corners. :(</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t  matter if it is being shipped from Hong Kong or America they always come faster than expected and the plates are deeply etched and easy to stamp with my larger stamper and my smaller ones. Great plates. Top of the line. This one is beautiful.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this in the mail.  It arrived quicker than expected, however, the one star is because it doesn&#x27;t work.  At all.  I tried to use it the first night that it arrived, but the grooves in the plate don&#x27;t appear to be deep enough for the polish to stay in them.  I used the scraper that came with the stamper and it scraped all of the polish off of the plate.  Frustrated, I put it away.  I tried again a few nights later, only to be disappointed again.  It&#x27;s upsetting because the patterns were all so cute, but it turned out to be a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> This plate is definitely worth buying. It has really great designs and the images come out nice and crisp. Nice diverse collection of geometric and feminine designs.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to add these cheeky image plates to my collection . A great value .  Alot of different images to choose from .  The large image plates were framed in pink. Iam a fan of the the Eiffel tower so when i saw this image plate i had to have it...  They Arrived alot sooner than expected.  I will be buying more for myself and for Christmas presents .</li>
            <li> I really wanted to find plates with the Eiffel Tower but this has so much more! The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give five stars was because one of the images (argyle pattern) wasn&#x27;t etched properly in some spots. Otherwise than that I really like all the images.</li>
            <li> With 63 images your sure to have fun. These stamp perfectly. I have had no issues or troubles picking up or transferring any image. These are large enough for long nails and yet still work for short nails also. If your wondering on quality.Don&#x27;t.. These are Great!</li>
            <li> I love this plate, all the images stamp perfectly, and there are a great variety of images. Highly recommend and I will definitely be buying more plates from this series!</li>
            <li> I normally LOVE Cheeky plates because the images are larger others I&#x27;ve tried and I find the quality to be excellent.

            <li> Great plate, excellent engravings, cute designs. Warning: while the full nail designs are very large (a good thing), the images WITHIN the full nail design is also very large, so if you have small nails, you will not be able to fit some of the full nail images on your nail. For example: the single leaning tower of Pisa will fit on small nails but the full nail image of leaning towers is far too large. The small images are perfect for small nails though. A very adorable plate, worth it even if you have small nails.</li>
