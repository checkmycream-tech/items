    <ol>
            <li>I love it!!!</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>Purchase at your own peril!</li>
            <li>My hair is easier to manage and I was able to achieve the best twist out of my life.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I liked the shampoo and conditioner, but the straightening treatment did nothing good for my hair.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that this product allowed you to &amp;#34;go back&amp;#34; to your curls and that it was &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I had nice, curly curls before using this system.</li>
            <li>straightening treatment kind of smells like rotten eggs.</li>
            <li>It was salon quality and that says a lot because, again, I&#x27;ve never been able to get my hair &amp;#34;bone straight&amp;#34; at home.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I rinsed the stuff out and my hair felt okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of most of the Shea Moisture line products.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Despite my reservations, my hair looked wonderful after flat ironing!</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;bounced back&amp;#34; to my original curl pattern!</li>
            <li>and I can easily get two - three more uses out of it, so basically 2 - 3 months as each treatment lasts one month.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my curl pattern after using the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;The product was great for blow-drying and flat-ironing.</li>
            <li>It was cool, straightened my hair pretty nicely.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product to fight the summer humidity.</li>
            <li>but when I saw it and purchased it I was excited.  </li>
            <li>I found it to start drying which I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>my hair and scalp still feels clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li>It spilled all over the box, and I got it all over my hands just trying to clean it up.</li>
            <li>I wanted versatility in this product and hoped that I would be able to switch between curly and straight.</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather much, but that&#x27;s ok,</li>
            <li>As it was processing, I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t doing anything, but I let the full time elapse anyway before I threw in the towel.</li>
            <li>Luckily I was like six months post relaxer</li>
            <li>My coils have loosened a bit, and is super manageable.</li>
            <li>and I love that deep conditioner, so I assumed the regular conditioner would be good.</li>
            <li>but it was easy and soft to manage.</li>
            <li>My hair is very straight</li>
            <li>My 4C fine, soft, coily hair loves this line.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the smell of the straightening system.</li>
            <li>I went back to my Sedu serum to make it better.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since this was my first use</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I paid for this kit and my first usage turned out to be a bust I&#x27;m going to have to stick with the 2 stars.  </li>
            <li>I flat ironed my hair this week and it is way better than before I used this product.</li>
            <li>I do plan on flat ironing my hair, but I&#x27;m enjoying wearing my twist out.</li>
            <li>It stayed pretty straight for about 2.5 weeks before I washed it.</li>
            <li>I have 4c hair that is very fine, which is the reason I went natural, because relaxer&#x27;s were only making my hair even finer and in the summer it would not hold a curl.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>FAST FORWARD 11 WEEKS</li>
            <li>The shampoo and rinse-out conditioner smell much better.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>I contacted Beauty Online, the people I bought it from, and they have been very understanding.</li>
            <li>I just used it to loosen my very kinky hair.</li>
            <li>it just takes way to much time, that i dont have....</li>
            <li>straight either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>If you love your natural curls, it&#x27;s not worth the risk!switch between curly and straight.</li>
            <li>The conditioner at first I was a little leery about because I have medium to fine curly hair</li>
            <li>It enables me to go from natural to straight</li>
            <li>I love my thick 4a curls, but do enjoy having my hair straightened occasionally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve usually traveled to the salon for this, because I have never been able to really straighten my hair at home.</li>
            <li>It felt somewhat normal after I rinsed everything out.</li>
            <li>My hair is still as frizzy as it normally is.</li>
            <li>My hair is still as frizzy as it normally is.</li>
            <li>Even if I did the high heat blow drying with a super hot flat iron, my hair would NEVER be this straight and silky, and it certainly would not last one hour in this southern climate!</li>
            <li>If you love your natural curls, it&#x27;s not worth the risk!</li>
            <li>one of the solutions had popped open and the product was all over the inside of the box, kind of a waste.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t keep my hair as straight as the chemical Keratin treatments but at least I know it&#x27;s somewhat safe.</li>
            <li>I feel as though I shed more hair than usual.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had to retouch nearly as often as I used to.</li>
            <li>I bought this product directly from Shea Moisture&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>im a 4b natural hair girl.</li>
            <li>I decided to go natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it natural for about 2 years when I tried this product.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels like its been relaxed and will hold a curl in this very humid southern climate.  </li>
            <li>as I desire while not destroying my hair&#x27;s curl pattern.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have kinky hair its more thick and curly.  </li>
            <li>The key is to blow dry it on high heat to really get it straight, followed by the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Now, when washed, my hair is pretty much bone straight and when totally dry my hair is limp and wavy.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I was not surprised that my hair was still straight when washing.</li>
            <li>The instructions made the process sound time-consuming, so I waited a few weeks until I had the time to fully complete the process, including flat ironing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t blow dry my hair; I really just wanted to lessen the frizz and loosen my curl.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I want to wear my hair straight I will try again and this time get a wide tooth</li>
            <li>The sad part is I own the Tahitian Noni and Monoi Deep Condition Masque (or</li>

            <li> It made my hair feel super hard and dry, but I continued with the process.</li>
            <li> ** fried my shoulder length texlaxed hair all the way down to the new growth (which was still just as curly as ever and even frizzier).</li>
            <li> I hope they will go back to normal after a few wash.</li>
            <li> this made my hair straight and limp AND fall out by the handful!</li>
            <li> I did not plan to flat iron it, but I had to because my hair was out of control.</li>
            <li> The flat iron did not glide either, felt like their was &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; on my hair.</li>
            <li> then flat iron it in the morning.  </li>
            <li> After flat ironing my hair is usually very shiny, after the treatment it was dull.</li>
            <li> I did not blow dry or flat iron</li>
            <li> and I had enough to make something out of it, but its still rough and drier than its ever been.</li>
            <li> I said I would give it time, but 11 weeks is too long.</li>
            <li> I said I would give it time, but 11 weeks is too long.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how long this kit&#x27;s been out</li>
            <li> I applied the straightening system as instructed (shampoo, apply treatment, shampoo again and condition), and my hair was frizzier than before and extremely dry.</li>
            <li> my hair felt dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> After this step, I blow dried my hair and noticed that my hair was very coarse and rough feeling (3rd clue).</li>
            <li> I waited like a month and a half to do the next straightening treatment.  </li>
            <li> , since my hair has extreme shrinkage and extreme coils I have to straighten my hair in order for me to get it into a style because no matter what I try it will go back to the way it is if I put a wet moisturizing product in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The process was a little tedious, as washing my hair then dangling without conditioner is a HUGE chore.</li>
            <li> I am currently getting over 8 cycles of chemo and 2 surgeries, and my curly hair is growing back and is hard to maintain.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have a wide tooth comb this stuff just seem to didn&#x27;t take.  </li>
            <li> So I blow dried my hair and then had to turn around to flat iron it.  </li>
            <li> It sort of smelled like a relaxer with a small bit of fragrance (2nd clue).</li>
            <li> Not the usual shedding that you see, but actual breakage!</li>
            <li> Other than that I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to use, but I finally opened it up and used it this past weekend.</li>
            <li> I have 4C hair with extreme shrinkage and extreme coils.  </li>
            <li> My hair length is long mid-back past bra strap.  </li>
            <li> There were a lot of mixed reviews, but one thing that all the videos had in common was that the product did</li>
            <li> I used to it to ease the frizz in my extremely curly hair and it made it stronger and shinier!</li>
            <li> After that treatment (I let it sit for less than 25 minutes)</li>
            <li> it said it would do, which is loosen the curl and make your hair less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I let the twist stay in my head for about a day and a half.</li>
            <li> I feel like I just wasted money in a defective item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was dead wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I would recommend b/c there isn&#x27;t any harsh smell or burning like Brazilian Hair Straightening that I&#x27;ve had done in the past.  </li>
            <li> The brush did not glide as usual.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t washed yet, so not sure how my curl pattern is.</li>
            <li> I immediately knew something was wrong as soon as my hair was completely dry...</li>
            <li> My hair felt hard and crunchy.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, 4B ( I guess)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long tedious process and for me, who washes her hair in the shower as opposed to a sink the getting in and out was not worth the lame results.  </li>
            <li> When I say &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; I mean all the moisture was gone.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about it is when it shipped to me</li>
            <li> I am afraid to try that weekly treatment that is included since I didn&#x27;t like the other 3 products, so I might chuck it in the trash, too.all that being said, this product didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I am afraid to try that weekly treatment that is included since I didn&#x27;t like the other 3 products, so I might chuck it in the trash, too.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the way my hair looked at all, but I decided to continue with process.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair stuff and one of the bottles had been opened with the security seal broken.</li>
            <li> I blow dried and it went crazy.</li>
            <li> The straightening treatment itself smells bad, but the other products have a floral, perfumy scent.</li>
            <li> The smell was really bad, but dissipated after a couple days.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I hate the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> hate to chuck this as a $25 loss.</li>
            <li> (Like I said, the shampoo was horrible and made my hair feel like crap).</li>
            <li> I hated the conditioner, too.</li>
            <li> It was terrible and smelled all through my bathroom and bedroom.</li>

            <li> I really like this product.  This is what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> Hair destroyer. I would give it zero stars if I could. This bulls*** fried my shoulder length texlaxed hair all the way down to the new growth (which was still just as curly as ever and even frizzier). Luckily I was like six months post relaxer and I had enough to make something out of it, but its still rough and drier than its ever been.</li>
            <li> PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW BEFORE PURCHASING! I love my thick 4a curls, but do enjoy having my hair straightened occasionally. I&#x27;ve usually traveled to the salon for this, because I have never been able to really straighten my hair at home. I liked the fact that this product allowed you to &amp;#34;go back&amp;#34; to your curls and that it was &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34;. I also did a lot of research, reading several reviews online and on the Shea Moisture website, and even watching YouTube videos. I ran across this item several months ago and debated on buying it until I found it on clearance at Target for $9.98 (1st clue). The instructions made the process sound time-consuming, so I waited a few weeks until I had the time to fully complete the process, including flat ironing. The first thing I noticed was the smell of the straightening system. It was terrible and smelled all through my bathroom and bedroom. It sort of smelled like a relaxer with a small bit of fragrance (2nd clue). After this step, I blow dried my hair and noticed that my hair was very coarse and rough feeling (3rd clue). I was not happy with the way my hair looked at all, but I decided to continue with process. Despite my reservations, my hair looked wonderful after flat ironing! It was salon quality and that says a lot because, again, I&#x27;ve never been able to get my hair &amp;#34;bone straight&amp;#34; at home. It stayed pretty straight for about 2.5 weeks before I washed it. I have to say that I was not surprised that my hair was still straight when washing. The product does say that it straightens for up to 4 weeks. FAST FORWARD 11 WEEKS and my hair still has not &amp;#34;bounced back&amp;#34; to my original curl pattern! And my hair is breaking off! Not the usual shedding that you see, but actual breakage! I had nice, curly curls before using this system. Now, when washed, my hair is pretty much bone straight and when totally dry my hair is limp and wavy. I wanted versatility in this product and hoped that I would be able to switch between curly and straight. I even thought about using this for my daughter&#x27;s 4c hair, but no way! I said I would give it time, but 11 weeks is too long. Purchase with caution. If you love your natural curls, it&#x27;s not worth the risk!switch between curly and straight.

            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my curl pattern after using the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;The product was great for blow-drying and flat-ironing. The tools (brush, comb, flat-iron) I used  just glided through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The straightening treatment kind of smells like rotten eggs. Also, i use latex gloves (not included in the box) to add in the treatment because it did smell like chemicals.  The shampoo and rinse-out conditioner smell much better.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the shampoo and conditioner and I love it. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather much, but that&#x27;s ok, my hair and scalp still feels clean but not stripped. The conditioner at first I was a little leery about because I have medium to fine curly hair but it was easy and soft to manage. Great price. I purchased them at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Purchase at your own peril! This is a straight up relaxer that does not smooth or loosen curls..this made my hair straight and limp AND fall out by the handful!</li>
            <li> I bought this hair stuff and one of the bottles had been opened with the security seal broken. It spilled all over the box, and I got it all over my hands just trying to clean it up. I feel like I just wasted money in a defective item. I contacted Beauty Online, the people I bought it from, and they have been very understanding. All I want is a replacement bottle, but I have yet to receive it yet. I am currently getting over 8 cycles of chemo and 2 surgeries, and my curly hair is growing back and is hard to maintain. All I want is to make it easier to do my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been trying for years to find something that would ease the frizz in my hair and this definitely works! I used to it to ease the frizz in my extremely curly hair and it made it stronger and shinier! I flat ironed my hair this week and it is way better than before I used this product. The only bad thing about it is when it shipped to me one of the solutions had popped open and the product was all over the inside of the box, kind of a waste. But the product itself works miracles.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this from Amazon. I bought it from Target for $19.99. I had purchased it before and returned it because I hadn&#x27;t heard anything about it. So 6 months later I purchased it again and tried it. I love it!!! I just used it to loosen my very kinky hair. I did not blow dry or flat iron my hair. My hair is easier to manage and I was able to achieve the best twist out of my life. I do plan on flat ironing my hair, but I&#x27;m enjoying wearing my twist out. Oh yeah I didn&#x27;t like the smell which is why I only gave it 4 stars. Other than that I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product to fight the summer humidity. I applied the straightening system as instructed (shampoo, apply treatment, shampoo again and condition), and my hair was frizzier than before and extremely dry. I feel as though I shed more hair than usual. I have never had a problem with protein in products, but perhaps I have discovered my limit with this system. The straightening treatment itself smells bad, but the other products have a floral, perfumy scent.</li>
            <li> I like shea moisture products. They work wonder on my 3B/3C hair. So I thought this treatment was &amp;#34;risk free&amp;#34;. After that treatment (I let it sit for less than 25 minutes) my hair felt dry and frizzy. I blow dried and it went crazy. The brush did not glide as usual. I did not plan to flat iron it, but I had to because my hair was out of control. The flat iron did not glide either, felt like their was &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; on my hair. After flat ironing my hair is usually very shiny, after the treatment it was dull. I went back to my Sedu serum to make it better. I hope they will go back to normal after a few wash. I liked the shampoo and conditioner, but the straightening treatment did nothing good for my hair.</li>
            <li> This works for my hair.  I don&#x27;t have kinky hair its more thick and curly.  I do the weekly treatment, along with the shampoo and conditioner and my hair does look healthier.  The Monthly treatment has enough for 2x treatments.  My hair length is long mid-back past bra strap.  I waited like a month and a half to do the next straightening treatment.  But I would recommend b/c there isn&#x27;t any harsh smell or burning like Brazilian Hair Straightening that I&#x27;ve had done in the past.  I&#x27;m never going to have any of those toxic treatments done again now that I&#x27;ve found this.  It doesn&#x27;t keep my hair as straight as the chemical Keratin treatments but at least I know it&#x27;s somewhat safe.</li>
            <li> So far so good! The process was a little tedious, as washing my hair then dangling without conditioner is a HUGE chore. The smell was really bad, but dissipated after a couple days. My hair is very straight and I haven&#x27;t had to retouch nearly as often as I used to. I haven&#x27;t washed yet, so not sure how my curl pattern is. Will update once I do! Florida&#x27;s humidity is a beast!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product directly from Shea Moisture&#x27;s website. On the website, the product had a rating of about a 3 or 3.5 stars, but only 5 or so people had reviewed it. I had watched some Youtube videos of people using the product and how they felt about. There were a lot of mixed reviews, but one thing that all the videos had in common was that the product did was it said it would do, which is loosen the curl and make your hair less frizzy. So, since I figured it worked, I decided to buy it. It took me a while to use, but I finally opened it up and used it this past weekend. Firstly, I hate the shampoo. It made my hair feel super hard and dry, but I continued with the process. I have really thick, 4B ( I guess) hair, so I had to let the actual straightening treatment sit on my hair for a minute. As it was processing, I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t doing anything, but I let the full time elapse anyway before I threw in the towel. I rinsed the stuff out and my hair felt okay until I had to shampoo it again (Like I said, the shampoo was horrible and made my hair feel like crap). Next step was to condition.... I hated the conditioner, too. The sad part is I own the Tahitian Noni and Monoi Deep Condition Masque (or whatever it is called) and I love that deep conditioner, so I assumed the regular conditioner would be good. NOT!!! So, what I ended up doing after I put the conditioner in my hair and realized it sucked was mix it with the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey and Mufura Oil Deep Treatment Masque to try to save my hair. It kinda worked. It felt somewhat normal after I rinsed everything out. I didn&#x27;t blow dry my hair; I really just wanted to lessen the frizz and loosen my curl. I proceeded to style my hair in twists for a twist out. I let the twist stay in my head for about a day and a half. I immediately knew something was wrong as soon as my hair was completely dry... When I say &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; I mean all the moisture was gone. My hair felt hard and crunchy. I hate it. With all that being said, this product didn&#x27;t work. My hair is still as frizzy as it normally is. My curl didn&#x27;t loosen. I will be rewashing my hair tonight and redoing it. And I have thrown away all the leftover shampoo, conditioner, and straightening treatment. I am afraid to try that weekly treatment that is included since I didn&#x27;t like the other 3 products, so I might chuck it in the trash, too.all that being said, this product didn&#x27;t work.

            <li> Did nothing for my hair</li>
            <li> It was cool, straightened my hair pretty nicely. im a 4b natural hair girl. it just takes way to much time, that i dont have....maybe i&#x27;ll buy and pay someone else to do it. ;-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of most of the Shea Moisture line products.  I have 4C hair with extreme shrinkage and extreme coils.  I seen mixed reviews about this but I decided to try it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had over 25 years of relaxers and March of 2012 I decided to go natural.  This year I finally figured out what my hair type is, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, since my hair has extreme shrinkage and extreme coils I have to straighten my hair in order for me to get it into a style because no matter what I try it will go back to the way it is if I put a wet moisturizing product in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how long this kit&#x27;s been out but when I saw it and purchased it I was excited.  I figured I wouldn&#x27;t have to go through the hassles of trying to style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was dead wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this was my first use and I didn&#x27;t have a wide tooth comb this stuff just seem to didn&#x27;t take.  My hair isn&#x27;t dyed or treated but I had to leave this in for 35 minutes.  It states to comb through every once in a while which I did.  I found it to start drying which I&#x27;m pretty sure wasn&#x27;t a good thing.  My hair kept drawing back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my rinse it looked like I never put anything in my hair.  So I blow dried my hair and then had to turn around to flat iron it.  It wasn&#x27;t bone straight either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the two week ordeal I found myself having to wrap my hair at night and then flat iron it in the morning.  I was doing this when I was getting relaxers.  It&#x27;s no point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I paid for this kit and my first usage turned out to be a bust I&#x27;m going to have to stick with the 2 stars.  Maybe if I want to wear my hair straight I will try again and this time get a wide tooth comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to chuck this as a $25 loss.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything to straighten my hair.  It&#x27;s long tedious process and for me, who washes her hair in the shower as opposed to a sink the getting in and out was not worth the lame results.  It may work for some, but it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I have 4c hair that is very fine, which is the reason I went natural, because relaxer&#x27;s were only making my hair even finer and in the summer it would not hold a curl.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it natural for about 2 years when I tried this product.  I was astonished at how well it works.  My hair looks and feels like its been relaxed and will hold a curl in this very humid southern climate.  I want to stock up on this product so that I never run out.  I&#x27;ve used the kit twice now and I can easily get two - three more uses out of it, so basically 2 - 3 months as each treatment lasts one month.  The key is to blow dry it on high heat to really get it straight, followed by the flat iron.  Even if I did the high heat blow drying with a super hot flat iron, my hair would NEVER be this straight and silky, and it certainly would not last one hour in this southern climate!</li>
            <li> My 4C fine, soft, coily hair loves this line. My coils have loosened a bit, and is super manageable. It enables me to go from natural to straight as I desire while not destroying my hair&#x27;s curl pattern.</li>
