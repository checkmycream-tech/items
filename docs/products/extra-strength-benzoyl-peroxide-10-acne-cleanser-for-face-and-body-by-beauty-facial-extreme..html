            <li>This stuff really shrinks the pores, and I can barely see them anymore</li>
            <li>This product actually has helped a great deal and my acne has become less and less by the day.</li>
            <li>Taking note of so many positive reviews, I tired this product thinking I had found a gem.</li>
            <li>I have hormonal acne and proactiv keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>It helps remove dirt and make the skin clear.</li>
            <li>Try to use organic products like lush.</li>
            <li>This deep cleansing really helps in cleansing my skin and fading away my blemishes .</li>
            <li>This acne treatment really helped with my ance problems I&#x27;ve been having recently.</li>
            <li>This acne facial wash works very well.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate it in any way.</li>
            <li>Cleared up my adult acne within a week.</li>
            <li>Seeing this very soon one of my cousin recommended me to use this one as she was having one extra pack.</li>
            <li>I was so much surprised looking at the results.</li>
            <li>Complete scam, received product, label not even on bottle.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m free from all worries and no more new Acne.</li>
            <li>Cleared my current acne and is helping prevent new breakouts.</li>
            <li>I wished it did but at least my back looks somewhat better, pimples appear once in a while but not as often as before.</li>
            <li>I personally use it for my face because over the years I have developed acne and it was getting out of hand.</li>
            <li>I have been using this on my face, I actually had some adult acne that I struggle with already.</li>
            <li>My only issue was that after a couple of weeks my face was burning, but that was mainly because I was putting it on everyday, and for the first couple of days I was using it and proactiv at the same time.</li>
            <li>Overall I don&#x27;t believe it is worth the hefty price, especially since you can get other benzoyl peroxide washes for much less.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used hundreds of washes in my life time and rarely got it in my eyes</li>
            <li> This product doesnâ€™t dry out skin, but it still leaves it nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Please ignore most of the other reviewers who are giving this product 5 stars, most of them are NOT verified purchased.</li>
            <li> At the time, I had mild acne that was pretty well controlled.</li>
            <li> She will stay on this product and highly recommends it to anyone that wants to be acne free!</li>
            <li> Its gentle on the skin and leaves it smooth, clean, clear, and bright... Plan to keep using it for long term</li>
            <li> I have to keep rotating products, because it seems like my face will get used to one, after I use it for so long, and the product will stop being effective for me.</li>
            <li> She starting using this and within one week she was acne free!</li>
            <li> Actually I have more break outs now than I did before using the product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products, but nothing has helped.</li>
            <li> Overall, we absolutely love this wash!&lt;br /&gt;*I</li>

            <li> I have struggled with moderate to severe acne most of my life.</li>
            <li> This product has a 30 day guarantee and I thought that it would be more than enough time to see improvement.</li>

            <li> I have mild acne and started using this product, but then I quickly realized that it&#x27;s a little too strong for me</li>

            <li> Really works well.</li>
            <li> Now my confidence is back due to clear skin and this amazing product!</li>

            <li> Thanks to lush my pimples are all gone because they use organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products and either their to harsh on my skin or just don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> This product is magic, as a teenager I had problems with acne on my face and so far I was ashamed, I decided to buy this product to remove my acne, miraculously this product took effect after a short time of use, It took off much of my red spots on my result of the acne</li>
            <li> and I truly feel like a brand new person.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin dry and super smelly.</li>
            <li> Dealing with acne as an adult can be difficult but a friend referred me to this product and it works great.</li>
            <li> My face has never been this clear!</li>
            <li> She has been on it ever since, with no acne and her skin glows now and is baby soft!  </li>
            <li> This stuff really shrinks the pores, and I can barely see them anymore</li>
            <li> This product actually has helped a great deal and my acne has become less and less by the day.</li>
            <li> Taking note of so many positive reviews, I tired this product thinking I had found a gem.</li>
            <li> I have hormonal acne and proactiv keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> It helps remove dirt and make the skin clear.</li>
            <li> Try to use organic products like lush.</li>
            <li> This deep cleansing really helps in cleansing my skin and fading away my blemishes .</li>
            <li> This acne treatment really helped with my ance problems I&#x27;ve been having recently.</li>
            <li> This acne facial wash works very well.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate it in any way.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my adult acne within a week.</li>
            <li> Seeing this very soon one of my cousin recommended me to use this one as she was having one extra pack.</li>
            <li> I was so much surprised looking at the results.</li>
            <li> Complete scam, received product, label not even on bottle.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m free from all worries and no more new Acne.</li>
            <li> Cleared my current acne and is helping prevent new breakouts.</li>
            <li> I wished it did but at least my back looks somewhat better, pimples appear once in a while but not as often as before.</li>
            <li> I personally use it for my face because over the years I have developed acne and it was getting out of hand.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face, I actually had some adult acne that I struggle with already.</li>
            <li> My only issue was that after a couple of weeks my face was burning, but that was mainly because I was putting it on everyday, and for the first couple of days I was using it and proactiv at the same time.</li>
            <li> Overall I don&#x27;t believe it is worth the hefty price, especially since you can get other benzoyl peroxide washes for much less.</li>
            <li> Beauty Facial Extreme Extra Strength Face and Body Wash has been a miracle.</li>
            <li> Nothing special other than it not being as irritating as others.</li>
            <li> Must say that I&#x27;ve tried lots of products , cosmetologists,dermatologists but nothing really worked ( you know what i mean) .They</li>
            <li> and it definitely stops other acne growth.</li>
            <li> I felt low when I used to be with my friends due to the blackheads on my face.</li>
            <li> Now it seems as thought I am out in front of my acne problem and use the other products a lot less frequently.</li>
            <li> If you need something to make your face seriously dry out, this is your stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product daily for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> Then my face was completely dry and rough.</li>
            <li> This product is just like any other benzoyl peroxide product.</li>
            <li> I had lots of pimples on my upper back which made me uncomfortable to wear deep necked dresses.</li>
            <li> Once I only started using this, I have noticed less irritation, and less acne scars!</li>
            <li> Not a wash, lotion with all in-active ingredients, other then 10% benzoyl p., which I doubt is in there either</li>
            <li> His skin is not irritated or dry, which has happened with other products in the past.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell to it.</li>
            <li> Not worth it, I will be returning this.</li>
            <li> I used it for about a month and a half, hoping to see results, but had no improvements.</li>
            <li> i also use snail cream at night to moisturize or fix any previous damage because snail cream helps with elasticity</li>
            <li> I wanted to see if a new less expensive product would work.</li>
            <li> and I saw a little bit of improvement.</li>

            <li> Ordered this for my 12 year old daughter who starting getting really bad break outs on her forehead and face. Could not believe it! Within days her face cleared up . This stuff really works.  a bit expensive but compared t a monthly membership fee to proactive its a much better deal.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t have any over powering smell that came with it and washed off quite easily leaving my face feeling clean and refreshed. I have been using this product daily for about a week and a half. I have noticed the acne on my face disappearing more and more. This product isn&#x27;t a product where it is going to work over night but rather with continual use. This works best on the blackheads on my nose, I have noticed.</li>
            <li> Great product, it really works and gives you a relief in problem areas.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a better quality item for the price. What I got was a bottle as big as a tiny flashlight and the product does not work.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS! Worst product I have ever used! After just one use my face was bright red and on fire. Then my face was completely dry and rough. Feels like I got a horrible sunburn!</li>
            <li> Waste of money . Do not buy . Did not work for me</li>
            <li> Targets breakouts all over! Especially my back and shoulders. Works super fast and doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Nice cleanser. Works well. Great for acne</li>
            <li> I have a lot of acne problems and this seemed to be the solution I have been applying this almost twice a day and everyday the acne is going away I freaking love this product beacause of how efficient is</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter in law, who has acne and never could get rid of it.  She starting using this and within one week she was acne free! She has been on it ever since, with no acne and her skin glows now and is baby soft!  She will stay on this product and highly recommends it to anyone that wants to be acne free!</li>
            <li> Works so well! My acne has been so bad lately I wanted to try something new! It&#x27;s now very clear! It burns my eyes every time I was my face though. I&#x27;ve used hundreds of washes in my life time and rarely got it in my eyes but this one always creeps in somehow like shampoo!</li>
            <li> Great product. Its extremely effective. I have always had acne problem, and this has worked for me. I love this product. It really helped me with my acne problems. It&#x27;s affordable and easy to use. Works super fast and doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This Benzoyl Peroxide Wash can be used for a variety of things is why I love it so much. I personally use it for my face because over the years I have developed acne and it was getting out of hand. I have tried so many products and either their to harsh on my skin or just don&#x27;t work at all. This product actually has helped a great deal and my acne has become less and less by the day. I use this twice a day and it leaves my skin feeling so refreshed, clean and almost blemish free.  I am really impressed with this product. Its super effective and is a great price. Now my confidence is back due to clear skin and this amazing product!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin dry and super smelly. Try to use organic products like lush. Thanks to lush my pimples are all gone because they use organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> Caused horrible horrible horrible break outs! I&#x27;ve never had acne like that!</li>
            <li> Magical.. Its extremely effective... Ugly acne marks and pimples start to fade with as little as 3-4 uses.. I use it everyday in the shower.. Its gentle on the skin and leaves it smooth, clean, clear, and bright... Plan to keep using it for long term</li>
            <li> I am pretty much at a maintenance level and this product does it for me.  Initially, I had to use some of the additional products from this company.  Now it seems as thought I am out in front of my acne problem and use the other products a lot less frequently.</li>
            <li> Have used different drug store washes including proactive and tv type washes ! This has been the best and cleared up my acne in less than 2 weeks !</li>
            <li> The fact that I can use this on my face AND body is a plus.  Breakouts don&#x27;t always happen on the face.  I highly recommend this wash to anyone looking for cleaner, smoother, acne-free skin.</li>
            <li> This cream is the easiset to apply to my face and has a nice and funny cover to the front. I totally recommend this product because it has great features and can really help your acne. Other then that it is also a great product for anyone going through the struggle of acne. It works!</li>
            <li> So i have been using this for mor than a month and I saw a little bit of improvement. Hopefully over time it will do what it is meant to do. Clean the acne bacteria.</li>
            <li> I used this twice a day for about thirty days and I have yet to see any progress in the elimination of my acne. Actually I have more break outs now than I did before using the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne problems probably since probably 9th grade.Must say that I&#x27;ve tried lots of products , cosmetologists,dermatologists but nothing really worked ( you know what i mean) .They just disappear and after some time appear back.But after I started using this product my face is always clean and not oily anymore and my face looks perfect .Hope it will be as this always .</li>
            <li> Please ignore most of the other reviewers who are giving this product 5 stars, most of them are NOT verified purchased.This product is just like any other benzoyl peroxide product. Nothing special other than it not being as irritating as others. Overall I don&#x27;t believe it is worth the hefty price, especially since you can get other benzoyl peroxide washes for much less.</li>
            <li> My son has suffered from severe acne for the last year. I have tried many different products, but nothing has helped. Until now!! Beauty Facial Extreme Extra Strength Face and Body Wash has been a miracle. It helps to remove dirt and debris by getting rid of excess oil. It also reduces the occurrences of clogged pores  preventing breakouts. His skin is not irritated or dry, which has happened with other products in the past. I love that it is fragrance free and does not affect his asthma. It also does not burn his skin. This is the first product that I do not have to fight him to use!! A definite 5 stars from me!!</li>
            <li> A  great treatment or acne .</li>
            <li> did nothing i returned it</li>
            <li> I love this product. It really helped me with my acne problems. It&#x27;s affordable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of acne. My mother told me that i must bought a product that treat it. I found this and i bought it! Wonderful product!! Now i have a wonderful skin and no problem with acne! I hope you will buy it</li>
            <li> This deep cleansing really helps in cleansing my skin and fading away my blemishes . I use this twice daily and have saw great results .</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell and all but it actually made my daughter break out and sore so we discontinued and returned.  It just didn&#x27;t work for her.  Prompt refund.  One month later I was charged for it again.  Amazon quickly rectified it and refunded again.</li>
            <li> I had lots of pimples on my upper back which made me uncomfortable to wear deep necked dresses. But after when I started using this product felt result in 2-3 days. Its now very smooth. It is really effective in cleaning up the skin. I liked the body wash...</li>
            <li> My husband has horrible back acne so we always love using products that are made to help remove it. Beauty Facial Extremes Benzoyl Peroxide wash has helped with just that. My husband has been using this wash for 6 days now and has found that the acne that he gets on his chest and back has started to go away. This product doesnâ€™t dry out skin, but it still leaves it nice and clean. Overall, we absolutely love this wash!&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product in exchange for my review however my opinion is my own*</li>
            <li> This acne treatment really helped with my ance problems I&#x27;ve been having recently. I&#x27;ve only used it for a week and I already see the results! It works magical wonders for your skin &amp; your ance. Definitely going to recommend this to all of my friends who have problems with acne.</li>
            <li> Dealing with acne as an adult can be difficult but a friend referred me to this product and it works great. I had to take pictures for a website and the week before I had a break out. Well I borrowed this from a friend and I was acne free the day before the photo shoot.</li>
            <li> This product is magic, as a teenager I had problems with acne on my face and so far I was ashamed, I decided to buy this product to remove my acne, miraculously this product took effect after a short time of use, It took off much of my red spots on my result of the acne</li>
            <li> This acne facial wash works very well. My only issue was that after a couple of weeks my face was burning, but that was mainly because I was putting it on everyday, and for the first couple of days I was using it and proactiv at the same time. Once I only started using this, I have noticed less irritation, and less acne scars!</li>
            <li> Benzoyl helped my skin quality so much I don&#x27;t even know how to thank you! My teenage son also started using it for his ache and it helped too! Anyone who needs to reduce or almost even get rid of ache I would put the on at night. This is one of the best things out there, I tried almost everything. Overall great product!</li>
            <li> Very affective on my daughters acne.  She is allergic to most products but this worked well.</li>
            <li> Used this for over a week and it does absolutely nothing, drugstore products such as neutrogena will do more at a fraction of the price. Not worth it, I will be returning this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this face wash for a couple weeks now and I really like it. I have always struggled with acne and I can tell this face wash is helping. I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate it in any way.</li>
            <li> I have hormonal acne and proactiv keeps my skin clear. I wanted to see if a new less expensive product would work. I broke out so bad from this stuff. It seriously dried out my skin so my skin produced even more oil to balance it out and in no time I had a pizza face. As soon as I went back to proactiv it cleared up. If you need something to make your face seriously dry out, this is your stuff.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! Cleared my current acne and is helping prevent new breakouts. My blackheads are very less noticable now. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Wonderful wash! Cleared up my adult acne within a week. My face has never been this clear!</li>
            <li> This product is great, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like some of the washes I have used on my face. I also dont find that i break out from this either, which i have a sensitivity to for many products on my face. My blackheads are defintely diminishing and would purchase from this buyer again and would buy this product again .</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product! It makes my skin feel fresh and look healthy, while also fighting acne which I love! A+</li>
            <li> I purchased this to face wash to help with acne problems on my face. It cleared up my skin within a couple of days of use when I used it on my face twice daily. I lowered the usage to once a day and still saw an acne free face. As of late, I have been slacking and I noticed that my acne started to act up again. I started to use this twice a day on a Monday and by Friday of that week, the pimples became smaller and went away. This is a mirace product and lasts for 3 months at least. It is a great buy and I recommend purchasing it through the auto-reorder and save!</li>
            <li> With this Benzoyl Peroxide 10% Wash, my acne has been going down this past few weeks, it has been going down a lot that I can barley see it. I bought this as a gift for my friend but after she told me how well it went, I sued some and it worked like magic. It is smooth and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell to it. It has greatly improved my confidence with myself in public and it has also made my skin a lot smoother. Wish you guys can try this product also!</li>
            <li> Extremely good product for skin care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maintains your skin clean, healthy and it&#x27;s very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I used to really feel so much depressed and was also lacking my own confidence just because of this acne. I tried many products for acne and none worked well and just served as the temporary solution. Seeing this very soon one of my cousin recommended me to use this one as she was having one extra pack. I was so much surprised looking at the results. It also made my skin smooth and clean. All thanks to this product and as well as my cousin.</li>
            <li> I have lot of acne on my back which I no longer have after i have started using this .  This product definitely helps in that aspect as it is really effective in cleaning up the skin and leaving you clear and glowing skin after repeated use. It helps fight acne as well, and the results are amazing! .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product in exchange to provide unbiased reviews.</li>

            <li> I love this product for my acne.</li>
            <li> Unlike many acne treatment products, this one is highly recommendable for washing the entire body. Every member of my family enjoy using it when bathing. It helps remove dirt and make the skin clear. It is not irritating.</li>
            <li> Would have like to seen quicker results but it stop my skin disease to going full effect and my boils go away faster so I&#x27;m loving this product even though it&#x27;s not working fast as I wanted</li>
            <li> It has reduce the acne on my back and redness but it doesn&#x27;t remove acne scars. I wished it did but at least my back looks somewhat better, pimples appear once in a while but not as often as before.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with moderate to severe acne most of my life. Its a never ending cycle of trying products that never work. I came across this and decided to give it a try. I must say I am really glad I did. I used it for a little over a week when I started noticing a change. I was getting fewer breakouts and the ones I had were shrinking or non existen. The product applied good, with no burning or irritation. This is a must have for people who suffer from acne.</li>
            <li> very good but almost too strong, be careful of over drying your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m suffering with Acne since long time and it was very painful to wash my face before. One fine day one of my cousins suggested me to try this and finally it worked out. Now I&#x27;m free from all worries and no more new Acne. Purely I recommend this for the people who are searching for \\&quot;Benzoyl Peroxide\\&quot; kind of products..!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me. Just dried my skin out a whole bunch, even with moisturizer. I didn&#x27;t really care for the type of wash it was. It felt like a lotion that you just rub around on your face. I used it for about a month and a half, hoping to see results, but had no improvements. Was a bit on the expensive side, but the bottle does last a while. Oh well, onto the next one.</li>
            <li> I received this Benzoyl Peroxide 10% Wash as a gift from my friend. Both my family and I have used this product. It is better than expected. Prices are very reasonable and safe to use. Do not cause any side effects. Always brings a touch of comfort to me.</li>
            <li> Tried this. Really works well. I like this.</li>
            <li> I have mild acne and started using this product, but then I quickly realized that it&#x27;s a little too strong for me so I switched to their 5%, This was a much better choice for me.</li>
            <li> Benzoyl peroxide works well in my oily skin, so I figured I was making a good choice with this , I seen a difference overnight ,  I was just upset to see how small the bottle was for the price you pay , it is very expensive at least with proactive you have the option to buy the stuff monthly for less this this stuff ,</li>
            <li> I struggled with horrible acne as a teen, but once I bought this body wash my skin began to clear up. I&#x27;ve become a committed customer and you will be too!</li>
            <li> i used murad and that worked for a little but damaged my face a bit. This actually works! i have combination skin and it definitely stops other acne growth. i also use snail cream at night to moisturize or fix any previous damage because snail cream helps with elasticity</li>
            <li> I never run out of this face wash because it is simply awesome. I have really bad acne and it helped me to keep my pores clean.</li>
            <li> Taking note of so many positive reviews, I tired this product thinking I had found a gem. At the time, I had mild acne that was pretty well controlled. This product has a 30 day guarantee and I thought that it would be more than enough time to see improvement. Not only did I not see an improvement in 30 days, it got WORSE. I went from trying to improve the appearance of blackheads to deep cystic acne that has left scars and deep regret for this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face, I actually had some adult acne that I struggle with already. I have to keep rotating products, because it seems like my face will get used to one, after I use it for so long, and the product will stop being effective for me. This works best on the blackheads on my nose, I have noticed. This stuff really shrinks the pores, and I can barely see them anymore, I love it. I think the pump top is really handy as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> Complete scam, received product, label not even on bottle. Not a wash, lotion with all in-active ingredients, other then 10% benzoyl p., which I doubt is in there either, this is according to label!! Returning ASAP!!</li>
            <li> I did not like this product. I usually use Proactiv products, but wanted to give this a try. It made me brake out more and would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I have found some of the acne face and body washes on the market today that &amp;#34;work best&amp;#34; are also unfortunately harsh on my skin. This acne wash is unlike the others in that respect. It&#x27;s the perfect balance between effectiveness and healthy skin care. I will definitely be a customer for life.</li>
            <li> This made my son and I have huge breakouts.  We tried it several times and it kept breaking us out.  We had the worse acne till we stopped using this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that I could use everyday. I am lucky that I found this product because it has worked wonders on my skin and I truly feel like a brand new person. Great product that works as intended.</li>
            <li> I felt low when I used to be with my friends due to the blackheads on my face. I tried a couple of skin care products but they added to my problem and resulted in pimples and acne. One of my friend suggested me this product as she was using it too. I thought lets give it a try. To my wonder, this face wash worked for me. I can see the blackheads are reduced to a big extent and I am not feeling any skin irritation too. Let me see for more weeks and I will share the result once again with you. So far I am just happy about it.</li>
