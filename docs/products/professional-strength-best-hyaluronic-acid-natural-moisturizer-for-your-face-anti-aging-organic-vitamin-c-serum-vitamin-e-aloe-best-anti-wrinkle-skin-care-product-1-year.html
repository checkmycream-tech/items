            <li>I received this face serum on August 20, 2015, and this product was provided to me at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.  </li>

            <li>Very impressive product at a reasonable price.</li>

            <li>Along with a nice moisturizer and gloves, I put it on while watching TV and relaxing in the evening.</li>
            <li>In am I use the c serum and a spf on top olay has a good one.</li>
            <li>I used the product and liked the results.</li>
            <li>My opinions are my own and have not been influenced in any way.</li>

            <li>i received this product in exchange of my honest  review.</li>
            <li>I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR A FAIR AND HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li>It is also completely natural which makes me happy!  </li>
            <li>I love Azure products because they are an honest and reliable company with quality products</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hyaluronic Acid can hold up to 1000 times its weight in water and draws moisture out of the environment onto the surface of your skin, which makes it a more effective moisturizing product.</li>
            <li>I ended up figuring most of the answers on my own, except for whether or not you can use around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Easy pump for applying, immediate results!  </li>
            <li>It has a very light weight non greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light weight</li>
            <li>I am 59 years old but with very good skin.</li>
            <li>so I look for more of what makes my skin look and feel healthy.  </li>
            <li>:) Like I mentioned before I think it is premature to state any results</li>
            <li>I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE FOR A HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li>- I always feel they could have put more explanation up on the bottle or the instruction.</li>
            <li>As a result, it rolled around and the top had all but popped off.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You will notice from looking at these ingredients that most of these look beneficial, and indeed they probably are.  </li>
            <li>You’ll find carrageenan in a number of products that most of us use every day.  </li>
            <li>I also question the percentage of hyaluronic acid contained in the product, and whether or not it is at a safe level.  </li>
            <li>I also question the percentage of hyaluronic acid contained in the product, and whether or not it is at a safe level.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I use it longer, I will see even better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is, my face  feels a lot more moisturized and has a more radiant, youthful look to it.</li>

            <li>Love the feeling on my skin.  </li>
            <li>My face did look tiered but this perks it up even when I am feeling sleepy:)</li>
            <li>Leaves me face feeling nice &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I will order again</li>
            <li>I love this one as I love Azure Naturals Vit C serum.</li>
            <li>I would love to see them come out with an Emu Oil line.</li>
            <li>Like so many hyaluronic acid formulas out there, this one contains witch hazel.  </li>
            <li>I love that this product is certified organic.</li>
            <li>I received this product for free or a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>

            <li>I love the pump</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re more supple and bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it at night and the c serum in morning after a month my skin feels and looks better.</li>
            <li>My skin just looks better and I am 51.</li>
            <li>I use the hyaluronic at night and use argan oil on top .</li>
            <li>Love this it works can&#x27;t wait to see how could my skin will look in 3 months.</li>
            <li>It also hasn&#x27;t made me break out when many products do, and I don&#x27;t find it too drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I really could not be more happy with it.</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free of charge in return for my honest review.</li>
            <li>Love the way this makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed trying this Azure Naturals product for my review.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I was able to get this product at a reduced price to try it out.</li>
            <li>I love when my things come in bubble wrap</li>
            <li>I love that I can use this product under my moisturizer and makeup with no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li>my skin has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>Also, unlike the vitamin C serums, the hyaluronic acid serum is more of a gel consistency than liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one works a lot better then those you see in stores by like olay an neutrogene.</li>
            <li>It has a better way of healing your skin and making it feel more nourished.</li>
            <li>My thoughts: I did receive this product for free!</li>
            <li>I use it at night, so that I can look beautiful and young in the morning.</li>
            <li>It helps me stay look young and beautiful.</li>
            <li>but for the witch hazel, this looks like a pretty good formula.</li>
            <li>It is nice and cool going on.</li>
            <li>I love that it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is a 1 oz (30ml) bottle with a convenient and easy to use pump style top.</li>
            <li>This product has been great so far!</li>
            <li>As always, all the right &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; ingredients and customer service is top notch!</li>
            <li>safe for acne-prone but mid-30s skin (so showing some signs of age); *cruelty free</li>
            <li>It is just a light citrusy scent. :)</li>
            <li>It is not sticky at all, smell nice and absorbed well on the skin.</li>
            <li>The reality here is that once we stop using so many cleansers and washes and toners, our skin tends to regulate itself and many times will clear up and look and feel very healthy.  </li>
            <li>Read my full review at TheBeeHiveBuzz dot com!</li>
            <li>an has a very light smell to it which is not a bad smell at all.</li>
            <li>Pump dispenser is easy and doesn&#x27;t leak at all.  </li>
            <li>easily damaged&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>easily damaged&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to use an apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable and you can easily buy it from amazon.</li>
            <li>and the results have been pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li>just a bottle?&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the product itself is not bad - it&#x27;s very smooth and light, does not irritate my skin or cause any discomfort.</li>
            <li>I think it is made to so this to hide fine lines.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is firmer, fine lines and wrinkles have diminished and</li>
            <li>Remember, I said it took time to get those fine lines and wrinkles, so be patient.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it hides fine lines.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I was still able to make the pump work, so I didn’t bother contacting the company for a replacement.  </li>
            <li>My face look smoother and tighter like the fine lines have been filled in.</li>
            <li>Which Is A Huge PLUS</li>
            <li>I wish I had a HUGE bottle of it</li>
            <li>MY SKIN IS SMOOTH AND BRIGHTER.</li>
            <li>Great serum- absorbs into my skin instantly.  </li>
            <li>And  try this product forcouple weeks.it really fit on my face and really enjoy this product</li>
            <li>I was given this product free for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product.</li>
            <li>how effective serums and toners really are, so I did some additional research.  </li>
            <li>It does not have much of a smell at all, which I liked.</li>
            <li>, this totally just soaks in and makes your face feel great.</li>
            <li>I received it complimentary for testing purposes but I will need more.</li>
            <li>did receive this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell which some people like, I wish it had some kind of smell to it.</li>
            <li>Great product,, really makes a difference.. highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, not greasy and no unpleasant smell.  </li>

            <li>I have seen a significant reduction in irritation, and I can also report that my skin has regulated and no longer produces excess oil.  </li>
            <li>I definitely  recommend this product based on my own results!</li>
            <li>It is a simple and effective addition to your skincare!</li>
            <li>It’s interesting to me that it is included here in a serum designed for one of the most sensitive areas of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>an clean.</li>
            <li>I might be able to get away with using this to fight signs of aging on the more tolerant skin on the backs of my hands, but it won&#x27;t be going anywhere near my face.  </li>
            <li>serum spreads really good, so you don&#x27;t really need much to start with.</li>
            <li>From the reviews I am super excited to see the results overtime.</li>
            <li>I have heard about how hyaluronic acid is great at activating collagen production allowing for fresher, firmer and more radiant skin in the past</li>
            <li>Hyalueronic is very beneficial for healthy looking  skin.</li>
            <li>CAN WAIT FOR THE FULL 30 DAYS...</li>
            <li>This helps prevent light from spoiling the product prematurely, and the fact that glass was used rather than a cheap plastic that could potentially leach chemicals is a nice touch as well.  </li>
            <li>Before using the product, I wanted to check out the full ingredients list.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed my moisturizer is even absorbing better with the addition of this product to my skin care routine.</li>
            <li>I like the addition of the vitamins to the serum as well, which really do help to make your complexion brighter and more even.</li>
            <li>This product works good in conjunction with the cucumber infused ultimate peptide eye gel.</li>
            <li>It may need more time to see real improvements.</li>
            <li>This Hyaluronic Acid moisturizer contains 98% natural and 72% organic ingredients contains no alcohol, no parabens, plant based, no gmo&#x27;s and most importantly cruelty free and never tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>Helped clear up my skin problems and keeps my skin nice looking under my foundation.</li>
            <li>I try as many anti-aging products that I can get my hands on i believe you should take care of your body as much as ypu can</li>
            <li>but so far it&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li>A good way for the c serum is to keep in the fridge and only a oz.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin quickly and lasts all day</li>
            <li>It is pretty light weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so anything that has a strong smell really turns me off, this did not.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes, they water after I put most products close to them and this one did not.</li>
            <li>it really smooths  out fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I really liked that this serum has a little thicker consistency to it, but it still absorbed very well and quickly into my skin without leaving any kind of residue.</li>
            <li>with any skincare products, I always tell my friends that it took time to get those fine lines and wrinkles, so your skincare products will work the more you use them and this one is no different.</li>
            <li>It really does absorb moisture and leaves my face so smooth.</li>
            <li>It really helped to rehydrate and smooth my skin.  </li>
            <li>In sum: not oily, does not cause even more pimples, but makes feel soft.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li>So far I am in love.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and my face feels soft and wrinkle free.  </li>
            <li>The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li>I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>I just have to keep using it to see more results, but so far, I like it.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic serum is such an important part to a healthy skin regimen for hydration.</li>
            <li>Take the time to understand the things you are choosing to put on your skin and make an educated decision about what is right for you.  </li>
            <li>Take the time to understand the things you are choosing to put on your skin and make an educated decision about what is right for you.  </li>
            <li>There seem to be a lot of companies coming out with face serums right now.</li>
            <li>I started using it right away</li>
            <li>so I get just the right amount.</li>
            <li>I put in on right after I get out of the shower while my skin is still moist.</li>
            <li>:) I use it every morning &amp; evening (yes, I really like it) :) &amp; it&#x27;s super soft &amp; dries very quick, so I can put my moisturizer or any other skin care products I use over it.</li>
            <li>I use the C first (on cleansed skin) and the Hyaluronic right after followed by a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I was originally going to wait a few weeks to review this, thinking it would take time to see benefits (if any), but after just a couple days I can already feel my skin is more moisturized, and not just like some off-the-shelf moisturizing cream full of chemicals does.</li>
            <li>I love this product - Natural, does what they say it will, no negative reactions.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and clear like silk with no greasy or stickyafter feeling ...</li>
            <li>I received  this product at a steep discount to review; after both me and my hubby uding ut consistently for 3 weeks; I can say I haven&#x27;t noticed ANY change in</li>
            <li>The first is that my bottle did not come in a box as shown in the pictures.  </li>
            <li>A definite must for age prevention or reversing, I love that it pumps up and smoothes the skin.</li>
            <li>and she uses it pretty consistently.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t smell it after the first 30 seconds after application, so no stars off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently discovered Azure Naturals and love everything about their line</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;d had the chance to look at the ingredients first, I&#x27;d have declined the sample.  </li>
            <li>I found this product to be equal, certainly no better than others that are much more cost effective!</li>
            <li>and it makes my face skin more moisture especially in fall and winter time.</li>
            <li>However, as I spend more time outside in the summer at swim meets</li>
            <li>I  didn&#x27;t  feel this product provided the moisture I needed and left me wanting more.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>and my face stays soft and smooth all</li>
            <li>You really get your money&#x27;s worth in value and benefits to your skin.</li>
            <li>out clear and smoothly covers your like the feeling of water.</li>
            <li>It has become a part of my daily morning routine and has more than once saved me from the effects of sunburn.</li>
            <li>While arguably these studies have various factors associated with them, a simple Google search will yield some surprising results for both sides of the argument.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a pretty clear serum that absorbs rather quickly without making your face feel or look like it&#x27;s greasy or shiny.</li>
            <li>I started using AzureNaturals for almost a month now, I really use it on my forehead from all the funny faces I make as a mother.</li>
            <li>Azure Naturals does recommend that it will work even better if used in conjunction with their Vitamin C Serum.low to dry.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are pure in this</li>
            <li>This improved my skin tone and large pores.</li>
            <li>AFTER ONLY 3 DAYS OF USE, I HAVE NOTICE THE FINE LINE IN MY CHIN and mouth is DIMINISHING.</li>
            <li>the dryness on my face and neck with immediate intense hydration&lt;br /&gt;-Noticeable reduction of fine lines and wrinkles (especially on my forehead)&lt;br</li>
            <li>My preference  is serum and the really like the texture of this serum.</li>
            <li>But this time, really?</li>
            <li>I really have seen a difference around my eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying a period of zero products to see how your skin may improve!</li>
            <li>I understand results may vary with each person, but I personally had a really great experience with the Azure Naturals Ultimate Hyaluronic Acid Serum and would recommend this product to anyone to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really seems to plump the skin up.</li>
            <li>It comes in a pump rather than a dropper, the pump is much easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very content with my order.</li>
            <li>The scent is a light almost herbal/flower like fragrance so it definitely does not smell like chemicals.</li>
            <li>Some of you might notice changes in about 2 weeks, but it can take up to 6 or 8 weeks to really see the difference and by the 6 month period, you will see the maximum benefits.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>really like this product and know that seeing results after 2 weeks is just the beginning.</li>
            <li>I moisturize in the morning and night and that&#x27;s all I need when i get ready in the mornings and go to bed at night.</li>
            <li>I did not know if I really needed this</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to continue using the product.</li>
            <li>I really like what it has done to my skin.</li>
            <li>It really seems to plump the skin up.</li>
            <li>and i do see results not has much as i would like</li>
            <li>so it was only natural that this would be my latest addition to my skin care regimen.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying over the last year or so to get away from all chemical based skincare products and go more natural or organic and it being made here is like icing on the cake!&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are unsure how much you will need, start very small and add as needed until you get more comfortable with how much to use.</li>
            <li>Very full and dry.</li>
            <li>I don’t know what effects long term use might have on the skin, but as someone who has very sensitive skin, it seems to me to be a better precaution to limit my exposure.  </li>
            <li>Since I started using hyaluronic serum right after I shave, the irritation has completely stopped.</li>
            <li>The skin on my face was becoming dry, and flaky.  </li>
            <li>I found that this is a carbohydrate that is already present in our bodies, and has significant healing and restorative capabilities.  </li>
            <li>This came in a perfect sized, small blue box with white lettering.</li>
            <li>It can take 4-6 weeks to see improvement and up to 6 months to experience the full benefit of a daily routine with Hyaluronic.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>youthful 31 year old, I am an old soul and excited to look this age for nearly ever.</li>
            <li>Mainly because it is in liquid form.</li>
            <li>Overall, seems like a good product, price is reasonable for the small 1 oz.</li>
            <li>I highly  recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying a period of zero products to see how your skin may improve!healthy.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I got a high discount code for it.</li>
            <li>You will love how your face feels and looks once you have used it for a few weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You only need a couple drops and it glides on the skin and absorbs right away.</li>
            <li>and she didn&#x27;t even know I was trying a new product.</li>
            <li>My skin feels brand new.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and it&#x27;s the hottest part of the year here summer time.</li>
            <li>Through this research, I learned that many of the products that we use on our faces are really quite unnecessary, and in most cases actually cause sebum production to be grossly thrown off scale.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any real results after using the entire bottle.</li>
            <li>It is found in high concentrations naturally, but the ability of the skin to reproduce it lessens as we age.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also so soft!</li>
            <li>I was aware of the benefits of hyaluronic acid for years, but never used it personally.</li>
            <li>I like it so far!</li>
            <li>but now I have seen it in action and it made a believer out of me!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a strong smell, and it didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling heavy like lotion would.  </li>
            <li>After only TWO uses my skin looked more hydrated and was noticeable less flaky.  </li>
            <li>skin does feel a little softer although I haven’t noticed a huge change.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I&#x27;m crazy...</li>
            <li>as clearly it was causing some adverse effects for me.  </li>
            <li>but so far I like it and will continue to use it</li>
            <li>so I can put product directly onto my face.</li>
            <li>The issues that we think we have are really just a constant use of products to try and correct skin that we believe to be overly-oily and irritated.  </li>
            <li>dryness on sensitive skin</li>
            <li>dryness on sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have been using this serum for a few days now an it has made my face feel smooth</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and she loves it so she can stays young</li>
            <li>I do really like this product because I use it daily</li>
            <li>so I am hoping that this serum helps keep me looking young.  </li>
            <li>I have mature skin.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft and it glows.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>but you should&#x27;nt expect miracles at 62 years old</li>
            <li>The Ultimate Hyaluronic Acid Serum is plant based and made right here in the United States, so that is even further incentive to use this product.</li>
            <li>I first wash wash my face and then pat dry , use the Witch hazel as my toner and then apply this all over my face except eyes.</li>
            <li>This product also caused, for me, the above mentioned excessive dryness, but many users seem to have found it to be favorable.  </li>
            <li>This product also caused, for me, the above mentioned excessive dryness, but many users seem to have found it to be favorable.  </li>
            <li>I also love that you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li>I also purchased the retinal serum and received it yesterday, not sure yet if that works as good, will need a few days to tell.</li>
            <li>By squinting I am able to feel the normally dry skin above my cheeks feels loose and smooth - hard to explain</li>
            <li>I use to have seasons of oily skin and then dry skin, however using this product for the last 3 weeks has allowed me to have a consistent clear and shall I say radiant skin!</li>
            <li>It is pretty light weight feeling on my face but did take a few min to dry enough to put on my moisturizer..</li>
            <li>Personally, I tend to avoid too much carrageenan when possible.  </li>
            <li>Check out the wealth of information that is available online, and take a few minutes to read about the potential benefits of not using any products at all.  </li>

            <li>I have since decided to start a 30 day challenge to not use any products on my face and cleanse with water only, because I want to see this theory in action and see how my skin is affected.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to see some further research direct from the company to support their claims, and I&#x27;d like to see the removal of the carrageenan and the potassium sorbate.  </li>
            <li>I have begun to use Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Facial Cleanser w/ Cotton Extract about once a week now, just to wash away any of the excess gunk that might be in my pores from going to the gym during the week, and this has become my go to routine.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m rapidly approaching 50, but my skin still looks like I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>You only need a few squirts to have full face/neck coverage.</li>
            <li>She said that its a little more &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; than she likes because she typically uses a cream, but she does like it.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin on my face, and every time I shaved it left it really red and irritated.</li>
            <li>I usually have issues with dryness and this has made mt skin look super hydrated.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert, so my skin has been exposed to lots of dry air and wind.</li>
            <li>I question whether or not the hyaluronic acid is really a &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; active ingredient.  </li>

            <li>I didn’t change any other part of my normal routine.  </li>
            <li>I’m not sure I like that idea because the second you stop using the product the lines would come right back.</li>

            <li> I love Azure products because they are an honest and reliable company with quality products</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid can hold up to 1000 times its weight in water and draws moisture out of the environment onto the surface of your skin, which makes it a more effective moisturizing product.</li>
            <li> I ended up figuring most of the answers on my own, except for whether or not you can use around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Easy pump for applying, immediate results!  </li>

            <li> - I always feel they could have put more explanation up on the bottle or the instruction.</li>
            <li> As a result, it rolled around and the top had all but popped off.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You will notice from looking at these ingredients that most of these look beneficial, and indeed they probably are.  </li>
            <li> You’ll find carrageenan in a number of products that most of us use every day.  </li>
            <li> I also question the percentage of hyaluronic acid contained in the product, and whether or not it is at a safe level.  </li>
            <li> I also question the percentage of hyaluronic acid contained in the product, and whether or not it is at a safe level.  </li>

            <li> Also, unlike the vitamin C serums, the hyaluronic acid serum is more of a gel consistency than liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one works a lot better then those you see in stores by like olay an neutrogene.</li>
            <li> It has a better way of healing your skin and making it feel more nourished.</li>

            <li> safe for acne-prone but mid-30s skin (so showing some signs of age); *cruelty free</li>
            <li> It is just a light citrusy scent. :)</li>
            <li> It is not sticky at all, smell nice and absorbed well on the skin.</li>
            <li> The reality here is that once we stop using so many cleansers and washes and toners, our skin tends to regulate itself and many times will clear up and look and feel very healthy.  </li>

            <li> I think it is made to so this to hide fine lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is firmer, fine lines and wrinkles have diminished and</li>
            <li> Remember, I said it took time to get those fine lines and wrinkles, so be patient.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it hides fine lines.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I was still able to make the pump work, so I didn’t bother contacting the company for a replacement.  </li>

            <li> Which Is A Huge PLUS</li>
            <li> I wish I had a HUGE bottle of it</li>

            <li> I have seen a significant reduction in irritation, and I can also report that my skin has regulated and no longer produces excess oil.  </li>
            <li> I definitely  recommend this product based on my own results!</li>
            <li> It is a simple and effective addition to your skincare!</li>
            <li> It’s interesting to me that it is included here in a serum designed for one of the most sensitive areas of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> an clean.</li>
            <li> I might be able to get away with using this to fight signs of aging on the more tolerant skin on the backs of my hands, but it won&#x27;t be going anywhere near my face.  </li>
            <li> serum spreads really good, so you don&#x27;t really need much to start with.</li>
            <li> From the reviews I am super excited to see the results overtime.</li>
            <li> I have heard about how hyaluronic acid is great at activating collagen production allowing for fresher, firmer and more radiant skin in the past</li>
            <li> Hyalueronic is very beneficial for healthy looking  skin.</li>
            <li> CAN WAIT FOR THE FULL 30 DAYS...</li>
            <li> This helps prevent light from spoiling the product prematurely, and the fact that glass was used rather than a cheap plastic that could potentially leach chemicals is a nice touch as well.  </li>
            <li> Before using the product, I wanted to check out the full ingredients list.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed my moisturizer is even absorbing better with the addition of this product to my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> I like the addition of the vitamins to the serum as well, which really do help to make your complexion brighter and more even.</li>
            <li> This product works good in conjunction with the cucumber infused ultimate peptide eye gel.</li>
            <li> It may need more time to see real improvements.</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic Acid moisturizer contains 98% natural and 72% organic ingredients contains no alcohol, no parabens, plant based, no gmo&#x27;s and most importantly cruelty free and never tested on animals.  </li>
            <li> Helped clear up my skin problems and keeps my skin nice looking under my foundation.</li>
            <li> I try as many anti-aging products that I can get my hands on i believe you should take care of your body as much as ypu can</li>
            <li> but so far it&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li> A good way for the c serum is to keep in the fridge and only a oz.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin quickly and lasts all day</li>
            <li> It is pretty light weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so anything that has a strong smell really turns me off, this did not.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes, they water after I put most products close to them and this one did not.</li>
            <li> it really smooths  out fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I really liked that this serum has a little thicker consistency to it, but it still absorbed very well and quickly into my skin without leaving any kind of residue.</li>
            <li> with any skincare products, I always tell my friends that it took time to get those fine lines and wrinkles, so your skincare products will work the more you use them and this one is no different.</li>
            <li> It really does absorb moisture and leaves my face so smooth.</li>
            <li> It really helped to rehydrate and smooth my skin.  </li>
            <li> In sum: not oily, does not cause even more pimples, but makes feel soft.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> So far I am in love.</li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly and my face feels soft and wrinkle free.  </li>
            <li> The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I just have to keep using it to see more results, but so far, I like it.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic serum is such an important part to a healthy skin regimen for hydration.</li>
            <li> Take the time to understand the things you are choosing to put on your skin and make an educated decision about what is right for you.  </li>
            <li> Take the time to understand the things you are choosing to put on your skin and make an educated decision about what is right for you.  </li>
            <li> There seem to be a lot of companies coming out with face serums right now.</li>
            <li> I started using it right away</li>
            <li> so I get just the right amount.</li>
            <li> I put in on right after I get out of the shower while my skin is still moist.</li>
            <li> :) I use it every morning &amp; evening (yes, I really like it) :) &amp; it&#x27;s super soft &amp; dries very quick, so I can put my moisturizer or any other skin care products I use over it.</li>
            <li> I use the C first (on cleansed skin) and the Hyaluronic right after followed by a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was originally going to wait a few weeks to review this, thinking it would take time to see benefits (if any), but after just a couple days I can already feel my skin is more moisturized, and not just like some off-the-shelf moisturizing cream full of chemicals does.</li>
            <li> I love this product - Natural, does what they say it will, no negative reactions.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and clear like silk with no greasy or stickyafter feeling ...</li>
            <li> I received  this product at a steep discount to review; after both me and my hubby uding ut consistently for 3 weeks; I can say I haven&#x27;t noticed ANY change in</li>
            <li> The first is that my bottle did not come in a box as shown in the pictures.  </li>
            <li> A definite must for age prevention or reversing, I love that it pumps up and smoothes the skin.</li>
            <li> and she uses it pretty consistently.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t smell it after the first 30 seconds after application, so no stars off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently discovered Azure Naturals and love everything about their line</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;d had the chance to look at the ingredients first, I&#x27;d have declined the sample.  </li>
            <li> I found this product to be equal, certainly no better than others that are much more cost effective!</li>
            <li> and it makes my face skin more moisture especially in fall and winter time.</li>
            <li> However, as I spend more time outside in the summer at swim meets</li>
            <li> I  didn&#x27;t  feel this product provided the moisture I needed and left me wanting more.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> and my face stays soft and smooth all</li>
            <li> You really get your money&#x27;s worth in value and benefits to your skin.</li>
            <li> out clear and smoothly covers your like the feeling of water.</li>
            <li> It has become a part of my daily morning routine and has more than once saved me from the effects of sunburn.</li>
            <li> While arguably these studies have various factors associated with them, a simple Google search will yield some surprising results for both sides of the argument.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a pretty clear serum that absorbs rather quickly without making your face feel or look like it&#x27;s greasy or shiny.</li>
            <li> I started using AzureNaturals for almost a month now, I really use it on my forehead from all the funny faces I make as a mother.</li>
            <li> Azure Naturals does recommend that it will work even better if used in conjunction with their Vitamin C Serum.low to dry.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are pure in this</li>
            <li> This improved my skin tone and large pores.</li>
            <li> AFTER ONLY 3 DAYS OF USE, I HAVE NOTICE THE FINE LINE IN MY CHIN and mouth is DIMINISHING.</li>
            <li> the dryness on my face and neck with immediate intense hydration&lt;br /&gt;-Noticeable reduction of fine lines and wrinkles (especially on my forehead)&lt;br</li>
            <li> My preference  is serum and the really like the texture of this serum.</li>
            <li> But this time, really?</li>
            <li> I really have seen a difference around my eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying a period of zero products to see how your skin may improve!</li>
            <li> I understand results may vary with each person, but I personally had a really great experience with the Azure Naturals Ultimate Hyaluronic Acid Serum and would recommend this product to anyone to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really seems to plump the skin up.</li>
            <li> It comes in a pump rather than a dropper, the pump is much easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very content with my order.</li>
            <li> The scent is a light almost herbal/flower like fragrance so it definitely does not smell like chemicals.</li>
            <li> Some of you might notice changes in about 2 weeks, but it can take up to 6 or 8 weeks to really see the difference and by the 6 month period, you will see the maximum benefits.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> really like this product and know that seeing results after 2 weeks is just the beginning.</li>
            <li> I moisturize in the morning and night and that&#x27;s all I need when i get ready in the mornings and go to bed at night.</li>
            <li> I did not know if I really needed this</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to continue using the product.</li>
            <li> I really like what it has done to my skin.</li>
            <li> It really seems to plump the skin up.</li>
            <li> and i do see results not has much as i would like</li>
            <li> so it was only natural that this would be my latest addition to my skin care regimen.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying over the last year or so to get away from all chemical based skincare products and go more natural or organic and it being made here is like icing on the cake!&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are unsure how much you will need, start very small and add as needed until you get more comfortable with how much to use.</li>
            <li> Very full and dry.</li>
            <li> I don’t know what effects long term use might have on the skin, but as someone who has very sensitive skin, it seems to me to be a better precaution to limit my exposure.  </li>
            <li> Since I started using hyaluronic serum right after I shave, the irritation has completely stopped.</li>
            <li> The skin on my face was becoming dry, and flaky.  </li>
            <li> I found that this is a carbohydrate that is already present in our bodies, and has significant healing and restorative capabilities.  </li>
            <li> This came in a perfect sized, small blue box with white lettering.</li>
            <li> It can take 4-6 weeks to see improvement and up to 6 months to experience the full benefit of a daily routine with Hyaluronic.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> youthful 31 year old, I am an old soul and excited to look this age for nearly ever.</li>
            <li> Mainly because it is in liquid form.</li>
            <li> Overall, seems like a good product, price is reasonable for the small 1 oz.</li>
            <li> I highly  recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying a period of zero products to see how your skin may improve!healthy.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got a high discount code for it.</li>
            <li> You will love how your face feels and looks once you have used it for a few weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You only need a couple drops and it glides on the skin and absorbs right away.</li>
            <li> and she didn&#x27;t even know I was trying a new product.</li>
            <li> My skin feels brand new.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and it&#x27;s the hottest part of the year here summer time.</li>
            <li> Through this research, I learned that many of the products that we use on our faces are really quite unnecessary, and in most cases actually cause sebum production to be grossly thrown off scale.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any real results after using the entire bottle.</li>
            <li> It is found in high concentrations naturally, but the ability of the skin to reproduce it lessens as we age.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also so soft!</li>
            <li> I was aware of the benefits of hyaluronic acid for years, but never used it personally.</li>
            <li> I like it so far!</li>
            <li> but now I have seen it in action and it made a believer out of me!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a strong smell, and it didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling heavy like lotion would.  </li>
            <li> After only TWO uses my skin looked more hydrated and was noticeable less flaky.  </li>
            <li> skin does feel a little softer although I haven’t noticed a huge change.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I&#x27;m crazy...</li>
            <li> as clearly it was causing some adverse effects for me.  </li>
            <li> but so far I like it and will continue to use it</li>
            <li> so I can put product directly onto my face.</li>
            <li> The issues that we think we have are really just a constant use of products to try and correct skin that we believe to be overly-oily and irritated.  </li>
            <li> dryness on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> dryness on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a few days now an it has made my face feel smooth</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it so she can stays young</li>
            <li> I do really like this product because I use it daily</li>
            <li> so I am hoping that this serum helps keep me looking young.  </li>
            <li> I have mature skin.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft and it glows.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> but you should&#x27;nt expect miracles at 62 years old</li>
            <li> The Ultimate Hyaluronic Acid Serum is plant based and made right here in the United States, so that is even further incentive to use this product.</li>
            <li> I first wash wash my face and then pat dry , use the Witch hazel as my toner and then apply this all over my face except eyes.</li>
            <li> This product also caused, for me, the above mentioned excessive dryness, but many users seem to have found it to be favorable.  </li>

            <li> I also love that you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> I also purchased the retinal serum and received it yesterday, not sure yet if that works as good, will need a few days to tell.</li>
            <li> By squinting I am able to feel the normally dry skin above my cheeks feels loose and smooth - hard to explain</li>
            <li> I use to have seasons of oily skin and then dry skin, however using this product for the last 3 weeks has allowed me to have a consistent clear and shall I say radiant skin!</li>
            <li> It is pretty light weight feeling on my face but did take a few min to dry enough to put on my moisturizer..</li>
            <li> Personally, I tend to avoid too much carrageenan when possible.  </li>
            <li> Check out the wealth of information that is available online, and take a few minutes to read about the potential benefits of not using any products at all.  </li>

            <li> I will buy this product in the near future.</li>
            <li> I have since decided to start a 30 day challenge to not use any products on my face and cleanse with water only, because I want to see this theory in action and see how my skin is affected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to see some further research direct from the company to support their claims, and I&#x27;d like to see the removal of the carrageenan and the potassium sorbate.  </li>
            <li> I have begun to use Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Facial Cleanser w/ Cotton Extract about once a week now, just to wash away any of the excess gunk that might be in my pores from going to the gym during the week, and this has become my go to routine.  </li>

            <li> She said that its a little more &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; than she likes because she typically uses a cream, but she does like it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my face, and every time I shaved it left it really red and irritated.</li>
            <li> I usually have issues with dryness and this has made mt skin look super hydrated.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert, so my skin has been exposed to lots of dry air and wind.</li>
            <li> I question whether or not the hyaluronic acid is really a &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; active ingredient.  </li>

            <li> personal try to only use organic all natural products.  </li>
            <li> I didn’t change any other part of my normal routine.  </li>
            <li> I’m not sure I like that idea because the second you stop using the product the lines would come right back.</li>
            <li> That being said you can&#x27;t always get the WOW affect as you do with some of the other serums on the market</li>
            <li> A stark change to my oily high school years.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with dry spots on my face and this really seems to help keep them under control.</li>
            <li> I felt the small was light and not chemical smelling, unlike some other the other reviews, I don&#x27;t use scented products</li>
            <li> You use this first and it sucks the moisturizer in to  your skin.</li>
            <li> Since we all have different skin types, my overall recommendation is to simply perform some research before you decide to buy this product, or any other products for that matter.  </li>

            <li> By the seventh day, my face was extremely dry, to the point that my skin was flaking and my brow area actually hurt from the dryness.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is the pump, which squirts out too much.</li>
            <li> It is a very lightweight  formula, and absorbs into the skin quickly without leaving any unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li> One bottle will last a very long time!</li>
            <li> My skin looks less tired, and as other reviewers have said, more &amp;#34;radiant&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It brightens skins appearance fills minor lines.</li>
            <li> quantity, so as long as they keep the price, I will continue to order.</li>
            <li> I’m always curious to find out how other products perform, especially with facial products.</li>
            <li> This is a product that is made from red algae and I’m guessing in the context of this serum it may function as one of the thickening agents, with the hydroxyethyl cellulose being the other.  </li>
            <li> I use it with the other Azure facial products and I find the products work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this will last or only initially when you start using it, time will tell.</li>
            <li> its not greasy and gross like other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> After about six days, I noticed that my face was remarkably dry.  </li>
            <li> I have had redness on the sides of my face and extremely dry skin around my nose for years.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect this to be a cure for dry skin; nothing is.</li>
            <li> Allow to dry.</li>
            <li> I let it dry and put my make up on.</li>
            <li> Does not make your face look dry.</li>
            <li> Dry skin shows age faster</li>
            <li> my face hasn&#x27;t been dry at all.</li>
            <li> It has helped to plump my skin and Lao with my dark circles, definitely a product I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Living in Arizona can leave your face wrinkled and dry and this helps defeat the sun!</li>
            <li> I normally do not use products of this type, but I decided to give this a go due to some unexplained breakouts around my forehead and scalp area.  </li>
            <li> All it takes is a few drops to achieve the same results so this bottle will go a long way</li>
            <li> I have tried a few Hyaluronic Acid serums over the past year but this one was a real treat.</li>
            <li> one is a little different since is contains an acid.</li>
            <li> it last a little longer.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned before, I have sensitive skin, so it is hard for me to say what ingredient(s) caused the dryness.  </li>
            <li> Don’t listen to the reviews that are one liners telling you that this product is great, and don’t listen to the ones making outrageous claims.  </li>

            <li> After I stopped using the product, I became curious as to</li>
            <li> I have been using the Azure Naturals Ultimate Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a few weeks now and the biggest difference and the biggest improvement I have noticed</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It goes on lightweight and you can wet it under moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be checking back in with the review in a few weeks with a updated review</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few days now, and am looking forward to seeing as well as feeling a difference soon.</li>
            <li> only &#x27;negative&#x27; is a slightly different odor than you&#x27;d expect from one of the off the shelf brands of moisturizers, but that&#x27;s because this isn&#x27;t pumped full of artificial fragrance.</li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was worried about effectiveness due to watery consistency.</li>
            <li> A bonus of this product is that unlike some serum that cannot be applied too often, this one can be used daily, so it&#x27;s simple for someone like me who does not want a complicated facial care schedule.</li>
            <li> other than that but other than I&#x27;m gonna continue to use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To explore the other side, I also researched hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li> but I expect that to improve as well, once the underlying inflammation is taken care of by the hyaluronic acid/MSM and other beneficial ingredients in this!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried Hyaluronic serum before from other companies.</li>
            <li> but when I saw the skin doctor for a other reason I asked he if I needed it</li>
            <li> I use it every other night, and use this brand&#x27;s 2.5% Retinol anti-wrinkle serum on off nights.</li>
            <li> (I get a little red on my face after running and just a little bit of this on my face helps it go away in one day).</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is not like other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Overall though not thrilled with what I&#x27;ve seen (or lack thereof)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still under review:&lt;br /&gt;-Lighten dark under eye circles&lt;br</li>
            <li> Obviously I do not know yet if it will slow my aging, but I hope so.</li>
            <li> It even works for oily skin and cuts down on breakouts.</li>
            <li> maybe crazy isn&#x27;t the right word</li>
            <li> The redness is even a little less after a couple days</li>
            <li> It give you a bit of a tight feeling.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause your face to feel tight or oily.</li>
            <li> and I find a little goes along way .  </li>
            <li> It burns my skin and made little blisters.</li>
            <li> *; no parabens or other garbage, AND affordable!!</li>
            <li> Ive used it everyday for a week</li>
            <li> I have used for a few days</li>
            <li> I noticed an improvement in my skin after a few days use.</li>
            <li> I always put it on after I showered and dried myself off.  </li>
            <li> I don’t like a heavy smell to beauty products.</li>
            <li> I just got this product a few days ago.</li>
            <li> The few afe spots I had are gone.</li>
            <li> Another ingredient it contains is Witch Hazel along with a few others but this one caught my eye as I have used Witch Hazel as an astringent for my face for about 10 years now</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I noted that there are a few ingredients that are vague, such as the organic herbal infusion and the wildcrafted green tea.  </li>
            <li> how well this serum works but for the past few days I have been using it so I will write a review and update it as time goes on.</li>
            <li> The dropper is a little weird to use because it&#x27;s like I have to tilt my head all the way back</li>
            <li> , I like their products, but the packaging is usually what bothers me</li>
            <li> You can reference these studies online since I am not able to post links here in my review.  </li>
            <li> I used this for the past three weeks and my skin feels smoother already.</li>
            <li> , not sure what,</li>
            <li> The skin on my face becomes very dried out.</li>
            <li> you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> The word acid sounds a little scary</li>
            <li> This one has acid in it which sounds a little scary</li>
            <li> That is a major plus for me because I hate looking like I have grease on my face.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s not so much a secret</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and have seen dramatic improvement in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> The product has a weird smell and when applied doesn&#x27;t feel moisturizing or tightening, it almost feels filmy.</li>
            <li> some questionable ingredients&lt;br</li>
            <li> conclude, it is difficult for me to offer my recommendation of this product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product - Natural, does what they say it will, no negative reactions. Win-win!</li>
            <li> Although I am almost 30 I still have pimples from time to time, but I also need to use a good moisturizer. I think this product is ideal for skin types like mine. In sum: not oily, does not cause even more pimples, but makes feel soft.Obviously I do not know yet if it will slow my aging, but I hope so.</li>
            <li> I received  this item  for an honest  review,  this my review. My preference  is serum and the really like the texture of this serum. It&#x27;s  not watery and absorbs into the skin. Hyalueronic is very beneficial for healthy looking  skin. I highly  recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Time will tell in the end how well this serum works but for the past few days I have been using it so I will write a review and update it as time goes on. Bottle it comes in is good quality, the pump works great and I find a little goes along way .  I personal try to only use organic all natural products.  That being said you can&#x27;t always get the WOW affect as you do with some of the other serums on the market so I look for more of what makes my skin look and feel healthy.  I felt the small was light and not chemical smelling, unlike some other the other reviews, I don&#x27;t use scented products what so ever so anything that has a strong smell really turns me off, this did not.  It is pretty light weight feeling on my face but did take a few min to dry enough to put on my moisturizer.. No issues with putting on makeup  over it, and it has not make me breakout yet so that is good.. :) Like I mentioned before I think it is premature to state any results but so far I like it and will continue to use it I will try and update my findings when my bottle is gone!</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR A FAIR AND HONEST REVIEW. AFTER ONLY 3 DAYS OF USE, I HAVE NOTICE THE FINE LINE IN MY CHIN and mouth is DIMINISHING. CAN WAIT FOR THE FULL 30 DAYS...YEAH!!! I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE FOR A HONEST REVIEW. AFTER 3 WEEKS OF USE...THIS PRODUCT IS WORTH THE MONEY. MY SKIN IS SMOOTH AND BRIGHTER. BEAUTIFUL AND YOUTHFUL.</li>
            <li> Ive used it everyday for a week and i already see and feel a difference. I was worried about effectiveness due to watery consistency. It brightens skins appearance fills minor lines. And this only after one week. Was very pleased and will write another review after a month.  The product was received when promised.</li>
            <li> Great serum- absorbs into my skin instantly.  There is no fragrance at all.  Great under any moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t change the way my makeup goes on at all.  It is also completely natural which makes me happy!  Pump dispenser is easy and doesn&#x27;t leak at all.  you do have to pump product onto your hand and then apply to your face, sometimes I prefer a dropper for serums so I can put product directly onto my face.</li>
            <li> I give 4 instead of 5 stars because the product came in a bubble bag - with no package or instruction or whatever. I have been using Azure for a while, I like their products, but the packaging is usually what bothers me - I always feel they could have put more explanation up on the bottle or the instruction. But this time, really? just a bottle?&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the product itself is not bad - it&#x27;s very smooth and light, does not irritate my skin or cause any discomfort. A bonus of this product is that unlike some serum that cannot be applied too often, this one can be used daily, so it&#x27;s simple for someone like me who does not want a complicated facial care schedule.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!  Easy pump for applying, immediate results!  I would defiantly buy azure naturals products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every day morning and night I can actually see tiny lines. The dropper is a little weird to use because it&#x27;s like I have to tilt my head all the way back so it doesn&#x27;t fall off my face when I&#x27;m trying to apply it but other than that but other than I&#x27;m gonna continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Broke me out nuff said</li>
            <li> I have this item asgift from my husband. And  try this product forcouple weeks.it really fit on my face and really enjoy this product</li>
            <li> I received product as sample fo my review and I am so happy I did. I have used for a few days and I&#x27;m so excited tocontinue to use. Goes on smooth and clear like silk with no greasy or stickyafter feeling ... U must try this product u won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> This product is working wonderfully. I noticed a change in the texture and look of my pores on my face.  I will continue to use this serum. I was given this product free for my unbiased opinion. I will buy this product in the near future.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product. It has a very light weight non greasy feel.  I noticed an improvement in my skin after a few days use.</li>
            <li> This product has been great so far! After just two uses my skin feels and looks great! I usually have issues with dryness and this has made mt skin look super hydrated. I especially love that it was made in the US and has so many great ingredients in one product. From the reviews I am super excited to see the results overtime. So far I am in love.</li>
            <li> I got it in the expected day. Very satisfied</li>
            <li> I received  this product at a steep discount to review; after both me and my hubby uding ut consistently for 3 weeks; I can say I haven&#x27;t noticed ANY change in is it my skin texture or appearance. The product has a weird smell and when applied doesn&#x27;t feel moisturizing or tightening, it almost feels filmy. The packaging and prompt of delivery were great. i still have some product left; so I&#x27;ll continue to use it to see if maybe it might show any improvement in my skin texture. Overall though not thrilled with what I&#x27;ve seen (or lack thereof)</li>
            <li> product looks good and came in a timely manner. I did receive this at reduced rate for honest feedback. Ability to improve appearance is still TBD based on continual use. Will see if this works over time.</li>
            <li> I love this!  I really have seen a difference around my eyes and mouth.  I suggest that you give Azure Naturals products a try if you haven&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> Love hyaluronic acid!!  Definitely adds moisture and actually retains it!!!</li>
            <li> Good for everyone in the 60&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I received this face serum on August 20, 2015, and this product was provided to me at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.  I normally do not use products of this type, but I decided to give this a go due to some unexplained breakouts around my forehead and scalp area.  I noticed a couple of things upon receiving this product.  The first is that my bottle did not come in a box as shown in the pictures.  As a result, it rolled around and the top had all but popped off.  Luckily, I was still able to make the pump work, so I didn’t bother contacting the company for a replacement.  It would just seem to me that if you are a company looking for a review of your product, you include everything it would come with at the retail level, in this case, the outer box.  I also noticed that this product is packaged in a brown glass bottle.  This helps prevent light from spoiling the product prematurely, and the fact that glass was used rather than a cheap plastic that could potentially leach chemicals is a nice touch as well.  Before using the product, I wanted to check out the full ingredients list.  Since I don’t see these posted in the description for the serum, I will post them here for anyone who is interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Organic herbal infusion&lt;br /&gt;Organic aloe&lt;br /&gt;Witch hazel&lt;br /&gt;Botanical hyaluronic acid&lt;br /&gt;Kosher vegetable glycerin&lt;br /&gt;MSM (methylsulfonymethane)&lt;br /&gt;Hydroxyethyl cellulose&lt;br /&gt;Carrageenan gum&lt;br /&gt;Organic jojoba oil&lt;br /&gt;Organic wildcrafted green tea&lt;br /&gt;Geranium essential oil&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C (sodium ascorbyl phosphate)&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E (Tocopheryl acetate)&lt;br /&gt;Sodium benzoate&lt;br /&gt;Potassium sorbate&lt;br /&gt;Ethyl hexyl glycerin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will notice from looking at these ingredients that most of these look beneficial, and indeed they probably are.  I noted that there are a few ingredients that are vague, such as the organic herbal infusion and the wildcrafted green tea.  I also noted some more questionable ingredients as well.  Take for instance the carrageenan gum.  This is a product that is made from red algae and I’m guessing in the context of this serum it may function as one of the thickening agents, with the hydroxyethyl cellulose being the other.  You’ll find carrageenan in a number of products that most of us use every day.  Coffee creamer, toothpaste; these products contain carrageenan.  There have been numerous studies done that may potentially link carrageenan to cancer and intestinal inflammation.  While arguably these studies have various factors associated with them, a simple Google search will yield some surprising results for both sides of the argument.  Personally, I tend to avoid too much carrageenan when possible.  I don’t know what effects long term use might have on the skin, but as someone who has very sensitive skin, it seems to me to be a better precaution to limit my exposure.  You can reference these studies online since I am not able to post links here in my review.  You could also search for additional information if you should have further interest.  I also noted the inclusion of potassium sorbate, which is probably the preservative in this serum.  Potassium sorbate has been known to be a skin irritant.  It’s interesting to me that it is included here in a serum designed for one of the most sensitive areas of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To explore the other side, I also researched hyaluronic acid.  I found that this is a carbohydrate that is already present in our bodies, and has significant healing and restorative capabilities.  It is found in high concentrations naturally, but the ability of the skin to reproduce it lessens as we age.  Therefore it would seem to this author that an addition of hyaluronic acid to our skin would be helpful, and this lends itself to the anti-aging claim of the product.  The hyaluronic acid binds to water, keeping the skin moisturized and helps prevent wrinkles.  There is also some evidence that in low humidity, hyaluronic acid can actually pull water from the skin, thus creating over-dryness.  Since both hyaluronic acid and glycerin are humectants, which draw moisture to themselves, they may end up causing dryness depending on how they are used and how products containing them are formulated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having educated myself on what I was getting into, I began using this serum twice a day and continued to do so for a week.  I didn’t change any other part of my normal routine.  The product itself is a clearish, gel-like consistency.  I used about three pumps each time to get about a dime sized amount and applied it to my face and neck.  The 1 oz. bottle appears to be about a month supply.  I didn&#x27;t notice a strong smell, and it didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling heavy like lotion would.  I always put it on after I showered and dried myself off.  After about six days, I noticed that my face was remarkably dry.  To my discontent, the irritation that was present was not clearing up either.  By the seventh day, my face was extremely dry, to the point that my skin was flaking and my brow area actually hurt from the dryness.  I decided at that point to discontinue use of this product as clearly it was causing some adverse effects for me.  As I mentioned before, I have sensitive skin, so it is hard for me to say what ingredient(s) caused the dryness.  After I stopped using the product, I became curious as to how effective serums and toners really are, so I did some additional research.  Through this research, I learned that many of the products that we use on our faces are really quite unnecessary, and in most cases actually cause sebum production to be grossly thrown off scale.  The issues that we think we have are really just a constant use of products to try and correct skin that we believe to be overly-oily and irritated.  The reality here is that once we stop using so many cleansers and washes and toners, our skin tends to regulate itself and many times will clear up and look and feel very healthy.  I have since decided to start a 30 day challenge to not use any products on my face and cleanse with water only, because I want to see this theory in action and see how my skin is affected.  I will return to this review at the end of September to update my findings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Glass pump bottle&lt;br /&gt;-Contains hyaluronic acid (this could also be considered a con as well, depending on how it is used)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Causes dryness on sensitive skin (the hyaluronic acid?)&lt;br /&gt;-Contains some questionable ingredients&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s possible product may ship without its outer box&lt;br /&gt;-Pump easily damaged&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To conclude, it is difficult for me to offer my recommendation of this product.  While it does contain what appear to be some beneficial ingredients, it also contains some ingredients that I am choosing not to use on my skin.  I question whether or not the hyaluronic acid is really a &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; active ingredient.  I also question the percentage of hyaluronic acid contained in the product, and whether or not it is at a safe level.  I&#x27;d like to see some further research direct from the company to support their claims, and I&#x27;d like to see the removal of the carrageenan and the potassium sorbate.  This product also caused, for me, the above mentioned excessive dryness, but many users seem to have found it to be favorable.  Since we all have different skin types, my overall recommendation is to simply perform some research before you decide to buy this product, or any other products for that matter.  Take the time to understand the things you are choosing to put on your skin and make an educated decision about what is right for you.  Don’t listen to the reviews that are one liners telling you that this product is great, and don’t listen to the ones making outrageous claims.  Just simply decide for yourself.  Use the list of ingredients above and take an hour to research.  Check out the wealth of information that is available online, and take a few minutes to read about the potential benefits of not using any products at all.  I am rating this product at 1/5 stars based on my personal usage and evaluation, and officially recommend that you, as a consumer, research what you intend to buy before clicking the add to cart button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT / UPDATE 10/7/2015:  I am happy to report that after my 30 day challenge to use no products on my face, my skin has never been happier.  I have seen a significant reduction in irritation, and I can also report that my skin has regulated and no longer produces excess oil.  I have begun to use Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Facial Cleanser w/ Cotton Extract about once a week now, just to wash away any of the excess gunk that might be in my pores from going to the gym during the week, and this has become my go to routine.  I highly recommend trying a period of zero products to see how your skin may improve!healthy.

            <li> This product  is  a  very effective  Hylauronic Acid Serum! My skin looks and feels more supple after using this serum! It is a very lightweight  formula, and absorbs into the skin quickly without leaving any unpleasant scent. I have noticed my moisturizer is even absorbing better with the addition of this product to my skin care routine. I definitely  recommend this product based on my own results! It is a simple and effective addition to your skincare! A definite must for age prevention or reversing, I love that it pumps up and smoothes the skin. I like the addition of the vitamins to the serum as well, which really do help to make your complexion brighter and more even. I love the radiance that it has restored to my own complexion!</li>
            <li> Gave this to my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day and she uses it pretty consistently. She said that its a little more &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; than she likes because she typically uses a cream, but she does like it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a few days now an it has made my face feel smooth an clean. I how it comes in a spray bottle. It is easy to use an apply. It&#x27;s very light weight an has a very light smell to it which is not a bad smell at all. My skin looks an feels great after using this serum.</li>
            <li> This product works good in conjunction with the cucumber infused ultimate peptide eye gel.</li>
            <li> The Product came a day sooner then quoted which was nice, I have been using it for a week now and I feel like the lines in myard forehead are already softening. It Is Colorless And Odorless Which Is A Huge PLUS And iI I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I am still reviewing this product. But with 30 days of regular use, I have found that this product has produce the following results:&lt;br /&gt;-Healing the dryness on my face and neck with immediate intense hydration&lt;br /&gt;-Noticeable reduction of fine lines and wrinkles (especially on my forehead)&lt;br /&gt;-noticeable brighter complexion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still under review:&lt;br /&gt;-Lighten dark under eye circles&lt;br /&gt;-Under eye puffiness treatment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll, get back to you with a 3 month review.</li>
            <li> This is a good beauty product. The majority of the ingredients in the formula are organic. I like the fact that they used multiple ingredients. Some of the cheaper products on the market only use one. I used this for the past three weeks and my skin feels smoother already. I&#x27;m sure if I use it longer, I will see even better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> Great product,, really makes a difference.. highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received it as a gift but will purchase when I have used it all.  I use it with the other Azure facial products and I find the products work well when used together.  It glides on smoothly and my face feels soft and wrinkle free.  I followed up with the vitamin C and the cucumber eye treatment.  They&#x27;re awesome!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Azure Naturals Ultimate Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a few weeks now and the biggest difference and the biggest improvement I have noticed is, my face  feels a lot more moisturized and has a more radiant, youthful look to it. It&#x27;s also so soft! I really liked that this serum has a little thicker consistency to it, but it still absorbed very well and quickly into my skin without leaving any kind of residue. I understand results may vary with each person, but I personally had a really great experience with the Azure Naturals Ultimate Hyaluronic Acid Serum and would recommend this product to anyone to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post. The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I was aware of the benefits of hyaluronic acid for years, but never used it personally. I had an opportunity to review this item at no cost to me so I figured, why not? I have had redness on the sides of my face and extremely dry skin around my nose for years. A stark change to my oily high school years. I was originally going to wait a few weeks to review this, thinking it would take time to see benefits (if any), but after just a couple days I can already feel my skin is more moisturized, and not just like some off-the-shelf moisturizing cream full of chemicals does. By squinting I am able to feel the normally dry skin above my cheeks feels loose and smooth - hard to explain but it just feels the way skin should feel. If you deal with the same redness/dryness on your face you know what I mean. The redness is even a little less after a couple days but I expect that to improve as well, once the underlying inflammation is taken care of by the hyaluronic acid/MSM and other beneficial ingredients in this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only &#x27;negative&#x27; is a slightly different odor than you&#x27;d expect from one of the off the shelf brands of moisturizers, but that&#x27;s because this isn&#x27;t pumped full of artificial fragrance. The smell goes away once applied and being so close to my nose, I can&#x27;t smell it after the first 30 seconds after application, so no stars off. The ingredients are pure in this and I don&#x27;t have to wonder what I&#x27;m putting on my body. I don&#x27;t expect this to be a cure for dry skin; nothing is. But I&#x27;m definitely going to buy a refill when I need it! (expecting this to last 60 applications for spot treatment on my face).</li>
            <li> There seem to be a lot of companies coming out with face serums right now. About six months ago I never heard of them and now I’ve already reviewed about four different ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is a little different since is contains an acid. The word acid sounds a little scary but it’s actually good for you. Hyaluronic Acid can hold up to 1000 times its weight in water and draws moisture out of the environment onto the surface of your skin. The acid serum penetrates your skin deeply, activating collagen production for a fresher, younger, firmer, and brighter complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this one for about ten days, twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really seems to plump the skin up. I think it is made to so this to hide fine lines. I’m not sure I like that idea because the second you stop using the product the lines would come right back. It does not have much of a smell at all, which I liked. I don’t like a heavy smell to beauty products. It comes in a pump rather than a dropper, the pump is much easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin does feel a little softer although I haven’t noticed a huge change. It may need more time to see real improvements.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week, just this product nothing else in addition, just so I could give a fair assessment and this serum is AMAZING. I have very sensitive eyes, they water after I put most products close to them and this one did not. It hydrates your skin, Doesn&#x27;t get sticky like some serums like when you put a foundation on the serum kinda balls up on your face, this totally just soaks in and makes your face feel great. After one week I don&#x27;t know if my face looks brighter but my friend did say my skin looks good and she didn&#x27;t even know I was trying a new product. I got this wonderful erful serum courtesy of I Love to Review and Azure Naturals for my unbiased opinion and I&#x27;d never say a product was good if it truly wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I use Azure&#x27;s Vitamin C serum on my face and have excellent results. My skin is smoother and always looks refreshed using 2x a day. I ordered the Hyaluronic acid moisturizer and although I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles it absorbs well , no odor and not oily. My skin feels brand new. I love Azure products because they are an honest and reliable company with quality products &#x3D;) Very content with my order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently discovered Azure Naturals and love everything about their line so it was only natural that this would be my latest addition to my skin care regimen.  This Hyaluronic Acid moisturizer contains 98% natural and 72% organic ingredients contains no alcohol, no parabens, plant based, no gmo&#x27;s and most importantly cruelty free and never tested on animals.  They recommend using this in conjunction with Azure Naturals Ultimate Vitamin C which is what I have been doing and the results have been pretty amazing.  Since I started using this I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is firmer, fine lines and wrinkles have diminished and my skin is deeply hydrated and moisturized.  All it takes is a few drops to achieve the same results so this bottle will go a long way and I would definitely recommend purchasing this along with the Ultimate Vitamin C for the maximum benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price or the item was supplied to me at no cost in order to evaluate and share my experience.  All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion.  One may or may not have the same results as myself when using this product.</li>
            <li> The Ultimate Hyaluronic Acid Serum is plant based and made right here in the United States, so that is even further incentive to use this product. I have been trying over the last year or so to get away from all chemical based skincare products and go more natural or organic and it being made here is like icing on the cake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid can hold up to 1000 times its weight in water and draws moisture out of the environment onto the surface of your skin, which makes it a more effective moisturizing product. The Ultimate Hyaluronic Acid Serum penetrates your skin deeply, activating collagen production for a fresher, younger, firmer, and brighter complexion. You will love how your face feels and looks once you have used it for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pretty clear serum that absorbs rather quickly without making your face feel or look like it&#x27;s greasy or shiny. That is a major plus for me because I hate looking like I have grease on my face. The scent is a light almost herbal/flower like fragrance so it definitely does not smell like chemicals. This serum will not clog your pores if you have had that problem in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any skincare products, I always tell my friends that it took time to get those fine lines and wrinkles, so your skincare products will work the more you use them and this one is no different. You can apply the Ultimate Hyaluronic Acid Serum twice daily, once in the morning and again at night. Some of you might notice changes in about 2 weeks, but it can take up to 6 or 8 weeks to really see the difference and by the 6 month period, you will see the maximum benefits. Remember, I said it took time to get those fine lines and wrinkles, so be patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum spreads really good, so you don&#x27;t really need much to start with. If you are unsure how much you will need, start very small and add as needed until you get more comfortable with how much to use. I would hate for you to waste any of this product. Allow to dry. Can be used daily and under make up. Follow with a moisturizer. Azure Naturals does recommend that it will work even better if used in conjunction with their Vitamin C Serum.low to dry. Can be used daily and under make up. Follow with a moisturizer. Azure Naturals does recommend that it will work even better if used in conjunction with their Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> I use it at night, so that I can look beautiful and young in the morning. It is not sticky at all, smell nice and absorbed well on the skin. It moisturized and hydrates well, although I use a moisturizer after applying the serum. It&#x27;s affordable and you can easily buy it from amazon. The packaging is also cute.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for Hyaluronic serum, you can give this a try. I am sure you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few Hyaluronic Acid serums over the past year but this one was a real treat. It really does absorb moisture and leaves my face so smooth. Living in Arizona can leave your face wrinkled and dry and this helps defeat the sun!</li>
            <li> This serum contains Hyaluronic acid, vitamin C and E. I just have to keep using it to see more results, but so far, I like it. It&#x27;s moisturize and plump my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the feeling on my skin.  Helped clear up my skin problems and keeps my skin nice looking under my foundation.</li>
            <li> Nice product,will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Amazing. I use it daily and I look so good. My face did look tiered but this perks it up even when I am feeling sleepy:)</li>
            <li> Really Good Anti Age Serum. I love that it is easy to use. Leaves me face feeling nice &amp; smooth. I use it every night!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I will order again</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it so she can stays young</li>
            <li> I just got this product a few days ago. I started using it right away and I have to say it does something, not sure what, but I do look younger. I&#x27;m not sure if this will last or only initially when you start using it, time will tell. I did post some questions on this product and company never responded. I ended up figuring most of the answers on my own, except for whether or not you can use around the eyes. Perhaps I&#x27;ll get an answer now that I posted a review. I also purchased the retinal serum and received it yesterday, not sure yet if that works as good, will need a few days to tell. Overall, seems like a good product, price is reasonable for the small 1 oz. quantity, so as long as they keep the price, I will continue to order.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to find a good product at a fair price! This improved my skin tone and large pores. I sometimes use one drop of Azure Organic Rosehips Oil with two drops of this for extra moisture.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic serum is such an important part to a healthy skin regimen for hydration. I love this one as I love Azure Naturals Vit C serum. I use the C first (on cleansed skin) and the Hyaluronic right after followed by a moisturizer. (Can&#x27;t wait for A.N.) to come out with one because I know it will be amazing.  As always, all the right &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; ingredients and customer service is top notch! Please Azure, more products! I would love to see them come out with an Emu Oil line.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, not greasy and no unpleasant smell.  At $17.95, it seems to be a fair price.</li>
            <li> My skin was so happy to have this product. It helps me stay look young and beautiful. I received it complimentary for testing purposes but I will need more.</li>
            <li> Excellent Seller, perfect item!</li>
            <li> I received this for testing and review purposes from the manufacturer.  If I&#x27;d had the chance to look at the ingredients first, I&#x27;d have declined the sample.  Like so many hyaluronic acid formulas out there, this one contains witch hazel.  Yes, witch hazel has some astringent properties, but it&#x27;s also a known skin irritant that can cause contact dermatitis.  I know it does for me.  I might be able to get away with using this to fight signs of aging on the more tolerant skin on the backs of my hands, but it won&#x27;t be going anywhere near my face.  Too bad, too... but for the witch hazel, this looks like a pretty good formula.</li>
            <li> I use this product with the Revitol  as seen on Dr. Oz. it really smooths  out fine lines and wrinkles. The few afe spots I had are gone. Complexion is glowing. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works as says it will</li>
            <li> I have no idea why they show two bottles?  Only one comes with the order!  I found this product to be equal, certainly no better than others that are much more cost effective!</li>
            <li> Very impressive product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> This came in a perfect sized, small blue box with white lettering. It is a 1 oz (30ml) bottle with a convenient and easy to use pump style top. This product is made in the USA. It contains Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C, Vitamin E and Organic Aloe. It DOES NOT contain: Alcohol, Parabens, Sulfates or GMO&#x27;s. I love that this product is certified organic. It did not make me break out as some tend to. This product is not tested on animals. Another ingredient it contains is Witch Hazel along with a few others but this one caught my eye as I have used Witch Hazel as an astringent for my face for about 10 years now and I swear by it. I first wash wash my face and then pat dry , use the Witch hazel as my toner and then apply this all over my face except eyes. I let it dry and put my make up on. Does not make your face look dry. I received this product for free or a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I wish I had a HUGE bottle of it :) I use it every morning &amp; evening (yes, I really like it) :) &amp; it&#x27;s super soft &amp; dries very quick, so I can put my moisturizer or any other skin care products I use over it. That is nice! Has a ton of great ingredients too. I will purchase more for sure.</li>
            <li> I do really like this product because I use it daily and it makes my face skin more moisture especially in fall and winter time. I love it</li>
            <li> I love this product. It goes on lightweight and you can wet it under moisturizer. It has helped to plump my skin and Lao with my dark circles, definitely a product I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!! I love it. I have very sensitive skin on my face, and every time I shaved it left it really red and irritated. I hated it. Since I started using hyaluronic serum right after I shave, the irritation has completely stopped. I&#x27;ve have tried countless after-shaves over the years and nothing has ever worked. I am so happy I&#x27;m crazy... maybe crazy isn&#x27;t the right word but I AM SO HAPPY, THIS IS AWESOME!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a middle-aged male, and have a strict routine. I use this before putting anything else on. I use this, then moisturizer and then any foundation or BB cream. You use this first and it sucks the moisturizer in to  your skin. I&#x27;m rapidly approaching 50, but my skin still looks like I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with dry spots on my face and this really seems to help keep them under control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried Hyaluronic serum before from other companies. I’m always curious to find out how other products perform, especially with facial products. I have been blessed with generally good skin. However, as I spend more time outside in the summer at swim meets I&#x27;ve noticed the sun starting to take its toll on my skin. Azure Naturals sent me a bottle to try and offer my honest opinion. I&#x27;m totally hooked now! I love the pump so I get just the right amount. It is nice and cool going on. I put in on right after I get out of the shower while my skin is still moist. I also use it at night to help hydrate my skin overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed a difference and others have too. As the end of summer comes to a close, my friends are asking how I managed not to get so parched being out for hours at the swim meets. This is my secret! Well, it&#x27;s not so much a secret any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on the tops of my hands at night. Along with a nice moisturizer and gloves, I put it on while watching TV and relaxing in the evening. I&#x27;ve seen a big different in my hands. They&#x27;re more supple and bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was only using it on my face, but after a week I started putting it on my neck and chest as well since those are areas that are often overlooked and can show signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product and know that seeing results after 2 weeks is just the beginning. It can take 4-6 weeks to see improvement and up to 6 months to experience the full benefit of a daily routine with Hyaluronic. Give it time. Your patience will be rewarded.</li>
            <li> Just tried this tonight! It feels very refreshing! I like it so far! I&#x27;ll be checking back in with the review in a few weeks with a updated review</li>
            <li> Love this product! Works as advertised and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I try as many anti-aging products that I can get my hands on i believe you should take care of your body as much as ypu can and if there&#x27;s a product to help your then why not try it. When I saw this serum with all it&#x27;s ingredients I couldnt wait to try it. I was so happy totry this one. You only need a couple drops and it glides on the skin and absorbs right away. It doesnt have an awful smell. I also use it all around my eyes as well. It give you a bit of a tight feeling. I moisturize in the morning and night and that&#x27;s all I need when i get ready in the mornings and go to bed at night. Their customer service is amazing as well.  I&#x27;m so happy I found this product that o am able to use.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li> I did not know if I really needed this but it works so well. I got the c serum a month or so ago and the retinol a serum but when I saw the skin doctor for a other reason I asked he if I needed it she said no I have no scares or a lot of sun damage . So I bought this one . I use it at night and the c serum in morning after a month my skin feels and looks better. I know it will take 3 to 4 months to get the best results but so far it&#x27;s really nice. My skin just looks better and I am 51. What I do is at night I use the hyaluronic at night and use argan oil on top . In am I use the c serum and a spf on top olay has a good one. I also use this on my none k , chest, back of hands on both serums. Love this it works can&#x27;t wait to see how could my skin will look in 3 months. A good way for the c serum is to keep in the fridge and only a oz. At a time it goes bad at three months but keeping in the fridge it last a little longer. A good argan oil to buy is l.t . organics here on amazon great for skin , hair, eye cream it does not burn . It even works for oily skin and cuts down on breakouts.</li>
            <li> I was SO happy to find a product for nighttime that met all of my needs: safe for acne-prone but mid-30s skin (so showing some signs of age); *cruelty free*; no parabens or other garbage, AND affordable!! I&#x27;ve definitely seen an improvement in my skin since using this product. I use it every other night, and use this brand&#x27;s 2.5% Retinol anti-wrinkle serum on off nights. My skin looks less tired, and as other reviewers have said, more &amp;#34;radiant&amp;#34;. It also hasn&#x27;t made me break out when many products do, and I don&#x27;t find it too drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the pump, which squirts out too much. However, I love Azure Naturals&#x27; products and will be buying them again and again!</li>
            <li> Still liking this Moisturizer. Use it several times a week</li>
            <li> I use all three of the hyaluronic acid line. My skin looks amazing and has a great even tone. I am. 39yo male however everyone thinks I am around 29-30. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product looking for an organic alternative and was disappointed. I am 59 years old but with very good skin. I  didn&#x27;t  feel this product provided the moisture I needed and left me wanting more. If you&#x27;re looking for an organic product, look at juice beauty. A quality product at a comparable price. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I got a high discount code for it. It makes my skin clear and smooth. I like the smell.</li>
            <li> I received the product in good condition. I used the product and liked the results. I have recommended this product to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I turn 32 in a few months, and I&#x27;ve always had a very &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; look. So when I got this product I was still wondering why I needed it. Then I used it! Holy smokes batman, this stuff is amazing. I use to have seasons of oily skin and then dry skin, however using this product for the last 3 weeks has allowed me to have a consistent clear and shall I say radiant skin! I really could not be more happy with it. I have already personally recommended this to 4 people (all of which made comments about my skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As youthful 31 year old, I am an old soul and excited to look this age for nearly ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Azure Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Serum for about a week but I have noticed a big difference in my skin already.  I live in the desert, so my skin has been exposed to lots of dry air and wind. The skin on my face was becoming dry, and flaky.  Even using moisturizer hasn&#x27;t helped.  After only TWO uses my skin looked more hydrated and was noticeable less flaky.  Dry skin shows age faster so I am hoping that this serum helps keep me looking young.  I use it every morning and my face stays soft and smooth all day.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free of charge in return for my honest review. My opinions are my own and have not been influenced in any way. I was not paid to write this review.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I apply after washing my face and before I put my concealer on. It does a great job on moisterizing faces. My face looks a lot healthier since I&#x27;ve been using it. Definately is a product everyone should try !</li>
            <li> Love the way this makes my face feel. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried using this product for two weeks, to get the same results every time.  It burns my skin and made little blisters. So I assume I might be allergic to the chemicals or something in this product. I enjoyed trying this Azure Naturals product for my review. Thank you for the great opportunity :) :) Nikki Durst.</li>
            <li> On my second bottle.  I have not seen any diminishing of wrinkles, but my skin does seem softer and smoother when I wake up in the morning after having applied it the night before.  I have mature skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Makes my skin feel so soft and it glows. My skin was. Very full and dry. I am so glad I was able to get this product at a reduced price to try it out. I use it twice a day and have seen dramatic improvement in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> After using the product for about a week I broke out in a rash so I had to quit using it. I have pretty sensitive skin so I am chalking it up to that. I was really hoping to continue using the product.</li>
            <li> I received the product it was in a box and in bubble wrap. I love when my things come in bubble wrap so I know they are protected. I started using AzureNaturals for almost a month now, I really use it on my forehead from all the funny faces I make as a mother. I really like what it has done to my skin. I live in Florida and it&#x27;s the hottest part of the year here summer time. The skin on my face becomes very dried out. Since I&#x27;ve been using AzureNaturals my face hasn&#x27;t been dry at all. My face looks a lot younger, fresher, softer and firmer also. It really seems to plump the skin up. I think it&#x27;s made to so it hides fine lines. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell which some people like, I wish it had some kind of smell to it. It comes in a pump rather than a dropper, pump is a lot easier to use. I love that I can use this product under my moisturizer and makeup with no problems whatsoever. It&#x27;s as though it&#x27;s not even there. I also love that you only need a small amount. One bottle will last a very long time! You really get your money&#x27;s worth in value and benefits to your skin. This one has acid in it which sounds a little scary but it&#x27;s actually good for you. Hyaluronic Acid can hold up to 1000 times its weight in water and draws moisture out of the environment onto the surface of the skin. The acid serum penetrates your skin deeply, activating collagen production for a fresher, younger, firmer, and brighter complexion.</li>
            <li> I loved this product!  It really helped to rehydrate and smooth my skin.  Ive had a lot of skin damage to my skin and after using this, my skin looks and feels great!  Read my full review at TheBeeHiveBuzz dot com!</li>
            <li> The Azure Naturals Hyuralonic Acid Serum&lt;br /&gt;pumps out clear and smoothly covers your like the feeling of water. It doesn&#x27;t cause your face to feel tight or oily. I habe been using it for three days  and I can tell a difference in my skin. My face look smoother and tighter like the fine lines have been filled in. This is a great serum because it does work just as it says. I was happy to be offered this product as a free sample for sharing my honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> i received this product in exchange of my honest  review. this works amazing. my skin has never looked or felt better. its not greasy and gross like other products I&#x27;ve tried.I use this morning and night after cleansing. It absorbs into the skin quickly and lasts all day</li>
            <li> I have heard about how hyaluronic acid is great at activating collagen production allowing for fresher, firmer and more radiant skin in the past but now I have seen it in action and it made a believer out of me! All of my friends and acquaintances all want to know my skin care secret! LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> This product feels great on my skin.  I have only used it for a few days now, and am looking forward to seeing as well as feeling a difference soon.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I really enjoyed this product. It has become a part of my daily morning routine and has more than once saved me from the effects of sunburn. (I get a little red on my face after running and just a little bit of this on my face helps it go away in one day). Unlike some products, after you put this serum on it doesn&#x27;t add a heaviness to your face. It is pretty light weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of a dropper like many serums have, this serum comes with a nifty pump! Also, unlike the vitamin C serums, the hyaluronic acid serum is more of a gel consistency than liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way. You only need a few squirts to have full face/neck coverage. It leaves your skin feeling soft and refreshed. As for smell, you need not worry. It is just a light citrusy scent. :)</li>
            <li> Me and my sister have been using this for several months now and i do see results not has much as i would like but you should&#x27;nt expect miracles at 62 years old lol</li>
            <li> Tried ordering multiple times and it wouldn&#x27;t allow me.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product twice and both times the bottle is broken! I&#x27;m sick about this!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any real results after using the entire bottle.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is not like other moisturizer. Mainly because it is in liquid form. A lot of us think moisturizer has to be in a cream form. This one works a lot better then those you see in stores by like olay an neutrogene. It has a better way of healing your skin and making it feel more nourished. My thoughts: I did receive this product for free! It is my own words 100 percent!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any improvements and made my face break out</li>
