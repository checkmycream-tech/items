    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>These are the best- working make-up removing wipes that I have found.</li>
            <li>One swipe takes off, even waterproof mascara, and they smell very pleasant as well.</li>
            <li>and they do a good job getting off waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice</li>
            <li>but it did OK for blush , eye-shadow and foundation.</li>
            <li>but I use it mostly for while I&#x27;m at work.  </li>
            <li>I love these things.</li>
            <li>So glad that I found it online.</li>
            <li>A bit more moist and clean make-up better</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I use these while on vacation- will pack in my bag while in flight- easy to just wipe off any makeup or just to refreshen while on the plane.  </li>
            <li>Very fresh and clean feeling!</li>
            <li>I like the original Garnier wipes better 9 bright green packaging).</li>
            <li>Great product, makeup came right off and not leaving my face feeling dry like</li>
            <li>It works perfectly on those lazy times after work when I just need to get my makeup off fast before bed.</li>
            <li>so being able to wash up quickly goes a long way.</li>
            <li>These work pretty well.</li>
            <li>So overall I was satisfied</li>
            <li>And it takes most of the oil away, will repurchase when the coupon comes back!</li>
            <li>These are very nice clothes, I only deducted 1 star from my review because I thought they were a bit dry.</li>
            <li>Takes off all of your makeup and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or leave it sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for over a month now and still love it.  </li>
            <li>These work very well for just whipping your face off.</li>
            <li>my face feels real oily.</li>
            <li>and I really like that you can lose them back up on top without having them dry out on you.</li>
            <li>just think they could be a little more moist.</li>
            <li>I have always been a fan of this product, just can never seem to find it in any stores near where I live!</li>
            <li>I would just add a little water too them and then they would work fine.</li>
            <li>Not fabulous just fine</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on the skin,however,I guess that is why it is harder to cleanse your make up off</li>
            <li>irritate my skin, my face became all red and some unknown acene like stuff pop up whole face..</li>

    <ol>
            <li> irritate my skin, my face became all red and some unknown acene like stuff pop up whole face.. I throw it away! even do not bother to use it wipe floor.</li>
            <li> Use them all the time, its a fast,effective way to remove make-up,</li>
            <li> I like the original Garnier wipes better 9 bright green packaging). Have been using them for years.  A bit more moist and clean make-up better</li>
            <li> I had a bit of a hard time getting my mascara off but it did OK for blush , eye-shadow and foundation.</li>
            <li> Not sure that these would remove makeup and I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily say they are &#x27;soothing&#x27;, but I use them after the gym and they do the trick w/ minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> These work pretty well. A little drying but my sensitive skin handles them well and they do a good job getting off waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle on the skin,however,I guess that is why it is harder to cleanse your make up off</li>
            <li> Takes off all of your makeup and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or leave it sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for over a month now and still love it.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Very fresh and clean feeling!</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin. But does not remove waterproof mascara!</li>
            <li> I use these while on vacation- will pack in my bag while in flight- easy to just wipe off any makeup or just to refreshen while on the plane.  I think they have no fragrance and don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> These are very nice clothes, I only deducted 1 star from my review because I thought they were a bit dry. I would just add a little water too them and then they would work fine. They didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or make me break out any. I also didn&#x27;t have to sit there and scrub to get my eye makeup off. So overall I was satisfied just think they could be a little more moist.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irate my eyes  or skin</li>
            <li> Not helping with the occasional breakouts but I use it mostly for while I&#x27;m at work.  I don&#x27;t always have access to a sink and soap.  I work with animals so being able to wash up quickly goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not fabulous just fine</li>
            <li> These removed all my make up and dont break my face out like other products. I love these things.</li>
