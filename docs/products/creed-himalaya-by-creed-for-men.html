            <li>Excellent price.</li>
            <li>The shipping was excellent, got it in 2 days.</li>
            <li>but i think this not the best .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this purchase and the substantial money I saved.</li>
            <li>this is the best price you can find!</li>
            <li>Creed are the best fragrances in the market.</li>
            <li>Great Item!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with both and will buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li>I was under the impression that the perfume would be great.</li>
            <li>Amazon has a great price on this cologne...</li>
            <li>It explains the great price.</li>
            <li>the description that settled the question for me is \\&quot;you smell like the Great Gatsby.\\</li>
            <li>Great cologne and</li>
            <li>The bottle is a reflection or representation of the fragrance – refreshing..!!</li>
            <li>Love the stuff!!</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I was concerned that this product will not be original because it has a very good price compared to retail price, but it is and is very good.</li>
            <li>This is the kind of perfume that women love to smell when are just having a perfect moment with their mens.</li>
            <li>The product is good  </li>
            <li>I CHOSE THIS BRAND BECAUSE OF THE GOOD RATING IT GOT OVER THE YEARS</li>
            <li>AND SOME GOOD REVIEWS OF SOME OF MY FRIENDS.</li>
            <li>Scent is good for me at the office as its not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>glad I found it here!</li>
            <li>, I feel like I am on top of the world!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Creed honestly is amazing - nothing is synthetic in it and the scent lasts for literally a week off of one spray.  </li>
            <li>Great buy and we&#x27;l worth the price!  </li>
            <li>With this one, I have to spray four or more times to get any kind of effect that lasts longer than four hours.</li>
            <li>I was happy to get an authentic bottle of Creed at a great price sold to me directly from Amazon LLC.</li>
            <li>It was so strong!</li>
            <li>+ hours on me, longer on clothing, at greater than arm</li>
            <li>While some say the price is exorbitant, but given the pleasure and confidence that Himalaya will add to your life, the bottle is worth every penny spent… Enjoy your day and happy fragrance hunting…</li>
            <li>and I feel much better now.</li>
            <li>Himalaya is in my top 5 favorite colognes now.</li>
            <li>Will buy this again for sure ...</li>
            <li>Creed Himalaya is one of my favorite men&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li>Its name Himalaya definitely is the best word because everytime I smell this cologne</li>
            <li>I had read many reviews on this product before I purchased it and all were positive.&lt;br /&gt;After trying the cologne, however, I was severly dissapointed.</li>
            <li>I thought that would be the safe way to go.</li>
            <li>This is one I will surely replace when it runs out.</li>
            <li>Outstanding.</li>
            <li>Creed is my favorite brand for men&#x27;s perfume .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years and love it since to me</li>
            <li>The quality is outstanding, as you&#x27;d expect from Creed, and the scent lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just excellent scent but still so very, very light and doesn&#x27;t stay with me that long.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff with the rich smoky and woody scents in it.  </li>
            <li>Until I got the Himalaya, my favorite Creed was the Original Vetiver.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t describe the scent since it&#x27;ll be subjective, but I will say that if you like the Original Vetiver, you&#x27;ll love Himalaya.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just wish it was strong and long-lasting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I googled it &amp; saw the price I said ok this is one you buy for someone special...</li>
            <li>I envision a Sunday drive in a convertible when winter is finally lifting, the air is still crisp, and the drive along the Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) is breathtaking – ocean on one side and the mountains in the horizon</li>
            <li>All this means is that they are selling overstock product and discounting it which is fine.</li>
            <li>Overall great experience with the seller.</li>
            <li>and I relied on my brother&#x27;s account of the smell to ensure that I had received a genuine bottle (I haven&#x27;t bought it from Amazon, but</li>
            <li>It has a citrus opening that soon goes away and develops into a woodsy smell that is very fresh and outdoorsy.</li>
            <li>I have been to the creed boutique, this smells nothing like the original.</li>
            <li>The smile Moved very quickly idon&#x27;</li>
            <li>I bought same one from saks fifth which has a good and original ......do not buy from amazon...</li>
            <li>The sweet scent lasts 24 hours, so it is long-lasting.</li>
            <li>As I said before both fragrances have some of the same notes (which is a good thing).</li>
            <li>The scent itself is a bit &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; to me, which is not bad.</li>
            <li>and then it&#x27;ll dissipate quickly into nothing.</li>
            <li>Smells ok but doesn&#x27;t last more than the room.</li>
            <li>But it is slightly more than normal perfume.</li>
            <li>SWEET AND FRESH , FOR DAY OR NIGHT.</li>
            <li>An unusual scent without the sweetness or muskiness of cheap colognes.  </li>
            <li>it might not be worth the price it has.</li>
            <li>This is my last purchase of this kind of products in amazon.</li>
            <li>The fresh sandalwood mid note is the heart of the scent, with light musk and a demure cedar as bases and bergamot and citrus top notes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Original review: Amazon is trusted, right?</li>
            <li>Himalaya may be Creed’s most underrated fragrance and similar to some of its siblings, worthy of masterpiece status.</li>
            <li>particular vendor was prompt in shipping and the bottle is original.</li>
            <li>The main difference is Himalaya gives a vibe that is woodsy fresh rather than the garden fresh grassy vibe of GIT.</li>
            <li>You can find the notes of Himalaya easily enough, but the way they come together is almost magical.</li>
            <li>Sadly, it is not a long-lasting scent, if I wear it to work</li>
            <li>my 2nd favorite is issey miyake</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>like it very unique  smell very different</li>
            <li>I actually like the Tweed a little better; it has an earthiness that is very appealing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong at first but a total turn on once it dries!</li>
            <li>Nice clean scent and very long lasting.</li>
            <li>Overall though, after some use and research to understand how the product is presented (no clear wrapping), this is a very unique scent, lasts long, and recipient loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have received a fake cheap perfume, the aluminum painted bottle with a bright metallic cap is so far away of the original flask.</li>
            <li>I really like how this cologne smells.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s real, maybe not.</li>
            <li>Himalaya is a scent I really like.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>their price is in line with what I&#x27;ve seen from retailers offering the real thing,)</li>
            <li>I mean, it&#x27;ll be good for a couple of hours</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful union of citrus, musk, and sandalwood notes that has quickly become one of my “go to” fragrances and currently ranking #3 behind Original Vetiver (#2) and my favorite, Green Irish Tweed (there is no substitute..!!) of my Creed fragrances.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely older product</li>
            <li>Simply put, it&#x27;s a classy, light, summery fragrance with a spicy feel to it.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations on this perfume.</li>
            <li>I still wish the box was wrapped with more care for shipping, as it arrived a little beat up and this was a gift.</li>
            <li>The bottle itself was untouched, as I had to prime it to get it to spray (i.e., it was new and not a return).</li>
            <li>It was a gift and the presentation was seriously lacking for this kind of item.</li>
            <li>It has a very masculine smell with a hint of sweetness.</li>
            <li>The new sprayers are far stronger than the old ones.</li>
            <li>just find that the package is a bit classy but  not durable</li>
            <li>I also want to point out that the bottle I was sent had the old Creed sprayer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nearly gone by lunch and all but a memory by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>This is by far the sexiest scent on a man...</li>
            <li>This is soft yet masculine.</li>
            <li>It smell&#x27;s like a sexy version of Green Irish Tweed.</li>
            <li>Himalaya definitely gives that same fresh outdoorsy vibe which you also get from GIT.</li>
            <li>fragrance has turned out to be one of my favourites precisely because it is not strong and does not offend.</li>
            <li>The juice is definitely Creed and it smells exactly the same as the juice you&#x27;d buy in the mall at a department store.</li>
            <li>That alone is a huge let down and honestly, a red flag.</li>
            <li>I have owned many products from Creed such as &amp;#34;Silver mountain water&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Royal Oud&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Green Irish Tweed&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Adventius&amp;#34; also &amp;#34;Virgin island water&amp;#34; and maybe a few others.</li>
            <li>think Himalaya is a bit stronger but certainly not too much.</li>
            <li>&quot; and more than a few have let a hug last a little longer than necessary or come back in for a second whiff of this masterpiece of a fragrance.</li>
            <li>Overall it still very, very nice scent for casual wear; I look forward to trying Creed Green Irish Tweed or Creed Silver Mountain Water instead.</li>

            <li> &quot; and more than a few have let a hug last a little longer than necessary or come back in for a second whiff of this masterpiece of a fragrance.</li>
            <li> Overall it still very, very nice scent for casual wear; I look forward to trying Creed Green Irish Tweed or Creed Silver Mountain Water instead.</li>
            <li> When I first spray it on, it is extremely weak as far as scent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s either 130 on here or 250 at Nordstroms where someone tries to upsell it to me for no other reason than to make money off the rich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long atall.</li>
            <li> All the reviews I had read said it was long lasting and could be smelled even after taking a shower.</li>
            <li> Came in box that was not sealed/properly wrapped (clear wrapping was missing).</li>
            <li> I have owned nearly 10 of the Creed Scents over the past several years and this is one I should have bought sooner...  </li>
            <li> I have Gucci Pour Homme 2, Prada, Burberry Brit, Lacoste, Polo, etc., and I never loved a fragrance as much as Himalaya.  </li>
            <li> Friends who have come close enough to smell me while wearing Himalaya have typically told me \\&quot;you smell</li>
            <li> The dry down is similar in some ways to Green Irish Tweed.</li>
            <li> Use only a little.  </li>
            <li> I bought both the Himalaya and the Green Irish Tweed.  </li>
            <li> Stay longer than other perfumes and will create vibes.  </li>
            <li> Smells like 50 other fragrances I&#x27;ve smelled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always preferred this scent to the other Creed products.</li>
            <li> I ordered this one straight from Amazon and noticed the bottle had some weird, &amp;#34;rusted&amp;#34;/decoloured wear on the flask cap.</li>
            <li> &quot; It&#x27;s only 80 years late, but it evokes imagery of the roaring &#x27;20s.</li>
            <li> i order the black one they send me the gray one</li>
            <li> i pay for the  the black one i need a phone number</li>
            <li> God I didn&#x27;t pay full retail, but this was by far the worst purchase I have made from Amazon and would have returned it immediately if I could have.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> So it was not original.</li>
            <li> When a cold left me with no sense of smell for several weeks</li>
            <li> I would pitch that Himalaya offers plenty of flexibility to be worn during any season and for any event - from formal settings to a casual Sunday.  </li>
            <li> Usually, with eau de parfum, I spray two, maybe three times.</li>
            <li> As usual, it came with the Arabic writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure how this is a creed.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with his other cologne.</li>
            <li> am guessing this is a bottle of very old stock, which is in the process of tapering and going bad.</li>
            <li> man, this fragrance is weak.</li>
            <li> Disregard the other reviewers, this item is fake!</li>
            <li> but this is irrelevant as these colognes last years and years without going bad.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it is too expensive for its performance.</li>
            <li> This is a fake product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that Amazon would send me the bottle in that condition.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was under the impression that the perfume would be great. Stay longer than other perfumes and will create vibes.  But it is slightly more than normal perfume. it might not be worth the price it has.</li>
            <li> I really like how this cologne smells. Amazon has a great price on this cologne...I&#x27;ve paid for this same cologne $220 bucks glad I found it here!</li>
            <li> Himalaya may be Creed’s most underrated fragrance and similar to some of its siblings, worthy of masterpiece status. This is a beautiful union of citrus, musk, and sandalwood notes that has quickly become one of my “go to” fragrances and currently ranking #3 behind Original Vetiver (#2) and my favorite, Green Irish Tweed (there is no substitute..!!) of my Creed fragrances.  The bottle is a reflection or representation of the fragrance – refreshing..!! I would pitch that Himalaya offers plenty of flexibility to be worn during any season and for any event - from formal settings to a casual Sunday.  I envision a Sunday drive in a convertible when winter is finally lifting, the air is still crisp, and the drive along the Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) is breathtaking – ocean on one side and the mountains in the horizon… You get the picture..!!  Himalaya performance is sufficient, lasting 6+ hours on me, longer on clothing, at greater than arm’s length projection/sillage.  It is a compliment getter and screams masculinity and a gentleman persona.  My final tally of Himalaya is 4.3 stars out of 5 stars with a solid recommendation to add to any collection.  While some say the price is exorbitant, but given the pleasure and confidence that Himalaya will add to your life, the bottle is worth every penny spent… Enjoy your day and happy fragrance hunting…</li>
            <li> Excellent cologne. A must recommendation for any man. My boyfriend loves it. Excellent price. I&#x27;ve purchased this before at double the price at Neiman&#x27;s. The shipping was excellent, got it in 2 days. Overall great experience with the seller.</li>
            <li> ** revised 3/7/14 **&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had some responses to my review and I feel much better now. Thank you for your feedback/comments. I still wish the box was wrapped with more care for shipping, as it arrived a little beat up and this was a gift. Overall though, after some use and research to understand how the product is presented (no clear wrapping), this is a very unique scent, lasts long, and recipient loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review: Amazon is trusted, right? Well I&#x27;m second guessing myself for purchasing this item on here. Maybe it&#x27;s real, maybe not. Will not buy from Amazon again though. Came in box that was not sealed/properly wrapped (clear wrapping was missing). That alone is a huge let down and honestly, a red flag. Disappointed that Amazon would send me the bottle in that condition. It was a gift and the presentation was seriously lacking for this kind of item. I pay prime membership to trust what I get from Amazon. Oh well, never again. Next time I&#x27;ll go to the dept store and get it there where I can see what I&#x27;m getting in person.</li>
            <li> The product is good  just find that the package is a bit classy but  not durable, Will also  recommended to friends</li>
            <li> its has a smell like something else...I bought same one from saks fifth which has a good and original ......do not buy from amazon...</li>
            <li> I have waited years to purchase &amp;#34;Himalaya&amp;#34; by Creed. I have owned many products from Creed such as &amp;#34;Silver mountain water&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Royal Oud&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Green Irish Tweed&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Adventius&amp;#34; also &amp;#34;Virgin island water&amp;#34; and maybe a few others. I didn&#x27;t think I would like Himalaya but I stand corrected! Love the stuff!! It smell&#x27;s like a sexy version of Green Irish Tweed. Himalaya is in my top 5 favorite colognes now.</li>
            <li> Just excellent scent but still so very, very light and doesn&#x27;t stay with me that long. Overall it still very, very nice scent for casual wear; I look forward to trying Creed Green Irish Tweed or Creed Silver Mountain Water instead.</li>
            <li> I CHOSE THIS BRAND BECAUSE OF THE GOOD RATING IT GOT OVER THE YEARS AND SOME GOOD REVIEWS OF SOME OF MY FRIENDS. GOT ME A SAMPLE AND GOT HOOK. SWEET AND FRESH , FOR DAY OR NIGHT. I RECOMMEND ANY CREED PRODUCT ANYWAY.</li>
            <li> ***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance has turned out to be one of my favourites precisely because it is not strong and does not offend. The sweet scent lasts 24 hours, so it is long-lasting. I plan on making this one a daily scent. Therefore, I am changing my rating from three stars to five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh man, this fragrance is weak. I mean, it&#x27;ll be good for a couple of hours and then it&#x27;ll dissipate quickly into nothing. Usually, with eau de parfum, I spray two, maybe three times. With this one, I have to spray four or more times to get any kind of effect that lasts longer than four hours. The scent itself is a bit &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; to me, which is not bad. I just wish it was strong and long-lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am guessing this is a bottle of very old stock, which is in the process of tapering and going bad. I ordered this one straight from Amazon and noticed the bottle had some weird, &amp;#34;rusted&amp;#34;/decoloured wear on the flask cap. The bottle itself was untouched, as I had to prime it to get it to spray (i.e., it was new and not a return). As usual, it came with the Arabic writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time around, I&#x27;ll see about getting some of it from a retail store to compare it properly. Caveat emptor.</li>
            <li> Nice clean scent and very long lasting. Great buy and we&#x27;l worth the price!  Will buy this again for sure ...</li>
            <li> Disregard the other reviewers, this item is fake! I have been to the creed boutique, this smells nothing like the original.</li>
            <li> The smile Moved very quickly idon&#x27; t know the reason but i think this not the best .&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I was happy to get an authentic bottle of Creed at a great price sold to me directly from Amazon LLC. Himalaya is a scent I really like. It has a citrus opening that soon goes away and develops into a woodsy smell that is very fresh and outdoorsy. The dry down is similar in some ways to Green Irish Tweed. I suspect Himalaya and GIT have some of the same notes. Himalaya definitely gives that same fresh outdoorsy vibe which you also get from GIT. The main difference is Himalaya gives a vibe that is woodsy fresh rather than the garden fresh grassy vibe of GIT. As I said before both fragrances have some of the same notes (which is a good thing). I also want to point out that the bottle I was sent had the old Creed sprayer. The new sprayers are far stronger than the old ones. All this means is that they are selling overstock product and discounting it which is fine. It explains the great price. The juice is definitely Creed and it smells exactly the same as the juice you&#x27;d buy in the mall at a department store. It&#x27;s definitely older product but this is irrelevant as these colognes last years and years without going bad. I am very happy with this purchase and the substantial money I saved.</li>
            <li> Extremely generic. Smells like 50 other fragrances I&#x27;ve smelled. Not sure how this is a creed. Garbage !</li>
            <li> I have received a fake cheap perfume, the aluminum painted bottle with a bright metallic cap is so far away of the original flask. This is my last purchase of this kind of products in amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this from fragrance Net.com but it is nothing to write about. I put it on and  before I left my room I can&#x27;t perceive the scent anymore. Don&#x27;t buy it is too expensive for its performance.</li>
            <li> Creed Himalaya is one of my favorite men&#x27;s cologne.  I have Gucci Pour Homme 2, Prada, Burberry Brit, Lacoste, Polo, etc., and I never loved a fragrance as much as Himalaya.  It has a very masculine smell with a hint of sweetness. Its name Himalaya definitely is the best word because everytime I smell this cologne, I feel like I am on top of the world!</li>
            <li> i order the black one they send me the gray one its cheaper i pay for the  the black one i need a phone number thanks</li>
            <li> You can find the notes of Himalaya easily enough, but the way they come together is almost magical. The fresh sandalwood mid note is the heart of the scent, with light musk and a demure cedar as bases and bergamot and citrus top notes. Sadly, it is not a long-lasting scent, if I wear it to work it&#x27;s nearly gone by lunch and all but a memory by the end of the day. I decant it into a 1/4oz tester vial, which I keep in my car for the times I don&#x27;t make it home after work before going out for the night. The sandalwood note is reminiscent of Ungaro III despite the drastically different styles.    Simply put, it&#x27;s a classy, light, summery fragrance with a spicy feel to it. When a cold left me with no sense of smell for several weeks and I relied on my brother&#x27;s account of the smell to ensure that I had received a genuine bottle (I haven&#x27;t bought it from Amazon, but their price is in line with what I&#x27;ve seen from retailers offering the real thing,) the description that settled the question for me is \\&quot;you smell like the Great Gatsby.\\&quot; It&#x27;s only 80 years late, but it evokes imagery of the roaring &#x27;20s. Friends who have come close enough to smell me while wearing Himalaya have typically told me \\&quot;you smell good,\\&quot; and more than a few have let a hug last a little longer than necessary or come back in for a second whiff of this masterpiece of a fragrance.</li>
            <li> I received this item and like it but I&#x27;m still waiting on my wife&#x27;s perfume.  We order this before Christmas.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations on this perfume. I was told something else but it doesn&#x27;t last long atall. Smells ok but doesn&#x27;t last more than the room.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  It&#x27;s either 130 on here or 250 at Nordstroms where someone tries to upsell it to me for no other reason than to make money off the rich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creed honestly is amazing - nothing is synthetic in it and the scent lasts for literally a week off of one spray.  I love this stuff with the rich smoky and woody scents in it.  Great cologne and this is the best price you can find!</li>
            <li> Knock off!!!!! Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I had read many reviews on this product before I purchased it and all were positive.&lt;br /&gt;After trying the cologne, however, I was severly dissapointed.When I first spray it on, it is extremely weak as far as scent goes.&lt;br /&gt;After about 10 minutes you can no longer even smell it at all. All the reviews I had read said it was long lasting and could be smelled even after taking a shower. That was not my experience.&lt;br /&gt;Thank God I didn&#x27;t pay full retail, but this was by far the worst purchase I have made from Amazon and would have returned it immediately if I could have.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this cologne was purchased from Amazon and not a perfume outlet. I thought that would be the safe way to go. I guess not.</li>
            <li> Creed are the best fragrances in the market. I was concerned that this product will not be original because it has a very good price compared to retail price, but it is and is very good.</li>
            <li> Creed speaks for itself</li>
            <li> This is my 6th creed  colonge  n like it very unique  smell very different</li>
            <li> This is the kind of perfume that women love to smell when are just having a perfect moment with their mens.</li>
            <li> This is a fake product. The one I received has letter in Arabic. So it was not original.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. I&#x27;ve always preferred this scent to the other Creed products.</li>
            <li> I used to pay $300 USD for this bottle in Paris a couple times per year; then started buying at Nieman Marcus for $200. This is an unbeatable price for CREED!</li>
            <li> Years ago I smelled this on a man at a lounge who was just passing by... I had to stop him &amp; asked what cologne are you wearing... When I googled it &amp; saw the price I said ok this is one you buy for someone special... Just got it for my boo as a Valentine&#x27;s Day gift! I had to spray it on me! It&#x27;s strong at first but a total turn on once it dries! Can&#x27;t wait to smell it on him! This is by far the sexiest scent on a man... my 2nd favorite is issey miyake</li>
            <li> I have owned nearly 10 of the Creed Scents over the past several years and this is one I should have bought sooner...  Scent is good for me at the office as its not overpowering.  This is one I will surely replace when it runs out.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Great Item! Item just as described!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this! I was not happy with his other cologne. It was so strong! This is soft yet masculine. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Outstanding. Use only a little.  It lasts all day. An unusual scent without the sweetness or muskiness of cheap colognes.  I bought both the Himalaya and the Green Irish Tweed.  I actually like the Tweed a little better; it has an earthiness that is very appealing.</li>
            <li> Creed is my favorite brand for men&#x27;s perfume . I&#x27;ve been using it for years and love it since to me nothing else can compare with the quality. Until I got the Himalaya, my favorite Creed was the Original Vetiver. Now these two are tied. I won&#x27;t describe the scent since it&#x27;ll be subjective, but I will say that if you like the Original Vetiver, you&#x27;ll love Himalaya.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Himalaya is a bit stronger but certainly not too much. The quality is outstanding, as you&#x27;d expect from Creed, and the scent lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular vendor was prompt in shipping and the bottle is original. I&#x27;m very happy with both and will buy from this vendor again.</li>
