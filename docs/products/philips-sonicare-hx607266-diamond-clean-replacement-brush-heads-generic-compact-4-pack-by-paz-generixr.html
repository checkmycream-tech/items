            <li>These are a great value.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they would be very effective.</li>
            <li>but as I am overseas the return and reship is no longer cost effective.</li>
            <li>so these brushes are perfect for me and they clean my teeth perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>These might be a tad softer bristles than the name brand, but much more of a value.</li>
            <li>and they all love them.</li>
            <li>Get the original!</li>
            <li>Was pleased that it was as advertised and fit the Sonicare toothbrush I have.</li>
            <li>And most important they don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>I ended up throwing these away and getting a Costco membership so that I could buy the real thing at a fair price.</li>
            <li>Too Fine of a bristle</li>
            <li>Had they fit, I would have used them -</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what these are supposed to fit.</li>
            <li>These generics are just as good quality as far as I can see, and the price is way lower.</li>
            <li>No wonder why the price is way lower than the original one.</li>
            <li>Not like original.</li>
            <li>With the original Sonicare brush heads, your teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>The brushes I was sent are NOT compatible with the Diamond clean brush and ARE NOT &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34; size.</li>
            <li>these are nothing like the diamond clean heads.</li>
            <li>These are nothing like the Diamond Clean brush heads.</li>
            <li>Not such a good value when the quality isn&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li>Save some dough and do it right.</li>
            <li>The Diamond Clean part really doe NOT apply here, either.  </li>
            <li>I have been buying generic toothbrushes for quite some time now and these are just as good as the “original” ones with the big brand name.</li>
            <li>The heading of this product, by the way, should be careful since they make it sound like this product is as good as the original, but it really is not.  </li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are way too soft to clean your teeth right.</li>
            <li>The bristles feel way too soft to make my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>As stated by others, these are way too soft to properly clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>This is a SOFT Bristle brush which is fine if you have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>It is a crime that the brand name brushes cost so much.</li>
            <li>Bristles are MUCH softer than the name brand.  </li>
            <li>Those are the toothbrush heads I received, not only are they noting like the photo, they don&#x27;t even fit my philips sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I never realized how much the brand names rip you off</li>
            <li>so you are just paying for the name really.</li>
            <li>These do fit a little tight but are such a great value.</li>
            <li>The bristles are more similar to the Pro Results heads in both softness and overall design - including bristle pitch, patch and pattern.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>yes, but I have very sensitive gums</li>
            <li>The head does not fit in your mouth as elegantly as the OEM heads  either as these heads are more of a wedge that tapers to a crude rounded tip like many 2$ disposable toothbrushes from the pharmacy.  </li>
            <li>I was so hoping to find a real alternative to the super expensive original sonicare compact heads from Phillips.  </li>
            <li>Also, the bristles are way to soft.</li>
            <li>I bought these heads as a replacement to the very overpriced Sonicare heads thinking they would be the same.</li>
            <li>Well, they are too soft and don&#x27;t do the toothbrush justice.  </li>
            <li>They are soft</li>
            <li>My whole family started using generic tooth brushes once I had bought these</li>
            <li>from a far they look similar.</li>
            <li>The bristles were too soft for my liking and very different from the Philips brush heads</li>
            <li>The bristles and the head itself is no where near the same quality as Philips.</li>
            <li>Not only were these heads not Compact but full size, but they do not fit my Diamond system.</li>
            <li>These are not exactly like the real brushes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not as good as the original one.</li>

            <li> Brush head about half the size of brand name and bristles already starting to bend outward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The bristles break down within a week of use.  Inexpensive, but you get what you pay for.  I was so hoping to find a real alternative to the super expensive original sonicare compact heads from Phillips.  The heading of this product, by the way, should be careful since they make it sound like this product is as good as the original, but it really is not.  The Diamond Clean part really doe NOT apply here, either.  It fits the devise, but it is not the same quality.</li>
            <li> Too Fine of a bristle and it is not a compact head as advertised.  They also do not fit onto the Sonicare very well, but will work, just not well.</li>
            <li> Was pleased that it was as advertised and fit the Sonicare toothbrush I have.</li>
            <li> It is a crime that the brand name brushes cost so much. These are proof we don&#x27;t need corporate greed and I urge everybody to purchase generic brushes and send a message to The name brand manufacturers to stop ripping people off. These might be a tad softer bristles than the name brand, but much more of a value.</li>
            <li> The bristles feel way too soft to make my teeth feel clean. I will definitely spring for the sonicare brand to replace them.</li>
            <li> The description indicates they are compact size.  They are not - they are larger than the compact size from Philips.</li>
            <li> These do fit a little tight but are such a great value.</li>
            <li> So soft that the brushes after the third day of use do not clean my teeth...</li>
            <li> Bristles are MUCH softer than the name brand.  I will not use again, but that may not bother some people.</li>
            <li> The brushes I was sent are NOT compatible with the Diamond clean brush and ARE NOT &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34; size. Total wast of money.</li>
            <li> Brush head about half the size of brand name and bristles already starting to bend outward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order arrive quickly, product just not best quality.</li>
            <li> These are not exactly like the real brushes. I don&#x27;t plan on reordering but for the price I can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> They wore out after one use</li>
            <li> Bristles are too thin.  Had to toss them out.</li>
            <li> these are nothing like the diamond clean heads. the materials and design are completely different. the only thing they got close were the colors. from a far they look similar. And most important they don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> They were not as advertised. Did not fit my toothbrush. I was not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Not only were these heads not Compact but full size, but they do not fit my Diamond system. Had they fit, I would have used them - but as I am overseas the return and reship is no longer cost effective. I will not be repurchasing these types of heads.</li>
            <li> This seller is a cheat, what you see in the picture is not actually what you get by the long shot! (See attached image) Those are the toothbrush heads I received, not only are they noting like the photo, they don&#x27;t even fit my philips sonicare toothbrush. Don&#x27;t waist your money here.</li>
            <li> Not as pictured.Very low quality!!!!</li>
            <li> This replacement tooth brush did not fit the kids Sonicare well at all. It did not fit all the way down on the handle.  I threw them away. Also, the bristles are way to soft. I don&#x27;t think they would be very effective.</li>
            <li> The bristles were too soft for my liking and very different from the Philips brush heads I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> This product deserves no stars. It is not even compatible with Sonicare tooth brushes. the picture is not representative of the product delivered.</li>
            <li> I bought these heads as a replacement to the very overpriced Sonicare heads thinking they would be the same. Well, they are too soft and don&#x27;t do the toothbrush justice.  I ended up throwing these away and getting a Costco membership so that I could buy the real thing at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I ordered compact replacement brush heads, but I received generic replacement brush heads. I need it for traveling, therefore I did not return/refund the product. Just felt that this is a pure careless, and made me very disappointed.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are a lot smaller than the originals. They also are wearing out faster. Not such a good value when the quality isn&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li> These are a great value. I never realized how much the brand names rip you off so you are just paying for the name really. These generics are just as good quality as far as I can see, and the price is way lower. I will never buy the Philips heads again.</li>
            <li> As stated by others, these are way too soft to properly clean your teeth. With the original Sonicare brush heads, your teeth feel clean. With these, they do not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not as good as the original one. No wonder why the price is way lower than the original one. Won&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are way too soft to clean your teeth right. They are no way the same as the originals, which gave your teeth the feel that you just came back from the dentist. These replacement brush heads are worthless, and need to be thrown away!</li>
            <li> I have been buying generic toothbrushes for quite some time now and these are just as good as the “original” ones with the big brand name. They are soft yes, but I have very sensitive gums so these brushes are perfect for me and they clean my teeth perfectly fine. My whole family started using generic tooth brushes once I had bought these and they all love them. Saves us quite a bit of money in one year. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These are nothing like the Diamond Clean brush heads. The bristles are more similar to the Pro Results heads in both softness and overall design - including bristle pitch, patch and pattern. The head does not fit in your mouth as elegantly as the OEM heads  either as these heads are more of a wedge that tapers to a crude rounded tip like many 2$ disposable toothbrushes from the pharmacy.  Take heed: This is a SOFT Bristle brush which is fine if you have sensitive gums. The bristles and the head itself is no where near the same quality as Philips. Save some dough and do it right. Too bad I can&#x27;t upload a picture of this as the picture shown in the description is nothing like what is actually shipped.   UPDATE: Took a day or so, but I finally decided to actually try and use it. ** The heads do not actually fit on the Philips SoniCare ** I don&#x27;t know what these are supposed to fit.</li>
            <li> Not like original. Bristle start coming after 4-5 use. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Get the original!</li>
    </ol>
