            <li> My Pharmacy has tried to sustitue Ferritin,Fetinic and other generics for NuIron.</li>

            <li> This item was prescribed by my family doctor, and was less expensive on Amazon than at the local large drug stores.</li>
            <li> the doctor recommended this specific brand name and said it was easy on the stomach.  It has caused no issues and happy to report the last blood test is back in the normal range.</li>

            <li> I used this product before surgery and have kept up with it after surgery.  it seems to be helping, but it does make you constipated.</li>
            <li> My Pharmacy has tried to sustitue Ferritin,Fetinic and other generics for NuIron. Nothing else has added Vit C,etc. ,needed for the absorption of Iron. Years ago, I took Iberet 500. An added plus, these NuIron come in a bottle vs the punch out card at my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking it for two weeks and it does not upset my stomach, which is fantastic. Wish it were not so expensive</li>
            <li> Unlike other Iron pills, these pills caused me none of the sick effects.  Easy to swallow,  no tummy ache, no nausea.</li>
            <li> I am unable to tolerate prescription iron tablets.  However these work great foe me</li>
            <li> Great product for vegetarians who can&#x27;t get enough iron rich foods in their diets to absorb into the body!!&lt;br /&gt;This product is so amazing, so easy to take, and easy on the digestive system.  I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> The Nu-iron 150 capsules have been a blessing. My Hemoglobin levels had descended to a level that precluded my Blood Band donations. These donations are my main public service now that I am retired from my career in Customer Service. Because of the Nu-iron Capsules, I have been able to continue my public service, and I am very thankful for that.</li>
            <li> It is terribly expensive!!!</li>
            <li> I have to take iron because of anemia. Most iron pills upset my stomach mightily. This formulation does not. It was recommended by my nephrologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I have use NU IRON for years. Package arrives intact and in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my cousin when I told her I was feeling lethargic and sleepy all the time with a touch of fuzzy brain. It was the most horrible nuisance.  I felt like I was an 80 year old person rather than in my mid-30s.  Even though I was fully expecting to have to wait about 2-4 weeks to feel any kind of results, I have to say that I started feeling back to my old self in about 2-3 days after taking this.  I take it in the morning with my breakfast. It doesn&#x27;t make me nauseas as some iron products have had a tendency to do with me. I wouldn&#x27;t say I feel hyper energetic, but I will say I feel NORMAL.  I feel awake in the morning. I feel like I am ready to think. I don&#x27;t have that underlying sleepy-lethargy in my body which just drags you down all day. OH! And it doesn&#x27;t constipate me as some iron products have in the past. (TMI for some, but necessary info for others.)</li>
            <li> When I was told I would have to take iron I was expecting major stomach issues, but nu-iron 150 has been very easy on my stomach.  It has helped my anemia, and I feel better.  It is supposed to be taken only if a doctor tells you to take it though.  It is more potent than typical iron supplements on drugstore shelves. I find getting it on amazon is easy and convenient.</li>
            <li> these pill give major constipation</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy I ordered this vitamins from Amazon.. It sure save me a lot of money not going through the&lt;br /&gt;pharmacy.  For the monies, I got much, much more quantity than what the pharmacy gave me on my prescription the first time,the Doctor order them&lt;br /&gt;And I didn&#x27;t need a script for them when I ordered to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give you 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with Anemia for a very long time.  And when I say my hemoglobin levels were low, I mean they were about half of the normal low-end value that an adult male should have.  So my doctor started me on Iron infusions on a weekly basis. After about 4 weeks we checked my hemoglobin levels again and they had gone up by about 3 gm/dL.  Which made a huge improvement in my energy levels and complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then I moved across the country and had to get a new doctor.  The new doctor introduced me to these pills. Other Iron pills had upset my stomach in the past, and I didn&#x27;t really get the absorption that the infusions had given me.  So we measured before I started and my hemoglobin level, in the month or two that I had missed out on infusions due to the move, had dropped almost back down to where I had started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after about a month of being on the NuIron pills I was back up to the upper level I was at from the infusions.  The NuIron pills may be expensive, but they are much cheaper than having the infusions.  The more I take these pills the better I feel (no more than 1 pill twice a day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend these to anybody with low iron levels, as I no longer look like and feel like a sick guy, just a normal guy.  I will update when I get get my next blood test.</li>
            <li> Really good help my daughter with her anemia</li>
            <li> This product cleared up my iron deficiency better than any other product that I have used in years!  I recommend this product for anyone that needs treatment for iron poor blood.</li>
            <li> My elderly mother has been unable to take most iron supplements.  Her cardiologist recommended NuIron.  It is pricey; However, she has not had constipation, stomach issues, etc. on this product.  Hopefully, we will see an improvement in her iron levels.</li>
            <li> Worked well.No side effects.</li>
            <li> Nu-Iron caps have made a world of difference for my wife! She works outside in the Arizona heat every day and she was exhausted beyond normal parameters even in that situation. Long story short - The Nu-Iron caps have provided exactly what she was missing and her energy levels and energy reserves have greatly improved!</li>
            <li> just what I wanted....so much cheaper than at the drugstore....</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Most irons cause constipation but this doesn&#x27;t upset your system at all--no stomach pains, no constipation.  My ferritan level was very low and has moved into a good range now. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was advised by one of my physicians to take Nu-Iron.  I&#x27;ve only been taking it for a few weeks.  I have a little more stamina, but the doctor will give the final vedict when I see him next.</li>
