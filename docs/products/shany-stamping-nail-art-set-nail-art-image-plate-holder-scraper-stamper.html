            <li>I love it!!    </li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE!!</li>
            <li>this kit is amazing!  </li>
            <li>lol Im not so good at doing stuff like this.  </li>
            <li>She is happy with it, so it was a good buy.  </li>
            <li>Okay so this goes perfect with \\&quot;SHANY</li>
            <li>Nice!</li>
            <li>Nice, good price!</li>
            <li>The stamper is easy to use, but it does take some practice to make the perfect design, but DON&#x27;T give up, it took me awhile</li>
            <li>so easy to use and a great value too!</li>
            <li>This is a great price, and I love the fact that it comes with a platform to hold your plates so they don&#x27;t slip around and helps prevent a lot of messes!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good that you get all three parts of a set instead of buying each separately.</li>
            <li>Works well and image plates fit perfectly in the holder.</li>
            <li>was good.</li>
            <li>.. can never get it to transfer image to make them look good..</li>
            <li>She loved it.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never tried anything like this, this will be a good investment because some of the others that I&#x27;ve purchased are costly.</li>
            <li>The stamper is good.  </li>
            <li>not as good as konad</li>
            <li>the stamper tool somehow doesnt pick up the nail art stamp good as konad.</li>
            <li>Works really good, no problems stamping the patterns and applying it on my nails.</li>
            <li>Good product and good price...</li>
            <li>Good quality,good product.</li>
            <li>Loved the quality of it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>I cannot get it to make good quality stamps for the life of me.</li>
            <li>Good for a starter set but meh for anyone wanting to keep their plates useable.</li>
            <li>and I get a good pencil-grip on it.</li>
            <li>the stamp didn&#x27;t work as good as i had hoped</li>
            <li>NEVER SEEN A PRODUCT WAS SO GOOD, SO EASY AND BEAUTIFUL RESULTS.</li>
            <li>and well i just love it and am so happy with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;s very cute</li>
            <li>Love the plate holder as used with my Shany plates and the stamper works great.</li>
            <li>I used in my salon and the customers are very satisfied with the results</li>
            <li>and I must say I am in love with it!</li>
            <li>I sure did learn to appreciate it when I forgot my plate holder one day!</li>
            <li>and she adores the cute design!</li>
            <li>I love all the possibilities!</li>
            <li>love playing with this set!</li>
            <li>they work awesome was kinda werid on using it at first</li>
            <li>You can never have too many stampers or scrapers!</li>
            <li>ahh I&#x27;m in love with this!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t as for anything better!</li>
            <li>All the amazing and trendy looks without having to pay salon prices.</li>
            <li>this nail stamper and polish scraper work amazingly, iv&#x27;e had this for a while</li>
            <li>This set is a necessity if you own the plates.</li>
            <li>but I kind of figured it out.</li>
            <li>I WANTED TO TRY THE SHORTER STAMPER FOR MY OWN USE.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend this product to anyone, it is great for grownups and kids!</li>
            <li>there is no point having nice plates.  </li>
            <li>I do my own nails</li>
            <li>The results are spectacular.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my own opinion and doesn&#x27;t effect the function of this</li>
            <li>yes I do my own nails    </li>
            <li>The stamper is nice and didn&#x27;t have issues picking up the design.</li>
            <li>The plate holder is handy, but it slides on the table when you are trying to scrape your plate.</li>
            <li>The scraper is nice, but scratches the plate.</li>
            <li>, Stamper)]]So have fun and Stamp Away!!!</li>
            <li>but once you get the hang of it, it is very cool!</li>
            <li>ALL THE PRODUCTS IS VERY EASY TO CLEAN AND MANAGE!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>So many plates with so many choices of decos!  </li>
            <li>This is so cute and Shany also has so many plates you can buy for this!</li>
            <li>After purchasing this product, my sister and I have more nail time together! :)</li>
            <li>I love beauty stuff so much!!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s good for people with a lot of free time and patience .</li>
            <li>but I would liked if the scraper Would have worked better.</li>
            <li>The Scrapper you need to find the right side where to scrap..need to try every side once you find it , it works great.</li>
            <li>plate holder is so easy to use!</li>
            <li>LOVE the plate holder idea they came up with, makes it SO much easier, and then you&#x27;re done and you have gorgeous nails to show for it!</li>
            <li>i absolutely love these art designs, and they are so easy to use!</li>
            <li>Great for people who aren&#x27;t very artistic and need a little help creating perfect designs every time.</li>
            <li>IT HOLDS THE PLATES IN PLACE AND IS EASY TO CLEAN!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STAMPER SET</li>
            <li>better then the metal ones for this.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok..</li>
            <li>Probably would have been better off just buying a stamper alone.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of this product, but have not purchased it yet.</li>
            <li>With this price and the cute design this is a fab favor for a girls birthday party.  </li>
            <li>and i just love it</li>
            <li>When she did them they looked OK.  </li>
            <li>Its an okay item but not up to my standards.</li>
            <li>It makes application a breeze, I love how I no longer have to go spend 15 a week on a manicure.</li>
            <li>so wasn&#x27;t able to test.  </li>
            <li>Love this product..</li>
            <li>Totally love it.</li>
            <li>one of my favorite stamper.</li>
            <li>i dont use the holder or the scraper. :-)</li>
            <li>(as many others here have already stated).  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>Im in love with the type of designing nails</li>
            <li>it okay</li>
            <li>This is so cute</li>
            <li>this is safe</li>
            <li>I recommend this :)</li>
            <li>ACTUALLY, THIS PRODUCT MAKES PERFECT YOUR nails look.</li>
            <li>I LOVE.</li>
            <li>I have done hair and nails for many, many years</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t exactly fit in the image plate holder!</li>
            <li>and i would reccomend it to anyone. :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li>This is soooo cute  </li>
            <li>yes this is safe  </li>
            <li>yes I recommend this :)</li>
            <li>sister very much enjoyed using these for her nails.</li>
            <li>so whenever I want to press the image on my nails--i end up applying more pressure which hurts.  </li>
            <li>Worked well once we got the hang of it. :)</li>
            <li>I ended up ordering Konan and that stamp works much better.  </li>
            <li>Also, a credit card works better as a scraper.</li>
            <li>The stamper is also okay</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>The stamper works perfectly, and I like that it is short and</li>
            <li>Love it, love Shany</li>
            <li>so i will be buying a better one</li>
            <li>I love dong my nails so as soon as I saw something that would help me put designs on my nails</li>
            <li>Glad I bought this case for my iPad.</li>
            <li>i absolutely love doing my nails</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure this would work with a better plate set.</li>
            <li>The stamper is ok.</li>
            <li>Most people have one or more laying around.</li>
            <li>I love the stamper</li>
            <li>The stamper was perfect especially for a beginner like me.</li>
            <li>i love doing my own nails and trying out different beautiful designs.</li>
            <li>The stamping thingy is pretty good</li>
            <li>i love the stamper and the holder they really work good .</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t believe that I only paid $4.99 for this great product.</li>
            <li>and it was very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I set this on my vanity and it adds the perfect pink to the rest of my collection.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using an old Amazon gift card, and it works great as a scraper.  </li>
            <li>So after much deliberation, i decided to buy the cheeky jumbo plates because of the good reviews.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and the clean up is even easier!</li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s so easy to clean!</li>
            <li>Which did not make me very happy, but other then that it works for my purposes</li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; handle</li>
            <li>It makes it so easy to stamp your nails.</li>
            <li>This nail art kit is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use it at a good angle to clear the excess polish from the plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Makes doing your nails at home so easy.</li>
            <li>Great idea, love that you get all 3 things together since some of the locations selling similar things at the mall dont come with the holder, just wish the holder was a lil deeper since the discs pop out easily, i&#x27;ve had one slide around on the holding tool when i was trying to scrape the polish off before using the stamper...</li>
            <li>it fits easily into my hand</li>
            <li>Easy to use and manage.</li>
            <li>Seems to be easy for her to use.</li>
            <li>This product was up to the high standard of all shany products- great quality, fast shipping, and works perfectly!</li>
            <li>This was super easy to use and I love that it has the plate holder.</li>
            <li>This is a very complete set for stamping your nails, very easy for beginners too!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in fine working condition.</li>
            <li>The plate holder and Stamper work fine, but the metal scraper scratched the plate I used it on.  </li>
            <li>This nail art set is so easy to use, and it is really cheap too</li>
            <li>This part is fine, the plates were the issue</li>
            <li>Only took 1 day to get to my house, which was great.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product.</li>
            <li>The stamper doesn&#x27;t pick up anything and the silicon isn&#x27;t secure in the holder.</li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s a great product for the price</li>
            <li>This would be great to do your nails 2 different colors and be all cuties before going out on the town.</li>
            <li>the stamper and holder itself was good, but I find the scraper unusable and opted to using an old plastic card.</li>
            <li>Also the stamper creates a bunch of really quick fun easy and cute designs.</li>
            <li>A three generation fun night with the girls was even more fun with a mani/pedi which included the use of this product!</li>
            <li>I was most interested in the tray to hold the plates.</li>
            <li>So much fun to use!  </li>
            <li>So worth the money!</li>
            <li>Fun to use, easy.</li>
            <li>The plate holder keeps the plates in but is not the easiest material to clean nail polish off of.</li>
            <li>You use nail polish remove to clean it</li>
            <li>The plastic melts when it comes in contact with acetone, which makes no sense because you need acetone to clean the plates....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too much to clean it , to put it on etc .</li>
            <li>It does make stamping nail art easy an fun.</li>
            <li>It seems to be very well made, and it cleans up easily with just a little nail polish remover on a Q-tip or cotton bud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $3.99, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>The stamper itself is pretty straightforward and easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t super excited when I got this because I had never stamped my nails.</li>
            <li>The scraper scratches the plates, a definite no no in my book; I stopped using it and stated using an old gift card, the material is ideal for swiping, and cleanup is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>The stamper has worked great, but beware if you want to stamp with pink polish.</li>
            <li>My teen loved them.</li>
            <li>The packaging is so adorable and Shany always gets things delivered fast.</li>
            <li>NEVER picks up a full image in one shot.</li>
            <li>and it is much softer and works better.</li>
            <li>The plate holder works ok but found I don&#x27;t really need one.</li>
            <li>For only $4.99 it was a good deal.</li>
            <li>and it came with all the parts which was cool</li>
            <li>While the holder is a good idea, it collects polish around the edges, creating extra cleaning.</li>
            <li>but this is not bad.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this product, it is easy to use and is very affordable.</li>
            <li>so I have been searching for one that is all plastic and wont mess up my beautiful image plates</li>
            <li>Quick Shipping.</li>
            <li>I followed multiple online tutorials and tried to stamp my nails many many times, I just cannot make it work.</li>
            <li>They are cute stamps; especially when you are in a hurry, this is kind of faster you cant really make mistakes.</li>
            <li>I love doing new things to my nails.</li>
            <li>I am new to the nail art world and am enjoying the learning process.</li>
            <li>The plate holder is good, it fits all the plate i have, the stamp is not bad, a little... cheap?</li>
            <li>I think this is the first bundle I&#x27;ve seen with a plate holder, scraper and stamper!  </li>
            <li>Makes life MUCH easier!!</li>
            <li>This is a great little set to have around.</li>
            <li>The plates won&#x27;t stay in the tray, they move too much to be useful when scraping the excess polish off.</li>
            <li>I thought it might be a fun hobby to start.</li>
            <li>The plate holder is kind of a waste for me because I hold my plates on a paper towel on top of a towel.  </li>
            <li>So much fun.</li>
            <li>The scraper scratched my plates, so I switched to an old store rewards card with much better results.</li>
            <li>Image does come out clear and hassle free!  </li>
            <li>The only issue is that the scraper isn&#x27;t made fully of plastic, it comes with a kind of blade to scrap the nail polish and it does scrantches the plates.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses her nail art weekly and comes up with some really fun nails.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses her nail art weekly and comes up with some really fun nails.</li>
            <li>Works well as described and lots of fun.</li>
            <li>IT IS WELL WORTH</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth buying</li>
            <li>Fun.</li>
            <li>I ended up using an old gift card and it works much better.</li>
            <li>Would have been nice if this information had been included in description or on product instructions especially since the stamping plates require pure acetone to clean.  </li>
            <li>Other than that good product.</li>
            <li>I just got this today (along with a set of 25 plates by Shany), and of course, I had to try it out right away even though I haven&#x27;t yet received the polish I ordered for</li>
            <li>To top it off the stamper is no good (even after a good priming)</li>
            <li>Very smart buy.</li>
            <li>They hold the plates perfectly while you design your nails and alleviates the mess from the entire process.</li>
            <li>Great buy, especially for only five dollars!</li>
            <li>This makes a mess free session and it definately looks more professional :)</li>
            <li>tried several of the Shany designs, including 2 with lots of little fine lines, and this stamper works great.  </li>
            <li>I WOULD MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND AND REBUY!!!</li>
            <li>I havent ordered yet but just wanted to share with everyone that if this is going to be the first time they buy a set like this plastic scapers and</li>
            <li>First time using anything like this...  </li>
            <li>the stamp isnt too big but its a perfect size its the only set i seen that works and its for a low price</li>
            <li>At first, i thought that the problem lies in my shany 2012 plates.</li>
            <li>I will admit that I am a first time stamping user.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap toy for kids as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s her technique because this was the first stamper she tried.</li>
            <li>But she eventually bought the double ended Konad stamper which gave her better results.</li>
            <li>I like to use a nail file to buff the stamp before first use.</li>
            <li>The stamper is ok but only has the one size.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>it came in a plastic ziplock more like something you let a teen use</li>
            <li>So adorable with the stability of protecting my pad and being able to carry my personal items such as an id and credit card.</li>
            <li>but this product saves me from so much struggle!</li>
            <li>Works really well easier to use than even expected I get compliments every day on my nails , buy it for sure!</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve given it another star if it fit a little better</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t own any other stamping sets</li>
            <li>I have really liked the SHANY nail products, I&#x27;ve never used them before, it takes a little work learning how to do it well, but it&#x27;s fun learning and my niece</li>
            <li>I have tried different scrapers but to be honest I prefer using an old credit card.  </li>
            <li>So amazing that you get all this for such a low price, with this stamper you will never run out of fun</li>
            <li>Came pretty fast.</li>
            <li>The concept is really cool, I bought them for my 7 yr old daughter and they don&#x27;t work on her</li>
            <li>Overall, I recommend you to buy the original ones because its going to work wonderfully than the fake ones like these.</li>
            <li>but thats what makes it easy to use, and hellooooooo its such a BARGAIN!!!</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, the plastic plate holder and plastic stamper melt after coming in contact with pure acetone.</li>
            <li>I cleaned the paint off these items with pure acetone and the image plate holder became sticky and the cotton stuck to it.  </li>
            <li>Its a pretty decent product for what I paid.</li>
            <li>And I almost wish there was a way to move a little plastic or rubber piece over the plate to kind of hold it in place.</li>
            <li>All of shanys nail products work wonders and work very well together.</li>
            <li>too much butm y sister loves messing with it all the time.</li>
            <li>And only six dollars with free shipping.</li>
            <li>i love the stamper it stamps every time and never leaves any empty spots and shipping</li>
            <li>I want to say that straight off.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a bit too much on</li>
            <li>plus I love the pink color.</li>
            <li>I really like the plate holder this kit comes with.</li>
            <li>The piece holds the stamping plates in place very well.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE IT.  </li>
            <li>But the stamping chips off fairly fast, not the stampers fault I know.  </li>
            <li>The metal scraper isn&#x27;t straight</li>
            <li>The scraper scratches my plates and doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>I really like the plate</li>
            <li>With that being said, that is the one item you don&#x27;t really need</li>
            <li>Really, go with konad because this one doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I have used a sraper that is fully made of plastic and it is much easier to scrap.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making that decision for me.</li>
            <li>Very convenient with the holder.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the holder thing.</li>
            <li>You certainly will not be able to use this stamp for full size adult nails, perhaps little kid nails</li>
            <li>Now I make sure it stays together with my other nail supplies.</li>
            <li>I would love to try it again, however, after having read some of the reviews, I might try to buy some of Shany&#x27;s other products, since some of the people who tried this product were on the fence about it.</li>
            <li>this worked lot better than some other competitors products.</li>
            <li>Way more affordable than the other nail stampers out there.</li>
            <li>My first time using it, I made the realization that the plate holder and the scraper are more trouble than helpful.</li>
            <li>I just discovered it, so i&#x27;m still a newbie, and i&#x27;m pretty crappy at the stamping so far,</li>
            <li>It was also slightly older.</li>
            <li>I brought this along with their 25 stamping plates for my older sister and</li>
            <li>The holder slips around a little making the stamping process a little more challenging</li>
            <li>Some of the images aren&#x27;t deep enough but other than that it is a good deal</li>
            <li>am trying a new nail design every week&lt;</li>
            <li>I am trying a new nail design every week   </li>
            <li>If I wanted to buy used instead of new I would have.</li>
            <li>I am new to stamping</li>
            <li>I am new to nail stamping</li>
            <li>New to nail stamping</li>
            <li>I am new to stamping and purchased this kit.</li>
            <li>As far as the kit goes, I thought the stamper was decent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad this was extremely inexpensive or else it&#x27;d be going back to Amazon.</li>
            <li>but it deff works once you get use to it and use new polishes nothing to old</li>
            <li>The stamper does its job just fine, but can be a little longer for grown up hands.</li>
            <li>it saves me a huge mess.</li>
            <li>It holds them well and make the design go on smoothly without a mess.</li>
            <li>I originally thought shany cosmetics was only good for their make up, and boy was I completely wrong!</li>
            <li>The holder melts with pure acetone, only used once to test when received.</li>
            <li>I am going to have to warn you that it is a lot sloppier using regular nail polish opposed to a stamping polish, due to their thickness, and if you are using a regular polish be prepared for many retries but other than that stamping is fun!</li>
            <li>I found it to make clear stamps</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clear the excess polish off of the plate as well as plastic does.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Image does come out clear and hassle</li>
            <li>Complete your manicure kit with this set.</li>
            <li>I just use the stamper and an old plastic card.  </li>
            <li>save your money and buy the professional brand  (eg konad) if u want to try stamping.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re completely blurry or just blobs.</li>
            <li>I use an old credit card instead of the scraper this comes with because it might scratch your plates.</li>
            <li>Would recommend using an old plastic card to scrape with.</li>
            <li>For the scraper, I would recommend an old credit card or a plastic scraper over the metal version.</li>
            <li>and it can be replaced with a gift card or old credit</li>
            <li>ended up giving up on the scraper and using an old plastic credit card for a scraper.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ended up pitching the scraper and just using an old credit card.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even attempt to use the scraper and opted for an old gift card instead.</li>
            <li>My 12 year old loves this set and the ones given to her with it.  </li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been a dream</li>
            <li>/&gt;Right now I use this stamper with an old health card as my scraper</li>
            <li>I have been using an old credit card.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 13 year old sister-in-law</li>
            <li>I find it easiest to set the plate on a double layered paper towel and scrape the excess polish straight off the plate to the towel.</li>
            <li>I find it easiest to use an old credit card or gift card.</li>
            <li>The scraper ended up scratching my plates, so instead of the scraper now i use an old gift card</li>
            <li>, it holds all the round plates I have from various maker, and it cuts down on the excess polish getting everywhere, and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I am still looking into it, but so far it seems like a nifty little product that helps out beginners and experts alike to achieve flawless nail designs without all the hard and messy work.</li>
            <li>The price is very good which makes it less scary to try out.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the plate holder could hold the plate in better.</li>
            <li>stamper actually works really well for me compared to another I got from Hong Kong recently.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s way too small to do much more than transfer individual images (when it occasionally allows a transfer to happen).</li>
            <li>My 21 year old is a nail polish addict and really loves this tool...especially since she changes her nail polish on average, every 2 days</li>
            <li>they work ok on mine not great.</li>
            <li>Their nail supplies and products work just as great if not better than other brands I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>There is another brand that has a rubber-type holder that really stays put while you are scraping, so I prefer the other one.</li>
            <li>it was hard for me to use because I had to clean it after every use</li>
            <li>, sure they made it cute with cut out hearts, and in a hot pink plastic, but no it is horrible you will be left with sloppy to non transferable designs every time you run the scrapper over a plate, just use an old plastic credit card, it works so much better</li>
            <li>she did her first set within an hour of receiving this and has since sent me pictures of new designs at least once a week.  </li>
            <li>In itself, its also a little small, I know you turn the plate and scrape downwards, but I want to be able to scrape sideways too.</li>
            <li>If there is a problem it is usually user error by not using the right polish ir not cleaning the stamper off in between stamps.</li>
            <li>Takes a  little practice but he was able to do her nails after just a few tries.  </li>

            <li> I love it!!    </li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE!!</li>
            <li> this kit is amazing!  </li>
            <li> lol Im not so good at doing stuff like this.  </li>
            <li> She is happy with it, so it was a good buy.  </li>
            <li> Okay so this goes perfect with \\&quot;SHANY</li>
            <li> Nice!</li>
            <li> Nice, good price!</li>
            <li> The stamper is easy to use, but it does take some practice to make the perfect design, but DON&#x27;T give up, it took me awhile</li>
            <li> so easy to use and a great value too!</li>
            <li> This is a great price, and I love the fact that it comes with a platform to hold your plates so they don&#x27;t slip around and helps prevent a lot of messes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good that you get all three parts of a set instead of buying each separately.</li>
            <li> Works well and image plates fit perfectly in the holder.</li>
            <li> was good.</li>
            <li> .. can never get it to transfer image to make them look good..</li>
            <li> She loved it.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried anything like this, this will be a good investment because some of the others that I&#x27;ve purchased are costly.</li>
            <li> The stamper is good.  </li>
            <li> not as good as konad</li>
            <li> the stamper tool somehow doesnt pick up the nail art stamp good as konad.</li>
            <li> Works really good, no problems stamping the patterns and applying it on my nails.</li>
            <li> Good product and good price...</li>
            <li> Good quality,good product.</li>
            <li> Loved the quality of it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> I cannot get it to make good quality stamps for the life of me.</li>
            <li> Good for a starter set but meh for anyone wanting to keep their plates useable.</li>
            <li> and I get a good pencil-grip on it.</li>
            <li> the stamp didn&#x27;t work as good as i had hoped</li>
            <li> NEVER SEEN A PRODUCT WAS SO GOOD, SO EASY AND BEAUTIFUL RESULTS.</li>
            <li> and well i just love it and am so happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;s very cute</li>
            <li> Love the plate holder as used with my Shany plates and the stamper works great.</li>
            <li> I used in my salon and the customers are very satisfied with the results</li>
            <li> and I must say I am in love with it!</li>
            <li> I sure did learn to appreciate it when I forgot my plate holder one day!</li>
            <li> and she adores the cute design!</li>
            <li> I love all the possibilities!</li>
            <li> love playing with this set!</li>
            <li> they work awesome was kinda werid on using it at first</li>
            <li> You can never have too many stampers or scrapers!</li>
            <li> ahh I&#x27;m in love with this!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t as for anything better!</li>
            <li> All the amazing and trendy looks without having to pay salon prices.</li>
            <li> this nail stamper and polish scraper work amazingly, iv&#x27;e had this for a while</li>
            <li> This set is a necessity if you own the plates.</li>
            <li> but I kind of figured it out.</li>
            <li> I WANTED TO TRY THE SHORTER STAMPER FOR MY OWN USE.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend this product to anyone, it is great for grownups and kids!</li>
            <li> there is no point having nice plates.  </li>
            <li> I do my own nails</li>
            <li> The results are spectacular.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my own opinion and doesn&#x27;t effect the function of this</li>
            <li> yes I do my own nails    </li>
            <li> The stamper is nice and didn&#x27;t have issues picking up the design.</li>
            <li> The plate holder is handy, but it slides on the table when you are trying to scrape your plate.</li>
            <li> The scraper is nice, but scratches the plate.</li>
            <li> , Stamper)]]So have fun and Stamp Away!!!</li>
            <li> but once you get the hang of it, it is very cool!</li>

            <li> After purchasing this product, my sister and I have more nail time together! :)</li>
            <li> I love beauty stuff so much!!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s good for people with a lot of free time and patience .</li>
            <li> but I would liked if the scraper Would have worked better.</li>
            <li> The Scrapper you need to find the right side where to scrap..need to try every side once you find it , it works great.</li>
            <li> plate holder is so easy to use!</li>
            <li> LOVE the plate holder idea they came up with, makes it SO much easier, and then you&#x27;re done and you have gorgeous nails to show for it!</li>
            <li> i absolutely love these art designs, and they are so easy to use!</li>
            <li> Great for people who aren&#x27;t very artistic and need a little help creating perfect designs every time.</li>

            <li> I LOVE THIS STAMPER SET</li>
            <li> better then the metal ones for this.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok..</li>
            <li> Probably would have been better off just buying a stamper alone.  </li>
            <li> I love the idea of this product, but have not purchased it yet.</li>
            <li> With this price and the cute design this is a fab favor for a girls birthday party.  </li>
            <li> and i just love it</li>
            <li> When she did them they looked OK.  </li>
            <li> Its an okay item but not up to my standards.</li>
            <li> It makes application a breeze, I love how I no longer have to go spend 15 a week on a manicure.</li>
            <li> so wasn&#x27;t able to test.  </li>
            <li> Love this product..</li>
            <li> Totally love it.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite stamper.</li>
            <li> i dont use the holder or the scraper. :-)</li>
            <li> (as many others here have already stated).  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> Im in love with the type of designing nails</li>
            <li> it okay</li>
            <li> This is so cute</li>
            <li> this is safe</li>
            <li> I recommend this :)</li>
            <li> ACTUALLY, THIS PRODUCT MAKES PERFECT YOUR nails look.</li>
            <li> I LOVE.</li>
            <li> I have done hair and nails for many, many years</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t exactly fit in the image plate holder!</li>
            <li> and i would reccomend it to anyone. :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li> This is soooo cute  </li>
            <li> yes this is safe  </li>
            <li> yes I recommend this :)</li>
            <li> sister very much enjoyed using these for her nails.</li>
            <li> so whenever I want to press the image on my nails--i end up applying more pressure which hurts.  </li>
            <li> Worked well once we got the hang of it. :)</li>
            <li> I ended up ordering Konan and that stamp works much better.  </li>
            <li> Also, a credit card works better as a scraper.</li>
            <li> The stamper is also okay</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The stamper works perfectly, and I like that it is short and</li>
            <li> Love it, love Shany</li>
            <li> so i will be buying a better one</li>
            <li> I love dong my nails so as soon as I saw something that would help me put designs on my nails</li>
            <li> Glad I bought this case for my iPad.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love doing my nails</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure this would work with a better plate set.</li>
            <li> The stamper is ok.</li>
            <li> Most people have one or more laying around.</li>
            <li> I love the stamper</li>
            <li> The stamper was perfect especially for a beginner like me.</li>
            <li> i love doing my own nails and trying out different beautiful designs.</li>
            <li> The stamping thingy is pretty good</li>
            <li> i love the stamper and the holder they really work good .</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t believe that I only paid $4.99 for this great product.</li>
            <li> and it was very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I set this on my vanity and it adds the perfect pink to the rest of my collection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using an old Amazon gift card, and it works great as a scraper.  </li>
            <li> So after much deliberation, i decided to buy the cheeky jumbo plates because of the good reviews.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and the clean up is even easier!</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s so easy to clean!</li>
            <li> Which did not make me very happy, but other then that it works for my purposes</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; handle</li>
            <li> It makes it so easy to stamp your nails.</li>
            <li> This nail art kit is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you use it at a good angle to clear the excess polish from the plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Makes doing your nails at home so easy.</li>
            <li> Great idea, love that you get all 3 things together since some of the locations selling similar things at the mall dont come with the holder, just wish the holder was a lil deeper since the discs pop out easily, i&#x27;ve had one slide around on the holding tool when i was trying to scrape the polish off before using the stamper...</li>
            <li> it fits easily into my hand</li>
            <li> Easy to use and manage.</li>
            <li> Seems to be easy for her to use.</li>
            <li> This product was up to the high standard of all shany products- great quality, fast shipping, and works perfectly!</li>
            <li> This was super easy to use and I love that it has the plate holder.</li>
            <li> This is a very complete set for stamping your nails, very easy for beginners too!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in fine working condition.</li>
            <li> The plate holder and Stamper work fine, but the metal scraper scratched the plate I used it on.  </li>
            <li> This nail art set is so easy to use, and it is really cheap too</li>
            <li> This part is fine, the plates were the issue</li>
            <li> Only took 1 day to get to my house, which was great.</li>
            <li> Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> The stamper doesn&#x27;t pick up anything and the silicon isn&#x27;t secure in the holder.</li>
            <li> but overall it&#x27;s a great product for the price</li>
            <li> This would be great to do your nails 2 different colors and be all cuties before going out on the town.</li>
            <li> the stamper and holder itself was good, but I find the scraper unusable and opted to using an old plastic card.</li>
            <li> Also the stamper creates a bunch of really quick fun easy and cute designs.</li>
            <li> A three generation fun night with the girls was even more fun with a mani/pedi which included the use of this product!</li>
            <li> I was most interested in the tray to hold the plates.</li>
            <li> So much fun to use!  </li>
            <li> So worth the money!</li>
            <li> Fun to use, easy.</li>
            <li> The plate holder keeps the plates in but is not the easiest material to clean nail polish off of.</li>
            <li> You use nail polish remove to clean it</li>
            <li> The plastic melts when it comes in contact with acetone, which makes no sense because you need acetone to clean the plates....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too much to clean it , to put it on etc .</li>
            <li> It does make stamping nail art easy an fun.</li>
            <li> It seems to be very well made, and it cleans up easily with just a little nail polish remover on a Q-tip or cotton bud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $3.99, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The stamper itself is pretty straightforward and easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t super excited when I got this because I had never stamped my nails.</li>
            <li> The scraper scratches the plates, a definite no no in my book; I stopped using it and stated using an old gift card, the material is ideal for swiping, and cleanup is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> The stamper has worked great, but beware if you want to stamp with pink polish.</li>
            <li> My teen loved them.</li>
            <li> The packaging is so adorable and Shany always gets things delivered fast.</li>
            <li> NEVER picks up a full image in one shot.</li>
            <li> and it is much softer and works better.</li>
            <li> The plate holder works ok but found I don&#x27;t really need one.</li>
            <li> For only $4.99 it was a good deal.</li>
            <li> and it came with all the parts which was cool</li>
            <li> While the holder is a good idea, it collects polish around the edges, creating extra cleaning.</li>
            <li> but this is not bad.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this product, it is easy to use and is very affordable.</li>
            <li> so I have been searching for one that is all plastic and wont mess up my beautiful image plates</li>
            <li> Quick Shipping.</li>
            <li> I followed multiple online tutorials and tried to stamp my nails many many times, I just cannot make it work.</li>
            <li> They are cute stamps; especially when you are in a hurry, this is kind of faster you cant really make mistakes.</li>
            <li> I love doing new things to my nails.</li>
            <li> I am new to the nail art world and am enjoying the learning process.</li>
            <li> The plate holder is good, it fits all the plate i have, the stamp is not bad, a little... cheap?</li>
            <li> I think this is the first bundle I&#x27;ve seen with a plate holder, scraper and stamper!  </li>
            <li> Makes life MUCH easier!!</li>
            <li> This is a great little set to have around.</li>
            <li> The plates won&#x27;t stay in the tray, they move too much to be useful when scraping the excess polish off.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be a fun hobby to start.</li>
            <li> The plate holder is kind of a waste for me because I hold my plates on a paper towel on top of a towel.  </li>
            <li> So much fun.</li>
            <li> The scraper scratched my plates, so I switched to an old store rewards card with much better results.</li>
            <li> Image does come out clear and hassle free!  </li>
            <li> The only issue is that the scraper isn&#x27;t made fully of plastic, it comes with a kind of blade to scrap the nail polish and it does scrantches the plates.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses her nail art weekly and comes up with some really fun nails.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses her nail art weekly and comes up with some really fun nails.</li>
            <li> Works well as described and lots of fun.</li>
            <li> IT IS WELL WORTH</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth buying</li>
            <li> Fun.</li>
            <li> I ended up using an old gift card and it works much better.</li>
            <li> Would have been nice if this information had been included in description or on product instructions especially since the stamping plates require pure acetone to clean.  </li>
            <li> Other than that good product.</li>
            <li> I just got this today (along with a set of 25 plates by Shany), and of course, I had to try it out right away even though I haven&#x27;t yet received the polish I ordered for</li>
            <li> To top it off the stamper is no good (even after a good priming)</li>
            <li> Very smart buy.</li>
            <li> They hold the plates perfectly while you design your nails and alleviates the mess from the entire process.</li>
            <li> Great buy, especially for only five dollars!</li>
            <li> This makes a mess free session and it definately looks more professional :)</li>
            <li> tried several of the Shany designs, including 2 with lots of little fine lines, and this stamper works great.  </li>
            <li> I WOULD MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND AND REBUY!!!</li>
            <li> I havent ordered yet but just wanted to share with everyone that if this is going to be the first time they buy a set like this plastic scapers and</li>
            <li> First time using anything like this...  </li>
            <li> the stamp isnt too big but its a perfect size its the only set i seen that works and its for a low price</li>
            <li> At first, i thought that the problem lies in my shany 2012 plates.</li>
            <li> I will admit that I am a first time stamping user.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap toy for kids as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s her technique because this was the first stamper she tried.</li>
            <li> But she eventually bought the double ended Konad stamper which gave her better results.</li>
            <li> I like to use a nail file to buff the stamp before first use.</li>
            <li> The stamper is ok but only has the one size.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> it came in a plastic ziplock more like something you let a teen use</li>
            <li> So adorable with the stability of protecting my pad and being able to carry my personal items such as an id and credit card.</li>
            <li> but this product saves me from so much struggle!</li>
            <li> Works really well easier to use than even expected I get compliments every day on my nails , buy it for sure!</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given it another star if it fit a little better</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t own any other stamping sets</li>
            <li> I have really liked the SHANY nail products, I&#x27;ve never used them before, it takes a little work learning how to do it well, but it&#x27;s fun learning and my niece</li>
            <li> I have tried different scrapers but to be honest I prefer using an old credit card.  </li>
            <li> So amazing that you get all this for such a low price, with this stamper you will never run out of fun</li>
            <li> Came pretty fast.</li>
            <li> The concept is really cool, I bought them for my 7 yr old daughter and they don&#x27;t work on her</li>
            <li> Overall, I recommend you to buy the original ones because its going to work wonderfully than the fake ones like these.</li>
            <li> but thats what makes it easy to use, and hellooooooo its such a BARGAIN!!!</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, the plastic plate holder and plastic stamper melt after coming in contact with pure acetone.</li>
            <li> I cleaned the paint off these items with pure acetone and the image plate holder became sticky and the cotton stuck to it.  </li>
            <li> Its a pretty decent product for what I paid.</li>
            <li> And I almost wish there was a way to move a little plastic or rubber piece over the plate to kind of hold it in place.</li>
            <li> All of shanys nail products work wonders and work very well together.</li>
            <li> too much butm y sister loves messing with it all the time.</li>
            <li> And only six dollars with free shipping.</li>
            <li> i love the stamper it stamps every time and never leaves any empty spots and shipping</li>
            <li> I want to say that straight off.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a bit too much on</li>
            <li> plus I love the pink color.</li>
            <li> I really like the plate holder this kit comes with.</li>
            <li> The piece holds the stamping plates in place very well.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE IT.  </li>
            <li> But the stamping chips off fairly fast, not the stampers fault I know.  </li>
            <li> The metal scraper isn&#x27;t straight</li>
            <li> The scraper scratches my plates and doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> I really like the plate</li>
            <li> With that being said, that is the one item you don&#x27;t really need</li>
            <li> Really, go with konad because this one doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have used a sraper that is fully made of plastic and it is much easier to scrap.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making that decision for me.</li>
            <li> Very convenient with the holder.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the holder thing.</li>
            <li> You certainly will not be able to use this stamp for full size adult nails, perhaps little kid nails</li>
            <li> Now I make sure it stays together with my other nail supplies.</li>
            <li> I would love to try it again, however, after having read some of the reviews, I might try to buy some of Shany&#x27;s other products, since some of the people who tried this product were on the fence about it.</li>
            <li> this worked lot better than some other competitors products.</li>
            <li> Way more affordable than the other nail stampers out there.</li>
            <li> My first time using it, I made the realization that the plate holder and the scraper are more trouble than helpful.</li>
            <li> I just discovered it, so i&#x27;m still a newbie, and i&#x27;m pretty crappy at the stamping so far,</li>
            <li> It was also slightly older.</li>
            <li> I brought this along with their 25 stamping plates for my older sister and</li>
            <li> The holder slips around a little making the stamping process a little more challenging</li>
            <li> Some of the images aren&#x27;t deep enough but other than that it is a good deal</li>
            <li> am trying a new nail design every week&lt;</li>
            <li> I am trying a new nail design every week   </li>
            <li> If I wanted to buy used instead of new I would have.</li>
            <li> I am new to stamping</li>
            <li> I am new to nail stamping</li>
            <li> New to nail stamping</li>
            <li> I am new to stamping and purchased this kit.</li>
            <li> As far as the kit goes, I thought the stamper was decent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad this was extremely inexpensive or else it&#x27;d be going back to Amazon.</li>
            <li> but it deff works once you get use to it and use new polishes nothing to old</li>
            <li> The stamper does its job just fine, but can be a little longer for grown up hands.</li>
            <li> it saves me a huge mess.</li>
            <li> It holds them well and make the design go on smoothly without a mess.</li>
            <li> I originally thought shany cosmetics was only good for their make up, and boy was I completely wrong!</li>
            <li> The holder melts with pure acetone, only used once to test when received.</li>
            <li> I am going to have to warn you that it is a lot sloppier using regular nail polish opposed to a stamping polish, due to their thickness, and if you are using a regular polish be prepared for many retries but other than that stamping is fun!</li>
            <li> I found it to make clear stamps</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clear the excess polish off of the plate as well as plastic does.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Image does come out clear and hassle</li>
            <li> Complete your manicure kit with this set.</li>
            <li> I just use the stamper and an old plastic card.  </li>
            <li> save your money and buy the professional brand  (eg konad) if u want to try stamping.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re completely blurry or just blobs.</li>
            <li> I use an old credit card instead of the scraper this comes with because it might scratch your plates.</li>
            <li> Would recommend using an old plastic card to scrape with.</li>
            <li> For the scraper, I would recommend an old credit card or a plastic scraper over the metal version.</li>
            <li> and it can be replaced with a gift card or old credit</li>
            <li> ended up giving up on the scraper and using an old plastic credit card for a scraper.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ended up pitching the scraper and just using an old credit card.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even attempt to use the scraper and opted for an old gift card instead.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old loves this set and the ones given to her with it.  </li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been a dream</li>
            <li> /&gt;Right now I use this stamper with an old health card as my scraper</li>
            <li> I have been using an old credit card.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 13 year old sister-in-law</li>
            <li> I find it easiest to set the plate on a double layered paper towel and scrape the excess polish straight off the plate to the towel.</li>
            <li> I find it easiest to use an old credit card or gift card.</li>
            <li> The scraper ended up scratching my plates, so instead of the scraper now i use an old gift card</li>
            <li> , it holds all the round plates I have from various maker, and it cuts down on the excess polish getting everywhere, and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I am still looking into it, but so far it seems like a nifty little product that helps out beginners and experts alike to achieve flawless nail designs without all the hard and messy work.</li>
            <li> The price is very good which makes it less scary to try out.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the plate holder could hold the plate in better.</li>
            <li> stamper actually works really well for me compared to another I got from Hong Kong recently.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s way too small to do much more than transfer individual images (when it occasionally allows a transfer to happen).</li>
            <li> My 21 year old is a nail polish addict and really loves this tool...especially since she changes her nail polish on average, every 2 days</li>
            <li> they work ok on mine not great.</li>
            <li> Their nail supplies and products work just as great if not better than other brands I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> There is another brand that has a rubber-type holder that really stays put while you are scraping, so I prefer the other one.</li>
            <li> it was hard for me to use because I had to clean it after every use</li>
            <li> , sure they made it cute with cut out hearts, and in a hot pink plastic, but no it is horrible you will be left with sloppy to non transferable designs every time you run the scrapper over a plate, just use an old plastic credit card, it works so much better</li>
            <li> she did her first set within an hour of receiving this and has since sent me pictures of new designs at least once a week.  </li>
            <li> In itself, its also a little small, I know you turn the plate and scrape downwards, but I want to be able to scrape sideways too.</li>
            <li> If there is a problem it is usually user error by not using the right polish ir not cleaning the stamper off in between stamps.</li>
            <li> Takes a  little practice but he was able to do her nails after just a few tries.  </li>
            <li> No instructions, just a blank stamper, a piece of flat plastic with a hole in it (no hearts) and that scraper thing.</li>
            <li> And the plate holder only works for small images and I was doing whole nail images.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly, but product was old and unable to be used.  </li>
            <li> Negative thing first - the scraper does scratch the plate and doesn&#x27;t scrape away the nail polish like it should.</li>
            <li> A little better but still giving poor impressions.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve spent countless hours watching videos and reading up on the techniques.</li>
            <li> but it was honestly a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little on the smaller side, I would have almost preferred a longer handle or a double sided one, but that doesn&#x27;t effect the function of the product.</li>
            <li> Stamp rubber was cracked and dry.</li>
            <li> I love this nail art plates but Konad is very expensive</li>
            <li> The stamper itself was decent but plate holder is too shallow</li>
            <li> It is very similar to KONAD and the price is almost half.  </li>
            <li> i just got mine and is not the same one, is not so cute at the picture here, mine doesnt have the heart shapes :(</li>
            <li> and i like it because it doesn&#x27;t create a big mess.</li>
            <li> Seemed to have trouble on larger domed nails.  </li>
            <li> , remember you may need to rough up the stamper part with a nail file to help the design to adhere</li>
            <li> It is much harder than it looks.  </li>
            <li> I loveeee the color pink and the stamp press is pink</li>
            <li> The scraper is harder to work than what I expected.</li>
            <li> I removed the blue covering and spent 3 hours trying to get it to work, but no luck; the image plate holder was also missing out of my order.</li>
            <li> Used a dark blue and black to stamp.  </li>
            <li> Does not work, plain and simple.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if other nail polish removers will work without damaging.  </li>
            <li> Use this kit with the metal plates to create endless nail looks.  </li>
            <li> plate holder is different than what is in the picture, and the scraper is small and works</li>
            <li> Other Han tat</li>
            <li> I do not care for the little holder and personally think it&#x27;s a waste of material.  </li>
            <li> Tossed the plate holder and scraper due to the melting plastic.., they were sticky and not worth the money paid....</li>
            <li> thats only complaint</li>
            <li> you put much pressure on it which makes it rather useless.</li>
            <li> The stamper and plates are a joke - the imprints are bad and doesn&#x27;t give a clean image.</li>
            <li> The scraper is not very strong.</li>
            <li> Also, the metal scraper scratches the plates &amp; she uses a cut in half credit card for scraping, which does not scratch her plates.</li>
            <li> It saves a mess and holds your plate into place for a neater application.  </li>
            <li> i recieved only the scraper and the image plate which is not fair</li>
            <li> The plate holder keeps a mess from happening.</li>
            <li> but i know i&#x27;ll become a pro with a little</li>
            <li> Since it flexes, you get a little tension</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my round stamping plates in place....</li>
            <li> waste of money doesnt even work when trying to transfer stamp to nails</li>
            <li> Plates do not fit in round holder.  </li>
            <li> but this sounds like a waste of money</li>
            <li> Wasted money</li>
            <li> I watched a few YT vids and thought I could handle this.  </li>
            <li> The holder does not hold the plate firmly.</li>
            <li> Im a sucker for anything that is pink and has hearts!</li>
            <li> it was a little frustrating because it kept wiggling around in the center</li>
            <li> This product does not look like the picture, it has no hearts and too small.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> cause her nails are too small.</li>
            <li> The scraper doesn&#x27;t work very well and the holding plate is a weird texture and makes it difficult to remove the polish.</li>
            <li> But its too small and too hard.</li>
            <li> The stamper works absolutely fine, but the scraper scrapes the plates (nasty).</li>
            <li> and/or it does not show up on the stamper hardly at all.</li>
            <li> Could not see image and hardly anything even showed up on nail.  </li>
            <li> it makes it bumpy and hard to get the plate out.</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time with the stamp.</li>
            <li> How hard would that be for them?</li>
            <li> The scraper sucks.</li>
            <li> The stamper is pink so it may be difficult to see where the polish is.</li>
            <li> I finally realised that the rubber used to make this stamper is too HARD which makes it very difficult to pick up the image.</li>
            <li> , it bad does its job only complaint would be</li>
            <li> The metal design forms (molds) are too shallow.</li>
            <li> A little difficult to get the hang of, but hang to keep polish from building up on it</li>
            <li> it not only leaves a really nasty and horrible scratches on your nice plates, but it also dosent do its job at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m not good at nail art at all...</li>
            <li> does not work, stamper is too stiff and scraper is useless.</li>
            <li> :/ Tired of people/companies misrepresting!</li>
            <li> It held the stamp plate well, but its a little awkward to work with.</li>
            <li> I had no clue it was so difficult, at least for me, to do without it.</li>
            <li> All around, not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> They are poor quality and this didn&#x27;t even work.  </li>
            <li> The scraper leaves streaks across the plate and the plate holder is rather unnecessary to the process-</li>
            <li> and it hasen&#x27;t broken or anything</li>
            <li> It might be user error but every time I try to use it, I leaves streaks of polish behind.</li>
            <li> The quality difference is dramatic.  </li>
            <li> The plate is useless, and the metal scraper has scratched my plates.  </li>
            <li> The stamper also is questionable.  </li>
            <li> It is silly trying to use this because it never picks up images.</li>
            <li> The scraper fails to evenly scrape off excess polish.  </li>
            <li> I am addicted!</li>
            <li> Ill give it 3 stars because everything seems to be here</li>
            <li> The scraper is metal and will scratch your plates, and I find the holder useless honestly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so difficult to use it.</li>
            <li> I feel like the plate holder is just something else to get dirty</li>
            <li> The stamper itself had no dents or crazy spirals  </li>
            <li> She is addicted!!</li>
            <li> def fail..:(</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> You will never get bored when you combine this with Shany&#x27;s plate selection!</li>
            <li> very lame...</li>
            <li> and I have never had a bad experience with shany products.</li>
            <li> I bought a plate, and the polish and started to do a stamp and the scraper scratched the plate so badly that you could no longer pull the pattern off.</li>
            <li> , the scraper is REALLY BAD.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t reccomend this :(</li>
            <li> The stamper works but the base isn&#x27;t made for use with nail polish remover and the scraper scratches up the plates.</li>
            <li> Buen producto trae el raspador, el sello y la base para las placas, viene en</li>
            <li> FALSE ADVERTISING !!!!</li>
            <li> The product is not what the picture shows and the scraper scratched my plate horribly.</li>
            <li> I hated stamping plates until I found this one!</li>
            <li> the reason i give four and not five is because the scraper is terrible but the stamper is AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!</li>
            <li> This was the worst purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> Horrible buy, did not work at all</li>
            <li> I hate it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not giving this 5 stars, because the scraper is awful</li>
            <li> its a shame that the scraper is horrible.</li>
            <li> but the scraper is awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STAMPER SET AND I LOVE THE PLATE HOLDER!! IT HOLDS THE PLATES IN PLACE AND IS EASY TO CLEAN!! ALL THE PRODUCTS IS VERY EASY TO CLEAN AND MANAGE!! I WOULD MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND AND REBUY!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the plates and polish from Shany.  This is a joke. Plates not deep enough indentation for figures and/or it does not show up on the stamper hardly at all. when stamped on nail, nothing shows up.  I painted my nails white so I could see the images.  Used a dark blue and black to stamp.  Didn&#x27;t work. Could not see image and hardly anything even showed up on nail.  I thought this was the product on info commercial for only $10 which included plates. Not the same product though it looks the same.</li>
            <li> I got this for my god daughter and she loved it! She is addicted!! Everywhere she goes she carries it around! Very cute and compact!!</li>
            <li> All of shanys nail products work wonders and work very well together. This is perfect for the design plates. It holds them well and make the design go on smoothly without a mess.</li>
            <li> Only took 1 day to get to my house, which was great. But the product looks nothing like the picture. There is no hearts on it which was the soul purpose I chose this one. :/ Tired of people/companies misrepresting!</li>
            <li> The product is not what the picture shows and the scraper scratched my plate horribly. A bit disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> Works great. My teen loved them. Came pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Fun to use, easy. I like it.</li>
            <li> 5 bucks for the entire set! What a great price! My daughter loves to experiment with her nails, and I could get her this and some plates and polish and not break the bank!</li>
            <li> Go try to find this stamper kit cheaper anywhere else. Not happening. This is a great price, and I love the fact that it comes with a platform to hold your plates so they don&#x27;t slip around and helps prevent a lot of messes!</li>
            <li> I purchased this stamping set including the plates and I must say I am in love with it! I always get compliments on my manicure since I&#x27;m always changing colors and designs. The stamper is easy to use, but it does take some practice to make the perfect design, but DON&#x27;T give up, it took me awhile but now I got the hang of it. The scraper does the job well when it comes to taking off the excess nail polish off the plate and the holder holds my plate snuggly. I&#x27;m highly impressed. Don&#x27;t hesitate on this purchase ladies and gentlemen!</li>
            <li> I hated stamping plates until I found this one! My designs would always come out looking like a blotch but this stamping set makes my designs look hand painted!</li>
            <li> This is a great starter set for nail art. I myself am not a big fan of this set because I don&#x27;t have patience to do nail art too much butm y sister loves messing with it all the time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my pre-teen daughter and she adores it. She uses it on her friends when they come over and they&#x27;re always saying to here \\&quot;can you paint my nails with a design\\&quot; lol! It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all!</li>
            <li> I have bought a nail stamping kit that comes with the scrapper being metel in the end. The metal caused my plates to sratch the designs so I have been searching for one that is all plastic and wont mess up my beautiful image plates this seems like the one. I havent ordered yet but just wanted to share with everyone that if this is going to be the first time they buy a set like this plastic scapers and better then the metal ones for this.</li>
            <li> This set is a necessity if you own the plates. I found it to make clear stamps and it was very easy to clean. I set this on my vanity and it adds the perfect pink to the rest of my collection.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good that you get all three parts of a set instead of buying each separately. And only six dollars with free shipping. Works well and image plates fit perfectly in the holder.</li>
            <li> the reason i give four and not five is because the scraper is terrible but the stamper is AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG! i love the stamper it stamps every time and never leaves any empty spots and shipping was good. i recomend this stamper with a konad scraper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newbie to nail stamping. I want to say that straight off. However, I&#x27;ve spent countless hours watching videos and reading up on the techniques. I have ordered a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; stamper from a non-Amazon seller, but in the meantime I purchased this set while I waited for that stamper to get to me. I was most interested in the tray to hold the plates. What a waste of money. The plates won&#x27;t stay in the tray, they move too much to be useful when scraping the excess polish off. To top it off the stamper is no good (even after a good priming) I think it&#x27;s a bit too much on the &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; side and the images don&#x27;t like to transfer off of it to the nails. Also, it&#x27;s way too small to do much more than transfer individual images (when it occasionally allows a transfer to happen). You certainly will not be able to use this stamp for full size adult nails, perhaps little kid nails but that&#x27;s about it. I&#x27;m just glad this was extremely inexpensive or else it&#x27;d be going back to Amazon.</li>
            <li> First time using anything like this...  It didn&#x27;t come with instructions but I kind of figured it out. lol Im not so good at doing stuff like this.  I thought it might be a fun hobby to start.</li>
            <li> Nail Stamping is all the rage now. Complete your manicure kit with this set. Can be also used on toenails. Easy to use &amp; handle plus I love the pink color. Would be a great gift for any nail artist.</li>
            <li> This is a must have if your going to use stencils on your nails!! It is so easy to use and the clean up is even easier!</li>
            <li> Is smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> I really like the plate holder this kit comes with. It saves a mess and holds your plate into place for a neater application.  I recommend this to anyone. I love it!!    Check out my review on it!    [...]</li>
            <li> This is a great kit if you are into nail stamping.  I just discovered it, so i&#x27;m still a newbie, and i&#x27;m pretty crappy at the stamping so far, but i know i&#x27;ll become a pro with a little practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing i wish were different, is that the hearts were actually on the scraper and plate holder (as shown in the picture).  Mine was solid, but i can&#x27;t complain about aesthetic things.  The product works well and i&#x27;m very happy with the product.  Nail Polish doesnt wipe off too well (but i&#x27;m also using nail PAINT, which lasts longer) so that may be it, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome awesome price for this, though.  If you want to get into nail stamping, this is a great product to get.  I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok.. does what it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work very good at all.. can never get it to transfer image to make them look good.. def fail..:(</li>
            <li> Probably would have been better off just buying a stamper alone.  The plate is useless, and the metal scraper has scratched my plates.  I just use the stamper and an old plastic card.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this product, but have not purchased it yet. I am still looking into it, but so far it seems like a nifty little product that helps out beginners and experts alike to achieve flawless nail designs without all the hard and messy work. Great for people who aren&#x27;t very artistic and need a little help creating perfect designs every time.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t super excited when I got this because I had never stamped my nails. I thought all nail stamping stuff came with a plate holder. I sure did learn to appreciate it when I forgot my plate holder one day! It makes it so easy to stamp your nails. I had no clue it was so difficult, at least for me, to do without it. Now I make sure it stays together with my other nail supplies. Definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> The piece holds the stamping plates in place very well. The scraper works wonderfully. The stamper transfers the art just like it should. Great set, great value!</li>
            <li> With this price and the cute design this is a fab favor for a girls birthday party.  The packaging is so adorable and Shany always gets things delivered fast.</li>
            <li> This set goes hand in hand with the nail plates also sold by shany. They hold the plates perfectly while you design your nails and alleviates the mess from the entire process. I originally thought shany cosmetics was only good for their make up, and boy was I completely wrong! Their nail supplies and products work just as great if not better than other brands I have tried in the past. Great buy, especially for only five dollars!</li>
            <li> The stamper does its job just fine, but can be a little longer for grown up hands. The plate holder keeps the plates in but is not the easiest material to clean nail polish off of. The scraper scratches the plates, a definite no no in my book; I stopped using it and stated using an old gift card, the material is ideal for swiping, and cleanup is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I ORERED THIS 3 PIECE SHANY STAMPING NAIL ART SET.  (NAIL ART IMAGE PLATE HOLDER, SCRAPER AND STAMPER.) I WANTED TO TRY THE SHORTER STAMPER FOR MY OWN USE.  I REALLY LIKE IT.  I WILL RATE THIS SET WITH 5 STARS.</li>
            <li> i got this set in the mail today and i just love it the stamp isnt too big but its a perfect size its the only set i seen that works and its for a low price and well i just love it and am so happy with it.</li>
            <li> i recieved only the scraper and the image plate which is not fair at all i paid for three items and only got ,who did the packaging must have forgoten it,please give me a feedbach because i cannot use it without the stamp</li>
            <li> This is a very complete set for stamping your nails, very easy for beginners too!  So many plates with so many choices of decos!  Quick Shipping. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have this product, and it&#x27;s been years sine I&#x27;ve tried nail art.  I would love to try it again, however, after having read some of the reviews, I might try to buy some of Shany&#x27;s other products, since some of the people who tried this product were on the fence about it.</li>
            <li> This product leaves a lot to be desired for</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a niece.  She was always trying do do nail art on her nails.  She loved it.  She did her mothers and my nails.  When she did them they looked OK.  But the stamping chips off fairly fast, not the stampers fault I know.  The stamper worked well on smaller nails.  Seemed to have trouble on larger domed nails.  She is happy with it, so it was a good buy.  Linda W</li>
            <li> Okay so this goes perfect with \\&quot;SHANY 2012 Nail Art Polish Stamp Manicure Image Plates set of 25pcs w/ Instruction \\&quot;!! It is an essential part of your beauty product collection! I love beauty stuff so much!!!!! This makes a mess free session and it definately looks more professional :)</li>
            <li> The applier and metal patterns are junk! Won&#x27;t work! Save yourself headache and don&#x27;t buy! The metal design forms (molds) are too shallow. The dabber won&#x27;t grab the nail polish. I&#x27;d just like my money back!</li>
            <li> The plate holder is the best part of this set! I bought this for my niece and she adores the cute design! plus it&#x27;s so easy to clean!</li>
            <li> LOVE the plate holder idea they came up with, makes it SO much easier, and then you&#x27;re done and you have gorgeous nails to show for it! Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Daughter uses it. At times there will be flaws but I assume it&#x27;s how she does it &amp; still need to master technique.</li>
            <li> My 21 year old is a nail polish addict and really loves this tool...especially since she changes her nail polish on average, every 2 days</li>
            <li> Its an okay item but not up to my standards. If you&#x27;ve never tried anything like this, this will be a good investment because some of the others that I&#x27;ve purchased are costly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;s very cute and I have never had a bad experience with shany products. The price is very good which makes it less scary to try out.</li>
            <li> I have tried different scrapers but to be honest I prefer using an old credit card.  It seems to work best for my taste.  The stamper is good.  File it with a nail file first to take away the slick surface.  The plate holder is kind of a waste for me because I hold my plates on a paper towel on top of a towel.  I feel like the plate holder is just something else to get dirty so I never use mine.</li>
            <li> This product does not look like the picture, it has no hearts and too small. I haven&#x27;t used it for stamping yet, i just got it today. So i will write another review when i try it out. This company need to change the picture it has no hearts !!! FALSE ADVERTISING !!!! I ALSO ORDERED THE  MOYOU NAIL ART IMAGE PLATE A52. THEY TOOK THE FUNDS OUT OF MY ACCOUNT THEN DAYS LATER SAID THE ITEM WAS OUT OF STOCK ! SO UNPROFESSIONAL ! So I ORDERED THE A47 PLATE, HAVEN&#x27;T RECEIVED IT YET.</li>
            <li> not as good as konad but it will do it. the stamper tool somehow doesnt pick up the nail art stamp good as konad.</li>
            <li> If your wanting to start out doing nail art then you should definitley think about getting this kit! Its quite basic but thats what makes it easy to use, and hellooooooo its such a BARGAIN!!!</li>
            <li> Update!  10/1/12  I LOVE THESE!! It comes in sooo handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This plate holder is so easy to use! It makes application a breeze, I love how I no longer have to go spend 15 a week on a manicure. I love all the possibilities!</li>
            <li> This is a great little set to have around. Stamp works great, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the scraper. Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> does not work, stamper is too stiff and scraper is useless. save your money and buy the professional brand  (eg konad) if u want to try stamping.</li>
            <li> as written by my wife &amp;#34;Would have given this item no stars if I could.  This is a waste of money.  The holder melts with pure acetone, only used once to test when received. Don&#x27;t know if other nail polish removers will work without damaging.  Would have been nice if this information had been included in description or on product instructions especially since the stamping plates require pure acetone to clean.  The stamper also is questionable.  Don&#x27;t use metal scrapers on my plates so wasn&#x27;t able to test.  I knew I should have stuck with Konad!  Buyer beware!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product.. It keeps my round stamping plates in place.... Sooo recommend...</li>
            <li> Not for me. I don&#x27;t have the time, though. I bought them as gifts, too, and I do not see them being used, not after the newness wore off. Sorry!</li>
            <li> This was the worst purchase I&#x27;ve ever made. The shapes don&#x27;t stay. They&#x27;re completely blurry or just blobs.</li>
            <li> This was obviously a used stamping set. There was still polish on the stamper and what not. It was also slightly older. I cleaned off the stamper and tossed the scraper (using a gift card to scrape). It&#x27;s in fine working condition. Not enough of a big deal to send it back. It works to stamp.</li>
            <li> Does not work, plain and simple.  I bought this along with the SHANY plates, and it just doesn&#x27;t work.  The metal scraper isn&#x27;t straight so it doesn&#x27;t scrape all the paint off, and the stamp doesn&#x27;t pick up the paint.  All around, not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Works really good, no problems stamping the patterns and applying it on my nails. Good product and good price... Nice!</li>
            <li> This product was up to the high standard of all shany products- great quality, fast shipping, and works perfectly! I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Horrible buy, did not work at all</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it was all in one and I wanted the plate holder but the scraper is uneven which is a real pain and the stamper NEVER picks up a full image in one shot. I hate it! Already ordered the pueen one.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get the desired results</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, the plastic plate holder and plastic stamper melt after coming in contact with pure acetone. The stamper did not pick up or transfer the images from different plates (bundle monster plates). For only $5, I thought I would give it a try but it was honestly a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> very lame...waste of money doesnt even work when trying to transfer stamp to nails it doesnt come out on nails if it does its in pieces!</li>
            <li> Metal scraper scratches plates.  Plates do not fit in round holder.  Stamper wears off when cleaned with polish remover.</li>
            <li> I will never buy another SHANY product.  They are poor quality and this didn&#x27;t even work.  I bought a plate, and the polish and started to do a stamp and the scraper scratched the plate so badly that you could no longer pull the pattern off.</li>
            <li> So much fun to use!  Totally love it.</li>
            <li> The stamper itself was decent but plate holder is too shallow so the stamping plates slide around. I use an old credit card instead of the scraper this comes with because it might scratch your plates.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite stamper. i dont use the holder or the scraper. :-)</li>
            <li> I wish there had been instructions with it. NOTE don&#x27;t get nail polish remover on the plate holder it makes it bumpy and hard to get the plate out. But no problems items came just as discribed.</li>
            <li> The plate holder and Stamper work fine, but the metal scraper scratched the plate I used it on.  Would recommend using an old plastic card to scrape with.</li>
            <li> I just got this today (along with a set of 25 plates by Shany), and of course, I had to try it out right away even though I haven&#x27;t yet received the polish I ordered for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not giving this 5 stars, because the scraper is awful (as many others here have already stated).  I&#x27;m using an old Amazon gift card, and it works great as a scraper.  I do not care for the little holder and personally think it&#x27;s a waste of material.  I just set my plates on a paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried several of the Shany designs, including 2 with lots of little fine lines, and this stamper works great.  It seems to be very well made, and it cleans up easily with just a little nail polish remover on a Q-tip or cotton bud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $3.99, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The stamper itself is pretty straightforward and easy to clean and use. For the scraper, I would recommend an old credit card or a plastic scraper over the metal version. It doesn&#x27;t clear the excess polish off of the plate as well as plastic does.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all! The scraper scratches my plates and doesn&#x27;t really work. The plate holder melts with acetone and the plates slip out of it. The stamper doesn&#x27;t pick up anything and the silicon isn&#x27;t secure in the holder. The silicon also crumbles and bits fall out. Waste of money! Stick with Konad.</li>
            <li> All the amazing and trendy looks without having to pay salon prices. So amazing that you get all this for such a low price, with this stamper you will never run out of fun designs!![[ASIN:B005R3UYEW Shany Stamping Nail Art Set (Nail Art Image Plate Holder, Scraper, Stamper)]]So have fun and Stamp Away!!!</li>
            <li> This nail art set is so easy to use, and it is really cheap too but the quality is great. I love it</li>
            <li> Use this kit with the metal plates to create endless nail looks.  You will never get bored when you combine this with Shany&#x27;s plate selection!</li>
            <li> i love it. it come with a holder that you can use and i like it because it doesn&#x27;t create a big mess. everyone should go and get it.</li>
            <li> This product is a must have for the nail design stencils. the applicator works really good on my nails! Im in love with the type of designing nails</li>
            <li> wont recommend them , hassel to put on. can do without them</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this product, it is easy to use and is very affordable. I really like the plate it saves me a huge mess. Also the stamper creates a bunch of really quick fun easy and cute designs. I really recommend this product to anyone, it is great for grownups and kids!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, and she absolutely loved it!  She changes her nails constantly and is having a ball doing it!  She evens does my nails!! So much fun.</li>
            <li> The plate holder is good, it fits all the plate i have, the stamp is not bad, a little... cheap? you can pull off the rubber and is kinda...meh.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, the scraper is REALLY BAD. it not only leaves a really nasty and horrible scratches on your nice plates, but it also dosent do its job at all.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to get a proper scraper cause without it there is no point having nice plates.  Though, for the price it okay because you get to have two things extra. its a shame that the scraper is horrible.</li>
            <li> This is so cute&lt;br /&gt;Image does come out clear and hassle free!&lt;br /&gt;I am trying a new nail design every week&lt;br /&gt;I luv it :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yes I do my own nails&lt;br /&gt;yes this is safe&lt;br /&gt;yes I recommend this :)</li>
            <li> Im a sucker for anything that is pink and has hearts! This is so cute and Shany also has so many plates you can buy for this!</li>
            <li> ACTUALLY, THIS PRODUCT MAKES PERFECT YOUR nails look. NEVER SEEN A PRODUCT WAS SO GOOD, SO EASY AND BEAUTIFUL RESULTS. I LOVE.</li>
            <li> This nail art kit is so easy to use.The results are spectacular.I love doing new things to my nails.This gets me the results I want.Good quality,good product.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.  It is very similar to KONAD and the price is almost half.  Loved the quality of it.</li>
            <li> Negative thing first - the scraper does scratch the plate and doesn&#x27;t scrape away the nail polish like it should. With that being said, that is the one item you don&#x27;t really need and it can be replaced with a gift card or old credit card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive -&lt;br /&gt;The stamper works great, it&#x27;s a little on the smaller side, I would have almost preferred a longer handle or a double sided one, but that doesn&#x27;t effect the function of the product. You use nail polish remove to clean it and it&#x27;s good and it does work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t own any other stamping sets, I don&#x27;t know if the image plate holder is the same size as all others. In itself, its also a little small, I know you turn the plate and scrape downwards, but I want to be able to scrape sideways too. And I almost wish there was a way to move a little plastic or rubber piece over the plate to kind of hold it in place. That&#x27;s my own opinion and doesn&#x27;t effect the function of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great value. I don&#x27;t mind throwing away the scraper for this price. I would prefer one that actually worked and didn&#x27;t scrape my plate...but anything scrapes this plates....</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time with the stamp. It wouldnt keep the paint designs on it. I wanted to do someones nails with it. So when I put it on there nail. None of it would come off.</li>
            <li> the stamper and holder itself was good, but I find the scraper unusable and opted to using an old plastic card. The scraper is metal and scratches the plates. Which did not make me very happy, but other then that it works for my purposes</li>
            <li> Works really well easier to use than even expected I get compliments every day on my nails , buy it for sure!</li>
            <li> The concept is really cool, I bought them for my 7 yr old daughter and they don&#x27;t work on her cause her nails are too small. I have done hair and nails for many, many years they work ok on mine not great. Wouldn&#x27;t reccomend this :(</li>
            <li> I think this is the first bundle I&#x27;ve seen with a plate holder, scraper and stamper!  I was looking forward to the heart things lol it didn&#x27;t have it. I got the shiny image plates and this stamper, plate holder and my plates didn&#x27;t exactly fit in the image plate holder! it was a little frustrating because it kept wiggling around in the center but I think it&#x27;s manageable. I would&#x27;ve given it another star if it fit a little better but it&#x27;s not so bad. The scraper seems to work as well as the stamper, I haven&#x27;t had a problem yet.. hopefully I don&#x27;t have a problem with it later.</li>
            <li> I purchased this plate holder and stamper along with a set of 25 plates.&lt;br /&gt;The plate holder is different than what is in the picture, and the scraper is small and works poorly.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up giving up on the scraper and using an old plastic credit card for a scraper.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that if you are going to purchase the stamp art kit, just get the stamper and save yourself some $$.</li>
            <li> I just bought a konad one because this one doesn&#x27;t work 9/10 times. It is silly trying to use this because it never picks up images. The scraper doesn&#x27;t work very well and the holding plate is a weird texture and makes it difficult to remove the polish. Really, go with konad because this one doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have really liked the SHANY nail products, I&#x27;ve never used them before, it takes a little work learning how to do it well, but it&#x27;s fun learning and my niece and I have a great time playing with them.</li>
            <li> Love the plate holder as used with my Shany plates and the stamper works great. The scraper scratched my plates, so I switched to an old store rewards card with much better results.</li>
            <li> The plate holder keeps a mess from happening. This kit is awsome and i would reccomend it to anyone. :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li> I followed multiple online tutorials and tried to stamp my nails many many times, I just cannot make it work. Maybe its a user error but this sounds like a waste of money</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this set. The scraper leaves streaks across the plate and the plate holder is rather unnecessary to the process- just put it on a paper towel.</li>
            <li> The stamper, scraper, and disc holder all worked well.  My only complaint is that the plate holder could hold the plate in better.</li>
            <li> The plastic melts when it comes in contact with acetone, which makes no sense because you need acetone to clean the plates.... The handle to the stamper started getting sticky from melting plastic.... Tossed the plate holder and scraper due to the melting plastic.., they were sticky and not worth the money paid....</li>
            <li> Bought it to try but realized I don&#x27;t have time to waist . It&#x27;s too much to clean it , to put it on etc . The images come not to visible and if you try to press it again it would smudge it .&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s good for people with a lot of free time and patience .</li>
            <li> Its a pretty decent product for what I paid. Some of the images aren&#x27;t deep enough but other than that it is a good deal</li>
            <li> This is soooo cute  Image does come out clear and hassle free!  I am trying a new nail design every week   I luv it :D  yes I do my own nails    yes this is safe  yes I recommend this :)</li>
            <li> I cleaned the paint off these items with pure acetone and the image plate holder became sticky and the cotton stuck to it.  The stamper and the scraper work great.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions, even ordered stamping polish, but the stamp wouldn&#x27;t pick up the stencil design. I removed the blue covering and spent 3 hours trying to get it to work, but no luck; the image plate holder was also missing out of my order.</li>
            <li> It is a great bundle, definetly a must have. It does make stamping nail art easy an fun. The only issue is that the scraper isn&#x27;t made fully of plastic, it comes with a kind of blade to scrap the nail polish and it does scrantches the plates. I have used a sraper that is fully made of plastic and it is much easier to scrap. Other than that good product.</li>
            <li> Hello&lt;br /&gt;My sister very much enjoyed using these for her nails. They are cute stamps; especially when you are in a hurry, this is kind of faster you cant really make mistakes.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses her nail art weekly and comes up with some really fun nails. My daughter uses her nail art weekly and comes up with some really fun nails.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly, but product was old and unable to be used.  Stamp rubber was cracked and dry.</li>
            <li> i bought it cos it was the cheapest that i could find. i only use the stamper cos the scrapper will scratch my nail plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: I have the stamper for about 2 months now. The stamper does not pick up any of the images on my plates. At first, i thought that the problem lies in my shany 2012 plates. So after much deliberation, i decided to buy the cheeky jumbo plates because of the good reviews. But, the stamper still does not pick up any of the image. I finally realised that the rubber used to make this stamper is too HARD which makes it very difficult to pick up the image. Moreover, the handle is too short so whenever I want to press the image on my nails--i end up applying more pressure which hurts.  I gave up and bought the longer konad double end stamper and it is much softer and works better.</li>
            <li> I will admit that I am a first time stamping user. The thing that I didn&#x27;t like about this product though is that the plate holder and the scraper stain with nail polish once it dries. The stamper is nice and didn&#x27;t have issues picking up the design.</li>
            <li> I love this nail art plates but Konad is very expensive so I decided to try this shany brand the plates are spectacular and the stamping set is perfect I used in my salon and the customers are very satisfied with the results</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my konad brand scraper and stamper.  The quality difference is dramatic.  The scraper fails to evenly scrape off excess polish.  I&#x27;ve ended up pitching the scraper and just using an old credit card.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we wanted. This works perfectly, we&#x27;ve been doing nails for a couple years now and this worked lot better than some other competitors products.</li>
            <li> This item arrived obviously used and that&#x27;s crappy. If I wanted to buy used instead of new I would have. Thanks for making that decision for me. As far as the kit goes, I thought the stamper was decent. Not all of the image transfers but you get what you pay for, I guess. I didn&#x27;t even attempt to use the scraper and opted for an old gift card instead. And the plate holder only works for small images and I was doing whole nail images.</li>
            <li> I cannot get it to make good quality stamps for the life of me. Even tried priming it with a nail file and nail polish remover. A little better but still giving poor impressions.</li>
            <li> A three generation fun night with the girls was even more fun with a mani/pedi which included the use of this product! Worked well once we got the hang of it. :)</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful and inexpensive nail stamping set.  I use it often and have not had any problems with the products.  Sturdy plastic construction and the blade to scrape over the plates is perfect.  Just make sure you use it at a good angle to clear the excess polish from the plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, remember you may need to rough up the stamper part with a nail file to help the design to adhere best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love playing with this set!</li>
            <li> i just got mine and is not the same one, is not so cute at the picture here, mine doesnt have the heart shapes :(</li>
            <li> I could not get the stamp to pick up the polish.  I ended up ordering Konan and that stamp works much better.  Also, a credit card works better as a scraper.</li>
            <li> The stamper works but the base isn&#x27;t made for use with nail polish remover and the scraper scratches up the plates. Good for a starter set but meh for anyone wanting to keep their plates useable.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get to work! Wasted money</li>
            <li> I watched a few YT vids and thought I could handle this.  It is much harder than it looks.  The holder does not hold the plate firmly. The scraper scratches the plates.  It&#x27;s a cheap toy for kids as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use. Of course practice makes perfect but overall it&#x27;s a great product for the price</li>
            <li> Works well as described and lots of fun.</li>
            <li> Nice, good price! I am addicted!</li>
            <li> Way more affordable than the other nail stampers out there. Makes doing your nails at home so easy. I want to do my nails all the time with this.</li>
            <li> they work awesome was kinda werid on using it at first but it deff works once you get use to it and use new polishes nothing to old</li>
            <li> My wife was not too happy with this stamper. Maybe it&#x27;s her technique because this was the first stamper she tried. But she eventually bought the double ended Konad stamper which gave her better results. She only uses the plate holder from this set. Also, the metal scraper scratches the plates &amp; she uses a cut in half credit card for scraping, which does not scratch her plates.</li>
            <li> SHANY needs to make the scraper from plastic only so that it does not damage the plates! How hard would that be for them? I am new to stamping so I used these tools but after scratching my plates I looked on youtube and saw that everyone was using credit cards/gift cards instead of this scraper in order to protect their plates. I wish I had realized this before I scratched my plate up!</li>
            <li> I am new to nail stamping so I thought  I would just get a bargain priced set, so I could see what all this nail stamping fuss was about. So I purchased the Shany Stamping kit the plate holder is wonderful, it holds all the round plates I have from various maker, and it cuts down on the excess polish getting everywhere, and is easy to clean. The stamper is also okay, I just wish it was double ended with a smaller end on it like some of the more expensive stampers I have seen but for trial and error purposes it works great. But the scrapper, just toss it when you get the kit, sure they made it cute with cut out hearts, and in a hot pink plastic, but no it is horrible you will be left with sloppy to non transferable designs every time you run the scrapper over a plate, just use an old plastic credit card, it works so much better and I get perfect results. I am going to have to warn you that it is a lot sloppier using regular nail polish opposed to a stamping polish, due to their thickness, and if you are using a regular polish be prepared for many retries but other than that stamping is fun!</li>
            <li> Great idea, love that you get all 3 things together since some of the locations selling similar things at the mall dont come with the holder, just wish the holder was a lil deeper since the discs pop out easily, i&#x27;ve had one slide around on the holding tool when i was trying to scrape the polish off before using the stamper...thats only complaint, everything else works great &#x3D;) So worth the money!</li>
            <li> I got this to have an extra stamper, but I don&#x27;t use the metal scraper because I don&#x27;t want it to scrape up my nail plates. The stamper works perfectly, and I like that it is short and stubby- it fits easily into my hand and I get a good pencil-grip on it. The plate holder is handy, but it slides on the table when you are trying to scrape your plate. There is another brand that has a rubber-type holder that really stays put while you are scraping, so I prefer the other one.</li>
            <li> Great for beginners. Very convenient with the holder. I like to use a nail file to buff the stamp before first use. Polish transfers great. If there is a problem it is usually user error by not using the right polish ir not cleaning the stamper off in between stamps.</li>
            <li> The scraper is not very strong. It bends it you put much pressure on it which makes it rather useless. I use the credit card instead. The stamper is ok but only has the one size. The plate holder works ok but found I don&#x27;t really need one.Would not order again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! Easy to use and manage. After purchasing this product, my sister and I have more nail time together! :)</li>
            <li> i absolutely love these art designs, and they are so easy to use! i love doing my own nails and trying out different beautiful designs.</li>
            <li> i love the stamper and the holder they really work good . The Scrapper you need to find the right side where to scrap..need to try every side once you find it , it works great.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old loves this set and the ones given to her with it.  The colors transfer to her nails just like they are shown to.  Takes a  little practice but he was able to do her nails after just a few tries.  I don&#x27;t think this part was necessary after purchasing the dauber and scraper in another set. I just didn&#x27;t know what I was buying!</li>
            <li> The stamper works absolutely fine, but the scraper scrapes the plates (nasty). Overall, I recommend you to buy the original ones because its going to work wonderfully than the fake ones like these.</li>
            <li> You can never have too many stampers or scrapers! Love it, love Shany</li>
            <li> THE DISC HOLDER WORKS WELL IF ACCOMPANIED BY THE SHANY PLATES. AS A STARTER KIT IT IS WELL WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> Have no clue what to do with this. No instructions, just a blank stamper, a piece of flat plastic with a hole in it (no hearts) and that scraper thing.I Ill give it 3 stars because everything seems to be here (I guess?) and Amazon is always great with timely shipping and mb its just me but idk what to do with this.</li>
            <li> it does what it need to so i would recommend it, it bad does its job only complaint would be it came in a plastic ziplock more like something you let a teen use so i will be buying a better one but this is not bad.</li>
            <li> I loveeee the color pink and the stamp press is pink ahh I&#x27;m in love with this! so easy to use and a great value too! wow I couldn&#x27;t as for anything better! shany is the best!</li>
            <li> I brought this along with their 25 stamping plates for my older sister and this kit is amazing!  It comes with everything you need to get started just add your design choice and nail polish and youre set.  I honestly can&#x27;t believe that I only paid $4.99 for this great product.</li>
            <li> this nail stamper and polish scraper work amazingly, iv&#x27;e had this for a while and it hasen&#x27;t broken or anything it&#x27;s worth buying</li>
            <li> Do you like to do nails? Well, this product is perfect for you as it has a stamper, scraper and plate holder.This would be great to do your nails 2 different colors and be all cuties before going out on the town.</li>
            <li> I love dong my nails so as soon as I saw something that would help me put designs on my nails I HAD TO BUY. So far it&#x27;s been a dream and i haven&#x27;t had any problems with it!</li>
            <li> The stamping thingy is pretty good but the scraper is awful. It might be user error but every time I try to use it, I leaves streaks of polish behind. Other Han tat, I&#x27;ve not had a problem!</li>
            <li> New to nail stamping I&#x27;d say this is &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stamper actually works really well for me compared to another I got from Hong Kong recently. But its too small and too hard. The scraper is metal and will scratch your plates, and I find the holder useless honestly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now I use this stamper with an old health card as my scraper and I don&#x27;t use the holder at all.</li>
            <li> I like the stamper and the plate holder. I do not like the scraper. It is metal and has scratched a couple of the plates. I have been using an old credit card.</li>
            <li> The scraper is harder to work than what I expected. Takes a bit to get the hang of it. Fun.</li>
            <li> Over all this is a great product. I am new to the nail art world and am enjoying the learning process. It held the stamp plate well, but its a little awkward to work with. The holder slips around a little making the stamping process a little more challenging but once you get the hang of it, it is very cool!</li>
            <li> I had bought a different brand of stamper and it would not work at all! This was super easy to use and I love that it has the plate holder. Makes life MUCH easier!!</li>
            <li> Glad I bought this case for my iPad. So adorable with the stability of protecting my pad and being able to carry my personal items such as an id and credit card. Very smart buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 13 year old sister-in-law and she loves it!  It works great for stamping nails - she did her first set within an hour of receiving this and has since sent me pictures of new designs at least once a week.  Seems to be easy for her to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so difficult to use it. I&#x27;m not a manicurist, but should be simple...</li>
            <li> the stamp didn&#x27;t work as good as i had hoped</li>
            <li> i absolutely love doing my nails but i&#x27;m not good at nail art at all... but this product saves me from so much struggle! it makes it very simple to apply and i will definitely recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> This stamping nail art set gets the job done but I would liked if the scraper Would have worked better. For only $4.99 it was a good deal. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to go along with the Shany Cosmetics nail art plates. For the price and quality, get these!! It&#x27;s a must have for doing your nail art. This also makes a great gift for anyone you know that likes to do nails</li>
            <li> Buen producto trae el raspador, el sello y la base para las placas, viene en una bolsa pequeña es un set pequeño! y no es como el de la imagen rosado con corazones, simplemente es rosado y ya, igual buen producto en excelentes condiciones</li>
            <li> This part is fine, the plates were the issue so I&#x27;m sure this would work with a better plate set.</li>
            <li> A little difficult to get the hang of, but hang to keep polish from building up on it but it it still a genius product.</li>
            <li> The stamper and plates are a joke - the imprints are bad and doesn&#x27;t give a clean image. I only use it once. I can&#x27;t even give this away!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me. When I finally get the picture to transfer on the stamp and try to transfer it on my nails, it peels off like a sticker. The stamper itself had no dents or crazy spirals  and it came with all the parts which was cool but the non transference is not.</li>
            <li> The stamper is ok. The scraper sucks. I ended up using an old gift card and it works much better. I don&#x27;t really use the holder thing. I think I&#x27;m going to get the Konad stamper scraper set.</li>
            <li> I am new to stamping and purchased this kit. My first time using it, I made the realization that the plate holder and the scraper are more trouble than helpful. While the holder is a good idea, it collects polish around the edges, creating extra cleaning. I find it easiest to set the plate on a double layered paper towel and scrape the excess polish straight off the plate to the towel. The scraper is nice, but scratches the plate. Also, since it is metal, it does not flex. I find it easiest to use an old credit card or gift card. Most people have one or more laying around. Since it flexes, you get a little tension so it scrapes the extra polish off cleaner. The stamper has worked great, but beware if you want to stamp with pink polish. The stamper is pink so it may be difficult to see where the polish is.</li>
            <li> I love the stamper but i didn&#x27;t care for the scraper or the plate holder. The scraper ended up scratching my plates, so instead of the scraper now i use an old gift card and it works perfect. The plate holder it was hard for me to use because I had to clean it after every use so instead of the plate holder I use paper napkin. The stamper was perfect especially for a beginner like me.</li>
