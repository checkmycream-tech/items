    <ol>
            <li>hoping for the best!!!!!</li>
            <li>I have had excellent results with this product, and I have tried EVERYTHING, both over the counter and prescription.</li>

            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>The product itself is WONDERFUL!!!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product - I don&#x27;t know that it is an acne cure because I&#x27;ve never used it alone</li>
            <li>cant say i was too impressed, but it did its job eventually.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I use it with 10% benzoyl peroxide and my skin is the best I have ever seen it.  </li>
            <li>Very good!</li>

            <li>Good Item, works great!</li>
            <li>I am going to stock up now after i finish writing this as i am very pleased with the product!</li>
            <li>Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t get over how great this product is.</li>
            <li>so they can see the great results.</li>
            <li>I had been using the Alpha Hydrox Retinol Resq with great results, so wanted to add in an AHA product.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced no peeling, but the results are there.</li>
            <li>This product works great for oily skin and acne.</li>
            <li>So happy</li>
            <li>(make sure you apply sunscreen liberally if you plan on being in the sun after application!!</li>
            <li>I have researched skin products to death, and concur with my dermatologist that retinol and glycolic acid are very effective products at keeping wrinkles at bay and evening out skin tone.</li>
            <li>Best of luck to all hope it works as well or better for you too.</li>
            <li>PHENOMENAL, amazing stuff!!!</li>
            <li>This is a good investment.</li>
            <li>Its cheap and works great!</li>
            <li>Im a licensed esethician, so I understand how glycolic acid peels work and have a good understanding how AHAs work.</li>
            <li>I laughed aloud when I read the comment that using this stuff is like smearing snot all over your face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good product.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is a good strength as well.  </li>
            <li>With the combination my skin has not looked this good since I was in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I loved this product and would order again.</li>
            <li>This is a really good product that, in my opinion, everyone should have, along with benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin</li>
            <li>Anyway, its all good.</li>
            <li>The price was fair</li>
            <li>Good value for price.</li>
            <li>I use it most nights and feel it is a great deal for my money.</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>My Face&#x27;s Peaches &amp; Cream moisturizer (which is no longer sold), and do miss its wonderful fragrance, but I like the higher percentage of AHA in the Alpha Hydrox products.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>With this many good reviews, I&#x27;m sure it works for some skin types, but not mine!</li>
            <li>This stuff however is amazing, i&#x27;ve used it for a week now and its making noticeable improvements by the day.</li>
            <li>I am proud to say I am BUMP FREE now and I am that person that no one would ever suspect had problem skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet.</li>
            <li>and it looks like lactic acid toners may have been a better choice if you&#x27;re skittish about getting burned.  YMMV.</li>
            <li>Nice under make up and sun screen.</li>
            <li>The packaging isn&#x27;t ideal and it seems like a lot comes out at once, but since the product works, I am not complaining too much about this.</li>
            <li>after a lot of research on what would be best to clear my skin - I stumbled upon a treatment plan that involves glycolic acid.</li>
            <li>I have had great success with weekly salicylic acid peels in preventing acne.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin , I use this in the morning and very smooth, make my face feels like silk and no grassy , and absorb very good, I will buy this again.</li>
            <li>i guess i have to use it more to see the result...</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by my dermatologist and have used it for many years now.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with acne on and off for the better part of 10 years.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and light under makeup</li>
            <li>I research many products and companies and decided to by Alpha Hydrox after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay and does the job.</li>
            <li>I think it would be better for summer.</li>
            <li>but I use this all over my face more often than not.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It has brightened my skin and my face is looking better than ever.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>No need to package it in a tube as it drips out; a spray bottle would be more appropriate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I even put some on my hypertrophic scars on my chest, and they already look better after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I love love love this &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s oil-free.  </li>
            <li>I was so pleased to find it online as I could not find it in any store, and I tried many.</li>
            <li>Much better.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s better for bedtime use.  </li>
            <li>and I really love that there is no perfume in this product.</li>
            <li>Ever since I discovered chemical exfoliation, I&#x27;ve tried others but this is always the best overall value.</li>
            <li>spf 20 over top of it.</li>
            <li>It doesnt soak in, it just sits on top clogging pores.</li>
            <li>I just ordered two more bottles of cleanser, and two additional bottles of toner.</li>
            <li>For being 44, my skin has that healthy glow I had at 19 and through my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>:) My pores are GONE.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>(note: the moisturizer &amp; serum probably absorb better after the affects of the AHA which is a plus</li>
            <li>I need to order more.</li>
            <li>I do see some exfoliation by morning, which will peel off if i use a scrub, so be sure to use sunscreen every day if trying this out.</li>
            <li>After I got burned I did more research</li>
            <li>I love this product and hope it never changes or gets taken off the market.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I no longer have break outs and my skin looks and feels so much better.</li>
            <li>face has become notably smoother and more even-toned with the addition of this product to my routine.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product!</li>
            <li>I love it and it works well to get rid of redness and discoloration.</li>
            <li>Most people think I&#x27;m in my fifties instead of sixties.  </li>
            <li>and I feel my skin looks better the morning after I use it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing the rest of Alpha Hydrox fragrance free products!</li>
            <li>After it dries, I cannot see or feel any evidence of the gel, but my complexion looks more matte and even.</li>
            <li>be sure to wear sunscreen with this product.</li>
            <li>but it costs more.</li>
            <li>Love the Alpha Hydrox products.</li>
            <li>I had never had more than a pimple a year before then...</li>
            <li>I am sure it works anyway</li>
            <li>Dan of acne.org&#x27;s AHA+ is much better and more</li>
            <li>Love this .  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to oversee the side effects because 35% of acne, sun, andmild age spots are gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years (12 -15 or so) and just love it.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps a stronger glycolic acid peel would make more of a difference in fine lines.</li>
            <li>Great for combo skin, hormonal adult acne.</li>
            <li>I used to use Alpha Hydrox Oil Free many years ago before</li>
            <li>I was happy to find it online because none of the drug stores near me carry this product anymore</li>
            <li>The oil free version is much better in the warmer months.  </li>
            <li>I know this got great reviews, but if you tend to have sensitive skin you WILL want to skip this gel.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and looking so much better.</li>
            <li>The sellers were good for they packaged well and shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mild but persistent acne around my chin / jaw line and this has really done a stellar job of getting it under control, which is awesome because I have been trying to figure out how to fix my skin for over a year.</li>
            <li>Not bad!</li>
            <li>I can go on my day with strong sunscreen and BB cream without makeup.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it helps with fine lines</li>
            <li>I hope once my skin is cleared up within a week or so more from consistent use, I will feel better and look like me again.</li>
            <li>the product seems to work fine</li>
            <li>I can say that I have also had some of my fine lines diminish as well.</li>
            <li>I think it would be fine for those not allergic to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this nightly for 3 weeks now, and it&#x27;s not making a difference in fine lines.</li>
            <li>but this AHA very effectively dries them up and makes my pores looks so clear &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my fine lines, (and realistically, no wash or cream will magically make those disappear) but having clearer skin makes this item worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and you can just use a little bit to hae a good result.  </li>
            <li>This product has made a huge difference in my daughter and son&#x27;s acne problem.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin and honestly, I don&#x27;t think it gives me that much of a matte finish, however it doesn&#x27;t make me any oilier.</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin look smooth</li>
            <li>My makeup lasts all day, my pores look smaller because they are collecting pools of oil (gag), and the blackheads on my nose and greatly diminished.  </li>
            <li>Since it is oil free</li>
            <li>Once I apply it to my face my skin is exceedingly smooth.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li>I chose this because it&#x27;s oil free.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is helped significantly reduce my acne too was a fantastic bonus.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I post a review after many years buying at Amazon.</li>
            <li>This product is really worth a try!</li>
            <li>(most are total BS) and this one I&#x27;ve used for many years!</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is my first experience with a 10% glycolic AHA exfoliator and i wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>and the morning after using this product, their appearance is significantly diminished.</li>
            <li>Alpha Hydrox is my budget friendly go-to as it has the glycolic acid content of uppity brands with an approachable price unparalleled.</li>
            <li>I ordered one for my sister after having such great success with it myself.</li>
            <li>I use this in my skin regimen in place of a toner as this product is far more efficient than a toner that evaporates off the most superficial part of your epidermis.</li>
            <li>First, I want to thank the previous reviewers for their reviews as their reviews encouraged me to try this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>With in 3 days my skin felt soft and amazing.</li>
            <li>Existing acne is clearing up insanely fast and most is being prevented.   </li>
            <li>It is cool on your face when you put it on.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much smoother and better looking than it was before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I alternate it with the Retinol Resq and everyone keeps saying how good my skins looks and</li>
            <li>This is good for people who have occasional zits.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you scrub with a good scrubber at least twice a week for better results.</li>
            <li>Since I tend to have acne scars and dark spots around my face, I decided to try this after so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>Been using it for years, goes on so lightly and dries right away.</li>
            <li>first downside is that it&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li>I understand this review isn&#x27;t fair to the product, but Amazon doesn&#x27;t sell it directly therefore there isn&#x27;t much to do.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems with irritation and my skin is super moist, not oily.  </li>
            <li>Its clearing it up quickly.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have any problems with my skin right now, so i purchased this as more of a preventive treatment.</li>
            <li>Anouther product if you suffer from back acne is head and shoulder classic clean because it contains zinc very effective, all the salyic acid, benzol peroxide does not match up to zinc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many drug store and higher end benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid products, but they never made much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference the first time!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stress enough how much I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>A combination of this treatment, switching to a gentler face wash, and using moisturizer consistently has significantly cleared up my acne scars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely not associated with acne.org, I&#x27;ve just used both and really love AHA+!</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t have wrinkles or many fine lines and was hoping this product would improve the overall texture and appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>Great for sloughing off the dead cells.</li>
            <li>Smooth skin, exfoliates gently and reduces pore size.</li>
            <li>Amazing, I wish I would have tried this when I was younger.</li>
            <li>I have like many people with acne prone skin spent more than i&#x27;d like to know going from product to product.</li>
            <li>It is so inexpensive it is worth trying to see if it works for you and if not you are not out a ton of money.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this as I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At this price, it is worth trying.</li>
            <li>It does cause some redness and makes skin more sun sensitive</li>
            <li>my face looks and feel so nice the next day.  </li>
            <li>, it is worth every penny.for the price and the results, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Left to its own devices, the skin would have taken a lot longer to heal and fade.</li>
            <li>Its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised more women don&#x27;t know about this product.</li>
            <li>Excellent and well priced products.&lt;br /&gt;Start with every other day use, and build up to daily use.</li>
            <li>I originally bought the moisturiser version of this same product as more of an ageing preventative measure.  </li>
            <li>In addition biore 4in1 works the best for me as well compared to tons of other facial washes that I have tried.</li>
            <li>So long story short this product has outstanding reviews on amazon for good reason.</li>
            <li>I also think it is great for acne, but only mild cases since it can feel burny on sensitive areas, but that is normal and goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than using nothing but barely.</li>
            <li>(always been using some kind of prescribed acne treatment) but it most definitely does wonders for the actual texture and feel of my skin...</li>
            <li>I love the consistency, as its completely clear and dries fast.</li>
            <li>and I burn easily, but so far I like it.</li>
            <li>I find that it works best when you only use a little bit at a time, too much will sting your face!</li>
            <li>Very light and fluid product.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a more expensive AHA serum prior to using this kind and didn&#x27;t have nearly as good results.  </li>
            <li>Keeps skin clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found AHA&#x27;s do help and when i&#x27;ve used them consistently my skin has improved.</li>
            <li>Thanks Alpha-Hydrox!</li>
            <li>Love this product, look years younger, save your Botox.</li>
            <li>It reduces oil on my face and makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I finally found the Alpha Hydrox products and am glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>Saw no difference in my acne hyperpigmentation after using consistently.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this product consistently, as it&#x27;s summer</li>
            <li>I have used many products, topical antibotics, etc, and nothing worked for my forehead.</li>
            <li>I started with the non-oil free product from the same company but for me the oil free goes on extremely easily without that 5-10 minute white color while it dries.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pretty sensitive and this does a great job of getting rid of the odd pimple.</li>
            <li>Other than that, its light, absorbs quickly and does what its supposed to do and my skin looks more even and soft.</li>
            <li>So far I am very happy with the early results and how it has destroyed a couple larger breakouts in literally days, instead of weeks of dealing with the same breakout.</li>
            <li>It feels fine, like any other face gel, and it is absorbed into the skin pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all that can be expected from a topical product, so I am happy.</li>
            <li>, I was pleasantly surprised with the exfoliation and the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; skin under the dead skin layers looked great.  </li>
            <li>I love this product so much, its non-oily so it keeps my face smooth and tight.</li>
            <li>I can only use it every other night, it is kind f strong and gives me a burning sensation (not always) ........</li>
            <li>Almost after the first application I woke up with much softer skin.</li>
            <li>It will dry your skin but make sure you used a mosturizer.  </li>
            <li>It appears to be super old and used.  </li>
            <li>Will buy again and again for large pores, oily and combination skin, and skin scarring.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been lucky to not have too severe breakouts, but I&#x27;ve never found a product that helped clear my blackheads and whiteheads so well and so gently until this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be keeping a steady supply from now on!</li>
            <li>As described, fast shipping</li>
            <li>I did notice that when I stopped using this for a week my skin was quite  a bit more rough.</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with a benzoyl peroxide 2.5% and it really keeps the skin from drying and being flaky.</li>
            <li>but it does seem to help overall with my skin tone and texture (which is not so smooth).  </li>
            <li>My complexion cleared up within a day or two and has not broken out again or gotten oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s on par with using 2% salicylic acid, which doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I want to give it to every woman I know</li>
            <li>I found this Alpha Hydrox to be very watery.</li>
            <li>The bottle suggests you use it twice a day, but if you use it during the day, you absolutely must wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>&quot; everyone talks about, so I stuck it out and used the whole bottle</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really want to try their 12% AHA body lotion and their foot cream.</li>
            <li>It has helped so much with my acne.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>I used this product for 3 weeks to fade freckles and didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  </li>
            <li>, it comes out fast</li>
            <li>It cleared up some hormonal acne I was having at that time, plus I really think it has helped prevent wrinkles.</li>
            <li>My 40-something skin has really responded to this product.</li>
            <li>I used to have numerous raised, purply acne scars, but nightly application of this product for a couple of weeks has helped fade and flatten those areas into smooth, level skin with the faintest speckle.</li>
            <li>Takes the place of toners and masks and leaves skin ready for moisturizer and/or makeup.</li>
            <li>I RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY!</li>
            <li>It does it&#x27;s job very well, but it has a two downsides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is beyond reasonable.</li>
            <li>I really believe it&#x27;s because of this product and using sunscreen</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle over about 2 1/2 months and noticed no positive difference in my skin, It just made me break out more.</li>
            <li>I have seen a significant improvement in my skin since starting to use this.</li>
            <li>I found their products, and ordered the foaming facial cleaner, toner/astringent, oil free moisturizer, and their heavier 2 oz jar of moisturizer for normal skin.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive, allergy-prone skin that can&#x27;t really deal with many cleansers or any moisturizers / products except all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Applying it more than once a day generally makes the spot I applied it at red.</li>
            <li>it definitely gets rid of acne super fast.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure to dry your face completely before applying.  </li>
            <li>i have always had sebaceous filaments on my nose &amp; chin (dark &amp;#34;plugs&amp;#34; in pores - what most people confuse as blackheads.)</li>
            <li>I also have pretty sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I hardly suffer from acne of any kind, and it has made my complexion very even.</li>
            <li>so it gives you that new skin you need much faster.  </li>
            <li>This has really been helping me with some new acne</li>
            <li>I gave it to a friend with dry skin who loves it and ordered the oil free version for myself.  </li>
            <li>I have decent skin</li>
            <li>It is totally odorless and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It gently gets rid of the dead top layer and reveals the softer newer skin underneath.</li>
            <li>I have mild acne on my chest and back.</li>
            <li>second downside is that it expires quickly.</li>
            <li>but I have a feeling that if I miss more than a week my face would be a mess.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for oily skin.</li>
            <li>Which is why, of course, wearing a high SPF is not just recommended, it&#x27;s required.</li>
            <li>At the price I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I have large pores and some fine lines, but the next morning I looked visibly younger.</li>
            <li>When I got off of birth control, the first major hormonal shift I noticed was the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li>It mimics the dermatologist-prescribed routine I am normally on, just gentler.</li>
            <li>sure how long the bottle will last-</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have many to start with being 26, but did have a few beginning on my forehead and some smile lines starting.</li>
            <li>It is good to use if you have some minor acne, because it has no oil, also because it sort of exfoliates your skin without irritating (any scratchy textures are likely to worsen acne and cause more scarring).</li>
            <li>I used to moisturize and moisturize and the flakes just would come right back.</li>
            <li>and i have a pimple on the middle of my right cheek.</li>
            <li>An extra bonus is that some fine facial lines seemed to have become even finer.  </li>
            <li>The oil free moisturizer I use in the daytime, the other one I use at night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid 20s and have had mild to moderate acne, blackheads, and large pores on my cheeks and and nose since puberty.</li>
            <li>I thought I would have to live with it</li>
            <li>If your in doubt and want to try something new for your skin.</li>
            <li>I put it on every night and even though I&#x27;m normally super dry, I find I don&#x27;t need to use lotion after using this because it sort of keeps the moisture in after I wash your face and put it on.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my fine lines, and have noticed a slight improvement.</li>
            <li>This product is not only keeping my skin clearer, thus avoiding more red marks, it&#x27;s also fading the red marks that were already there.</li>
            <li>only thing I will say is that if you are using it for acne control, you must be consistent.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was the \\&quot;initial breakout\\</li>
            <li>I only applied this gel twice --- on the first day</li>
            <li>and...it was pretty big...</li>
            <li>I concentrate on the crowsfeet, smile lines and around the lips, trying to avoid those old-lady wrinkle lips as long as I can.  </li>
            <li>It is strong but not too harsh to use.</li>
            <li>Most of the time when I apply this, it feels like I am applying a neutral gel, but sometimes there is a slight sting, especially if I have a blemish.</li>
            <li>I can tell it&#x27;s working because I get a mild burning sensation shortly after I apply it, but it&#x27;s not bothersome and goes away after a short time.  </li>
            <li>The moisturiser version was fine for me in the winter, but was too heavy for my skin in the summer.  </li>
            <li>Quite literally overnight, this product helped to clear out and minimize my pores without irritating my skin, and it has never looked better!</li>
            <li>I was concerned that it would irritate my skin, as I am certainly prone to irritation and redness,  but I have had no such issues at all.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and evenly, tingles a little from the acidic pH</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard for me to tell which one is doing most of the work.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to have clear skin.....</li>
            <li>Any way...she was using this gel, and it started to clear my face up immediately....</li>
            <li>When I use this with a BHA, my acne completely clears up.</li>
            <li>It does help to keep my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 44 years old, I&#x27;ve never been a sun-worshiper.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m fighting wrinkles at an early age.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i use this product at night since the AHA can make skin sensitive to the sun</li>
            <li>i do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After about 2 weeks of nightly use, my blackheads and whiteheads have almost completely gone away.</li>
            <li>I have an acne prone sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I started using this product 14 years ago when I was 43 years old.</li>
            <li>People are amazed when they find out how old I am, and ask me what I use.  </li>
            <li>At 55 years old I was still experiencing break outs.</li>
            <li>My skin is fairly sensitive, oily and acne prone.</li>
            <li>Those extra dead skin layers are gone and my skin looks better than it ever has.</li>
            <li>The only complaint is the bottle opening is so big that the gel kind of oozes out even without squeezing it, so you get more than you</li>
            <li>you skin will be more sensitive to burning and you can damage the delicate skin on your face.)</li>
            <li>BUT it has done something no other product has been able to do, and that is keep my face from being an oily, gross, mess 3 hours after washing my face in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been applying a little to stretch marks on one side of my body, and they&#x27;re noticeably lighter than those on the other side, so it seems to be an effective stretch mark treatment.</li>
            <li>Hmm the product i recieved tthe boxed was completly smashed and the product felt half way full in the bottle..</li>
            <li>The first one I ordered was the Souffle version and it kept breaking my sensitive skin out even after the initial several weeks when that is predicted.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 20s but have been suffering from moderate to even severe acne since high school.</li>
            <li>I mainly have problems with blackheads, whiteheads, and the occasional pimple.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend getting this (definitely the oil-free version if your prone to breakouts).</li>
            <li>Works well underneath a moisturizers (with a broad spectrum sunscreen--remember the sunscreen everyone)!</li>
            <li>So far, no new break outs, and I am very acne prone at age 30.  </li>
            <li>For the first two weeks I used it every other day as to get accustomed to my skin since I read it can be harsh - personally I have not had an issues except I need to wear a sunscreen or I will burn easily.</li>
            <li>have oily skin an live in the deep south.  </li>
            <li>Other peoples&#x27; skin may react differently, but this makes it extremely good for getting rid of pimples quickly, even if it&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable and can leave you with red patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a 50 year old chemistry teacher and mom, I want to look as young as possible.</li>
            <li>Be sure to wear at least SPF 15 when using this product!</li>
            <li>For the past two years, I&#x27;ve been dealing with mild adult acne.</li>
            <li>When I opened the cap on this one, the stuff came out of the bottle like water and the bottle was only half full.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is decent size and lasts for a long time (6 months).  </li>
            <li>I still get small bumps here and there, but this product along with my other regime, keeps my skin hydrated, healthy, and clear.</li>
            <li>It feels like a thin gel, dries quickly &amp; works fine in combination with other beauty products.  </li>
            <li>You can tell when it expires, because it won&#x27;t burn and it will generally just leave a greasy film on your skin.</li>
            <li>i got my package toaday, the packaging was horrible!!!!!!!!and as far as the product its been only one day...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m nearly 25 and still get moderate breakouts.</li>
            <li>Unless I&#x27;m suffering from allergies and my skin is extra sensitive</li>
            <li>but that goes away completely with regular use.    </li>
            <li>BURN BURN BURNED off the skin near my temple/eye area and left cheek.  </li>
            <li>I have virtually no blemishes or breakouts (though I wasn&#x27;t overly prone to breakouts or acne before this), and most importantly, the ingrown hairs on my chin are far less tough and less noticeable.</li>
            <li>It goes away quickly and this product has not made my pale skin red or irritated, even with some sun exposure.</li>
            <li>This product has great reviews, but its complete crap.</li>
            <li>As four weeks went by, I am down to the last of my first bottle of cleanser, and ran out of toner.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it it was a little tingly</li>
            <li>I had a little tingle at first and sometimes still do.</li>
            <li>It is possibly helping to fade my dark, post acne marks, which is a positive thing.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money and since a little goes a long way, it lasts a while.</li>
            <li>i still feel really uncomfortable after few hours after uses, but this one gives me a light but enough strenght to keep my face clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li>My skin is looking (relatively) fantastic lately, and this probably has something to do with it!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m still pretty young (30) but have started taking a serious interest in skin care for the last two years.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and other OTC acne control products were not working or were causing dryness and rashy areas (salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide).</li>
            <li>My face hasn&#x27;t been this clear in a long, long time.</li>

            <li> Happy with my purchase.</li>

            <li> (make sure you apply sunscreen liberally if you plan on being in the sun after application!!</li>
            <li> I have researched skin products to death, and concur with my dermatologist that retinol and glycolic acid are very effective products at keeping wrinkles at bay and evening out skin tone.</li>
            <li> Best of luck to all hope it works as well or better for you too.</li>
            <li> PHENOMENAL, amazing stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good investment.</li>
            <li> Its cheap and works great!</li>
            <li> Im a licensed esethician, so I understand how glycolic acid peels work and have a good understanding how AHAs work.</li>
            <li> I laughed aloud when I read the comment that using this stuff is like smearing snot all over your face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good product.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is a good strength as well.  </li>
            <li> With the combination my skin has not looked this good since I was in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I loved this product and would order again.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product that, in my opinion, everyone should have, along with benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin</li>
            <li> Anyway, its all good.</li>
            <li> The price was fair</li>
            <li> Good value for price.</li>
            <li> I use it most nights and feel it is a great deal for my money.</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> My Face&#x27;s Peaches &amp; Cream moisturizer (which is no longer sold), and do miss its wonderful fragrance, but I like the higher percentage of AHA in the Alpha Hydrox products.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> With this many good reviews, I&#x27;m sure it works for some skin types, but not mine!</li>
            <li> This stuff however is amazing, i&#x27;ve used it for a week now and its making noticeable improvements by the day.</li>
            <li> I am proud to say I am BUMP FREE now and I am that person that no one would ever suspect had problem skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet.</li>
            <li> and it looks like lactic acid toners may have been a better choice if you&#x27;re skittish about getting burned.  YMMV.</li>
            <li> Nice under make up and sun screen.</li>
            <li> The packaging isn&#x27;t ideal and it seems like a lot comes out at once, but since the product works, I am not complaining too much about this.</li>
            <li> after a lot of research on what would be best to clear my skin - I stumbled upon a treatment plan that involves glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> I have had great success with weekly salicylic acid peels in preventing acne.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin , I use this in the morning and very smooth, make my face feels like silk and no grassy , and absorb very good, I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> i guess i have to use it more to see the result...</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist and have used it for many years now.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne on and off for the better part of 10 years.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice and light under makeup</li>
            <li> I research many products and companies and decided to by Alpha Hydrox after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay and does the job.</li>
            <li> I think it would be better for summer.</li>
            <li> but I use this all over my face more often than not.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It has brightened my skin and my face is looking better than ever.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> No need to package it in a tube as it drips out; a spray bottle would be more appropriate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even put some on my hypertrophic scars on my chest, and they already look better after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love love love this &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s oil-free.  </li>
            <li> I was so pleased to find it online as I could not find it in any store, and I tried many.</li>
            <li> Much better.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s better for bedtime use.  </li>
            <li> and I really love that there is no perfume in this product.</li>
            <li> Ever since I discovered chemical exfoliation, I&#x27;ve tried others but this is always the best overall value.</li>
            <li> spf 20 over top of it.</li>
            <li> It doesnt soak in, it just sits on top clogging pores.</li>
            <li> I just ordered two more bottles of cleanser, and two additional bottles of toner.</li>
            <li> For being 44, my skin has that healthy glow I had at 19 and through my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> :) My pores are GONE.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> (note: the moisturizer &amp; serum probably absorb better after the affects of the AHA which is a plus</li>
            <li> I need to order more.</li>
            <li> I do see some exfoliation by morning, which will peel off if i use a scrub, so be sure to use sunscreen every day if trying this out.</li>
            <li> After I got burned I did more research</li>
            <li> I love this product and hope it never changes or gets taken off the market.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I no longer have break outs and my skin looks and feels so much better.</li>
            <li> face has become notably smoother and more even-toned with the addition of this product to my routine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product!</li>
            <li> I love it and it works well to get rid of redness and discoloration.</li>
            <li> Most people think I&#x27;m in my fifties instead of sixties.  </li>
            <li> and I feel my skin looks better the morning after I use it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing the rest of Alpha Hydrox fragrance free products!</li>
            <li> After it dries, I cannot see or feel any evidence of the gel, but my complexion looks more matte and even.</li>
            <li> be sure to wear sunscreen with this product.</li>
            <li> but it costs more.</li>
            <li> Love the Alpha Hydrox products.</li>
            <li> I had never had more than a pimple a year before then...</li>
            <li> I am sure it works anyway</li>
            <li> Dan of acne.org&#x27;s AHA+ is much better and more</li>
            <li> Love this .  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried it though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to oversee the side effects because 35% of acne, sun, andmild age spots are gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years (12 -15 or so) and just love it.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps a stronger glycolic acid peel would make more of a difference in fine lines.</li>
            <li> Great for combo skin, hormonal adult acne.</li>
            <li> I used to use Alpha Hydrox Oil Free many years ago before</li>
            <li> I was happy to find it online because none of the drug stores near me carry this product anymore</li>
            <li> The oil free version is much better in the warmer months.  </li>
            <li> I know this got great reviews, but if you tend to have sensitive skin you WILL want to skip this gel.  </li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and looking so much better.</li>
            <li> The sellers were good for they packaged well and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mild but persistent acne around my chin / jaw line and this has really done a stellar job of getting it under control, which is awesome because I have been trying to figure out how to fix my skin for over a year.</li>
            <li> Not bad!</li>
            <li> I can go on my day with strong sunscreen and BB cream without makeup.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it helps with fine lines</li>
            <li> I hope once my skin is cleared up within a week or so more from consistent use, I will feel better and look like me again.</li>
            <li> the product seems to work fine</li>
            <li> I can say that I have also had some of my fine lines diminish as well.</li>
            <li> I think it would be fine for those not allergic to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nightly for 3 weeks now, and it&#x27;s not making a difference in fine lines.</li>
            <li> but this AHA very effectively dries them up and makes my pores looks so clear &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my fine lines, (and realistically, no wash or cream will magically make those disappear) but having clearer skin makes this item worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and you can just use a little bit to hae a good result.  </li>
            <li> This product has made a huge difference in my daughter and son&#x27;s acne problem.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin and honestly, I don&#x27;t think it gives me that much of a matte finish, however it doesn&#x27;t make me any oilier.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin look smooth</li>
            <li> My makeup lasts all day, my pores look smaller because they are collecting pools of oil (gag), and the blackheads on my nose and greatly diminished.  </li>
            <li> Since it is oil free</li>
            <li> Once I apply it to my face my skin is exceedingly smooth.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li> I chose this because it&#x27;s oil free.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is helped significantly reduce my acne too was a fantastic bonus.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I post a review after many years buying at Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product is really worth a try!</li>
            <li> (most are total BS) and this one I&#x27;ve used for many years!</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is my first experience with a 10% glycolic AHA exfoliator and i wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> and the morning after using this product, their appearance is significantly diminished.</li>
            <li> Alpha Hydrox is my budget friendly go-to as it has the glycolic acid content of uppity brands with an approachable price unparalleled.</li>
            <li> I ordered one for my sister after having such great success with it myself.</li>
            <li> I use this in my skin regimen in place of a toner as this product is far more efficient than a toner that evaporates off the most superficial part of your epidermis.</li>
            <li> First, I want to thank the previous reviewers for their reviews as their reviews encouraged me to try this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> With in 3 days my skin felt soft and amazing.</li>
            <li> Existing acne is clearing up insanely fast and most is being prevented.   </li>
            <li> It is cool on your face when you put it on.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much smoother and better looking than it was before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I alternate it with the Retinol Resq and everyone keeps saying how good my skins looks and</li>
            <li> This is good for people who have occasional zits.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you scrub with a good scrubber at least twice a week for better results.</li>
            <li> Since I tend to have acne scars and dark spots around my face, I decided to try this after so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years, goes on so lightly and dries right away.</li>
            <li> first downside is that it&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li> I understand this review isn&#x27;t fair to the product, but Amazon doesn&#x27;t sell it directly therefore there isn&#x27;t much to do.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with irritation and my skin is super moist, not oily.  </li>
            <li> Its clearing it up quickly.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any problems with my skin right now, so i purchased this as more of a preventive treatment.</li>
            <li> Anouther product if you suffer from back acne is head and shoulder classic clean because it contains zinc very effective, all the salyic acid, benzol peroxide does not match up to zinc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many drug store and higher end benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid products, but they never made much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the first time!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress enough how much I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> A combination of this treatment, switching to a gentler face wash, and using moisturizer consistently has significantly cleared up my acne scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely not associated with acne.org, I&#x27;ve just used both and really love AHA+!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have wrinkles or many fine lines and was hoping this product would improve the overall texture and appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> Great for sloughing off the dead cells.</li>
            <li> Smooth skin, exfoliates gently and reduces pore size.</li>
            <li> Amazing, I wish I would have tried this when I was younger.</li>
            <li> I have like many people with acne prone skin spent more than i&#x27;d like to know going from product to product.</li>
            <li> It is so inexpensive it is worth trying to see if it works for you and if not you are not out a ton of money.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this as I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At this price, it is worth trying.</li>
            <li> It does cause some redness and makes skin more sun sensitive</li>
            <li> my face looks and feel so nice the next day.  </li>
            <li> , it is worth every penny.for the price and the results, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Left to its own devices, the skin would have taken a lot longer to heal and fade.</li>
            <li> Its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised more women don&#x27;t know about this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent and well priced products.&lt;br /&gt;Start with every other day use, and build up to daily use.</li>
            <li> I originally bought the moisturiser version of this same product as more of an ageing preventative measure.  </li>
            <li> In addition biore 4in1 works the best for me as well compared to tons of other facial washes that I have tried.</li>
            <li> So long story short this product has outstanding reviews on amazon for good reason.</li>
            <li> I also think it is great for acne, but only mild cases since it can feel burny on sensitive areas, but that is normal and goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than using nothing but barely.</li>
            <li> (always been using some kind of prescribed acne treatment) but it most definitely does wonders for the actual texture and feel of my skin...</li>
            <li> I love the consistency, as its completely clear and dries fast.</li>
            <li> and I burn easily, but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> I find that it works best when you only use a little bit at a time, too much will sting your face!</li>
            <li> Very light and fluid product.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a more expensive AHA serum prior to using this kind and didn&#x27;t have nearly as good results.  </li>
            <li> Keeps skin clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found AHA&#x27;s do help and when i&#x27;ve used them consistently my skin has improved.</li>
            <li> Thanks Alpha-Hydrox!</li>
            <li> Love this product, look years younger, save your Botox.</li>
            <li> It reduces oil on my face and makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I finally found the Alpha Hydrox products and am glad that I did.  </li>
            <li> Saw no difference in my acne hyperpigmentation after using consistently.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product consistently, as it&#x27;s summer</li>
            <li> I have used many products, topical antibotics, etc, and nothing worked for my forehead.</li>
            <li> I started with the non-oil free product from the same company but for me the oil free goes on extremely easily without that 5-10 minute white color while it dries.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s pretty sensitive and this does a great job of getting rid of the odd pimple.</li>
            <li> Other than that, its light, absorbs quickly and does what its supposed to do and my skin looks more even and soft.</li>
            <li> So far I am very happy with the early results and how it has destroyed a couple larger breakouts in literally days, instead of weeks of dealing with the same breakout.</li>
            <li> It feels fine, like any other face gel, and it is absorbed into the skin pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all that can be expected from a topical product, so I am happy.</li>
            <li> , I was pleasantly surprised with the exfoliation and the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; skin under the dead skin layers looked great.  </li>
            <li> I love this product so much, its non-oily so it keeps my face smooth and tight.</li>
            <li> I can only use it every other night, it is kind f strong and gives me a burning sensation (not always) ........</li>
            <li> Almost after the first application I woke up with much softer skin.</li>
            <li> It will dry your skin but make sure you used a mosturizer.  </li>
            <li> It appears to be super old and used.  </li>
            <li> Will buy again and again for large pores, oily and combination skin, and skin scarring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been lucky to not have too severe breakouts, but I&#x27;ve never found a product that helped clear my blackheads and whiteheads so well and so gently until this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be keeping a steady supply from now on!</li>
            <li> As described, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I did notice that when I stopped using this for a week my skin was quite  a bit more rough.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with a benzoyl peroxide 2.5% and it really keeps the skin from drying and being flaky.</li>
            <li> but it does seem to help overall with my skin tone and texture (which is not so smooth).  </li>
            <li> My complexion cleared up within a day or two and has not broken out again or gotten oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on par with using 2% salicylic acid, which doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I want to give it to every woman I know</li>
            <li> I found this Alpha Hydrox to be very watery.</li>
            <li> The bottle suggests you use it twice a day, but if you use it during the day, you absolutely must wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> &quot; everyone talks about, so I stuck it out and used the whole bottle</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really want to try their 12% AHA body lotion and their foot cream.</li>
            <li> It has helped so much with my acne.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 3 weeks to fade freckles and didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  </li>
            <li> , it comes out fast</li>
            <li> It cleared up some hormonal acne I was having at that time, plus I really think it has helped prevent wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My 40-something skin has really responded to this product.</li>
            <li> I used to have numerous raised, purply acne scars, but nightly application of this product for a couple of weeks has helped fade and flatten those areas into smooth, level skin with the faintest speckle.</li>
            <li> Takes the place of toners and masks and leaves skin ready for moisturizer and/or makeup.</li>
            <li> I RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY!</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job very well, but it has a two downsides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is beyond reasonable.</li>
            <li> I really believe it&#x27;s because of this product and using sunscreen</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle over about 2 1/2 months and noticed no positive difference in my skin, It just made me break out more.</li>
            <li> I have seen a significant improvement in my skin since starting to use this.</li>
            <li> I found their products, and ordered the foaming facial cleaner, toner/astringent, oil free moisturizer, and their heavier 2 oz jar of moisturizer for normal skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive, allergy-prone skin that can&#x27;t really deal with many cleansers or any moisturizers / products except all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Applying it more than once a day generally makes the spot I applied it at red.</li>
            <li> it definitely gets rid of acne super fast.</li>
            <li> Also, make sure to dry your face completely before applying.  </li>
            <li> i have always had sebaceous filaments on my nose &amp; chin (dark &amp;#34;plugs&amp;#34; in pores - what most people confuse as blackheads.)</li>
            <li> I also have pretty sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I hardly suffer from acne of any kind, and it has made my complexion very even.</li>
            <li> so it gives you that new skin you need much faster.  </li>
            <li> This has really been helping me with some new acne</li>
            <li> I gave it to a friend with dry skin who loves it and ordered the oil free version for myself.  </li>
            <li> I have decent skin</li>
            <li> It is totally odorless and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It gently gets rid of the dead top layer and reveals the softer newer skin underneath.</li>
            <li> I have mild acne on my chest and back.</li>
            <li> second downside is that it expires quickly.</li>
            <li> but I have a feeling that if I miss more than a week my face would be a mess.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend for oily skin.</li>
            <li> Which is why, of course, wearing a high SPF is not just recommended, it&#x27;s required.</li>
            <li> At the price I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I have large pores and some fine lines, but the next morning I looked visibly younger.</li>
            <li> When I got off of birth control, the first major hormonal shift I noticed was the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> It mimics the dermatologist-prescribed routine I am normally on, just gentler.</li>
            <li> sure how long the bottle will last-</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have many to start with being 26, but did have a few beginning on my forehead and some smile lines starting.</li>
            <li> It is good to use if you have some minor acne, because it has no oil, also because it sort of exfoliates your skin without irritating (any scratchy textures are likely to worsen acne and cause more scarring).</li>
            <li> I used to moisturize and moisturize and the flakes just would come right back.</li>
            <li> and i have a pimple on the middle of my right cheek.</li>
            <li> An extra bonus is that some fine facial lines seemed to have become even finer.  </li>
            <li> The oil free moisturizer I use in the daytime, the other one I use at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 20s and have had mild to moderate acne, blackheads, and large pores on my cheeks and and nose since puberty.</li>
            <li> I thought I would have to live with it</li>
            <li> If your in doubt and want to try something new for your skin.</li>
            <li> I put it on every night and even though I&#x27;m normally super dry, I find I don&#x27;t need to use lotion after using this because it sort of keeps the moisture in after I wash your face and put it on.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fine lines, and have noticed a slight improvement.</li>
            <li> This product is not only keeping my skin clearer, thus avoiding more red marks, it&#x27;s also fading the red marks that were already there.</li>
            <li> only thing I will say is that if you are using it for acne control, you must be consistent.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was the \\&quot;initial breakout\\</li>
            <li> I only applied this gel twice --- on the first day</li>
            <li> and...it was pretty big...</li>
            <li> I concentrate on the crowsfeet, smile lines and around the lips, trying to avoid those old-lady wrinkle lips as long as I can.  </li>
            <li> It is strong but not too harsh to use.</li>
            <li> Most of the time when I apply this, it feels like I am applying a neutral gel, but sometimes there is a slight sting, especially if I have a blemish.</li>
            <li> I can tell it&#x27;s working because I get a mild burning sensation shortly after I apply it, but it&#x27;s not bothersome and goes away after a short time.  </li>
            <li> The moisturiser version was fine for me in the winter, but was too heavy for my skin in the summer.  </li>
            <li> Quite literally overnight, this product helped to clear out and minimize my pores without irritating my skin, and it has never looked better!</li>
            <li> I was concerned that it would irritate my skin, as I am certainly prone to irritation and redness,  but I have had no such issues at all.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and evenly, tingles a little from the acidic pH</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard for me to tell which one is doing most of the work.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to have clear skin.....</li>
            <li> Any way...she was using this gel, and it started to clear my face up immediately....</li>
            <li> When I use this with a BHA, my acne completely clears up.</li>
            <li> It does help to keep my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 44 years old, I&#x27;ve never been a sun-worshiper.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m fighting wrinkles at an early age.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i use this product at night since the AHA can make skin sensitive to the sun</li>
            <li> i do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks of nightly use, my blackheads and whiteheads have almost completely gone away.</li>
            <li> I have an acne prone sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I started using this product 14 years ago when I was 43 years old.</li>
            <li> People are amazed when they find out how old I am, and ask me what I use.  </li>
            <li> At 55 years old I was still experiencing break outs.</li>
            <li> My skin is fairly sensitive, oily and acne prone.</li>
            <li> Those extra dead skin layers are gone and my skin looks better than it ever has.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is the bottle opening is so big that the gel kind of oozes out even without squeezing it, so you get more than you</li>
            <li> you skin will be more sensitive to burning and you can damage the delicate skin on your face.)</li>
            <li> BUT it has done something no other product has been able to do, and that is keep my face from being an oily, gross, mess 3 hours after washing my face in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying a little to stretch marks on one side of my body, and they&#x27;re noticeably lighter than those on the other side, so it seems to be an effective stretch mark treatment.</li>
            <li> Hmm the product i recieved tthe boxed was completly smashed and the product felt half way full in the bottle..</li>
            <li> The first one I ordered was the Souffle version and it kept breaking my sensitive skin out even after the initial several weeks when that is predicted.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20s but have been suffering from moderate to even severe acne since high school.</li>
            <li> I mainly have problems with blackheads, whiteheads, and the occasional pimple.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend getting this (definitely the oil-free version if your prone to breakouts).</li>
            <li> Works well underneath a moisturizers (with a broad spectrum sunscreen--remember the sunscreen everyone)!</li>
            <li> So far, no new break outs, and I am very acne prone at age 30.  </li>
            <li> For the first two weeks I used it every other day as to get accustomed to my skin since I read it can be harsh - personally I have not had an issues except I need to wear a sunscreen or I will burn easily.</li>
            <li> have oily skin an live in the deep south.  </li>
            <li> Other peoples&#x27; skin may react differently, but this makes it extremely good for getting rid of pimples quickly, even if it&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable and can leave you with red patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a 50 year old chemistry teacher and mom, I want to look as young as possible.</li>
            <li> Be sure to wear at least SPF 15 when using this product!</li>
            <li> For the past two years, I&#x27;ve been dealing with mild adult acne.</li>
            <li> When I opened the cap on this one, the stuff came out of the bottle like water and the bottle was only half full.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is decent size and lasts for a long time (6 months).  </li>
            <li> I still get small bumps here and there, but this product along with my other regime, keeps my skin hydrated, healthy, and clear.</li>
            <li> It feels like a thin gel, dries quickly &amp; works fine in combination with other beauty products.  </li>
            <li> You can tell when it expires, because it won&#x27;t burn and it will generally just leave a greasy film on your skin.</li>
            <li> i got my package toaday, the packaging was horrible!!!!!!!!and as far as the product its been only one day...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nearly 25 and still get moderate breakouts.</li>
            <li> Unless I&#x27;m suffering from allergies and my skin is extra sensitive</li>
            <li> but that goes away completely with regular use.    </li>
            <li> BURN BURN BURNED off the skin near my temple/eye area and left cheek.  </li>
            <li> I have virtually no blemishes or breakouts (though I wasn&#x27;t overly prone to breakouts or acne before this), and most importantly, the ingrown hairs on my chin are far less tough and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It goes away quickly and this product has not made my pale skin red or irritated, even with some sun exposure.</li>
            <li> This product has great reviews, but its complete crap.</li>
            <li> As four weeks went by, I am down to the last of my first bottle of cleanser, and ran out of toner.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it it was a little tingly</li>
            <li> I had a little tingle at first and sometimes still do.</li>
            <li> It is possibly helping to fade my dark, post acne marks, which is a positive thing.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money and since a little goes a long way, it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> i still feel really uncomfortable after few hours after uses, but this one gives me a light but enough strenght to keep my face clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking (relatively) fantastic lately, and this probably has something to do with it!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m still pretty young (30) but have started taking a serious interest in skin care for the last two years.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and other OTC acne control products were not working or were causing dryness and rashy areas (salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide).</li>
            <li> My face hasn&#x27;t been this clear in a long, long time.</li>
            <li> However, I have breakouts on areas that don&#x27;t normally break out, something I find quite odd.</li>
            <li> If I apply a reasonable amount and don&#x27;t go crazy, it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1 container usually lasts me 4-5 months, and it&#x27;s very inexpensive when I compare to all the fancy brands.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin like I do, I recommend using just a little mixed with a moisturizer and build your way up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i let the product dry for about 10-15 minutes and then apply a p.m. moisturizer (CeraVe) mixed with a vitamin c/hyaluronic acid serum.</li>
            <li> Applying it and benzoyl peroxide in the same day will make my skin dry up and peel off (along with any pimples).</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make anything worse or better even after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> It does what is says but it is super irritating.</li>
            <li> and I have faint fine lines</li>
            <li> the product is clear and a little runny</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t sting as much as some alpha hydroxy acids do, so it&#x27;s apparently got a decent amount of buffer in it, and my face doesn&#x27;t peel like crazy because of it.</li>
            <li> Ive used this product before and ran out, I cant believe I waited this long to buy again.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product long, but I feel like I am seeing an improvement in my skin after just a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fighting an oily face for several years and it has been even worse in this summer&#x27;s hot, humid weather.</li>
            <li> Once in a while one would get inflamed, then go back down again but never really left.  </li>
            <li> I use several other products</li>
            <li> But it compares favorably to other similar products I have used.</li>
            <li> It took me getting fed up with all the other stuff to convince myself that this product was the key.  </li>
            <li> Same as the other.</li>
            <li> It can dry your skin</li>
            <li> I was using BP gel/lotions and those leave bleach marks on pillow cases and over dry my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff has practically solved my dry skin problem (periodically severely dry, peeling and flaky).</li>
            <li> Cant keep it dry.  </li>
            <li> Helps to fight those dry, patchy, &amp;#34;barnacles&amp;#34; that have started to appear here and there on my neck and chest.</li>
            <li> My blemishes were calmed down and healing within 48 hours of use last month.</li>
            <li> Trust me, I couldn&#x27;t find it for any less than $10 last week when I ordered.</li>
            <li> My skin is also looking much brighter, and the amount of oil on my face has decreased (I am usually a complete oil slick).</li>
            <li> Hate the feeling love the results!</li>
            <li> I do find that this makes me skin a little sensitive, but it&#x27;s nothing that a little moisturizer can&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and it has help me a lot with the problem and actually peels your skin a little</li>
            <li> Give it 10 minutes to dry and have an effect before applying anything else to your face, because the pH of other products can interfere with efficacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for roughly 2-3 months</li>
            <li> Broke me out in closed comodones</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been a week and using this product nightly has broken my face out so intensely</li>
            <li> I have spent alot...</li>
            <li> I saw results in the softness of my skin after only 2-3 uses and can&#x27;t imagine not using it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Based on the research I did prior to purchasing, this is probably a good product to buy if you already know AHA doesn&#x27;t give you evil acne, and you don&#x27;t mind a bunch of parabens.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin as it is, but then the breakouts and dry, flaky patches that were taking over my face started making it even worse.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This product is basically an extreme exfoliant, so that your freshest layer of skin is always showing.</li>
            <li> I like to use it under other products to enhance their benefits.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I am no longer shy to have my picture taken, and people compliment me on my skin for the first time in my life.    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it has done anything to my wrinkles or my zits like the other reviewers</li>
            <li> Now I use it every other night.</li>
            <li> That may be beneficial for some, but for me, every other night works wonders.</li>
            <li> I wanted the strength of the 10% and this delivers it without any other additives.</li>
            <li> I have quit using all other acne treatments.  </li>
            <li> I am done with all other skin care lines but</li>
            <li> so i had no problem with irritation, even applying after washing my face with other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> then the other two products already mentioned.</li>
            <li> Contrary to other reviews, this product didn&#x27;t work well for my skin.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to a lot of the chemicals in other products.</li>
            <li> I have no problems with the texture, contrary to other reviewers.</li>
            <li> but I hate the fact that its so watery though I am sure a little bit goes a long way with the watered down type formula.</li>
            <li> but it is hard to find since I know of only one store that carries it</li>
            <li> You definitely have to start out slow</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin slowly going back to how it looked before st ives, and decided to just give the product to a friend.</li>
            <li> i still have (at least) half of a bottle left.</li>
            <li> During the down time I use ROC at night and this in the morning.</li>
            <li> Could be a little drying for other skin types, though.</li>
            <li> My pores are less noticable, as well as blackheads on my nose.  </li>
            <li> and it makes them less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> No breakouts and less redness.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit that after using this treatment for less than a week, I can see improvements that I wasn&#x27;t even looking for.  </li>
            <li> I previously used Kiss</li>
            <li> I hate the creamy feeling when i use the other product no matter what they claim as oil free</li>
            <li> My face and neck feel a lot smoother and pores are clearing little by little.</li>
            <li> I added the Alpha in and have seen no significant difference.</li>
            <li> Try an astringent with a little tea tree and lavender oil in it (you have to make it)</li>
            <li> It is a little harsh</li>
            <li> This product brightened my skin after just a few days.</li>
            <li> I now use it year round because I am a creature of habit.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a fan of Freeman&#x27;s Dead Sea mineral mask.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t at all harsh.  </li>
            <li> and I went a few years like that.  </li>
            <li> but after a few weeks of putting it on my \\&quot;patches\\&quot; at night, I noticed progress.  </li>
            <li> use this product a few times a week now for \\&quot;maintenance.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Maybe too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> While I was using the product for a few weeks it did not have any effect.  </li>
            <li> I use it at night a few times a week</li>
            <li> Product is not tested on animals, but I have not confirmed the source of the sodium lactate, and it does contain parabens (preservatives linked to cancer).</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this until I find a kinder, safer product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Water, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Hydroxide, Sodium Lactate, Green Tea Extract, Carrageenan (Sea Kelp Extract), Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, PVM/MA Decadiene Crosspolymer</li>
            <li> you too will receive a defective, brown, goopy mess!</li>
            <li> However, when I stopped using it my skin broke out pretty badly.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday for the past month now and my forehead breaks out no more as well as my face.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a burning sensation in the areas where my face is still damp (usually neck area).</li>
            <li> I mix a small quantity of this product with another aftershave product about every 3 days.</li>
            <li> I use this twice/day - morning and night - just dime-size amount - on my face and neck, followed by my usual moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> not sure what is happening at a cellular level</li>
            <li> ...eventually the cystic acne gave way to patches of weird, deep-set white bumps.  </li>
            <li> I have been using AHA 12% since past one year.</li>
            <li> If i do have a dreaded breakout due to hormones, it clears up super fast (a couple days), and i no longer have those horrible, painful cysts that are under my skin for a month before erupting.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now been a month or twi since i received this, and I basically never get a pimple anymore and have very few of the others.</li>
            <li> At least now I know to be extra wary of AHA.</li>
            <li> This is an affordable solution to clogged pores and dull looking skin.</li>
            <li> In my late 20&#x27;s now.</li>
            <li> Those patches of my face along my jawline looked pebbled in texture, which was very obvious and ugly on my pale skin.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff may be a miracle.</li>
            <li> This product has no smell, doesnt dry my skin out, doesnt leave any weird residue on my skin, and WORKS!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the brand that I have been using is not available anymore</li>
            <li> I found this one to be awkward to use due to the consistancy (runny) and the packaging (tube).</li>
            <li> I wasnt disappointed only except for the fact that it needed a pump.</li>
            <li> so be wary of small squeezes.</li>
            <li> This is a thin gel that can be worn under makeup.</li>
            <li> Even through my monthly cycles I dont have the serious breakout because the bumps just dont form!  </li>
            <li> I am using this in tandem (switching nights) with other products that provide chemical exfoliation for my horrible skin, so it is hard for me to speak about its effectiveness specifically.</li>
            <li> The worst part are the red marks that hang around for weeks even after the blemish is gone.</li>
            <li> Amazon.com carries it as it can be difficult to find elsewhere, or I find it</li>
            <li> unfortunately, you have to buy it online....</li>
            <li> wondering if I got a bad batch?</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that bad.  </li>
            <li> Though the seller that is being fulfilled by Amazon sent me expired, OXIDIZED product that is completely worthless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had annoyingly problematic skin.</li>
            <li> , I beleive the companies employees wrote all these 5 star reviews so you will buy their crap products.</li>
            <li> It did give me an awful rash and bumpy skin, so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> AHA products break some people out terribly, and that&#x27;s what happened to me.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When I use this with a BHA, my acne completely clears up. Seriously, this stuff may be a miracle.</li>
            <li> As described, fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this. I have decent skin but I feel like overall this product smooths my skin out. I use several other products so it&#x27;s hard for me to tell which one is doing most of the work. I did notice that when I stopped using this for a week my skin was quite  a bit more rough.</li>
            <li> i got my package toaday, the packaging was horrible!!!!!!!!and as far as the product its been only one day...i guess i have to use it more to see the result...hoping for the best!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for roughly 2-3 months and I have some mixed feelings. I&#x27;m in my early 20s but have been suffering from moderate to even severe acne since high school. I have oily skin and honestly, I don&#x27;t think it gives me that much of a matte finish, however it doesn&#x27;t make me any oilier. I have noticed an improvement on existing acne. However, I have breakouts on areas that don&#x27;t normally break out, something I find quite odd. I find that it works best when you only use a little bit at a time, too much will sting your face! Overall, I think this is alright. I will continue to buy and use it because it works well on bacne too.</li>
            <li> Broke me out in closed comodones</li>
            <li> This is an affordable solution to clogged pores and dull looking skin. I&#x27;ve had acne since I was a teenager and have gone through several treatments without any luck. I decided to give glycolic acid a try 2 months ago and I can already see the difference! My face and neck feel a lot smoother and pores are clearing little by little. This is not a magical potion and I understand it will take time for my skin to improve; but this is the first product that has reduced the incidence and length of breakouts. I do get them every now an then, but they only last for a day or two. This is the first time I post a review after many years buying at Amazon. This product is really worth a try!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for oily skin. Could be a little drying for other skin types, though. I have had excellent results with this product, and I have tried EVERYTHING, both over the counter and prescription. I find this works best during my \\&quot;downtime\\&quot; from Renova--I take 3-6 months off after an 18-month stretch to give my skin a break. During the down time I use ROC at night and this in the morning. It mimics the dermatologist-prescribed routine I am normally on, just gentler. Be sure to wear at least SPF 15 when using this product!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist and have used it for many years now.</li>
            <li> This product brightened my skin after just a few days. I have virtually no blemishes or breakouts (though I wasn&#x27;t overly prone to breakouts or acne before this), and most importantly, the ingrown hairs on my chin are far less tough and less noticeable. This product is basically an extreme exfoliant, so that your freshest layer of skin is always showing. Which is why, of course, wearing a high SPF is not just recommended, it&#x27;s required. Great product!</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase. Keeps skin clear and smooth. I bought this for my fine lines, and have noticed a slight improvement. That&#x27;s all that can be expected from a topical product, so I am happy. Worth the money and since a little goes a long way, it lasts a while. I use morning and night, and use an SPF during the day.</li>
            <li> I have bought probably 100 items on amazon throughout my life and never once felt compelled to write a review, until now of course. I have struggled with acne on and off for the better part of 10 years. In my late 20&#x27;s now. I&#x27;ve found AHA&#x27;s do help and when i&#x27;ve used them consistently my skin has improved. This stuff however is amazing, i&#x27;ve used it for a week now and its making noticeable improvements by the day. Existing acne is clearing up insanely fast and most is being prevented.   I love the consistency, as its completely clear and dries fast. I started with the non-oil free product from the same company but for me the oil free goes on extremely easily without that 5-10 minute white color while it dries. I have like many people with acne prone skin spent more than i&#x27;d like to know going from product to product. So far I am very happy with the early results and how it has destroyed a couple larger breakouts in literally days, instead of weeks of dealing with the same breakout. I use this in conjunction with a benzoyl peroxide 2.5% and it really keeps the skin from drying and being flaky. So long story short this product has outstanding reviews on amazon for good reason. I am going to stock up now after i finish writing this as i am very pleased with the product! Best of luck to all hope it works as well or better for you too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about 10 days now.  So far, no new break outs, and I am very acne prone at age 30.  I do find that this makes me skin a little sensitive, but it&#x27;s nothing that a little moisturizer can&#x27;t help. It is possibly helping to fade my dark, post acne marks, which is a positive thing.  I don&#x27;t know if it helps with fine lines (I have some around my eyes) but it does seem to help overall with my skin tone and texture (which is not so smooth).  The packaging isn&#x27;t ideal and it seems like a lot comes out at once, but since the product works, I am not complaining too much about this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of products, professional, cheap, expensive and this stuff does the trick. Great for combo skin, hormonal adult acne.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin look smooth but I have to use it sparingly.  It can dry your skin so I use it every two days.  I like to use it under other products to enhance their benefits.  This is a good investment.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t get over how great this product is. I used to use Alpha Hydrox Oil Free many years ago before and it does what it does now. I hardly suffer from acne of any kind, and it has made my complexion very even. I was happy to find it online because none of the drug stores near me carry this product anymore (shame for them - they&#x27;d make a killing from me, LOL!). Now I have my mother using it as well with similar results. I would suggest to anyone to give this product, and the entire line a try!</li>
            <li> First, I want to thank the previous reviewers for their reviews as their reviews encouraged me to try this wonderful product. I&#x27;ve been fighting an oily face for several years and it has been even worse in this summer&#x27;s hot, humid weather. I noticed IMMEDIATE improvement (like minutes)!!! My complexion cleared up within a day or two and has not broken out again or gotten oily. I am using the product morning and night. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nearly 25 and still get moderate breakouts. The worst part are the red marks that hang around for weeks even after the blemish is gone. This product is not only keeping my skin clearer, thus avoiding more red marks, it&#x27;s also fading the red marks that were already there. My face hasn&#x27;t been this clear in a long, long time. I use it once in the morning and once at night. It goes on nice and light under makeup - I can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s there. I ordered one for my sister after having such great success with it myself.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin , I use this in the morning and very smooth, make my face feels like silk and no grassy , and absorb very good, I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much, its non-oily so it keeps my face smooth and tight. Its cheap and works great!</li>
            <li> Since I tend to have acne scars and dark spots around my face, I decided to try this after so many good reviews. I wasnt disappointed only except for the fact that it needed a pump. Other than that, its light, absorbs quickly and does what its supposed to do and my skin looks more even and soft.</li>
            <li> Im a licensed esethician, so I understand how glycolic acid peels work and have a good understanding how AHAs work. It hasn&#x27;t been a week and using this product nightly has broken my face out so intensely Im embarrassed.  I feel like a teenager with self-esteem issues. I hope once my skin is cleared up within a week or so more from consistent use, I will feel better and look like me again. Can&#x27;t wait to have clear skin.....</li>
            <li> I have tried everything over the years including Clinique and Proactive.  I was on low-dose antibiotics for years throughout my 20&#x27;s.  I am now in my 40&#x27;s and still had acne until i tried this product.  It is NOT because of my diet or that i need \\&quot;cleansing\\&quot; that i have had problems with acne, it is because my skin will not exfoliate at all on it&#x27;s own.  This product worked for me like nothing else!      If i do have a dreaded breakout due to hormones, it clears up super fast (a couple days), and i no longer have those horrible, painful cysts that are under my skin for a month before erupting.  TRY THIS PRODUCT!  I am no longer shy to have my picture taken, and people compliment me on my skin for the first time in my life.    You should also know:  It takes a few weeks to really kick in, and i did have an increase in acne for about a week to begin with.  I have been using it for 5 months and I can&#x27;t imagine my face without it.  An extra bonus is that some fine facial lines seemed to have become even finer.  It has been just the thing for me.</li>
            <li> I have been suffuring from non-inflammatory acne for years...after a lot of research on what would be best to clear my skin - I stumbled upon a treatment plan that involves glycolic acid. I research many products and companies and decided to by Alpha Hydrox after reading the reviews. I use this product in the AM along with 10% benzoyl peroxide in the PM - within two to three weeks...I have about 3 bumps left on my face....I will forever use this product and hope it never discontinues. I have spent alot...alot..alot of money on various cleansers, toners, creams, etc...and nothing even comes close to what this product can do. For the first two weeks I used it every other day as to get accustomed to my skin since I read it can be harsh - personally I have not had an issues except I need to wear a sunscreen or I will burn easily. If I use a sunscreen - I will not burn. It is so inexpensive it is worth trying to see if it works for you and if not you are not out a ton of money. Thanks Alpha-Hydrox!</li>
            <li> I hate the creamy feeling when i use the other product no matter what they claim as oil free i still feel really uncomfortable after few hours after uses, but this one gives me a light but enough strenght to keep my face clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I use this as an AHA chemical exfoliant. I put it on at night and just leave it on. It does help to keep my skin soft.</li>
            <li> During the summer months skin tends get oily, and the only thing that cures oily skin, is this product.  A great find!</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for 20 years. This is like a drippy gel. It&#x27;s okay and does the job. I prefer the cream. I think it would be better for summer. It is cool on your face when you put it on.</li>
            <li> I laughed aloud when I read the comment that using this stuff is like smearing snot all over your face.  It sort of is.  But I can&#x27;t say anything else about it because I think it rocks.    I don&#x27;t think it has done anything to my wrinkles or my zits like the other reviewers gush about.  BUT it has done something no other product has been able to do, and that is keep my face from being an oily, gross, mess 3 hours after washing my face in the morning.  I have oily spots and nothing would control them.  I&#x27;d have to keep wiping my face throughout the day and that would ruin my makeup.  Now I literally go all day, until 9PM, with zero shine on my face.  My makeup lasts all day, my pores look smaller because they are collecting pools of oil (gag), and the blackheads on my nose and greatly diminished.  This alone makes me rate this stuff 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This product has improved the overall look of my skin.  My pores are less noticable, as well as blackheads on my nose.  (When I stop using the product the blackheads come back).  I am 30 and I have faint fine lines and it makes them less noticeable.  I use it most nights and feel it is a great deal for my money.</li>
            <li> I got this to use on my combo skin. I have problem areas but I use this all over my face more often than not. When I don&#x27;t use it, I sub it for another moisturizer but I like the way this feels on my skin. I use a couple drops of rosehip oil in addition to the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I use it for acne prone skin. I was using BP gel/lotions and those leave bleach marks on pillow cases and over dry my skin. This product has no smell, doesnt dry my skin out, doesnt leave any weird residue on my skin, and WORKS!</li>
            <li> As a 50 year old chemistry teacher and mom, I want to look as young as possible. I have researched skin products to death, and concur with my dermatologist that retinol and glycolic acid are very effective products at keeping wrinkles at bay and evening out skin tone. I have been using this product on my face, neck, hands and feet every morning after my shower. Those extra dead skin layers are gone and my skin looks better than it ever has. I use the Retinol ResQ every night on my face, neck and hands, to work well below the surface of my skin to reduce wrinkles and give my skin that youthful plump look. Excellent and well priced products.&lt;br /&gt;Start with every other day use, and build up to daily use. Keep it below the cheek bone and above the eyebrow to prevent burning of the eye.</li>
            <li> Love this product, look years younger, save your Botox.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the rave reviews about using it as a treatment for acne. I currently have a strict regimen I stick to every morning and every night that is the only thing that works for me. I added the Alpha in and have seen no significant difference. It&#x27;s on par with using 2% salicylic acid, which doesn&#x27;t do much. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this as I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;My products:&lt;br /&gt;Morning- 15% Benzoyl Peroxide face wash, 1% clindamycin lotion (prescription)&lt;br /&gt;Afternoon - 1% Clindamycin lotion&lt;br /&gt;Night - 10% Benzoyl peroxide cream&lt;br /&gt;I tried using this in the morning before applying my clindamycin lotion and then again in the afternoon after washing my make up off. It&#x27;s better than using nothing but barely.</li>
            <li> Very light and fluid product.  I use it as my moisturizer every night.  I repurchased and will continue to do so when I run out.  1.7 fl oz bottle can last me about 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> Hmm the product i recieved tthe boxed was completly smashed and the product felt half way full in the bottle.. the product seems to work fine it definitely gets rid of acne super fast. I ordered from &amp;#34;bepretty&amp;#34; on here</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and I love it! It reduces oil on my face and makes my skin soft and smooth. It is totally odorless and dries quickly. It has brightened my skin and my face is looking better than ever. I also think it is great for acne, but only mild cases since it can feel burny on sensitive areas, but that is normal and goes away quickly. Unless I&#x27;m suffering from allergies and my skin is extra sensitive I don&#x27;t feel a tingle at all. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> The product itself is WONDERFUL!!! Though the seller that is being fulfilled by Amazon sent me expired, OXIDIZED product that is completely worthless. Didn&#x27;t do a thing! Even had a brown tint to it -- gross!! I understand this review isn&#x27;t fair to the product, but Amazon doesn&#x27;t sell it directly therefore there isn&#x27;t much to do. Plus, I wanted to inform you guys that there&#x27;s a big change you too will receive a defective, brown, goopy mess!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 7 months and I love it.  I saw results in the softness of my skin after only 2-3 uses and can&#x27;t imagine not using it everyday.  The bottle is decent size and lasts for a long time (6 months).  Since it is oil free I use it daily before putting on lotion and it doesn&#x27;t add any extra oil to my face.  At the price I highly recommend it.  I purchased a more expensive AHA serum prior to using this kind and didn&#x27;t have nearly as good results.  I like it so much that I want to give it to every woman I know so they can see the great results.</li>
            <li> I found this Alpha Hydrox to be very watery. No need to package it in a tube as it drips out; a spray bottle would be more appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;No difference in skin after using it for 1 month.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m wondering if I got a bad batch?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good product.  I have been using this for years but it is hard to find since I know of only one store that carries it and that&#x27;s ulta and of course amazon.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the first time! I have large pores and some fine lines, but the next morning I looked visibly younger. No joke, YOUNGER. Now I use it every other night. I wait 10 minutes after application, then put on a moisturizer. The bottle suggests you use it twice a day, but if you use it during the day, you absolutely must wear sunscreen. That may be beneficial for some, but for me, every other night works wonders. I even put some on my hypertrophic scars on my chest, and they already look better after 2 weeks. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love love love this &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s oil-free.  It feels like a thin gel, dries quickly &amp; works fine in combination with other beauty products.  Regular lotions tend to make me break out, no matter what they say on their boxes.  This lotion is a good strength as well.  I&#x27;ll be keeping a steady supply from now on!</li>
            <li> I wanted the strength of the 10% and this delivers it without any other additives. I was so pleased to find it online as I could not find it in any store, and I tried many. Works well underneath a moisturizers (with a broad spectrum sunscreen--remember the sunscreen everyone)! At this price, it is worth trying.</li>
            <li> I am 29 and still suffer from acne.  I originally bought the moisturiser version of this same product as more of an ageing preventative measure.  I use it morning and evening.  The fact that it is helped significantly reduce my acne too was a fantastic bonus.  I have quit using all other acne treatments.  My skin is so much smoother and better looking than it was before.&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin an live in the deep south.  The moisturiser version was fine for me in the winter, but was too heavy for my skin in the summer.  The oil free version is much better in the warmer months.  I now use it year round because I am a creature of habit.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I will say is that if you are using it for acne control, you must be consistent.  I have found that if I miss a day or two I break out again.  Not as severe as it used to, but I have a feeling that if I miss more than a week my face would be a mess.  Also, make sure to dry your face completely before applying.  I have noticed a burning sensation in the areas where my face is still damp (usually neck area).</li>
            <li> I had been using the Alpha Hydrox Retinol Resq with great results, so wanted to add in an AHA product.  The first one I ordered was the Souffle version and it kept breaking my sensitive skin out even after the initial several weeks when that is predicted.  I gave it to a friend with dry skin who loves it and ordered the oil free version for myself.  Much better.  No breakouts and less redness.  I alternate it with the Retinol Resq and everyone keeps saying how good my skins looks and what a glow I have.  Somedays I&#x27;ve even stopped wearing foundation.  It does cause some redness and makes skin more sun sensitive so I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s better for bedtime use.  The only complaint is the bottle opening is so big that the gel kind of oozes out even without squeezing it, so you get more than you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price and I really love that there is no perfume in this product.</li>
            <li> This is such a bargain. Ever since I discovered chemical exfoliation, I&#x27;ve tried others but this is always the best overall value. I have sensitive-oily skin and this is workable as part of my routine. It is strong but not too harsh to use.</li>
            <li> I found this one to be awkward to use due to the consistancy (runny) and the packaging (tube). A prefer the souffle.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  If you have blemishes, this works and clears in a month with twice a day application.  In day time I use as smashbox. spf 20 over top of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had annoyingly problematic skin. This is a wonderful product - I don&#x27;t know that it is an acne cure because I&#x27;ve never used it alone (always been using some kind of prescribed acne treatment) but it most definitely does wonders for the actual texture and feel of my skin...it essentially makes my face FRESHER. Almost after the first application I woke up with much softer skin. It gently gets rid of the dead top layer and reveals the softer newer skin underneath. The first time I tried it it was a little tingly but that goes away completely with regular use.    This stuff has practically solved my dry skin problem (periodically severely dry, peeling and flaky). I used to moisturize and moisturize and the flakes just would come right back. This got rid of it almost immediately! I put it on every night and even though I&#x27;m normally super dry, I find I don&#x27;t need to use lotion after using this because it sort of keeps the moisture in after I wash your face and put it on. I just add lotion around my eyes and that&#x27;s it (because the product doesn&#x27;t go on the eyes).    I HIGHLY recommend getting this (definitely the oil-free version if your prone to breakouts). I&#x27;ve tried a million things in my lifetime (most are total BS) and this one I&#x27;ve used for many years!</li>
            <li> I tried this at the same time as Timeless Vitamin. C. With the combination my skin has not looked this good since I was in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This product has great reviews, but its complete crap. It feels like your rubbing snot all over your face when you apply it. It doesnt soak in, it just sits on top clogging pores. I used the whole bottle over about 2 1/2 months and noticed no positive difference in my skin, It just made me break out more. At first I thought it was the \\&quot;initial breakout\\&quot; everyone talks about, so I stuck it out and used the whole bottle and now I regret buying it. NEVER TRUST THESE AMAZON REVIEWS, I beleive the companies employees wrote all these 5 star reviews so you will buy their crap products.</li>
            <li> I have seen improvement in my skin, the spots from the acne on my face has lighten, the texture of my skin has improved. i will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I am using this in tandem (switching nights) with other products that provide chemical exfoliation for my horrible skin, so it is hard for me to speak about its effectiveness specifically. That said, I do know that I have had no problems with this product. I was concerned that it would irritate my skin, as I am certainly prone to irritation and redness,  but I have had no such issues at all. It seems to be the gentlest of the products that I use. My skin is looking (relatively) fantastic lately, and this probably has something to do with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 20s and have had mild to moderate acne, blackheads, and large pores on my cheeks and and nose since puberty. I&#x27;ve been lucky to not have too severe breakouts, but I&#x27;ve never found a product that helped clear my blackheads and whiteheads so well and so gently until this product. I&#x27;ve tried many drug store and higher end benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid products, but they never made much of a difference. Quite literally overnight, this product helped to clear out and minimize my pores without irritating my skin, and it has never looked better! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I mix a small quantity of this product with another aftershave product about every 3 days. Once I apply it to my face my skin is exceedingly smooth. Now that I use this method my skin has no irritation after shaving, especially after using the foaming face wash before I shave. This product has also helped remove excess oil on the T zone areas of my face.</li>
            <li> I called the Alpha Hydrox company out of curiosity before ordering! I ordered their entire line. I&#x27;m 44 years old, I&#x27;ve never been a sun-worshiper. Three years ago someone asked me if I was 29. I was so flattered. As a teenager, i never had blemishes. For the past two years, I&#x27;ve been dealing with mild adult acne. My Mom is a licensed hairdresser &amp; cosmetologist. A dear friend of mine is a licensed esthetician. I called my friend, she suggested I try the Alpha Hydrox line. I found their products, and ordered the foaming facial cleaner, toner/astringent, oil free moisturizer, and their heavier 2 oz jar of moisturizer for normal skin. As four weeks went by, I am down to the last of my first bottle of cleanser, and ran out of toner. I just ordered two more bottles of cleanser, and two additional bottles of toner. The oil free moisturizer I use in the daytime, the other one I use at night. My blemishes were calmed down and healing within 48 hours of use last month. My skin GLOWED after a week of use. All of their products I purchased are 10% glycolic acid. I really want to try their 12% AHA body lotion and their foot cream. PHENOMENAL, amazing stuff!!! I would not trade these products for anything in the universe. For being 44, my skin has that healthy glow I had at 19 and through my 20&#x27;s. I used Mary Kay from 1991 to 2003, I&#x27;ve sold Mary Kay 3 different times. I&#x27;ve tried Cetaphil and nothing but this product line has cleared up my skin. Eight years ago when my child was born, I became allergic to MK Timewise. I am done with all other skin care lines but Alpha Hydrox! :) My pores are GONE. I&#x27;m also a fan of Freeman&#x27;s Dead Sea mineral mask.</li>
            <li> i used for a lil while. cant say i was too impressed, but it did its job eventually.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any problems with my skin right now, so i purchased this as more of a preventive treatment. I have to admit that after using this treatment for less than a week, I can see improvements that I wasn&#x27;t even looking for.  My skin is firmer and softer.  I use this twice/day - morning and night - just dime-size amount - on my face and neck, followed by my usual moisturizer.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with irritation and my skin is super moist, not oily.  The results are terrific.</li>
            <li> I  have been using this product for several weeks and can definitely see an improvement in my facial and neck skin.  It isn&#x27;t at all harsh.  I&#x27;ve experienced no peeling, but the results are there.</li>
            <li> I have seen a significant improvement in my skin since starting to use this. You definitely have to start out slow or you will experience a lot of burning and sensitivity. I&#x27;ve had mild but persistent acne around my chin / jaw line and this has really done a stellar job of getting it under control, which is awesome because I have been trying to figure out how to fix my skin for over a year. Be cautious with sun exposure when using this. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks. If I notice improvement, I&#x27;ll edit this review.</li>
            <li> Im 26 and have always had oily, acne prone skin. I found this product after researching acne and realizing a lot of it is caused by excess production of skin cells in people with acne prone skin. An exfoliator is needed so that&#x27;s what I found.  I&#x27;ve been using this cream at night for 5 years now. It cleared my cystic acne. I still get small bumps here and there, but this product along with my other regime, keeps my skin hydrated, healthy, and clear. And I&#x27;m fighting wrinkles at an early age. Not bad!</li>
            <li> This is a good product and you can just use a little bit to hae a good result.  The sellers were good for they packaged well and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> really impressed with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is my first experience with a 10% glycolic AHA exfoliator and i wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. i&#x27;m still pretty young (30) but have started taking a serious interest in skin care for the last two years. i don&#x27;t have wrinkles or many fine lines and was hoping this product would improve the overall texture and appearance of my skin. IT DID!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i use this product at night since the AHA can make skin sensitive to the sun (make sure you apply sunscreen liberally if you plan on being in the sun after application!! you skin will be more sensitive to burning and you can damage the delicate skin on your face.) i do not have sensitive skin so i had no problem with irritation, even applying after washing my face with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the biggest difference i see is the appearance of my pores. i have always had sebaceous filaments on my nose &amp; chin (dark &amp;#34;plugs&amp;#34; in pores - what most people confuse as blackheads.) even when i exfoliate and use facial masks - they are still visible. and the morning after using this product, their appearance is significantly diminished. not sure what is happening at a cellular level but this AHA very effectively dries them up and makes my pores looks so clear &amp; clean. it also makes my skin so soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i let the product dry for about 10-15 minutes and then apply a p.m. moisturizer (CeraVe) mixed with a vitamin c/hyaluronic acid serum. my face looks and feel so nice the next day.  (note: the moisturizer &amp; serum probably absorb better after the affects of the AHA which is a plus but when i use this moisturizing mixture without the AHA, i definitely do not see the same results.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not sure how long the bottle will last- i&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks and use it 2-4x per week. i still have (at least) half of a bottle left. the product is clear and a little runny and i use a dollop about the size of a quarter. i will continue to buy &amp; use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for the price and the results, it is worth every penny.for the price and the results, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I loved this product and would order again.</li>
            <li> I finally found the Alpha Hydrox products and am glad that I did.  I previously used Kiss My Face&#x27;s Peaches &amp; Cream moisturizer (which is no longer sold), and do miss its wonderful fragrance, but I like the higher percentage of AHA in the Alpha Hydrox products.</li>
            <li> It is a little harsh but I suppose that is the nature of the acids.  I don&#x27;t use it every day.  But it compares favorably to other similar products I have used.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress enough how much I love this stuff! It has helped so much with my acne. I mainly have problems with blackheads, whiteheads, and the occasional pimple. After about 2 weeks of nightly use, my blackheads and whiteheads have almost completely gone away. It&#x27;s now been a month or twi since i received this, and I basically never get a pimple anymore and have very few of the others. My skin is also looking much brighter, and the amount of oil on my face has decreased (I am usually a complete oil slick). I also have pretty sensitive skin. I use this daily snd mix it with my moisturizer at night. If you have sensitive skin like I do, I recommend using just a little mixed with a moisturizer and build your way up. I had tried it without the moisturizer, and my skin started to burn some and turned red. I can say that I have also had some of my fine lines diminish as well. I didn&#x27;t have many to start with being 26, but did have a few beginning on my forehead and some smile lines starting. I hope this product never gets discontinued.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Saw no difference in my acne hyperpigmentation after using consistently.</li>
            <li> Yes Yes Yes!  I have dry, sensitive, allergy-prone skin that can&#x27;t really deal with many cleansers or any moisturizers / products except all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had cystic acne along my jaw line that I saw a derm and took antibiotics for...eventually the cystic acne gave way to patches of weird, deep-set white bumps.  Looked like pimples but were very deep and never \\&quot;came to a head.\\&quot;  Once in a while one would get inflamed, then go back down again but never really left.  Those patches of my face along my jawline looked pebbled in texture, which was very obvious and ugly on my pale skin.  I thought I would have to live with it and I went a few years like that.  Enter this product...no idea why I tried it, but after a few weeks of putting it on my \\&quot;patches\\&quot; at night, I noticed progress.  I am proud to say I am BUMP FREE now and I am that person that no one would ever suspect had problem skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product a few times a week now for \\&quot;maintenance.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It works very well. I need to order more.</li>
            <li> This product works very well. Help with even out the tone.</li>
            <li> Good Item, works great!</li>
            <li> I used this product for 3 weeks to fade freckles and didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  It did give me an awful rash and bumpy skin, so I stopped using it. Now my rash is going away.  I think it would be fine for those not allergic to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nightly for 3 weeks now, and it&#x27;s not making a difference in fine lines. It goes on smoothly and evenly, tingles a little from the acidic pH, it comes out fast so be wary of small squeezes. I do see some exfoliation by morning, which will peel off if i use a scrub, so be sure to use sunscreen every day if trying this out. Perhaps a stronger glycolic acid peel would make more of a difference in fine lines. I have had great success with weekly salicylic acid peels in preventing acne.</li>
            <li> BURN BURN BURNED off the skin near my temple/eye area and left cheek.  I only applied this gel twice --- on the first day, I was pleasantly surprised with the exfoliation and the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; skin under the dead skin layers looked great.  I applied it the next day and felt severe stinging immediately even though there was no redness or irritation before.  3 days later I&#x27;m still dealing with the chemical burn and I can&#x27;t even put neosporin, aloe gel (no alcohol) or basically anything on it to soothe the burn it&#x27;s that bad.  I know this got great reviews, but if you tend to have sensitive skin you WILL want to skip this gel.  After I got burned I did more research and it looks like lactic acid toners may have been a better choice if you&#x27;re skittish about getting burned.  YMMV.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I have an acne prone sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week, no breakouts at all. My skin is smooth and looking so much better. I am impressed</li>
            <li> I started using this product 14 years ago when I was 43 years old. It cleared up some hormonal acne I was having at that time, plus I really think it has helped prevent wrinkles. People are amazed when they find out how old I am, and ask me what I use.  I love this product and hope it never changes or gets taken off the market.</li>
            <li> AHA products break some people out terribly, and that&#x27;s what happened to me. At least now I know to be extra wary of AHA. I used it for a month, and reduced the number weekly applications once my face started freaking out. Unfortunately it did not get better from there. Based on the research I did prior to purchasing, this is probably a good product to buy if you already know AHA doesn&#x27;t give you evil acne, and you don&#x27;t mind a bunch of parabens.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is gentle and effective.  At 55 years old I was still experiencing break outs. I no longer have break outs and my skin looks and feels so much better.</li>
            <li> This is a thin gel that can be worn under makeup. Give it 10 minutes to dry and have an effect before applying anything else to your face, because the pH of other products can interfere with efficacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face has become notably smoother and more even-toned with the addition of this product to my routine. I&#x27;ve been applying a little to stretch marks on one side of my body, and they&#x27;re noticeably lighter than those on the other side, so it seems to be an effective stretch mark treatment.</li>
            <li> My 40-something skin has really responded to this product. I used to have numerous raised, purply acne scars, but nightly application of this product for a couple of weeks has helped fade and flatten those areas into smooth, level skin with the faintest speckle. Left to its own devices, the skin would have taken a lot longer to heal and fade. Great for sloughing off the dead cells.</li>
            <li> within ONE day my skin was softer and it allowed my skin to start clearing out the pores.  The clogged pores begging for release finally could.  Even through my monthly cycles I dont have the serious breakout because the bumps just dont form!  Ive used this product before and ran out, I cant believe I waited this long to buy again.  It took me getting fed up with all the other stuff to convince myself that this product was the key.  I use it with 10% benzoyl peroxide and my skin is the best I have ever seen it.  I will not go without it ever! AND oh yes...I have the OILIEST skin on the planet.  Cant keep it dry.  Try an astringent with a little tea tree and lavender oil in it (you have to make it) then the other two products already mentioned.</li>
            <li> No noticeable impact after months of use.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin which is prone to deep cystic acne and scarring. Alpha Hydrox is my budget friendly go-to as it has the glycolic acid content of uppity brands with an approachable price unparalleled. I use this in my skin regimen in place of a toner as this product is far more efficient than a toner that evaporates off the most superficial part of your epidermis. Will buy again and again for large pores, oily and combination skin, and skin scarring.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product! This is the only thing that has worked for my acne prone skin. I love it and it works well to get rid of redness and discoloration.</li>
            <li> Very good! Doesn&#x27;t sting as much as some alpha hydroxy acids do, so it&#x27;s apparently got a decent amount of buffer in it, and my face doesn&#x27;t peel like crazy because of it. If I apply a reasonable amount and don&#x27;t go crazy, it dries quickly. No scent (yay! I loathe applying perfumes to my face), and the price is terrific.</li>
            <li> Same as the other. Maybe too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> Smooth skin, exfoliates gently and reduces pore size. Takes the place of toners and masks and leaves skin ready for moisturizer and/or makeup.</li>
            <li> This is good for people who have occasional zits.  I have used it for over ten years.  Most people think I&#x27;m in my fifties instead of sixties.  Nice under make up and sun screen.</li>
            <li> very good product, I can tell that it does contain the ingredients mentioned.  It will dry your skin but make sure you used a mosturizer.  I have oily skin, and it has help me a lot with the problem and actually peels your skin a little so it gives you that new skin you need much faster.  Make sure you scrub with a good scrubber at least twice a week for better results.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone with acne prone skin.  While I was using the product for a few weeks it did not have any effect.  However, when I stopped using it my skin broke out pretty badly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  When I opened the cap on this one, the stuff came out of the bottle like water and the bottle was only half full.  It&#x27;s never been like this before.  It appears to be super old and used.  I&#x27;d return the darn thing if I could, but I&#x27;ve already thrown away the paper packaging.  Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  havent seen any improvement yet.</li>
            <li> This product has made a huge difference in my daughter and son&#x27;s acne problem.  It basically clears it up immediately and has kept us from having to use prescription meds!</li>
            <li> My skin is fairly sensitive, oily and acne prone. This doesn&#x27;t irritate my face. I use it at night a few times a week and I feel my skin looks better the morning after I use it.</li>
            <li> Contrary to other reviews, this product didn&#x27;t work well for my skin. I used it in replacement for St Ives pads since they&#x27;re discontinuing them, but it just didn&#x27;t work in the same way. I noticed my skin slowly going back to how it looked before st ives, and decided to just give the product to a friend. With this many good reviews, I&#x27;m sure it works for some skin types, but not mine!</li>
            <li> I have mild acne on my chest and back. Combining this with acne meds and a moisturizer seems to combat pimples without dryness. The only con for this product is that is a bit runny. The product always get caught in the cap, which is not that sanitary.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am allergic to a lot of the chemicals in other products. I chose this because it&#x27;s oil free. I will be purchasing the rest of Alpha Hydrox fragrance free products!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product consistently, as it&#x27;s summer and I burn easily, but so far I like it. I have no problems with the texture, contrary to other reviewers. It feels fine, like any other face gel, and it is absorbed into the skin pretty quickly. After it dries, I cannot see or feel any evidence of the gel, but my complexion looks more matte and even. It is good to use if you have some minor acne, because it has no oil, also because it sort of exfoliates your skin without irritating (any scratchy textures are likely to worsen acne and cause more scarring). It has helped to accelerate the recovery of hyperpigmentation left on my face by the occasional cystic acne.</li>
            <li> This product works great for oily skin and acne. I have used many products, topical antibotics, etc, and nothing worked for my forehead. I use it everyday for the past month now and my forehead breaks out no more as well as my face. In addition biore 4in1 works the best for me as well compared to tons of other facial washes that I have tried. Anouther product if you suffer from back acne is head and shoulder classic clean because it contains zinc very effective, all the salyic acid, benzol peroxide does not match up to zinc.</li>
            <li> I have been using AHA 12% since past one year. Unfortunately the brand that I have been using is not available anymore so I brought this one.&lt;br /&gt;I quit using this after a week since I started getting breakouts. Now i just use it on my knee and elbow instead of throwing it out</li>
            <li> This has really been helping me with some new acne I have been getting.  Its clearing it up quickly.  be sure to wear sunscreen with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  So happy Amazon.com carries it as it can be difficult to find elsewhere, or I find it but it costs more. Been using it for years, goes on so lightly and dries right away. Helps to fight those dry, patchy, &amp;#34;barnacles&amp;#34; that have started to appear here and there on my neck and chest. Love the Alpha Hydrox products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Alpha Hydrox Gel since 1996....I had never had more than a pimple a year before then...then suddenly..out of no where...POOF!  I wake up one day...and i have a pimple on the middle of my right cheek. and...it was pretty big...and I was freaked out...so, I went to the store to buy some of that acne cream stuff...and it didn&#x27;t work...it suddenly turned into 2, then 4,, then 8..and so on...I then went to a dermatologist...and she told me that I had Adult Acne...which is harder to get rid of then if I had gotten them when I was a teenager,,,I was so upset....I went there once a week...and I would get these treatments...Any way...she was using this gel, and it started to clear my face up immediately....and so, I asked her..&amp;#34;what is that gel you&#x27;re putting on my face called&amp;#34;...and she just called it  &amp;#34;A Hydroxy gel&amp;#34;...and these treatments were costing me $100 per week!!  OUCH....so, I went to a regular drug store,..something like a CVS is today...and I found this product..and it was the SAME STUFF She was using on my face...for $8.99..So..I have been using it. like i said..every day for over 20 years....unfortunately, you have to buy it online....like on here....I RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY!</li>
            <li> Amazing, I wish I would have tried this when I was younger. With in 3 days my skin felt soft and amazing. I had a little tingle at first and sometimes still do. If your in doubt and want to try something new for your skin. Its worth every penny. I&#x27;ve noticed reduced pore size on my nose with in just a week of use. I will keep using this daily.</li>
            <li> A combination of this treatment, switching to a gentler face wash, and using moisturizer consistently has significantly cleared up my acne scars.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product that, in my opinion, everyone should have, along with benzoyl peroxide. I have fair skin that&#x27;s pretty sensitive and this does a great job of getting rid of the odd pimple. It does it&#x27;s job very well, but it has a two downsides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first downside is that it&#x27;s strong. It definitely can burn your face, especially if you apply it too often or with something like benzoyl peroxide. Applying it more than once a day generally makes the spot I applied it at red. Applying it and benzoyl peroxide in the same day will make my skin dry up and peel off (along with any pimples). Other peoples&#x27; skin may react differently, but this makes it extremely good for getting rid of pimples quickly, even if it&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable and can leave you with red patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second downside is that it expires quickly. If you only use it for spot treatment, like I do, the tube will outlast it&#x27;s expiration date (which isn&#x27;t printed). You can tell when it expires, because it won&#x27;t burn and it will generally just leave a greasy film on your skin.</li>
            <li> I am sure it works anyway but I hate the fact that its so watery though I am sure a little bit goes a long way with the watered down type formula. Also I paid $10.50 Which pisses me off. I was looking for a cheaper price around  $7.00 and just now seeing it after purchasing it last week. Trust me, I couldn&#x27;t find it for any less than $10 last week when I ordered. Anyway, its all good.</li>
            <li> It does what is says but it is super irritating. Dan of acne.org&#x27;s AHA+ is much better and more calming.&lt;br /&gt;Also I&#x27;m definitely not associated with acne.org, I&#x27;ve just used both and really love AHA+!</li>
            <li> Love this .  Have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a different when using this lotion.  It didn&#x27;t make anything worse or better even after a few weeks.  Oh well, hopefully it will work for others.  I&#x27;m glad I tried it though.</li>
            <li> THis Alpha Hydrox Oil-Free Formula (1.7 oz / 50 ml)&lt;br /&gt;Alpha Hydrox is very good exfoliator and promotes cell turn over.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product long, but I feel like I am seeing an improvement in my skin after just a couple of weeks.  I can tell it&#x27;s working because I get a mild burning sensation shortly after I apply it, but it&#x27;s not bothersome and goes away after a short time.  The price is beyond reasonable.</li>
            <li> The price was fair and I knew what the product was intended for. It is a concentrated alpha hydroxy acid product that won&#x27;t clog your pores.</li>
            <li> I found out about this product by reading a blog. Good value for price. I use it twice a day under moisturizer on my face, neck, and chest and it helps to reduce breakouts. I have very sensitive skin and other OTC acne control products were not working or were causing dryness and rashy areas (salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide). Most of the time when I apply this, it feels like I am applying a neutral gel, but sometimes there is a slight sting, especially if I have a blemish. It goes away quickly and this product has not made my pale skin red or irritated, even with some sun exposure. I think it is also contributing to an overall smoother look to my skin. I have repurchased this product several times on Amazon. One bottle lasts about 5-6 weeks. Product is not tested on animals, but I have not confirmed the source of the sodium lactate, and it does contain parabens (preservatives linked to cancer). I will continue to use this until I find a kinder, safer product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Water, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Hydroxide, Sodium Lactate, Green Tea Extract, Carrageenan (Sea Kelp Extract), Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, PVM/MA Decadiene Crosspolymer</li>
            <li> I can only use it every other night, it is kind f strong and gives me a burning sensation (not always) ........ I&#x27;m able to oversee the side effects because 35% of acne, sun, andmild age spots are gone. I can go on my day with strong sunscreen and BB cream without makeup. Hate the feeling love the results!</li>
            <li> When I got off of birth control, the first major hormonal shift I noticed was the condition of my skin. I have very sensitive skin as it is, but then the breakouts and dry, flaky patches that were taking over my face started making it even worse. I tried different soaps, lotions, masks, serums, etc. to get rid of my acne, but nothing worked - until I found this facial wash. I still get breakouts during my menstrual cycle, but nothing as severe as it used to be. I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my fine lines, (and realistically, no wash or cream will magically make those disappear) but having clearer skin makes this item worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years (12 -15 or so) and just love it.  I only use it at night, and not every night.  During the day I use a gentle face lotion with SPF in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in my 30s when I started using it and felt I saw a noticeable difference in my burgeoning crows feet within a few weeks. I concentrate on the crowsfeet, smile lines and around the lips, trying to avoid those old-lady wrinkle lips as long as I can.  I&#x27;m now in my 50s and in the last month have had 4 different people tell me they can&#x27;t believe my age because I don&#x27;t have wrinkles. I really believe it&#x27;s because of this product and using sunscreen every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 container usually lasts me 4-5 months, and it&#x27;s very inexpensive when I compare to all the fancy brands.  I&#x27;m really surprised more women don&#x27;t know about this product.</li>
