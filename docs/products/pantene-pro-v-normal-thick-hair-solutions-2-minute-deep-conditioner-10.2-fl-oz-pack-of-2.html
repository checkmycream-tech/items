            <li>and this helps keep it nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I have normal, healthy hair.</li>
            <li>It is definetely worth trying.</li>
            <li>and though my hair looks great when its curly its a mess when it is straight) also its naturally full which can sometimes be a problem.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a week or for special occasions because my hair is much softer and lighter when I use it.</li>
            <li>Made my hair smooth and soft after the first use!</li>
            <li>I have tried many sorts of different products to tryand</li>
            <li>The longer it is left in the better the results are</li>
            <li>when i first used it (i stole it from my sister ;D)</li>
            <li>Love using this overnight, makes my hair feel like silk the next day.</li>
            <li>The only reason it&#x27;s not one more star is because of the container.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to find this product at Wal-Mart all the time but here lately I have not been able to find this exact product.</li>
            <li>I use it pretty regularly because my hair dries out really easily</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time a few months ago,  and love it!</li>
            <li>It feels so much lighter and the smell stays in longer.</li>
            <li>It is no longer available at my local grocery or drugstore.  </li>
            <li>I really like it&#x27;s smell and what it does to my hair, but since I am trying to switch to organic products I have to give this 4 stars because of its ingredients.</li>
            <li>Shipment was very speedy.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;box&amp;#34; of conditioner is really cumbersome to use.</li>
            <li>This is a great everyday conditioner for very long hair.  </li>
            <li>This deep conditioner has brought my hair back to life on more than one occasion.</li>
            <li>(I realized this when I used an older container that had been &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; in the cabinet for probably a year.</li>
            <li>Its vivid effect and reasonable price will make me keep using it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this conditioner.</li>
            <li>This stuff really makes your hair quite silky soft.  </li>
            <li>i got so many compliments on my hair on how flowing and soft it was (i am african american and indian.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, coarse, naturally curly hair and this product works great for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>my long hair, I can go through this product pretty quickly, so I limit myself by masagging already dampened strands into dry ones.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use a little without rinsing it out, and it seems to work fine that way.  </li>
            <li>People always comment how soft and flowy my hair is.  </li>
            <li>I color my hair to cover my grays and this makes my hair feel soo soft.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week and my hair becomes shiny and soft after 2 months.</li>
            <li>I would rather pay a bit more for the non-watered down product than have to buy multiple containers to get the same effect.</li>
            <li>It can really make dry hair healed.  </li>
            <li>I just rinse out later and my hair is bouncing, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wash my hair as often to not dry it out</li>

            <li> Excuse my English.</li>
            <li> Very few conditioners make my thick hair feel smooth.  </li>
            <li> The older product was really thick and lasted twice as long as what I had been using.)</li>
            <li> I  use it every other day as a deep conditioner !</li>
            <li> I have dry, course, frizzy, color treated.</li>
            <li> My hair is always dry like hay</li>
            <li> I am using it as daily conditioner to give extra care and fix stiff hair issue.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with very dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair down to my waist</li>
            <li> I use this Pantene conditioner every other day.</li>
            <li> Whenever it&#x27;s down, everyone compliments my hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is helping the texture to be smoother to the touch and look less frizzy too.</li>
            <li> when I use this, in less than 12 hours my hair looks greasy.</li>
            <li> After using this product, my hair is knotted, dull, dry and unmanagable.</li>
            <li> It is ten days late!  </li>
            <li> Apply once a week, s I apply on my day off on Tuesdays, wait until I&#x27;m through with all my house work and work outs, take a shower then apply this and leave it in for a few hours with my hair up.</li>
            <li> I go swimming everyday.</li>
            <li> This is just like a pantene 2 minute conditioner I used a few years ago.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know how the other products from pro v medium thick works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to think ...</li>
            <li> This decreases the frizz, helps the softness and shine and does not weight down my baby thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have graying, thick, and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for thick, course hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> and i have bad split ends making it feel and look coarse.</li>
            <li> It did not make it worse at least.</li>
            <li> my hair is very thick</li>
            <li> I have used this for approximately 4 years.</li>
            <li> I have horrible dry, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> my hair was falling out like crazy and after two uses of this mask I can&#x27;t find any singe hair in a bathtub.</li>
            <li> Leave it in for two minutes but rinse hair with cold water....</li>
            <li> if I get any water in there within a week it seems to get moldy or slimy since almost impossible to keep all water out while showering</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have very thick, coarse, naturally curly hair and this product works great for my hair.  I use it pretty regularly because my hair dries out really easily and it makes my curls more defined.  I would recommend this to anyone with very dry hair.</li>
            <li> For the longest time my hair was just BLEH. I have tried many sorts of different products to tryand bring my hair \\&quot;back to life\\&quot; with no results. I came across the Pantene Pro-V products, and with trial and error I found that the thick-medium flat to volume done the best for me. I had been seeing this tub at walmart for the longest time and actually thought it was a type of vasaline. But after researching it I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe how different my hair is. Whenever it&#x27;s down, everyone compliments my hair. It feels so much lighter and the smell stays in longer. My hair has never been this healthy before.&lt;br /&gt;For my long hair, I can go through this product pretty quickly, so I limit myself by masagging already dampened strands into dry ones. Apply once a week, s I apply on my day off on Tuesdays, wait until I&#x27;m through with all my house work and work outs, take a shower then apply this and leave it in for a few hours with my hair up. I just rinse out later and my hair is bouncing, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Hello where are my products I have not received them as yet? It is ten days late!  I look forward to hearing from you. Please contact me with some information!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to think ...my hair was falling out like crazy and after two uses of this mask I can&#x27;t find any singe hair in a bathtub. Wow! Is this a coincidence or just miracle product for me?...time will show. I was trying different products before and nothing worked. It is definetely worth trying. Excuse my English. I&#x27;m Polish.</li>
            <li> Good products with resonable price! Also fast delivery and pack nice in the box!</li>
            <li> Great deep conditioner and many people swear by it that it helps prevent hair loss.  Like the directions say, don&#x27;t leave it in and only use it once a week.  Don&#x27;t get water in it either.</li>
            <li> Great stuff leave it in over night for great results.</li>
            <li> This is like magic. This deep conditioner has brought my hair back to life on more than one occasion. I like to leave it in for anywhere from an hour to even overnight. The longer it is left in the better the results are</li>
            <li> I love it&lt;br /&gt;I used buy this conditioner at the a store.&lt;br /&gt;But they don&#x27;t stock any more.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy that I can buy it online.</li>
            <li> This is a great everyday conditioner for very long hair.  It has a lot of &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; so it detangles my hair with ease.  I use this twice a week or so.  It is no longer available at my local grocery or drugstore.  It appears that Pantene has discontinued this product.  This is a shame.  I find that the regular conditioner doesn&#x27;t work as well for me.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any buildup with this conditioner at all.  I&#x27;ve tried a similar product by LOreal but there is no comparison between the two.  I did not notice any moisturizing effect with LOreal.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  People always comment how soft and flowy my hair is.  Friends who give me a hug comment how good my hair smells...  Good product..I have long hair down to my waist so its nice to find a product that makes my hair all its lenghth, soft and &amp;#34;flowy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> There are so many snake oils out there for baby boomer hair.  Another example of a lot of hype that does nothing that helped my condition.  It did not make it worse at least.</li>
            <li> I use this Pantene conditioner every other day. I have dry, course, frizzy, color treated. I really love it! It keeps my hair in check! And it smells nice too!&lt;br /&gt;PS. Leave it in for two minutes but rinse hair with cold water....my hair reacts well to this trick...</li>
            <li> This stuff works sooooo nice. I color my hair to cover my grays and this makes my hair feel soo soft. every so often I wash my hair and skip so my hair doesnt get too built up with it.. But On the Whoe its GREAT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this conditioner as my only conditioner. I love it. I have graying, thick, and frizzy hair. This conditioner is helping the texture to be smoother to the touch and look less frizzy too.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know how the other products from pro v medium thick works but this is AWESOME. when i first used it (i stole it from my sister ;D) i got so many compliments on my hair on how flowing and soft it was (i am african american and indian. my hair is very thick and i have bad split ends making it feel and look coarse. and though my hair looks great when its curly its a mess when it is straight) also its naturally full which can sometimes be a problem. the next time i used it i mixed it with wen cleansing conditioner..... EVEN BETTER!!! now my hair is shiny and flowing and light. i LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li> I really like it&#x27;s smell and what it does to my hair, but since I am trying to switch to organic products I have to give this 4 stars because of its ingredients.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner on a regular bases and it leaves my hair smelling, looking and feeling wonderful. My husband can&#x27;t keep his hands or his nose off my hair.</li>
            <li> I go swimming everyday. I am using it as daily conditioner to give extra care and fix stiff hair issue.</li>
            <li> when I was in my country, i was used to using pantene shampoo and conditioner. So after i came to boston, i still prefer to use the same product. Its vivid effect and reasonable price will make me keep using it.</li>
            <li> I have normal, healthy hair. After using this product, my hair is knotted, dull, dry and unmanagable. Will see if I can get my money back, otherwise it will be thrown out!</li>
            <li> My hair is always dry like hay so I decided to try Pantene deep conditioner since it does not require steam. I use it once a week and my hair becomes shiny and soft after 2 months. Wish I use it years ago. I&#x27;d recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Great for my course colored hair. I use it as a deep conditioner periodically leaving on an hour at a time and it softens and conditions.</li>
            <li> Love using this overnight, makes my hair feel like silk the next day.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. I have used this for approximately 4 years. I even use it on my Shih-Tzu puppy and everyone tells me how nice my hair looks and the pet groomers love the way my Shih-Tzu puppy hair is so soft and she smells so good. I have had alot of people stop and ask me what conditioner do I use because my hair looks so soft and shiny and smells great. I used to be able to find this product at Wal-Mart all the time but here lately I have not been able to find this exact product. Pantene switched over to another conditioner in a tube that does not work as well as this product does. I am going to order another package of 3 to keep in stock for later use. I highly recommend this conditioner. You will love it.</li>
            <li> I have horrible dry, frizzy hair.  On top of that it has been changing over the years as I am 56.  This decreases the frizz, helps the softness and shine and does not weight down my baby thin hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff really makes your hair quite silky soft.  Sometimes I use a little without rinsing it out, and it seems to work fine that way.  It can really make dry hair healed.  I LOVE this masque.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This used to be a great conditioner, but the manufacturer has changed the formula to the point that it&#x27;s now almost completely water. (I realized this when I used an older container that had been &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; in the cabinet for probably a year. The older product was really thick and lasted twice as long as what I had been using.) It now takes a third of a container for just one use. I have canceled my standing order for this product because of this. I would rather pay a bit more for the non-watered down product than have to buy multiple containers to get the same effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been happy with the Pantene brand of hair care products and this conditioner does not disappoint.  My hair is on the fine side and the conditioner does a great job of leaving the hair smooth without weighing it down.  Shipment was very speedy.</li>
            <li> I do like the way it makes my hair look and feel just don&#x27;t like the packaging. Would like a more user friendly packaging if I get any water in there within a week it seems to get moldy or slimy since almost impossible to keep all water out while showering</li>
            <li> Made my hair smooth and soft after the first use! I don&#x27;t wash my hair as often to not dry it out and this helps keep it nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Very few conditioners make my thick hair feel smooth.  This product works well as a moisturizing conditioner.  I recommend it for thick, course hair.</li>
            <li> when I use this, in less than 12 hours my hair looks greasy. Wish I had realized that before purchasing 3 pack!</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time a few months ago,  and love it! I  use it every other day as a deep conditioner ! I got a great deal on Groupon, and will  continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> This is just like a pantene 2 minute conditioner I used a few years ago. It smells good and works well. I use it twice a week or for special occasions because my hair is much softer and lighter when I use it. The only reason it&#x27;s not one more star is because of the container. It&#x27;s ridiculous. Why not a regular container like nearly every other conditioner out there. This &amp;#34;box&amp;#34; of conditioner is really cumbersome to use.</li>
