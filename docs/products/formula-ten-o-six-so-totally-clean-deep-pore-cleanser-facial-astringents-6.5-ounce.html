            <li>I have bought 10-0-6 lotion on eBay that was sold in the UK, and that product is not at all like my beloved Bonne Bell 10-0-6.  </li>

            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say I have never had any problems with acne.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just as effective.</li>
            <li>I still use it and have nice skin for a &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and I still get compliments on how nice my skin is (I&#x27;m now in my mid-50&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li>I need an astringent for warm weather skin and this will do the trick.</li>
            <li>I thought to look on line, I was thrilled to find it.  </li>
            <li>gave it this rating because its just that good and an outstanding</li>
            <li>Does a nice cleansing.</li>
            <li>It had a unique sensuous fragrance that my husband loved and said I &#x27;smelled good&#x27;, too.</li>
            <li>Happy to find an altered version of the original 10-0-6.</li>
            <li>It does a good job making your face really clean !&lt;</li>
            <li>I had a problem finding it and was thrilled to be able to order it.  </li>
            <li>How easy is that !</li>
            <li>good as the original, using this for 45 yrs</li>
            <li>Not as good as Bonnie Bell original 10-0-6,</li>
            <li>I have been a 10-0-6 fan, since the sixties, and my complexion is in very good shape for a 64 year old.</li>
            <li>This is a excellent product for facial problems.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended it to so many people but they seldom try it.</li>
            <li>I love how this cleans my skin.</li>
            <li>and I felt like it caused me to break out even more when I was using it once a day for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Overall though, very happy with it.</li>
            <li>nothing could compare to the way it tightened my pores, toned, and gave skin a &#x27;glow&#x27;  and even made makeup look better.</li>
            <li>I think this is my favorite skin care line now.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it here.  </li>
            <li>So glad to find this product again</li>
            <li>So glad I was able to find it again.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Over the years, the condition returned one more time and again it cleared up with the 10-0-6.</li>
            <li>So glad they did.</li>
            <li>I LOVE 1009 LOTION.  </li>
            <li>HAVE USED IT FOR MANY YEARS</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Get many many compliments on my complexion.</li>
            <li>have recommended this to many others after Bonnie&lt;br /&gt;Bell</li>
            <li>product mostly for pre-teen and teens to help them through their skin issues</li>
            <li>but, I haven&#x27;t been able to buy it in years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is the next best thing I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find this again, will never use anything else ever again.</li>
            <li>&amp; I love it.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still around.</li>
            <li>I put it on a cotton pad, wipe off my makeup, flip the pad over to make sure I haven&#x27;t missed anything, and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li>Glad I can still get it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to find it again.</li>
            <li>am glad that you carry this product again.</li>
            <li>Now that I am &amp;#34;older,&amp;#34; I use it mainly in the warm weather months when I am gardening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived in good condition and on time.</li>
            <li>However, I did not see a huge difference in my acne, and the smell is very strong of alcohol.</li>
            <li>I find it makes my skin feel very clean.</li>
            <li>So Totally Clean!</li>
            <li>Slightly different from the original but still the best toner out there for my skin</li>
            <li>It works fabulous, and on most any type of skin.  </li>
            <li>I am a cosmetologist and have recommended this to many others after Bonne Bell sold the original 10-0-6.</li>
            <li>I have some of the original formula I bought quite some time ago, and wish I had purchased more.  </li>
            <li>you will be pleased with SO Totally Clean.</li>
            <li>Removes makeup easily and reduces pores.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as I remembered, but it has been 35 years since I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li>I finally found it on line and am delighted to say that it is the same wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>Thank you SO very much!!</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t as strong as the original</li>
            <li>just wish all the BB cosmetics from the 1970&#x27;s were still available, including the Well Spring cleanser : anyone remember that?</li>
            <li>I am often asked, what product I use on my face, because my skin is quite smooth, and without blemishes.  </li>
            <li>Great to remove big city pollution at midday instead of just using blotting papers.</li>
            <li>It has always cleansed my face and kept it blemish free.  </li>
            <li>Really great at cleaning, especially the oily areas of the face.</li>
            <li>This is a great deep cleanser.  </li>
            <li>That sounds not too good, but for me, this product was the best cleanser I have ever had, and I am sorry to see it go.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure many people would be much happier with their product.</li>
            <li>After I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores I switched to Clean and Clear which was a good substitute but just didn&#x27;t seem to have the cleaning power.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was expecting, I will be ordering more of this product.</li>
            <li>The closest thing I have found to the original formula 10-0-6.  </li>
            <li>The Bonne Bell Heritage website has that great Good Nature gel blusher, white white highlighter, and Colorado Sage aftershave.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find the original anymore, but this is quite close.</li>
            <li>I used to buy it originally at a Rexall Drug Store.  </li>
            <li>Since the original is gone forever this will have to do.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find it again.</li>
            <li>Identical to the original formula.  </li>
            <li>This is not the original formula.  </li>
            <li>sold the original 10-0-6.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>So Totally Clean original formula</li>
            <li>So Totally Clean lotion is close enough, and it does leave the nice scent on my skin--not sure why one reviewer said it did not.  </li>
            <li>but it seems to clean as well as ever.</li>
            <li>but I am so glad to find my old favorite.  </li>
            <li>I buy it now for the smell-- clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>I clean my face with 10-0-6 lotion/NOT soap.</li>
            <li>Pretty good, but not as good as the original formula, seem to be  watered down A LOT!!</li>
            <li>Shipment was very prompt and packed safely.</li>
            <li>That is not necessarily a bad thing to be rid of-</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>10.0.6 is an excellent product for deep cleaning your face, neck, etc., and it does not dry your skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my sister and she said it works very well, but doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as the original 10-0-6 cleaner she used to buy.</li>
            <li>every day, I wash my face with a mild soap on a wash cloth,twice, then rinse well, then apply \\&quot;SO</li>
            <li>I was very pleased when I found it on Amazon, and ordered multiple bottles just in case it disappeared, again.  </li>
            <li>I love buying on Amazon and decided to check for this product, which I currently use (I had used the original Bonne Bell 1006 for 56 years!).</li>
            <li>, it is more of a watered down version and not quite as effective.</li>
            <li>This product cleans your skin without leaving it dry, and it leaves a nice, clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>This product can rarely be found in stores in my area.</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers have said, I have been in love with 10-0-6 by Bonne Belle since I was in my teens-</li>
            <li>Is there a different MORE ORIGINAL formula?</li>
            <li>It does clean really well</li>
            <li>My skin should look like a road map, after baking in the hot sun most of my adult life.</li>
            <li>TA-DA, my skin is smooth, clear &amp; glowing, again, at 70!!</li>
            <li>Luckily, I bought 8 large bottles of the stuff just before they stopped making it.  </li>
            <li>an old formula that still works better than the modern stuff.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like that strong smell, then try to buy the sensitive formula.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>This was ok, but not quite the same as the Bonnie Bell astringent that I used years ago.</li>
            <li>So glad it is still made and is the same.</li>
            <li>My favorite facial cleanser - been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>It has doubled in price since I first started to use it.</li>
            <li>But, we used to carry it in a spritzer bottle on the boat, apply at first sign of sunburn, and we never blistered or peeled..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they came back with this product.</li>
            <li>It is so great at the end of a long day, and so simple.  </li>
            <li>My face thanks you !</li>
            <li>I use to use this facial cleanser when I was a teenager and just fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>My skin was so clear, soft, smooth, and blemish free.  </li>
            <li>only thing is I wish I could get more of it.</li>
            <li>There used to be a scent after it dried that I loved.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, So Totally Clean Cleanser is not the same as the original ten-o-six formula.  </li>
            <li>Several times a day I would use the 10-0-6 to clean away the dirt &amp; perspiration so my face would be totally clean before I reapplied sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I can definitely feel that this toner makes my face super clean.</li>
            <li>Very good, but expensive</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li>The price is quite reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I am in my 30&#x27;s now and don&#x27;t need something as drying as straight up alcohol.</li>
            <li>I have very oilyt skin.</li>
            <li>thanks ...</li>
            <li>Thank you much.</li>
            <li>It shocks me to see how much residue this toner can pick up even after exfoliating and cleansing my face.</li>
            <li>Thanks again to Amazon and the market place people that findthehard to find items.&lt;br /&gt;Jane</li>
            <li>They work equally as well, but are not cost effective for daily use when compared with the bottle of liquid.  </li>
            <li>Love the old Ten O Six..............</li>
            <li>So Totally Clean is an amazing product although I think the word \\&quot;So\\&quot; is unnecessary...</li>
            <li>It smells similar to the original</li>
            <li>Love the mask in the pink bottle too!</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the same as the original Bonne Bell Ten-O-Six.</li>
            <li>Bonne Bell should go back to their original formula of ten-o-six</li>
            <li>Totally Clean Deep Pore Cleanser ...</li>
            <li>After spending time outside in 100 degree summer heat, or at the gym, it feels like a clean cooling pick me up.  </li>
            <li>and I still use it 2 or 3 times a day and keep a bottle at work for quick first aid of minor paper cuts and mosquito bites.</li>
            <li>You can buy this exact product directly from the Formula 10.0.6 website for $5.99.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face at all, so I feel comfortable using it daily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have strangers ask me what I use on my skin on a steady basis.</li>
            <li>I have never found anything else that cleaned my skin of makeup yet left it feeling soft and smooth afterward.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend and approve of this product.</li>
            <li>I used this product when I was in high school 40 years ago.  </li>
            <li>10-0-6 since I was in high school,</li>
            <li>My grandmother bought this for me when I was in the junior high school.</li>
            <li>I dont normally use cleaners</li>
            <li>I had a bottle of this that I used sparsely for years, but I&#x27;ve decided to make toning more a part of my everyday routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the places I normally purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I had used Bonny Bell 1006 facial cleanser for many-many years</li>
            <li>Now if only I felt young enough to still wear Love&#x27;s Baby Soft cologne!</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s been pretty much the same ingredient-wise for all these years.</li>
            <li>for reconnecting me with the new name.</li>
            <li>Supposed to be the newly packaged Ten-O-Six of yesteryear.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I discovered the new name.  </li>
            <li>No more do I have the \\&quot;me\\&quot; smell that was a favorite of my husband and daughter and even my mom and sisters.</li>
            <li>even though they say it is original, I do not believe it); they have removed resorcinol and replaced it with other ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Then, adult acne attacked!</li>
            <li>Formula doesn&#x27;t appear to be exactly the same.</li>
            <li>Totally Clean has the same ingredients as Bonne Belle 10-0-6 but only the name has changed.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely NOT the original from the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s.... too bad, as that was GREAT stuff.</li>
            <li>In my case, 10-0-6 is pretty much the only non-soap facial cleanser that does not produce an irritation, even in its &amp;#34;altered formula&amp;#34; form.</li>
            <li>I believe this is a toned down version of the original 10.0.6 which cleaned so well.</li>
            <li>I agree with other long-time users that this is not the original cleanser, but it still is kinder to my face and better at removing dirt, than other, more expensive &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; cleansers.</li>
            <li>When it became hard to find, the drugstore I could still get it from stopped carrying it so I turned to AMAZON.I am able to get it delivered to my door.</li>
            <li>Helps keep my pores clean and helps dry up current blemishes.</li>
            <li>Not the old formula</li>
            <li>I guess they think it&#x27;s too old fashioned.</li>
            <li>Totally Clean\\&quot; to a cotton pad/ball and gently wipe over my face to remove any residue.  </li>
            <li>I have oily/combination skin and have adult acne in my 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I am 84 years old and have used 1006 since my twenties and would prefer the product without the additive.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 bottles from Bonne Belle some years ago before they completely stopped making it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using 1006 since I was fourteen years old, I&#x27;m sixty five now....  </li>
            <li>old</li>
            <li>And even though I have 50 year old skin now, it is not drying.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product from my early teens (until it disappeared from retail shelves in my 20&#x27;s).</li>
            <li>I tried to find it under its old name, Bonne Belle 10-0-6.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as strong as past formulas, but it was like</li>
            <li>I always had a fresh clean face even in the Serengeti or traveling on the dusty roads in Tanzania, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe or Zanzibar.  </li>
            <li>So what I have been doing is reserving to use this only 1-2 a week, mainly for days that I&#x27;m wearing a lot of make up and that has seem to keep my acne at bay.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Reminds me when I was much younger in high school.</li>
            <li>flashing back to high school</li>
            <li>would highly recommend for anyone bothered by blackheads and occasional breakouts</li>
            <li>As long as the skin is not broken, make a poultice of this and cover with plastic wrap, bag, anything to keep it moist..</li>
            <li>It cleans all the extra dirt that normal makeup removers leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Keeps face clear and do not dry skin out.</li>
            <li>My mother used this in her teens and then when I was a teen, she recommended it to me for clear skin.</li>
            <li>Still the same old Bonne Bell from decades ago</li>
            <li>an old friend back.  </li>
            <li>The only product that helps me keep my adult acne under control.</li>
            <li>Is it possible that as an endocrine disrupter the old formula could contribute to breast cancer?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s, male, and I started using this product when I was in my early 20&#x27;s after trying many cleaners that I found to be drying and irritating.</li>
            <li>The bottle contains less than half as much as the original formula bottles for the same price.  </li>
            <li>so the first one or two times, you may notice a slight stinging feeling, which goes away within seconds.</li>
            <li>My pores feel like it is getting a deep and tingling cleaning (probably due to the high alcohol content).  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have bought 10-0-6 lotion on eBay that was sold in the UK, and that product is not at all like my beloved Bonne Bell 10-0-6.  </li>

            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say I have never had any problems with acne.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just as effective.</li>
            <li> I still use it and have nice skin for a &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and I still get compliments on how nice my skin is (I&#x27;m now in my mid-50&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li> I need an astringent for warm weather skin and this will do the trick.</li>
            <li> I thought to look on line, I was thrilled to find it.  </li>
            <li> gave it this rating because its just that good and an outstanding</li>
            <li> Does a nice cleansing.</li>
            <li> It had a unique sensuous fragrance that my husband loved and said I &#x27;smelled good&#x27;, too.</li>
            <li> Happy to find an altered version of the original 10-0-6.</li>
            <li> It does a good job making your face really clean !&lt;</li>
            <li> I had a problem finding it and was thrilled to be able to order it.  </li>
            <li> How easy is that !</li>
            <li> good as the original, using this for 45 yrs</li>
            <li> Not as good as Bonnie Bell original 10-0-6,</li>
            <li> I have been a 10-0-6 fan, since the sixties, and my complexion is in very good shape for a 64 year old.</li>
            <li> This is a excellent product for facial problems.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended it to so many people but they seldom try it.</li>
            <li> I love how this cleans my skin.</li>
            <li> and I felt like it caused me to break out even more when I was using it once a day for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Overall though, very happy with it.</li>
            <li> nothing could compare to the way it tightened my pores, toned, and gave skin a &#x27;glow&#x27;  and even made makeup look better.</li>
            <li> I think this is my favorite skin care line now.</li>
            <li> So glad I found it here.  </li>
            <li> So glad to find this product again</li>
            <li> So glad I was able to find it again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Over the years, the condition returned one more time and again it cleared up with the 10-0-6.</li>
            <li> So glad they did.</li>
            <li> I LOVE 1009 LOTION.  </li>
            <li> HAVE USED IT FOR MANY YEARS</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Get many many compliments on my complexion.</li>
            <li> have recommended this to many others after Bonnie&lt;br /&gt;Bell</li>
            <li> product mostly for pre-teen and teens to help them through their skin issues</li>
            <li> but, I haven&#x27;t been able to buy it in years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is the next best thing I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find this again, will never use anything else ever again.</li>
            <li> &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still around.</li>
            <li> I put it on a cotton pad, wipe off my makeup, flip the pad over to make sure I haven&#x27;t missed anything, and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li> Glad I can still get it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to find it again.</li>
            <li> am glad that you carry this product again.</li>
            <li> Now that I am &amp;#34;older,&amp;#34; I use it mainly in the warm weather months when I am gardening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived in good condition and on time.</li>
            <li> However, I did not see a huge difference in my acne, and the smell is very strong of alcohol.</li>
            <li> I find it makes my skin feel very clean.</li>
            <li> So Totally Clean!</li>
            <li> Slightly different from the original but still the best toner out there for my skin</li>
            <li> It works fabulous, and on most any type of skin.  </li>
            <li> I am a cosmetologist and have recommended this to many others after Bonne Bell sold the original 10-0-6.</li>
            <li> I have some of the original formula I bought quite some time ago, and wish I had purchased more.  </li>
            <li> you will be pleased with SO Totally Clean.</li>
            <li> Removes makeup easily and reduces pores.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as I remembered, but it has been 35 years since I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li> I finally found it on line and am delighted to say that it is the same wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> Thank you SO very much!!</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t as strong as the original</li>
            <li> just wish all the BB cosmetics from the 1970&#x27;s were still available, including the Well Spring cleanser : anyone remember that?</li>
            <li> I am often asked, what product I use on my face, because my skin is quite smooth, and without blemishes.  </li>
            <li> Great to remove big city pollution at midday instead of just using blotting papers.</li>
            <li> It has always cleansed my face and kept it blemish free.  </li>
            <li> Really great at cleaning, especially the oily areas of the face.</li>
            <li> This is a great deep cleanser.  </li>
            <li> That sounds not too good, but for me, this product was the best cleanser I have ever had, and I am sorry to see it go.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure many people would be much happier with their product.</li>
            <li> After I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores I switched to Clean and Clear which was a good substitute but just didn&#x27;t seem to have the cleaning power.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was expecting, I will be ordering more of this product.</li>
            <li> The closest thing I have found to the original formula 10-0-6.  </li>
            <li> The Bonne Bell Heritage website has that great Good Nature gel blusher, white white highlighter, and Colorado Sage aftershave.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find the original anymore, but this is quite close.</li>
            <li> I used to buy it originally at a Rexall Drug Store.  </li>
            <li> Since the original is gone forever this will have to do.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find it again.</li>
            <li> Identical to the original formula.  </li>
            <li> This is not the original formula.  </li>
            <li> sold the original 10-0-6.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> So Totally Clean original formula</li>
            <li> So Totally Clean lotion is close enough, and it does leave the nice scent on my skin--not sure why one reviewer said it did not.  </li>
            <li> but it seems to clean as well as ever.</li>
            <li> but I am so glad to find my old favorite.  </li>
            <li> I buy it now for the smell-- clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves you feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> I clean my face with 10-0-6 lotion/NOT soap.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, but not as good as the original formula, seem to be  watered down A LOT!!</li>
            <li> Shipment was very prompt and packed safely.</li>
            <li> That is not necessarily a bad thing to be rid of-</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> 10.0.6 is an excellent product for deep cleaning your face, neck, etc., and it does not dry your skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister and she said it works very well, but doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as the original 10-0-6 cleaner she used to buy.</li>
            <li> every day, I wash my face with a mild soap on a wash cloth,twice, then rinse well, then apply \\&quot;SO</li>
            <li> I was very pleased when I found it on Amazon, and ordered multiple bottles just in case it disappeared, again.  </li>
            <li> I love buying on Amazon and decided to check for this product, which I currently use (I had used the original Bonne Bell 1006 for 56 years!).</li>
            <li> , it is more of a watered down version and not quite as effective.</li>
            <li> This product cleans your skin without leaving it dry, and it leaves a nice, clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> This product can rarely be found in stores in my area.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers have said, I have been in love with 10-0-6 by Bonne Belle since I was in my teens-</li>
            <li> Is there a different MORE ORIGINAL formula?</li>
            <li> It does clean really well</li>
            <li> My skin should look like a road map, after baking in the hot sun most of my adult life.</li>
            <li> TA-DA, my skin is smooth, clear &amp; glowing, again, at 70!!</li>
            <li> Luckily, I bought 8 large bottles of the stuff just before they stopped making it.  </li>
            <li> an old formula that still works better than the modern stuff.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like that strong smell, then try to buy the sensitive formula.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> This was ok, but not quite the same as the Bonnie Bell astringent that I used years ago.</li>
            <li> So glad it is still made and is the same.</li>
            <li> My favorite facial cleanser - been using it for years.  </li>
            <li> It has doubled in price since I first started to use it.</li>
            <li> But, we used to carry it in a spritzer bottle on the boat, apply at first sign of sunburn, and we never blistered or peeled..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they came back with this product.</li>
            <li> It is so great at the end of a long day, and so simple.  </li>
            <li> My face thanks you !</li>
            <li> I use to use this facial cleanser when I was a teenager and just fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> My skin was so clear, soft, smooth, and blemish free.  </li>
            <li> only thing is I wish I could get more of it.</li>
            <li> There used to be a scent after it dried that I loved.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, So Totally Clean Cleanser is not the same as the original ten-o-six formula.  </li>
            <li> Several times a day I would use the 10-0-6 to clean away the dirt &amp; perspiration so my face would be totally clean before I reapplied sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I can definitely feel that this toner makes my face super clean.</li>
            <li> Very good, but expensive</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> The price is quite reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s now and don&#x27;t need something as drying as straight up alcohol.</li>
            <li> I have very oilyt skin.</li>
            <li> thanks ...</li>
            <li> Thank you much.</li>
            <li> It shocks me to see how much residue this toner can pick up even after exfoliating and cleansing my face.</li>
            <li> Thanks again to Amazon and the market place people that findthehard to find items.&lt;br /&gt;Jane</li>
            <li> They work equally as well, but are not cost effective for daily use when compared with the bottle of liquid.  </li>
            <li> Love the old Ten O Six..............</li>
            <li> So Totally Clean is an amazing product although I think the word \\&quot;So\\&quot; is unnecessary...</li>
            <li> It smells similar to the original</li>
            <li> Love the mask in the pink bottle too!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the same as the original Bonne Bell Ten-O-Six.</li>
            <li> Bonne Bell should go back to their original formula of ten-o-six</li>
            <li> Totally Clean Deep Pore Cleanser ...</li>
            <li> After spending time outside in 100 degree summer heat, or at the gym, it feels like a clean cooling pick me up.  </li>
            <li> and I still use it 2 or 3 times a day and keep a bottle at work for quick first aid of minor paper cuts and mosquito bites.</li>
            <li> You can buy this exact product directly from the Formula 10.0.6 website for $5.99.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face at all, so I feel comfortable using it daily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have strangers ask me what I use on my skin on a steady basis.</li>
            <li> I have never found anything else that cleaned my skin of makeup yet left it feeling soft and smooth afterward.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend and approve of this product.</li>
            <li> I used this product when I was in high school 40 years ago.  </li>
            <li> 10-0-6 since I was in high school,</li>
            <li> My grandmother bought this for me when I was in the junior high school.</li>
            <li> I dont normally use cleaners</li>
            <li> I had a bottle of this that I used sparsely for years, but I&#x27;ve decided to make toning more a part of my everyday routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the places I normally purchased it.  </li>
            <li> I had used Bonny Bell 1006 facial cleanser for many-many years</li>
            <li> Now if only I felt young enough to still wear Love&#x27;s Baby Soft cologne!</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s been pretty much the same ingredient-wise for all these years.</li>
            <li> for reconnecting me with the new name.</li>
            <li> Supposed to be the newly packaged Ten-O-Six of yesteryear.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I discovered the new name.  </li>
            <li> No more do I have the \\&quot;me\\&quot; smell that was a favorite of my husband and daughter and even my mom and sisters.</li>
            <li> even though they say it is original, I do not believe it); they have removed resorcinol and replaced it with other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Then, adult acne attacked!</li>
            <li> Formula doesn&#x27;t appear to be exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Totally Clean has the same ingredients as Bonne Belle 10-0-6 but only the name has changed.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely NOT the original from the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s.... too bad, as that was GREAT stuff.</li>
            <li> In my case, 10-0-6 is pretty much the only non-soap facial cleanser that does not produce an irritation, even in its &amp;#34;altered formula&amp;#34; form.</li>
            <li> I believe this is a toned down version of the original 10.0.6 which cleaned so well.</li>
            <li> I agree with other long-time users that this is not the original cleanser, but it still is kinder to my face and better at removing dirt, than other, more expensive &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; cleansers.</li>
            <li> When it became hard to find, the drugstore I could still get it from stopped carrying it so I turned to AMAZON.I am able to get it delivered to my door.</li>
            <li> Helps keep my pores clean and helps dry up current blemishes.</li>
            <li> Not the old formula</li>

            <li> Totally Clean\\&quot; to a cotton pad/ball and gently wipe over my face to remove any residue.  </li>
            <li> I have oily/combination skin and have adult acne in my 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I am 84 years old and have used 1006 since my twenties and would prefer the product without the additive.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 bottles from Bonne Belle some years ago before they completely stopped making it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using 1006 since I was fourteen years old, I&#x27;m sixty five now....  </li>
            <li> old</li>
            <li> And even though I have 50 year old skin now, it is not drying.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product from my early teens (until it disappeared from retail shelves in my 20&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> I tried to find it under its old name, Bonne Belle 10-0-6.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as strong as past formulas, but it was like</li>
            <li> I always had a fresh clean face even in the Serengeti or traveling on the dusty roads in Tanzania, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe or Zanzibar.  </li>
            <li> So what I have been doing is reserving to use this only 1-2 a week, mainly for days that I&#x27;m wearing a lot of make up and that has seem to keep my acne at bay.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Reminds me when I was much younger in high school.</li>
            <li> flashing back to high school</li>
            <li> would highly recommend for anyone bothered by blackheads and occasional breakouts</li>
            <li> As long as the skin is not broken, make a poultice of this and cover with plastic wrap, bag, anything to keep it moist..</li>
            <li> It cleans all the extra dirt that normal makeup removers leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Keeps face clear and do not dry skin out.</li>
            <li> My mother used this in her teens and then when I was a teen, she recommended it to me for clear skin.</li>
            <li> Still the same old Bonne Bell from decades ago</li>
            <li> an old friend back.  </li>
            <li> The only product that helps me keep my adult acne under control.</li>
            <li> Is it possible that as an endocrine disrupter the old formula could contribute to breast cancer?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s, male, and I started using this product when I was in my early 20&#x27;s after trying many cleaners that I found to be drying and irritating.</li>
            <li> The bottle contains less than half as much as the original formula bottles for the same price.  </li>
            <li> so the first one or two times, you may notice a slight stinging feeling, which goes away within seconds.</li>
            <li> My pores feel like it is getting a deep and tingling cleaning (probably due to the high alcohol content).  </li>
            <li> The only difference in the &#x27;new&#x27; 10.06 is it&#x27;s a little diluted but works just as well as ever!</li>
            <li> Been looking for this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Used this as a teenager long ago</li>
            <li> But I will keep using it for as long as they make it...</li>
            <li> I found a long, lost friend.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any dry or flaky skin.</li>
            <li> (Unless they see my dry, wrinkled, and spotted arms &amp; legs.</li>
            <li> I am 88 years old, and use it at least once daily after washing my face with soap and water.  </li>
            <li> I suspect the formula is slightly different as it used to have a slight &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one I can find with a low salicylic acid content of 0.5%, so it&#x27;s not to harsh or drying for my adult/acne prone/combo skin!</li>
            <li> I have few facial wrinkles, or crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> I was terrified a few years back when I went to buy it online</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve found that cleans my face without drying it,  Been using it for the past 50ears.</li>
            <li> I know this product, because I used it for decades starting as a teenager, then stopped for quite a while and had a hard time locating it again.  </li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviewers, I&#x27;ve been using this since my teens (in the 1960s!).</li>
            <li> I usually follow with a moisturizer so my face doesn&#x27;t get dry.</li>
            <li> I was not familiar with the wipes, but I ordered some of these as well for use with travel.  </li>
            <li> I just put a few drops onto a cotton ball and wipe.</li>
            <li> I did not have trouble with acne and did not want to and this cleaner prevented all of that</li>
            <li> too bad the real 10-0-6 can&#x27;t be revived, though.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time!</li>
            <li> If you are feeling nostalgic for Ten 0</li>
            <li> I resorted to expensive &#x27;designer&#x27; acne treatments, without the same results!</li>
            <li> While on safari for 5 days, I kept a small travel size of 10-0-6 &amp; some cotton pads in the pocket of my safari pants.</li>
            <li> (I always buy six at a time, usually wind up giving some away to my kids)</li>
            <li> Avoid eyes and don&#x27;t scrub hard.  </li>
            <li> I have this for years and it is getting hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I thought in my late 50s</li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least 40 years.</li>
            <li> , they have a serious problem with their ordering system.</li>
            <li> The price online is RIDICULOUS though.</li>
            <li> AND IT IS NOW VERY HARD</li>
            <li> She said my face would get worse for a day or two, but that was the 10-0-6 cleansing my skin.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> have used this product for about 50 years, off and on, as it became increasingly difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Felt nostalgic, so I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> The formula&#x27;s secret  ingredient, allantoin, is a &#x27;sister&#x27; of RETINOL!</li>
            <li> Terrible!  </li>
            <li> Awful!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> exactly what I was expecting, I will be ordering more of this product.</li>
            <li> Still the same old Bonne Bell from decades ago and I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This is definitely NOT the original from the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s.... too bad, as that was GREAT stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a excellent product for facial problems. I would reccomen to others and would feel they would like the product&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Terrible!  Have ordered twice and when item doesn&#x27;t arrive, you check and there is no order number.  Don&#x27;t waste your time!</li>
            <li> Not the old formula but I like it</li>
            <li> Delghted to find this product as I have used since the 1960&#x27;s!!</li>
            <li> Just like the Ten0six I remember</li>
            <li> good as the original, using this for 45 yrs</li>
            <li> From pre-teen on, this is wonderful.</li>
            <li> great service for this great product. Thankyou</li>
            <li> Love this. Keeps face clear and do not dry skin out.</li>
            <li> Been looking for this for a long time.  Nothing like it!</li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviewers, I&#x27;ve been using this since my teens (in the 1960s!). In my case, 10-0-6 is pretty much the only non-soap facial cleanser that does not produce an irritation, even in its &amp;#34;altered formula&amp;#34; form. I agree with other long-time users that this is not the original cleanser, but it still is kinder to my face and better at removing dirt, than other, more expensive &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; cleansers.</li>
            <li> My wife has used it for over 50 years.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best toner! I&#x27;ve used it for years!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE So Totally Clean! I have used this product for over 20 years! There is no need to wash your face before using.  I put a dab on a cotton ball and wipe my face. I usually follow with a moisturizer so my face doesn&#x27;t get dry. I can honestly say I have never had any problems with acne. I highly recommend this product to everyone! Keep in mind that it is a deep cleanser so the first one or two times, you may notice a slight stinging feeling, which goes away within seconds.</li>
            <li> The best astringent on the market. Does not dry out my very sensitive skin. Also have&lt;br /&gt;Rosacea.</li>
            <li> Used this as a teenager long ago and it&#x27;s just as effective.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s the only thing we have, unless you want to order from overseas and wait 1 1/2 months for your order.  Good luck trying to order from Ulta, they have a serious problem with their ordering system.</li>
            <li> The closest thing I have found to the original formula 10-0-6.  I have been a 10-0-6 fan, since the sixties, and my complexion is in very good shape for a 64 year old.</li>
            <li> I have bought 10-0-6 lotion on eBay that was sold in the UK, and that product is not at all like my beloved Bonne Bell 10-0-6.  This So Totally Clean lotion is close enough, and it does leave the nice scent on my skin--not sure why one reviewer said it did not.  I would suggest that consumers go to the actual website because it is cheaper. The Bonne Bell Heritage website has that great Good Nature gel blusher, white white highlighter, and Colorado Sage aftershave.  I think Bonne Bell sold the 10-0-6 trademark and have to sell their lotion under a different name....just wish all the BB cosmetics from the 1970&#x27;s were still available, including the Well Spring cleanser : anyone remember that?</li>
            <li> i have used this product for years, it gets out all of the dirt</li>
            <li> This product worked for me 43 years ago and is working for my grandson now. Highly recommend and approve of this product.</li>
            <li> I used this product when I was in high school 40 years ago.  Can&#x27;t find the original anymore, but this is quite close.</li>
            <li> I started using 10-0-6 in the 70s. After I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores I switched to Clean and Clear which was a good substitute but just didn&#x27;t seem to have the cleaning power. Happy to find an altered version of the original 10-0-6. The scent isn&#x27;t as strong as the original but it seems to clean as well as ever. I thought in my late 50s I wouldn&#x27;t be dealing with oily skin any longer but I am so glad to find my old favorite.  Now if only I felt young enough to still wear Love&#x27;s Baby Soft cologne!</li>
            <li> Very good, but expensive</li>
            <li> A pharmacist told my mom about 10-0-6 when I was 15 (in 1968) and started getting break outs. I still use it and have nice skin for a &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; woman. I&#x27;ve recommended it to so many people but they seldom try it. I guess they think it&#x27;s too old fashioned. Oh well!.....more for the die-hard fans!</li>
            <li> I used this product for years, and it became unavailable at local stores.  I was very pleased when I found it on Amazon, and ordered multiple bottles just in case it disappeared, again.  10.0.6 is an excellent product for deep cleaning your face, neck, etc., and it does not dry your skin.  The price is quite reasonable.  I am often asked, what product I use on my face, because my skin is quite smooth, and without blemishes.  I have recommended this product to several friends.  I was not familiar with the wipes, but I ordered some of these as well for use with travel.  They work equally as well, but are not cost effective for daily use when compared with the bottle of liquid.  I am very pleased to be re-united with 10.0.6. . . .</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I&#x27;ve been washing my face with Bonne Bell 10-0-6 since I was in high school, and I still get compliments on how nice my skin is (I&#x27;m now in my mid-50&#x27;s).  This product cleans your skin without leaving it dry, and it leaves a nice, clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love how this cleans my skin. I dont normally use cleaners but i made the exception for 10 0 6. Ive been using it for years.</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite astringent! I had a bottle of this that I used sparsely for years, but I&#x27;ve decided to make toning more a part of my everyday routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works quite well at removing dirt and leftover makeup after I wash my face. I just put a few drops onto a cotton ball and wipe. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face at all, so I feel comfortable using it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I actually ask for Bonnie Bell 1006 astringent.  This was ok, but not quite the same as the Bonnie Bell astringent that I used years ago.</li>
            <li> It is the same Bonne Belle cleanser that I used for years - until it disappeared from the stores.  I finally found it on line and am delighted to say that it is the same wonderful product.  I ordered it and it was delivered within 48 hours. Thank you SO very much!!</li>
            <li> This is the best replacement for 10-0-6. It does a good job of cleansing the skin without being too drying.  I am 52yo. I have used this product for 4 years. I wear mineral makeup every day, I wash my face with a mild soap on a wash cloth,twice, then rinse well, then apply \\&quot;SO Totally Clean\\&quot; to a cotton pad/ball and gently wipe over my face to remove any residue.  Avoid eyes and don&#x27;t scrub hard.  I am a cosmetologist and have recommended this to many others after Bonne Bell sold the original 10-0-6. Since Amazon tends to run out of this product I order several bottles at a time. This product can rarely be found in stores in my area.</li>
            <li> My mother used this in her teens and then when I was a teen, she recommended it to me for clear skin. I need an astringent for warm weather skin and this will do the trick. I suspect the formula is slightly different as it used to have a slight &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; to it. That is not necessarily a bad thing to be rid of- I am in my 30&#x27;s now and don&#x27;t need something as drying as straight up alcohol. If you are feeling nostalgic for Ten 0 Six- you will be pleased with SO Totally Clean.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for the skin..feels so clean and takes off all makeup in seconds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence on this product.  I have oily/combination skin and have adult acne in my 30&#x27;s.  It does clean really well ( I see dirt on my cotton pad even thought I just washed my face). My pores feel like it is getting a deep and tingling cleaning (probably due to the high alcohol content).  However it was drying and I felt like it caused me to break out even more when I was using it once a day for 2 weeks.  So what I have been doing is reserving to use this only 1-2 a week, mainly for days that I&#x27;m wearing a lot of make up and that has seem to keep my acne at bay.</li>
            <li> A college classmate recommended 10.0.6 decades ago and I still use it 2 or 3 times a day and keep a bottle at work for quick first aid of minor paper cuts and mosquito bites. Great to remove big city pollution at midday instead of just using blotting papers. Best for combination or oily complexion; do not use around eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister and she said it works very well, but doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as the original 10-0-6 cleaner she used to buy. Overall though, very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have used Bonne Bell 10-0-6 for 45 years and it is still the wonderful product it was then.  It has always cleansed my face and kept it blemish free.  It is the only thing I&#x27;ve ever used.  Soap has never touched my face.  So glad it is still made and is the same.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for 30 years. People say I look 10 yrs younger!</li>
            <li> I am 84 years old and have used 1006 since my twenties and would prefer the product without the additive.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 40 years. It cleans my skin and pores as nothing else. Now that I am &amp;#34;older,&amp;#34; I use it mainly in the warm weather months when I am gardening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived in good condition and on time.</li>
            <li> My favorite facial cleanser - been using it for years.  I have oily skin and 1006 cleans off the makeup and leaves my face feeling great,</li>
            <li> Have used this for years. Can no longer find it in regular stores. Does a good job of cleaning the face. It has doubled in price since I first started to use it.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers have said, I have been in love with 10-0-6 by Bonne Belle since I was in my teens- nothing could compare to the way it tightened my pores, toned, and gave skin a &#x27;glow&#x27;  and even made makeup look better. It had a unique sensuous fragrance that my husband loved and said I &#x27;smelled good&#x27;, too. I bought 3 bottles from Bonne Belle some years ago before they completely stopped making it.  This product is similar, and I still use it daily to remove makeup- it really deep cleans even after washing my face with soap. It smells similar to the original but I know the ingredients differ, it is more of a watered down version and not quite as effective. But I will keep using it for as long as they make it...too bad the real 10-0-6 can&#x27;t be revived, though.</li>
            <li> Loved it when my skin needed it. I buy it now for the smell-- clean. It brings me back....</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I think this is my favorite skin care line now. Love the mask in the pink bottle too! The price online is RIDICULOUS though. Ulta carries this brand for a quarter of the cost.</li>
            <li> I have this for years and it is getting hard to find.  So glad I found it here.  It is really a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 40 years.  I used to buy it originally at a Rexall Drug Store.  I am 88 years old, and use it at least once daily after washing my face with soap and water.  I find it makes my skin feel very clean.</li>
            <li> Love the old Ten O Six..............Reminds me when I was much younger in high school.</li>
            <li> So glad to find this product again</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I have been using it since 1968. I have no pimples or blemishes. My skin is radiant too. I will continue to use it.....forever!</li>
            <li> excellent product.  Good price.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years.  Was recommended to me as a teenager to help rid my complexion of acne. Of course, then it was called&lt;br /&gt;10 0 6 Lotion.  So glad I was able to find it again. Shipment was very prompt and packed safely.</li>
            <li> Not as I remember. Made my face break-out.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I always use&#x27;t to use 10-0-6.  Then I could not find it in stores for years.&lt;br /&gt;When I thought to look on line, I was thrilled to find it.  It works fabulous, and on most any type of skin.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> She only uses this for cleaning for face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s, male, and I started using this product when I was in my early 20&#x27;s after trying many cleaners that I found to be drying and irritating. Not only did it work wonders for my complexion, it even cleared up a problem area that had ben plaguing me for years.  I tried numerous products and prescription medications and nothing worked. Then I found 10-0-6 (then made by Bonnie Bell) and it cleared up the problem. Over the years, the condition returned one more time and again it cleared up with the 10-0-6. Luckily, I bought 8 large bottles of the stuff just before they stopped making it.  That helped me weather the years until they FINALLY reintroduced the product again.  So glad they did. A wonderful one of a kind product in my book.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the same as the original Bonne Bell Ten-O-Six. It doesn&#x27;t have the distinctive scent and it doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Great product. On-time delivery. Excellent!</li>
            <li> Works just like the stuff I used as a kid.  Smells the same.  I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using 1006 since I was fourteen years old, I&#x27;m sixty five now....  Suddenly it disappeared&lt;br /&gt;from the places I normally purchased it.  I&#x27;ve been without it over 5 years.  I decided to do a&lt;br /&gt;search and Amazon found it for me.  It&#x27;s not quite as strong as past formulas, but it was like&lt;br /&gt;welcoming an old friend back.  Also the packaging had changed dramatically, once I saw it I&lt;br /&gt;readily recognized it at my local drug store.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> Have been using this since 1955 for burns, whether sunburn, grease, steam, what ever.  As long as the skin is not broken, make a poultice of this and cover with plastic wrap, bag, anything to keep it moist.. They don&#x27;t advertise it, probably for liability purposes, but actually rubbing alcohol will do the same thing..it toughens the skin.  I know that the formula has changed somewhat since then, or perhaps they weren&#x27;t required to list everything back then.  But, we used to carry it in a spritzer bottle on the boat, apply at first sign of sunburn, and we never blistered or peeled.. Personal experience.  Great for teenagers skin, too.</li>
            <li> Use it in my teen years and it still works!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE 1009 LOTION.  IT WORKS! HAVE USED IT FOR MANY YEARS AND IT IS NOW VERY HARD TO FIND.&lt;br /&gt;MY SISTERS AND DAUGHTERS LOVE IT TOO.  IT CLEANS YOUR FACE AND PREVENTS FLAIR-UPS.</li>
            <li> I have very oilyt skin.I have used this product since I was a child..&lt;br /&gt;I am using it two times a day.</li>
            <li> I love buying on Amazon and decided to check for this product, which I currently use (I had used the original Bonne Bell 1006 for 56 years!). But the price on Amazon is WAY out of line. You can buy this exact product directly from the Formula 10.0.6 website for $5.99. I regularly buy it in quantities of 6 or 8, just for convenience. I am astounded at the price this seller is asking, unless this is for a multiple-pack order (and I don&#x27;t see anywhere that it is). Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I found a long, lost friend.  I had used Bonny Bell 1006 facial cleanser for many-many years and then it suddenly disappeared.  The Amazon site even gave me an explanation for why I couldn&#x27;t find it --  formula 1006 was sold to another company - but it&#x27;s still the same thing, even says so on the back of the bottle .Thanks for reconnecting me with the new name.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve found that cleans my face without drying it,  Been using it for the past 50ears.</li>
            <li> an old formula that still works better than the modern stuff.  may have to order it by the case thanks ...A+</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they came back with this product. I&#x27;ve been using it since I was a teenager. They had suspended it for a while and I couldn&#x27;t find it. When I saw it at Amazon, I was delighted. The only product that helps me keep my adult acne under control.</li>
            <li> My grandmother worked in cosmetics at a well known department store.  She introduced me to Bonne Bell 10-0-6 lotion when I was in 7th grade.  I never had a skin problem - ever.  I have always used it. I am now 74 yrs. old and we use it at our house for a number of reasons.  Can&#x27;t do without it.  I had a problem finding it and was thrilled to be able to order it.  Thank you much.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least 40 years. I have strangers ask me what I use on my skin on a steady basis. Get many many compliments on my complexion. 1006 has been with me forever.</li>
            <li> My Mom uses this and has used it for years. She loves it!</li>
            <li> I believe this is a toned down version of the original 10.0.6 which cleaned so well. Since the original is gone forever this will have to do. And it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> I have been using 10.0.6 for over 30 years. When I purchased this So Totally Clean original formula I was so excited to find it again. But when I used it there was one big difference...the scent!! There used to be a scent after it dried that I loved. No more do I have the \\&quot;me\\&quot; smell that was a favorite of my husband and daughter and even my mom and sisters. Is there a different MORE ORIGINAL formula?</li>
            <li> the only product i have found to stop the &#x27;peeling&#x27; on my forehead</li>
            <li> It cleans all the extra dirt that normal makeup removers leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the cap.  It should have a dispenser cap.</li>
            <li> have used this product for about 50 years, off and on, as it became increasingly difficult to find in stores. Thank heaven for online shopping and those who still stock this incredible skin product. Really great at cleaning, especially the oily areas of the face.</li>
            <li> flashing back to high school</li>
            <li> Identical to the original formula.  Smells great.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, but not as good as the original formula, seem to be  watered down A LOT!!</li>
            <li> This is not the original formula.  I have some of the original formula I bought quite some time ago, and wish I had purchased more.  It was made in Australia and distributed by Bonne Bell in Lakewood, OH.  I know this product, because I used it for decades starting as a teenager, then stopped for quite a while and had a hard time locating it again.  Now they have changed the formula (even though they say it is original, I do not believe it); they have removed resorcinol and replaced it with other ingredients.  In googling about resorcinol I have learned that it is considered to be an endocrine disrupter.  That sounds not too good, but for me, this product was the best cleanser I have ever had, and I am sorry to see it go.  Does anyone know anything about the health effects of resorcinol?  Is it possible that as an endocrine disrupter the old formula could contribute to breast cancer?</li>
            <li> Amazon.com: Formula 10-0-6 Totally Clean Deep Pore Cleanser ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this to many others after Bonnie&lt;br /&gt;Bell sold the original 10-0-6.&lt;br /&gt;Great product mostly for pre-teen and teens to help them through their skin issues</li>
            <li> Not as good as Bonnie Bell original 10-0-6, but, I haven&#x27;t been able to buy it in years.&lt;br /&gt;It is the next best thing I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> Felt nostalgic, so I ordered it.  Doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as I remembered, but it has been 35 years since I was a teenager.  It is a great skin refresher.  And even though I have 50 year old skin now, it is not drying.  After spending time outside in 100 degree summer heat, or at the gym, it feels like a clean cooling pick me up.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any dry or flaky skin.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product from my early teens (until it disappeared from retail shelves in my 20&#x27;s). Never had to deal with acne, or clogged pores. Occasional zits got zapped before they started. Awesome! The formula&#x27;s secret  ingredient, allantoin, is a &#x27;sister&#x27; of RETINOL! (I bought it by the gallon!) Then, adult acne attacked! Awful!  BUT my treasured skin care had DISAPPEARED. I resorted to expensive &#x27;designer&#x27; acne treatments, without the same results! Suddenly, 10.06 turned up as &amp;#34;So Totally Clean&amp;#34;. TA-DA, my skin is smooth, clear &amp; glowing, again, at 70!! I have few facial wrinkles, or crow&#x27;s feet. My skin should look like a road map, after baking in the hot sun most of my adult life. Instead, people are stunned at my age! (Unless they see my dry, wrinkled, and spotted arms &amp; legs. I should have used those gallons on my entire body!) PS The only difference in the &#x27;new&#x27; 10.06 is it&#x27;s a little diluted but works just as well as ever! Liquid gold!!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT. WOULD RECOMMEND TO FRIENDS</li>
            <li> I love this toner! It&#x27;s the only one I can find with a low salicylic acid content of 0.5%, so it&#x27;s not to harsh or drying for my adult/acne prone/combo skin! Helps keep my pores clean and helps dry up current blemishes.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this multiple times.  It is an excellent product and I was very satisfied with the delivery.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase .</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to people of all ages.  It&#x27;s AWESOME and the scent is fresh. My grandmother bought this for me when I was in the junior high school. Acne starting to get out of hand. She said my face would get worse for a day or two, but that was the 10-0-6 cleansing my skin. It did get worse, but when it cleared up, it was fantastic.  I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find this again, will never use anything else ever again.</li>
            <li> I have used 10-0-6 for years &amp; years &amp; I love it.I was unaware the name had changed until a couple of years ago I tried to find it under its old name, Bonne Belle 10-0-6.  Totally Clean has the same ingredients as Bonne Belle 10-0-6 but only the name has changed.  I went with a friend to a cosmetic surgeon&#x27;s office where she was going to have a laser procedure for lines on her face.  The surgeon looked at me and said whatever I&#x27;ve been doing, keep it up because I didn&#x27;t have any lines on my face. I attribute this to 10-0-6. I would have been lost without my 10-0-6 on a safari trip to East Africa. While on safari for 5 days, I kept a small travel size of 10-0-6 &amp; some cotton pads in the pocket of my safari pants. Several times a day I would use the 10-0-6 to clean away the dirt &amp; perspiration so my face would be totally clean before I reapplied sunscreen. I always had a fresh clean face even in the Serengeti or traveling on the dusty roads in Tanzania, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe or Zanzibar.  So Totally Clean is an amazing product although I think the word \\&quot;So\\&quot; is unnecessary...just the words \\&quot;Totally Clean\\&quot; says it all.</li>
            <li> Supposed to be the newly packaged Ten-O-Six of yesteryear. Formula doesn&#x27;t appear to be exactly the same. Still effective, pleasant fragrance. would highly recommend for anyone bothered by blackheads and occasional breakouts</li>
            <li> I love this! I grew up using 10 0 6 lotion &amp; I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still around.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 47 YEARS!!!  I have never found anything else that cleaned my skin of makeup yet left it feeling soft and smooth afterward.  I put it on a cotton pad, wipe off my makeup, flip the pad over to make sure I haven&#x27;t missed anything, and that&#x27;s it.  It is so great at the end of a long day, and so simple.  I was terrified a few years back when I went to buy it online (I always buy six at a time, usually wind up giving some away to my kids) and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  That&#x27;s when I discovered the new name.  As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s been pretty much the same ingredient-wise for all these years.</li>
            <li> Removes makeup easily and reduces pores. I have used it for years. Wish it were easier to find at stores.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, So Totally Clean Cleanser is not the same as the original ten-o-six formula.  The bottle contains less than half as much as the original formula bottles for the same price.  Bonne Bell should go back to their original formula of ten-o-six and I&#x27;m sure many people would be much happier with their product.</li>
            <li> I can definitely feel that this toner makes my face super clean. It shocks me to see how much residue this toner can pick up even after exfoliating and cleansing my face. However, I did not see a huge difference in my acne, and the smell is very strong of alcohol. If you don&#x27;t like that strong smell, then try to buy the sensitive formula.</li>
            <li> Unavailable for years.  This is a great deep cleanser.  Great scent.  Leaves you feeling clean.  Doesn&#x27;t over-dry Reminds me of my youth...</li>
            <li> Great product, Fair pricing.</li>
            <li> I looked all over for this product and found it here on Amazon! Used this cleanser for years and my husband uses it after he shaves. So pleased to find it!</li>
            <li> Been using this as Bonne Belle since I was 12 and that&#x27;s 60 years ago. Glad I can still get it. Thank you</li>
            <li> I just turned 59 and have been using 10-0-6 since I was 15 !  I am so glad to find it again. When it became hard to find, the drugstore I could still get it from stopped carrying it so I turned to AMAZON.I am able to get it delivered to my door. How easy is that ! My face thanks you ! Summer or winter I clean my face with 10-0-6 lotion/NOT soap. Thanks again to Amazon and the market place people that findthehard to find items.&lt;br /&gt;Jane E Vann</li>
            <li> It does a good job making your face really clean !&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that you carry this product again.</li>
            <li> I use to use this facial cleanser when I was a teenager and just fell in love with it.  My skin was so clear, soft, smooth, and blemish free.  I did not have trouble with acne and did not want to and this cleaner prevented all of that and I am 54 years of age and it still works like it did back in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it this rating because its just that good and an outstanding product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would reccommend this product to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is I wish I could get more of it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Have used it for 35 years. Does a nice cleansing.</li>
            <li> Smells great&lt;br /&gt;But irritated my skin</li>
            <li> Slightly different from the original but still the best toner out there for my skin</li>
            <li> I have been using judiciously my last bottles of Bonnie Bell&#x27;s 10-0-6 product, which I have used since I was 13. I am now 67. To find this equivalent product is a wonderful thing!  I hope you will continue to have it.</li>
