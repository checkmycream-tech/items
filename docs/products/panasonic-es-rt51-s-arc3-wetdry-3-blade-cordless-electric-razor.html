            <li>it works good and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>This one is no different...solid build, good cut (nothing will be as close as a razor) for a great price (under $60).</li>
            <li>This shaver is built well, looks great, &amp; does a good job for me.</li>
            <li>Excellent shaver, holds its charge for many shaves...</li>
            <li>In fact, the battery life is one of the most impressive things about this device.</li>

            <li>Great shaved and good price</li>
            <li>I use a Neutrogena shave lotion, some warm water, the the Panasonic performs just like a razor without the burn or cuts!  </li>
            <li>Does the job, nothing particularly remarkable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d like to give all of you some good advice on how to get a great electric shave.</li>
            <li>The one thing that I&#x27;m most impressed with is the battery.  </li>
            <li>If it gave a good shave it would be a very nice item.</li>
            <li>It fits my needs, has nice feel, and is a good price!</li>
            <li>and this one is a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>They say it is very easy to get a good shave!</li>
            <li>Charging this is very easy as it has a display to indicate the battery life of the shaver!</li>
            <li>amazon the pest good  item.</li>
            <li>good quality for the price</li>
            <li>I think is a good pirchase</li>
            <li>all was good.</li>
            <li>good service</li>
            <li>They are good designs and priced well.</li>
            <li>The cheapest one available with the best reviews was the Panasonic ES-RT51-s.  </li>
            <li>Quite, gives a good shave</li>
            <li>This surprisingly did not.</li>
            <li>life is good.  </li>
            <li>HE SAID GO AND BUY YOU AN ELECTRIC RAZOR (A GOOD ONE )</li>
            <li>A GOOD ONE.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I used foil type Remington Shavers for years...and loved them.</li>
            <li>The trimmer adjustment is really good.</li>
            <li>Good for sideburns and nape of neck/hairline.     </li>
            <li>Discount brands are not as good setting up your beard.</li>
            <li>Not as good as a blade</li>
            <li>loved that this was waterproof, and could be used in the shower and with shaving cream/gel.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, this electric razor otherwise functions as advertised.</li>
            <li>You must move slower to get a good shave, but the shave IS good.  </li>
            <li>good razor for the price.</li>
            <li>I got it for under $50, which makes it a good value too.</li>
            <li>Not so good of a product.</li>
            <li>Holds a good charge.</li>
            <li>Good price point.  </li>
            <li>After my boyfriend fighting with his shaver for MONTHS before Christmas it was time to invest in a good one.  </li>
            <li>good quality</li>
            <li>It is not as good as the lady&#x27;s shaver (though it is sharper and shaves closer), for my purposes.</li>
            <li>This gift for my husband was a good choice.  </li>
            <li>Good ergonomics, (weight, balance, shape).</li>
            <li>Good buy for the price.</li>
            <li>Does good shaving.</li>
            <li>I got what I pay for , doesn&#x27;t shave good</li>
            <li>As good as advertised.</li>
            <li>I imagine this one is just as good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just that good.</li>
            <li>Good weight and well balanced.  </li>
            <li>The reviews looked good</li>
            <li>I have been using a Phillips Norelco Razor for years (the type with the three spinning disks), and I could never get a good shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The battery indicator is actually surprisingly helpful as well.  </li>
            <li>Decided to try an Arc 3 8103  and loved it.</li>
            <li>Good price for good quality .</li>
            <li>Good product... recomended 100%</li>
            <li>A good close shave, which is what this razor gives.</li>
            <li>Good product does good job .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of electric razors (Braun, Norelco, Remington and Walgreens) and this Panasonic is probably the best value available.</li>
            <li>Smoothest Shave and good battery life.</li>
            <li>Using a shaving gell felt really good with this shaver.</li>
            <li>But the Panasonic is a superior shaver compared to others in its class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>think I got a good product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, it does not do a good job shaving you.</li>
            <li>The person it was bought for loved it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;good good</li>
            <li>I still believe that any electric razor will never be as good as a blade.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The trimmer is not as good as my beard trimmer (go figure), but works in a pinch.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic wet/dry sounded like a good choice as the price was comparable to the replacement blades for Norelco.</li>
            <li>Seems like a good value</li>
            <li>Battery is good for about 14 shaves but</li>
            <li>a couple years would be nice lol...</li>
            <li>good shaver.</li>
            <li>Good batter life.</li>
            <li>works good</li>
            <li>It gives a good close shave.</li>
            <li>The shaver gives a good shave.</li>
            <li>It shaves good.</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>It has a good appearance and I like the t-handle</li>
            <li>The battery is good.</li>
            <li>Side-burn razor works good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have felt it was a good bargain.</li>
            <li>Does a really good job for the price.</li>
            <li>Does a good job retaining the shavings/whisker dust as well, so I can walk around the house or use it while reading the computer screen, etc...</li>
            <li>probably a good choice for anyone needing a travel razor, or just likes the convenience of rechargeable.</li>
            <li>This is about as good of an electric razor as you&#x27;re going to find today.</li>
            <li>Good price, prompt shipping.  </li>
            <li>Good price, good warranty ( 2 years ).</li>
            <li>THE PRICE WAS GOOD, BUT</li>
            <li>but i didn&#x27;t work good at all</li>
            <li>I like Panasonic razors and this one is a good one.</li>
            <li>anyway good deal for me.</li>
            <li>I bought for my hubby and he loved it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do jaw line good for me..</li>
            <li>Good shave for about 9 months.  </li>
            <li>My husband loved it.</li>
            <li>Good value too.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I got a good deal on it.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice razor with some nice features.</li>
            <li>a clean face gives me the best shave).</li>
            <li>great razor consistently gives a close shave, and feels great doing it!  </li>
            <li>Liked this shaver so much I bought another one!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>the razor was a gift for a special person, and he is very happy with the shaver, said never had one like it.  </li>
            <li>This one is very smooth and never hurts my face and works great in the shower as well.</li>
            <li>Although it gives a very good shave I cannot give it 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t give me that ultra smooth close shave all over my face.</li>
            <li>This is a very light razor, easy to handle and has an excellent trimmer.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>This is what I bought and I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I owned a Panasonic 8033 shaver and was very pleased with it</li>
            <li>I am so happy not to need a separate cleaning system, but can use something that most all of us have,</li>
            <li>and I have been very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>but he was very pleased with the ease and end</li>
            <li>Gives great shaves, love it...</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with my purchase of this razor.</li>
            <li>I love the razor does as great job</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the latest model, but it has everything I want and the price is great.</li>
            <li>Been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It does look very nice and the display is ok.</li>
            <li>Can clean up the beard, very good.</li>
            <li>It gives me a good shave and cleans our very easy.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>gave this shaver a FIVE star, but I wish I could give it more!</li>
            <li>after many contacts with Panasonic attempting to  obtain the brush, I felt like I was dealing with Washington!</li>
            <li>so just a ok shaver!</li>
            <li>I cannot imagine a better shave!</li>
            <li>Am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>is has a higher speed and doesn&#x27;t grab, but I&#x27;m not too impressed with either one of them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still in the process of \\&quot;training\\&quot; my beard, but the results have been phenomenal and NO RAZOR RASH !</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li>Exactly what was hoping for...this inexpensive Panasonic shaver is perfect for my husband&#x27;s needs.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It made him happy to be able to do some self care with this easy to use shaver!</li>
            <li>Also very easy to keep clean and gets a very good shave.</li>
            <li>A very nice shaver, easy to use</li>
            <li>The shave is great; the razor is comfortable to hold and it runs quieter than any others I have owned.  </li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.  </li>
            <li>friend who recommended this amazing shaver, told me that he has been on it for 3+years and the shaver still perform it&#x27;s duty..</li>
            <li>I can take a nice leisurely shave on my drive in and it still registers 80% charge.  </li>
            <li>It gives him a nice close shave and he can handle it well, given the problems with his hands.  </li>
            <li>Nice feature: displays the remaining battery charge in 10% decrements.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s that good love it.</li>
            <li>No razor burn, and this all done with no water,shaving cream,or lotion of any kind.      </li>
            <li>Holds a charge for 6+ shaves and gives me a nice, close shave.  </li>
            <li>I think you get a really nice shave either way.</li>
            <li>Nicely, the foil heads are inter changeable with the 31 RT, so I have 2 to use again.</li>
            <li>Keep it charged up, however, and it does the job nicely.</li>
            <li>This is the 5th Panasonic shaver I own.</li>
            <li>The charge indicator is nice.</li>
            <li>Panasonic shavers are the best and this one shaves close and fast.</li>
            <li>Overall, great value for money with a great shave!</li>
            <li>The wet/dry shaving aspect is nice too - you can use shaving cream, use it in the shower, etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This shaver gives me a nice close shave and causes virtually no irritation.  </li>
            <li>Now we each have one of our own.</li>
            <li>I thought the power indicator was a nice feature.</li>
            <li>it has a side burn trimmer which is handy.</li>
            <li>It contours nicely to your hand.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES RT51S gets a four star rating for providing a close shave that is nearly as good as the top of the line models offered by Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I have found that to shave effectively</li>
            <li>I used to own a Remington  rotary razor cordless.</li>
            <li>The lower part of the shaver becomes slightly warm during recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice razor and all</li>
            <li>pop-up trimmer is handy and effective.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really give me the best results.</li>
            <li>Provides a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li>It charged within an hour and the numerical battery indicator was a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice combination wet/dry shaver.....</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best shaver I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>This is an all around nice model for a medium beard.  </li>
            <li>The ES-RT51-S looks nice</li>
            <li>nice.</li>
            <li>His was thrilled with it and the features it has.</li>
            <li>Honestly this razor is a bargin and works</li>
            <li>Nice features and charging system but does not cut my beard close by any means.  </li>
            <li>Braun &amp; Remington, who used to make the best electric razors, absolutely stink today.</li>
            <li>My dad tried it and he liked it.</li>
            <li>I found I liked it and decided to upgrade to this ES-RT51.  </li>
            <li>This shaver gets the job done in an effective manner.</li>
            <li>That feature is handy if you neglect to charge it.</li>
            <li>My husband was delighted to be able to find another Panasonic razor.  </li>
            <li>it is nice</li>
            <li>It has a nice reassuring heft to it as well.</li>
            <li>I particularily liked the fact that it could be cleaned by rinsing with water.</li>
            <li>It is a nice shaver.</li>
            <li>However, this Panasonic does a nice job, and I like having the built-in trimmer.</li>
            <li>Very nice and comfortable</li>
            <li>Shaver gave a very good close shave and charging was very fast.</li>
            <li>With the caveat that I am someone with a very light beard, I am very satisfied with its performance.  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic is made with high quality and does an excellent job.</li>
            <li>Free shipping is nice too!</li>
            <li>Good shave, easy to clean, great value</li>
            <li>I have been using Panasonic wet/dry shavers for about 5 years and my new ES-RT51-S 3 gives me the best shave yet.</li>
            <li>Best shave when used wet, but either way it will give you a great shave.</li>
            <li>It is great for a quick shave when in a hurry or maybe out camping.</li>
            <li>This shaver holds a good charge and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Works great, charges quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this model shaver for many years, and love it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>If I enjoyed shaving, the Panasonic would rate 5 stars for eternal love!</li>
            <li>Great Shaver...and charges up very fast!</li>
            <li>This shaver does a good job of shaving, and the trimmer works just fine.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and gets a very good charge in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>I was the proud owner of a made in Japan ultrasonic wet/dry shaver that lasted pretty close to 15 years!  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping but quality of razor wasn&#x27;t very good</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is by far the BEST ELECTRIC RAZOR</li>
            <li>As far as using this shaver with shave gel or foam, pre-shave oil feels best.  </li>
            <li>It was good value for money, and free shipping.</li>
            <li>This is by near the best electric cordless shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li>After 6 months of using it, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s so far the best electric razor for me.</li>
            <li>This was absolutely perfect for my 91 year old Dad.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to be able to use this shaver in the shower.</li>
            <li>Wow, very impressed with this item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 65 years old and this razor is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This unit has more difficulty catching longer hairs, even if I miss shaving for two days, than the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My legs are nice and smooth!</li>
            <li>Good for light shaving and on the go.</li>
            <li>Great recharging process, good system for alerting that battery is low, feels good in the hand, gives a good, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>If you want something you can grow with and maneuver more comfortably, I&#x27;d recommend a good ol&#x27; hair trimmer, you know the kind that often come with numbered attachments, bottle of lubricant, brush, ect.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best electric razor I have had ...</li>
            <li>It comfortable to hold and using, and the battery life is good.</li>
            <li>This is a very fine product.</li>
            <li>is a very fine product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i love the panasonic brand and have found them to be the best for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This one is really great because it actually cuts and the &amp;#34;side burn trimmer&amp;#34; works great on the bikini line.  </li>
            <li>I am comparing this to two others one a Remington Rotary and one a Braun foil and the Panasonic feels better in the hand and seems to have a better quality and the comfort of the Panasonic is amazing</li>
            <li>Excellent Shaver, used everyday and works great.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, and the battery has great life--charged it two+ weeks ago</li>
            <li>the price was very reasonable and the product had great reviews.</li>
            <li>Great Deal &amp; Very Fast Shipping</li>
            <li>but is nothing special but good for the price</li>
            <li>, I actually enjoyed shaving, it&#x27;s quick, easy, no cuts and best I could wash everything under water to keep it clean.</li>
            <li>great razor, fast, cuts closely, easy on the face, fast charging, holds the charge, excellent!</li>
            <li>I replaced the blades yearly, as advertised, and was pretty happy with the results.</li>
            <li>It feels very comfortable in my hand and</li>
            <li>It is also very light weight for travel.</li>
            <li>The battery is good for 6 to 8 shaves and it charges quickly.  </li>
            <li>I had the Panasonic ES8103 and then went to this one when I needed a new one since it had good reviews and was a good price.</li>
            <li>he&#x27;s never had an electric razor and has loved how smooth and easy this is to use.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a nice electric razor that would provide a nice quick shave for legs and underarms.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This shaver is excellent, I am using electric razors for more than 20 years, this one is really really makes the cut, very close shave, in the beginning I had some irritation, maybe because the foil isn&#x27;t hyper-allergic, or something else, but after a week or so, the skin got used to it, huge upgrade from 30 series, nice motor buzzing!</li>
            <li>Good value, comfortable shave, very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Charges quick cleans easy!!</li>
            <li>What a huge contrast in Service!  </li>
            <li>So if you shave in the car like me make sure you charge it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this model razor for about 10 years and it is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>and I realy love it.</li>
            <li>So if you are traveling for more than a week, you will need to bring the charger cable, which is somewhat bulky.</li>
            <li>Im sure theres better out there, but not at the price.</li>
            <li>and I was so pleased with this one.  </li>
            <li>I would gladly get another for him...</li>
            <li>As you&#x27;d expect, as the blades become duller, more passes are required.  </li>
            <li>but I sure am glad I did.</li>
            <li>but this razor is much better.</li>
            <li>It did an ok job.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this shaver.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for the closest shave better get a 5 blade Razor.</li>
            <li>I love them for weekend shaves, since women dig the Saturday evening scruff effect.</li>
            <li>A more powerful motor means the  blades work faster, so I am very favorably impressed.  </li>
            <li>On top of that, the price just rocks.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve become more prone to cuts or nicks to my face with a razor.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found it to be much better than the ES-RT51-s</li>
            <li>I truly cannot understand why Panasonic decided to produce such a piece of junk after it once had the best shavers on the market.  </li>
            <li>One of many Panasonic wet/dry shavers, which can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li>This makes it nice and smooth for whomever may be feeling it, aside from me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I would want anything more.</li>
            <li>shaving quality, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall quite pleased with this shaver and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>but I know many women don&#x27;t shave there.  </li>
            <li>That being said, a razor will always give you a closer shave (with more irritation).</li>
            <li>Initially I was very happy with the ES-RT51.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t trust their build quality any more.</li>
            <li>Here lies the Achilles heal to most Panasonic shavers:    </li>
            <li>Now I will be able to charge my shaver</li>
            <li>More often then not i have to use my razor to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>FOR MANY YEARS,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;D BEEN PLAGUED WITH FOR MANY YEARS .  </li>
            <li>In fact, even superior to the old Remington shavers that I loved.</li>
            <li>They love it and have no complaints about it at all.</li>
            <li>When traveling, be sure to use the plastic blade cover.</li>
            <li>Also got one of these shavers for my son who likes it better than his Norelco.</li>
            <li>Simply the best bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>Simply the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Braun shaver for so many years I can&#x27;t remember.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never paying $300 for a shaver again, that&#x27;s for danged sure.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES-RT51 is so much better than the Braun 370</li>
            <li>get a better shave.</li>
            <li>This is a ok shaver</li>
            <li>I have found that most electric razors do not give me a close shave.  </li>
            <li>the Flexible Pivoting Head help to cut all, and works better whe</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I should have known better - you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>However, I find myself actually enjoying the shave now.</li>
            <li>Perhaps even better than a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the razor...</li>
            <li>Love thse Panasonic razors.</li>
            <li>This one is much better in that arena, and a wet/dry to boot.  </li>
            <li>He was able to use it by himself, without me having to help him.</li>
            <li>Very close shave and great value for the money.</li>
            <li>I had one just like it for many years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Under the chin and neck which has always been the most stubborn area I am still satisfied by the performance of this</li>
            <li>Maybe there are better electric razors out there</li>
            <li>very happy with my product and would definitely recommend it to others</li>
            <li>I have had many brands through the years</li>
            <li>I love the wet/dry option.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would try a foil razor because many reviews indcated they gave a closer shave for a heavier beard.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I wish this could give me more of a closer shave.</li>
            <li>but if you are more than 30...</li>
            <li>It is okay</li>
            <li>I have used many electric shavers in my lifetime including name brands like Norelco, Braun and Remington.</li>
            <li>and I can get more than 10 shaves per charge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if there&#x27;s a lot more hair one would have to charge more often.  </li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s more of a gimmick than anything.</li>
            <li>bought this Panasonic and it was so much better than anything I had ever owned.</li>
            <li>Does not shave well, if you have more than a days growth.</li>
            <li>This shaver is ok thought it was the liner blade system that Panasonic has</li>
            <li>I was very happy with it initially.  </li>
            <li>but after 7 years the battery was still better than the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>My husband says its The best shaver, he&#x27;s personally ever had the experience of using.</li>
            <li>I MORE THAN PLEASED WITH THIS RAZOR.</li>
            <li>How many things can you say about a razor that does not cut.</li>
            <li>This thing would be better at doing an oil change on my car than as a razor.</li>
            <li>This is more sophisticated and has a helpful power meter.</li>
            <li>I wish there was more options to trim</li>
            <li>and i love the battery life percentage.</li>
            <li>This is the case with most electric razors these days.</li>
            <li>I use it along with a trimmer (since the lady&#x27;s shaver has a trimmer and this newer, better shaver does not):</li>
            <li>This electric shaver replaced another Panasonic from many many years ago.  </li>
            <li>this shave better than Norelco...</li>
            <li>However, this latest model died on me within six months.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a rotary shaver, I believe you will get a better shave</li>
            <li>better than any Braun or Norelco I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and works great.</li>
            <li>I switched on a dozen more times.</li>
            <li>woman&#x27;s electric shaver, Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver, was much better than this shaver.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll just keep supplying this shaver with replacements, as needed, thank you. :)</li>
            <li>Pass on this one and spend more money.</li>
            <li>And unlike the top of the line models, the rechargeable batteries in the RT51S can be replaced.</li>
            <li>Good battery life and easy to clean under running water.  </li>
            <li>Works better than my Braun and hold a longer charge.</li>
            <li>I had to apply more pressure to get some sort of result and doing so resulted in a world of pain.</li>
            <li>If you want my opinion don&#x27;t buy, it just causes more pain, and that&#x27;s why I returned it.</li>
            <li>I always missed many hairs, and if I got too close to the skin, it began to burn.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>For my face the flatter head surface does a slightly better job than the 8103</li>
            <li>I looked at so many and compared them all.  </li>
            <li>I will surely recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Have to press more that I would like.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>and I love the battery charge indicator.  </li>
            <li>Gave me the best shave next to a blade and no cuts.</li>
            <li>Gets the hairs on neck unlike most electrics.</li>
            <li>This razor allows him to safely shave himself without all the fuss.</li>
            <li>The reviews of this razor compared more favourably than the equivalent from Philips or Braun.</li>
            <li>but I end up doing that most days as this doesn&#x27;t get the stuble.</li>
            <li>No doubt, this is the best three blade shaver I have had the pleasure of owning, my third.</li>
            <li>I take leisurely shaves, probably longer than most without irritation.</li>
            <li>If you shave every day, it works much better.</li>
            <li>For me, since my skin never gets used to it (tried for many years), I prefer the electric overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this unit for several weeks now and am very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>love my Panasonic ES-RT51-S3</li>
            <li>Its ok for now.</li>
            <li>a Norelco might suit that person better.</li>
            <li>For the price, the Panasonic ES8103 is a much better razor</li>
            <li>so pay more and get a better shave -</li>
            <li>So, the shaver ended up costing me $12 more</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t too many reviews by women for a man&#x27;s razor.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it</li>
            <li>For the price it is ok</li>
            <li>Panasonic has always been my favorite razor.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic shaves closer than the rotary, but takes more passes to catch every hair.</li>
            <li>They provide excellent service and last three to four years.  </li>
            <li>So, if I had it to do over again, I&#x27;d do more research and get a better model.  </li>
            <li>This is something I&#x27;ve noticed from Panasonic for many years and one of the reasons I bought it, as they rarely make anything that isn&#x27;t good.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t expect much more out of this one.</li>
            <li>so I wanted a product from a reputable company but not outragously priced.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several elecric shavers and found (for the money) that this is one of the best.</li>
            <li>Love the battery indicator on the front of the shaver.</li>
            <li>The difference I&#x27;m experiencing is that i need to do more passes with this shaver to get the job done.</li>
            <li>Love the way it shaves.  </li>
            <li>I will keep it, but use it for travel mostly.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it with shaving cream, maybe that will be better.  </li>
            <li>Trimming blade could be better.</li>
            <li>Fantastic appliance; built like a watch and shaved as well as an old Remington, which is to say, perfectly.</li>
            <li>It simply gives me the best shave with the smoothest skin ever.  </li>
            <li>Ok shaver.</li>
            <li>Love this shaver</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for the price.</li>
            <li>and I love the battery level indicator.  </li>
            <li>, Silver works a lot better than my Norelco.</li>
            <li>It does not leave as many razor stubs.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>I am pleased with its performance...</li>
            <li>100% better than the cheap lady electric razors!</li>
            <li>What more can a person ask for?</li>
            <li>The display is great and very helpful for not running out of power.</li>
            <li>it did a better job.</li>
            <li>the reason why I gave 4  stara from 5 is that you can not shave with it while charging, but everything is ok</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using &#x27;many brand&#x27; of shaver for more than 15years..</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>and I am sure I shave longer than most.  </li>
            <li>Pop the top, run cover under water, run razor under water while turned on</li>
            <li>I wish it came with a better bag/case.  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic is easily my favorite razor to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyone considering using an electric shaver after many years of using a razor and shave cream should look into trying this shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just looking for quality at the best possible price.</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s considered cheap, so be it!</li>
            <li>The results are much better, too.</li>
            <li>THIS SHAVER DOES OK.  </li>
            <li>I would probably have done better with a lithium battery.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying this raiser but I would still like a closer shave without going over my face so many times.</li>
            <li>I think it should give more options&lt;</li>
            <li>Maybe a rotary one would do a better job.</li>
            <li>I shave after taking a shower and use a face scrub before going into the shower to make sure my face isn&#x27;t oily at all when shaving.</li>
            <li>Most men do this to get a closer shave (but at the cost of in-grown hairs)&lt;br</li>
            <li>and glad I did.  </li>
            <li>The ES-LV61-A is even better by the way, but that will have to be a separate review.</li>
            <li>Much better than the rotating head type razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this a week, and already I love it.</li>
            <li>It replaces an over-the-hill Remington MS3 1000, and is vastly better: quieter, faster, closer.  </li>
            <li>I still love it.  </li>
            <li>Quite possibly better than my Braun</li>
            <li>nice close shave for a cheap price.  </li>
            <li>For how I&#x27;m using the item, I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I switched to the Panasonic and it has performed better than any of the Norelco products that I have used over the years.</li>
            <li>maybe a Braun would be a better way to go.</li>
            <li>it sure beats any Braun razor that I have owned.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see the point in paying more.</li>
            <li>Much better then</li>
            <li>I am satisfied to the point that I won&#x27;t be returning it, but if I could find another ES3041, I&#x27;d deep-six</li>
            <li>The shaver uses a Lithium ion battery, not the outmoded Nickel Cadmium type that most cheap-quality, battery-powered consumer products come with.  </li>
            <li>but Iâ€™d prefer the gauge to be more</li>
            <li>It works very well for that purpose and was a great deal.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I waited.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I have it.</li>
            <li>mostly I&#x27;m the shower.</li>
            <li>Norelco is better.</li>
            <li>So glad I puchased it.</li>
            <li>The design fits comfortably in my hand and the shaving head does a nice job working against the grain on my beard.</li>
            <li>Love it all aspects as an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>this is the best electric razor I have owned, although i have only tried the cheaper varieties.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had many.</li>
            <li>Seems ok and I like it</li>
            <li>so this is okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for many years.</li>
            <li>Will them one more try.</li>
            <li>Ok  there are better shavers.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought one.</li>
            <li>It does the job, have to go over shaved area many times to get the desired results.</li>
            <li>I feel like I need to make so many passes with this</li>
            <li>Am quite pleased with the razor.  </li>
            <li>but i forgot what it was called, i fell in love with that one and now ive fallen in love with this one, close shave, doesnt jam up, rechargable,</li>
            <li>what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>(That shaver cost $20 more than this one).  </li>
            <li>For the price, it seems to be just about right and feels good.  </li>
            <li>A VERY NICE QUALITY RAZOR FOR A REASONABLE PRICE.</li>
            <li>Good clean and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>My husband found it easy to use, good quality, and a good replacement for an old one like it.</li>
            <li>The foil on the older razor is still going great after about 1.5 years use every day.</li>
            <li>I have had good Panasonic shavers in the past and I would say that this might be the best of them all.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cut very clean and evenly.</li>
            <li>AND IT GIVES A PRETTY GOOD SHAVE.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>The first was an ES4026NC which was, and still is, quite good</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>quit.would recommend at anytime.amazon&#x27;s price was pretty good also.</li>
            <li>OMG, my husband has been using this new shaver for a week now and he can&#x27;t stop raving about how great it is.  </li>
            <li>This one is easy to use and safe.</li>
            <li>The shave is nice and close, and it&#x27;s easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>very easy to clean .</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to clean up.  </li>
            <li>still on the first charge which is impressive, but it is new.</li>
            <li>very smooth and comfortable , pleasing outcome</li>
            <li>It has a good feel in my hand and gave a better shave than the older model.  </li>
            <li>Very good battery life and digital readout showing remaining battery life a plus.</li>
            <li>But overall very good product for the price.</li>
            <li>The RT51, though Chinese made, is a very good shaver.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a very good razor</li>
            <li>But finally I got smart and went on Amazon in advance of my flight to see him and found this great razor at this great price.  </li>
            <li>Great shave, light weight, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Works ok on smooth parts of face.</li>
            <li>Ended up buying a cheap Remington and it shaves much better.  </li>
            <li>Really great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far works great.</li>
            <li>I use it wet on my underarms and it works great too!!!  </li>
            <li>ES-RT51 seems to be quieter than my old model, which makes the wife happy.</li>
            <li>It does not eat away at the top of the beard like a safety razor and leaves my cheeks and neck smooth.  </li>
            <li>First time I used an electric razor and im very pleased with this one.</li>
            <li>That seems to be because I must do more than two or three passes over each area to get the smooth</li>
            <li>and I bought this to replace an old lady shaver that was not all that great to begin with.</li>
            <li>I was able to get a smooth shave both ways.</li>
            <li>One perspective I have is that the razor pivots quite a bit from side to side--more than up and down--and I&#x27;ve found that by engaging this aspect it gives me an even better shave.  </li>
            <li>It works fantastic and my shaves are as close as with most razors.</li>
            <li>Good shave without much irritation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Was very close to giving up on Panasonic, but have never had good results with the Braun products.</li>
            <li>It feels good to hold and that fact this it is wet/dry is a real bonus.</li>
            <li>However, if it won&#x27;t give a good shave, that doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>in all, a good shave for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It delivers a good reasonably close shave without the pulling sensation on the hairs which I have sometimes</li>
            <li>My son really finds it quite good and it suits his purposes.  </li>
            <li>still use this razor because I can run it across my face real quick after a shower, get most of the hair, then quickly finish up with a manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rarely shave with them, but they are exceptionally close, and once the blood stops flowing, I notice the shaver cut isn&#x27;t quite a match for a good old Mach 3.  </li>
            <li>Very precisely made and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>This razor gives me the best shave out of approximately 10 other mfr&#x27;s I have purchased before.  </li>
            <li>I originally brought this shaver thinking that a man&#x27;s electric shaver will cut the hair closer and better than a woman&#x27;s shaver.</li>
            <li>and yeah, I still have a full head of hair on my head!)</li>
            <li>I might even buy another one for the future, just because its that good!</li>
            <li>The battery charges very quickly though.</li>
            <li>Cleaning was a breeze, charging seems very quick and not deafening.    </li>
            <li>and I plan on replacing the blades when it recommends because it&#x27;s easy and not too</li>
            <li>Cleans easily.</li>
            <li>easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>Also cleans up under the tap very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use,</li>
            <li>Easy cleanup, and</li>
            <li>The movement of flexible pivoting head, designed for man face, is OPTIMUM for the legs adjusting to the contours and makes shaving SMOOTH, fast and easy.</li>
            <li>He can easily use this.</li>
            <li>Charge easily lasts about a week.  </li>
            <li>Trimmer angle makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy it will</li>
            <li>took away the foil to make sure the blades were not obstructed by anything, everything was clean and appeared to be in order.</li>
            <li>easy to clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s easy to grab the Panasonic shaver and shave while watching the news, on the throne, or anywhere...even in your car.  </li>
            <li>Easy to handle and use.</li>
            <li>The recharger is compact and easy to store at home or on a trip.</li>
            <li>The shaver is easy to use and gives you a close shave.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use and recharge.</li>
            <li>guard easily snaps on and off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Charges just as advertised-- very quickly.</li>
            <li>The rinse-clean is convenient and easy.  </li>
            <li>I love it, easy to use and clean after using it.</li>
            <li>got this for my husband because he seems to get razor burn easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is a very adequate shaver.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer blade on the back is a nice feature and does a good job on sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I am elderly and so I mainly want to shave and have it do a good job.</li>
            <li>Good charge, and shaves well with the main blades.  </li>
            <li>I never had a close shave like this from an electric razor, the battery is strong.</li>
            <li>Still a good  design and doesn&#x27;t really feel as cheap as it is.</li>
            <li>and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>realize that I should have attempted to return it; however, I have a strong adversity to the hassle of returns.</li>
            <li>and I used it for years and does as good of a job as the older one.  </li>
            <li>Great razor, very easy to use and holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li>It shaves OK but nothing special.</li>
            <li>: Nice close smooth shave, not as good as a blade but close enough.  </li>
            <li>I found a vendor on ebay (cost-$23), and replaced them myself, which was a tricky procedure that I managed to complete successfully.</li>
            <li>i kind of missed the recharging station at first but the battery holds</li>
            <li>Too much fuss to get a good, clean shave for my liking.</li>
            <li>Easy cleanup, long charge life and a good shave!</li>
            <li>Sanyo Enloop AA batteries to the rescue, which powers the unit fine.</li>
            <li>the charging system seems to be fine as well.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works fine.</li>
            <li>and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>It does fine for touch ups</li>
            <li>Battery life is fine.</li>
            <li>Works just fine .</li>
            <li>Best of all, I did not experience the typical razor burn that has plagued me for years.</li>
            <li>For my needs a lower priced model is fine.</li>
            <li>Light , easy charge, wet/dry cut</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price and Build quality is so fine &amp; GOOD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I get 6 years out of this razor and original battery like the other one, I&#x27;ll be a happy man!</li>
            <li>The Norelcos worked pretty good when they were fresh, but that was all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will say the recharge is quick!</li>
            <li>I love the quick charges as well as the power remaining screen.</li>
            <li>This new shaver gives a really nice shave and has better battery life than the ES4026NC.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: Very good razor; could be better with more reasonable long term support.</li>
            <li>Percent of Charge remaining digital window is a great feature and it&#x27;s easy to charge.&lt;br /&gt;Looks</li>
            <li>Easy to take apart and clean, easy to resemble.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, charges quikly after use, Easy to clean</li>
            <li>The product is easy to handle and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Love this electric razor, it charges very quickly lasts long, gives a close clean shave,  I&#x27;d buy another if this wasn&#x27;t already great.</li>
            <li>As I have a light beard it suits me just fine.</li>
            <li>My new Panasonic is excellent, I get the smoothest, cut free shave ever, better than multiple blade razors and the cut throat razor at the barbers...</li>
            <li>After using the 49.00 cheaper,slower motor panasonic razor I have found that the shavers with the super high speed motors are much better than the cheaper slower motor shavers, the cheaper ones work good but the higher speed motors work much better</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!  </li>
            <li>Clean shave and good battery life when it was new.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to find that the same razor was still available.  </li>
            <li>Works great without any gels or shaving fines, after shaving skin is smooth and is not bristly at all (!)</li>
            <li>This was a great purchase considering the vast range of prices and shaver types available.  </li>
            <li>Power is strong and the shaving is clean, but sometimes hurts the skin, not as smooth as the Philps I used before.</li>
            <li>I kind of wish I ordered the style that has the three circular shaving pads for more contour and pivot action</li>
            <li>Again though there&#x27;s a huge price difference between this shaver and my rotary.</li>
            <li>This shaver is a great gift that not only my husband gets to enjoy.</li>
            <li>However, after 1 year, the battery life greatly diminished with the shaver dying when the indicator light still showed 60% of charge left.</li>
            <li>Still same great shave.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Loves the shave - close and smooth.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s fairly easy to clean after shaving.</li>
            <li>None were cheap except the Remington.</li>
            <li>: shaves well, easy to clean, great build quality trimmer actually works, seems to use about 10% of the charge per shave</li>
            <li>: shaves well, easy to clean, great build quality trimmer actually works, seems to use about 10% of the charge per shave</li>
            <li>I just put on some shaving cream and in two or three minutes - smooth face.</li>
            <li>That is so great because that&#x27;s what died on my last shaver.  </li>
            <li>It is just as the advertisement claimed and it gives me a close smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It flexes just enough to follow your contours, and feels great in your hand.  </li>
            <li>so it wouldn&#x27;t move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that I get a great shave with this basic shaver</li>
            <li>ex: armpit, bikini, and thicker leg hair, which for me is only below the knee)&lt;br /&gt;-The extendable trimmer is a nifty addition, great for the bikini area</li>
            <li>It is cheap and good&lt;</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T BE CHEAP BUY</li>
            <li>The razor is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It dose such a great job that I can go 2 to three days without the need to save again</li>
            <li>The ES-RT-51 is a fantastic shaver.</li>
            <li>The shaver is smooth, and doesn&#x27;t bite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned 2 Panasonic shavers in the last 15 years...and was happy with each.</li>
            <li>Iâ€™ve been using, I want to give a detailed comparison here for anyone else whoâ€™s looking for a Braun alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just judging by sound.</li>
            <li>Smooth going against the hair to the touch!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to use it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll stick with razor blades for my primary shaving method.</li>
            <li>The cleaning is simply under water for practical and hygiene solution, which is great.</li>
            <li>but, shaving in the shower with gel is incredibly comfortable and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The noise is acceptable and easy to was and clean.</li>
            <li>I have a smooth face for this item.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and keeps the charge</li>
            <li>This shaver performs as advertised-a close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I have a relatively light beard, so I decided on a foil shaver instead of a rotary.</li>
            <li>I bought it because it gives me the shave I&#x27;m looking for, close, smooth, and no irritation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, recharge and has a trimmer.</li>
            <li>Comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>Amazon has been fantastic to work with</li>
            <li>and it was not giving me a smooth  shave.  </li>
            <li>This one is through and gentle and amazing.  </li>
            <li>After three months:  Fits my hand well / comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It leaves smooth shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to clean and the charge indicator  is a plus</li>
            <li>Compact &amp; light weight.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I use it for emergency sideburn trims, but I&#x27;d probably stay away from any precise mustache work at first.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Get the cheap Panasonic, and if you want wet/dry then this is the one.  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic shaver provides a smooth close shave.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and fits comfortably in my hand.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, close shaves and quieter than most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Contact was smooth and effortless.  </li>
            <li>Great travel and daily razor.</li>
            <li>a clicking sound</li>
            <li>such a great deal\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>or I leave my primary at home.</li>
            <li>but it just doesn&#x27;t compare to the Panasonic shaver that I got before that which was powerful, heavier and could tell it was made of better parts.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and use - have to fight off my wife so she may get one for mothers day</li>
            <li>it makes the Braun sound like a chain saw.  </li>
            <li>Strong, reliable, clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Light</li>
            <li>Smooth shave with no pulling.</li>
            <li>but it does a fair job of shaving; of course not equal to a safety razor but more comfortable to my face.  </li>
            <li>I actually enjoy shaving</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, and store.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic shaver is so easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>I like buying the cheap ones since the replacement blades are a rip off</li>
            <li>Went to amazon hoping to find a cheap razor and found this</li>
            <li>I found the shave to be quite close and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely buy another one, it is great product</li>
            <li>Fabulous purchase.</li>
            <li>The above heading should tell you that I am a proud Grandfather.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>The razor works as advertised and gives a close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>This came in handy for my vacation trip abroad, one charge lasted the whole trip.</li>
            <li>I only use it &amp;#34;dry,&amp;#34; but it works great.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and does the job nicely.</li>
            <li>though now I quite enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>of course, real razors are better as I never get a close  shave, no matter how many time i go over the area.</li>
            <li>It still works fairly well, except the battery has deteriorated to the point I cannot get two complete shaves without recharging.</li>
            <li>Does seem to be adequately waterproof, as I usually clean it under running water and have done so many times now.</li>
            <li>Very close shave and the digital read-out for power is great!</li>
            <li>This is the third Panasonic shaver I have owned, and it is absolutely the best electric shaver ever.  </li>
            <li>The razor gives a close shave, the charge lasts exactly one week, and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The charge lasts me about 3-4 full leg shaves, but it recharges very quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps in six months or a year or so, I&#x27;ll come back to this review and report my long term findings, but in the meantime, great shaver at a great price.</li>
            <li>Cleanup with soap and water mandatory after each use to keep the blades clean and running smoothly</li>
            <li>For once an electric razor that shaves smoothly and cleanly.</li>
            <li>Easy set up, quick charge, close shave.</li>
            <li>quick and easy return.</li>
            <li>I love Panasonic stuff normally, but this isn&#x27;t about what I love.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad shaver, just not quite as good as the old 3 head remington I had.</li>
            <li>up is easy and it recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>I love his smooth face thanks!</li>
            <li>br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied,&lt;br /&gt;Function is very strong for me,</li>
            <li>Their design has not changed much, but they are very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I purchase a new one every 2-4 years when the battery ultimately fades, and have been very happy with them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too noisy, easy to clean and seems to charge up fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and charges quickly.</li>
            <li>easy to use, no issues, battery is good and last for a period of time.</li>
            <li>And super easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>AND GIVES A CLOSE SHAVE RECOMEND THE SHAVER AS IT GIVES A VERY CLOSE SHAVE AND IS VERY EASY TO CLEAN , JUST RINSE IT UNDER THE FAUSET</li>
            <li>shaves close, charges fast and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>the first one would still be in use after many years except for my damaging one blade side piece.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember what the model number was of my first shaver, but it was better than any Braun or Norelco that I had ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Then I bought a Panasonic ES8077 which was even better than the first</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the remarkable shaving experience, the next step is a breeze - cleanup.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver and keeps its charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>After using this shaver for a couple of weeks I feel that I have to add to my original review.</li>
            <li>Initial charging was successful.  </li>
            <li>My son couldn&#x27;t do it at all, and it took me applying significant pressure to see any results.  </li>
            <li>very pleased so far with the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li>was excited to get this</li>
            <li>and originally I was at almost two weeks.  </li>
            <li>My first Panasonic and much better than the 2 Norelco ones before it.</li>
            <li>My face and chin cleaned up nicely with this new razor.</li>
            <li>I use a blade at home and get clean shaves.</li>
            <li>and it was a pain to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>Waterproof means you can shave and clean it in the shower or under running water.  </li>
            <li>but as with most electric razors, it needs too many passes to achieve a complete shave.</li>
            <li>clean up.</li>
            <li>The probable cause was me tapping it against the sink to clean it.</li>
            <li>to clean.</li>
            <li>Use it to clean up what my razor blade misses.  </li>
            <li>gives clean shave.</li>
            <li>You can make a difference by choosing some skin preparation oil and keeping the blade basically clean.</li>
            <li>This razor cleanly shaved among all of them.</li>
            <li>I clean them every month or so</li>
            <li>Powerful and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Panasonic definitely cut some corners on this latest version, probably because it was so popular.</li>
            <li>Shaves clean and close.</li>
            <li>AFTER 6-12 months, you will be recharging more and more frequently until by 18 months</li>
            <li>Reasons vary, but we do it because want to be clean shaven.</li>
            <li>Use and clean-</li>
            <li>So clean and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>clean up takes seconds.  </li>
            <li>a brush to clean.</li>
            <li>, it shaved rather well and did give me a very close smooth shave on most parts of my face.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t even resemble a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Powerful motor and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Only thing I liked better was the cleaning.</li>
            <li>This shaver again is at the low end, but my far the best shave I ever gotten from an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>battery indicator works very well, and I liked the fact that it shaved at full power right until the battery was drained.  </li>
            <li>This model is very close to my original model and it shaves better.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, a good second razor, for quick, light, on the go shaves.</li>
            <li>Panasonic, like many large corporations does not quite &amp;#34;walk the walk&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter how many times I go over certain spots, it doesn&#x27;t get the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had a credit for amazon for $20 off so the price was right!</li>
            <li>I was right, this is one wimpy shaver!</li>
            <li>Excellent close shave particularly when used wet.  </li>
            <li>not as close as a blade but very good for everyday use and holds is charge.  </li>
            <li>I almost never use the wet option, but it&#x27;s great to have and makes cleaning a snap.  </li>
            <li>The wet shaving and cleaning ability is great.</li>
            <li>anyone looking for a great shave at an awesome price I would suggest they try this one,I do not think anyone will be disappointed.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews, expected it to be great.</li>
            <li>It has performed great and I find it not too rough on my skin.</li>
            <li>He can grow a full beard in a week and he can shave 2 times a day.  </li>
            <li>I get about 5 shaves with a full charge.</li>
            <li>But this bulkiness is true with all electric razors.</li>
            <li>I gave it a full month</li>
            <li>Very close, but you may have to make sure you got all the hairs in some problem areas.</li>
            <li>then plummet to 0% requiring a full recharge.  </li>
            <li>, it is a good size razor - I also use a smaller Panasonic -</li>
            <li>Dont try to take on a full beard here haha.&lt;br /&gt;*works</li>
            <li>This is good enough for me.</li>
            <li>Freaking sweet...</li>
            <li>/&gt;4 to 5 shaves from a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>The last Panasonic just gave a good shave and lasted a while.  </li>
            <li>The descriptions are true.</li>
            <li>That was my last Panasonic and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>The item&#x27;s look is so cool.</li>
            <li>This is my second Panasonic shaver and it&#x27;s as good as they get.</li>
            <li>Overall, good product.</li>
            <li>It is good for only about 8-10 shaves before it needs recharged.</li>
            <li>With a full charge, I got about 5, 4 minute shaves.</li>
            <li>OK if I use it every day, but it doesn&#x27;t shave my neck very well and it doesn&#x27;t give me the consistency of blades.</li>
            <li>Really good features and a solid product.</li>
            <li>after full charging,I turned on my razor.</li>
            <li>Love the lithium-ion battery, much improved over ni-cads.</li>
            <li>Read the reviews before purchasing it and everything printed was true.  </li>
            <li>This met all my wants and more.</li>
            <li>Even though shaver was showing full charge it did not work all of the time.  </li>
            <li>you must pay more attention to the &amp;#34;grain&amp;#34; of the hairs, but the result is much cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Panasonic ES-Rt51-S3 razor charges in a hour for a full charge.</li>
            <li>This model is a good mid range and entry level into the Panasonic family.</li>
            <li>Does a good job even with daily use.</li>
            <li>Each charge good enough for five shaves.</li>
            <li>Time will tell the true value of the product.</li>
            <li>Its true.</li>
            <li>So you start with a full charge at 100%, then it drops to 80%, and so on.  </li>
            <li>Definitely does not provide a good shave.</li>
            <li>My last Norelco delivered a closer shave, but I like the feel of this in my hand and it looks good.  </li>
            <li>And now I went to turn it on with a full charge yesterday, December 11, and it shook but didn&#x27;t turn on and the battery perecentage had dropped to 0%.  </li>
            <li>My wife is grateful that I have such a good razor now.</li>
            <li>I never pay full price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to have the digital screen shows the battery capacity.</li>
            <li>Who knows, if I like this option, I really wouldn&#x27;t mind spending more money especially around the holiday season if I can catch a good sale.</li>
            <li>This razor is good for angular faces, especially jaws.</li>
            <li>so one full charge on this one gives me three shaves.  </li>
            <li>I cant understand how this shaver got such good ratings.  </li>
            <li>good shaver and trimmer, still working 2.5 years later.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, good feel and relatively quiet.</li>
            <li>price was reasonable compared to many others yet gets the job done for him.</li>
            <li>Looks cool, too.</li>
            <li>Many thanks to Panasonic and Amazon.</li>
            <li>Been using regular razors for years, but decided to get this and see how good it worked.</li>
            <li>The display is in 20% increments of full charge.  </li>
            <li>Replaced a Remington which was not bad</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>So, therefore, 1 of 2 is not bad.</li>
            <li>However, the price being considerably lower, the results are pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad unit</li>
            <li>knew I wanted a wet / dry shaver and Panasonic had the most models available and some of the best reviews.  </li>
            <li>The new one is very adorable, compact, quiet, and gives a nice shaving.</li>
            <li>The old model worked great, but the new \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; is junk.  </li>
            <li>The LCD meter is easy to read in reasonable light.</li>
            <li>In fact, I don&#x27;t intend to do anything more than basic rinses any more, and occasionally clean underneath the cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do like the easy cleanup, and it works pretty well, but invariably I have a lot of missed areas although I&#x27;ve gone over and over them.  </li>
            <li>This shaver can easily cut skin on the pubic area, will not cut hairs that are too fine or too long, and it takes many passes to get the skin perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li>I have also found that the battery life is quite good and the unit is very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For tougher beards or less frequent shavers a Norelco might suit that person better.</li>
            <li>Easy to use Very clean,If the sound is smaller the better,I hope there are many more promotions can participate.</li>
            <li>Powerful and made clean shaves.</li>
            <li>After owning device, shaving is so fun and clean.</li>
            <li>However the trimmer does a good (if not perfect) job there and does a great job with the side burns.</li>
            <li>I had to shave for 15 minutes and still wasn&#x27;t happy, not to mention when shaving near the ears I nearly went deaf.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m assured of a close quick shave to begin with...  </li>
            <li>Although the build quality is more than acceptable, the quality of the shaves has been mediocre, at best.  </li>
            <li>but I should have bought the one with the higher speed motor as I shave my head and the higher speed would do a better job.</li>
            <li>I will keep for quick jobs, but will continue to use another brand I have for a closer shave.</li>
            <li>The battery charges quickly</li>
            <li>After what I hoped was adequate research, I settled on this model by Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Quick 1 hour charge.</li>
            <li>I started with Edge for the shaving cream but found that this gel-based cream does not rinse quickly from the razor.</li>
            <li>I was a former Phillips user for many many years.</li>
            <li>He has curly hair and uses a pre-shave lotion and gets a great, fast, close enough shave.  </li>
            <li>It got the job done quickly and conformed to my face well.</li>
            <li>This shaver is better in most ways than the Braun of similar design</li>
            <li>Main problem is the chin and neck for me; may just be age :)</li>
            <li>so if I go anywhere at night this razor is a quick alternative for the blade.</li>
            <li>Amazon was quick as well.</li>
            <li>Its easy to clean, really doesn&#x27;t require cleaning often.</li>
            <li>it has been seven months and the battery is going quickly.  </li>
            <li>Great razor, holds up to travel very well, and usually only need to recharge it on the weekends.  </li>
            <li>With quick shaving the battery lasts a month.</li>
            <li>He actually doesn&#x27;t have to shave until 2 days later, awesome!</li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;m a loyal Braun customer)  </li>
            <li>A quick 5-min.</li>
            <li>This shaver charges quickly.  </li>
            <li>I like it,thanks for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>This shaver gives a closer and more comfortable shave than any of the others I&#x27;ve owned,by far.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an adequate shaver.</li>
            <li>However I like to have a electric back-up for quick shaves when needed.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>They are very pleased - especially convenient when traveling with their sports teams</li>
            <li>I doubt using it in the shower every week is the best move as far as usable life goes, but the battery will give out in due time anyway.  </li>
            <li>The first two were fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I personally have not used it yet, but my son was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I have received the gift shipped oversea, I like it very much!</li>
            <li>Amazon of course shipped very fast!</li>
            <li>First shave was smooth, effortless, and close.</li>
            <li>A fully charged battery is good for two long and close shaves.</li>
            <li>It provide convenience for shaving in an clean and efficient approach and provide nice feeling in the same time.</li>
            <li>It offers a smooth, comfortable shave and the wet use function allows me to use it in the shower, which is great.  </li>
            <li>It gives a decent shave, but don&#x27;t expect a super clean cut!     </li>
            <li>Replacement parts cost as much or more than a new razor and this is where I deducted one star.</li>
            <li>So, I purchased a new unit as a better option.</li>
            <li>I love my new razor.  </li>
            <li>With the use of Lectra Shave, it works great between the mundane lather shaves.</li>
            <li>As good as an electric can work dry</li>
            <li>It shaves very well and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and does work somewhat better, or at least more comfortably, when using shaving cream.</li>
            <li>a normal razor is way more worth buying this product.</li>
            <li>You will be more than pleased and say why didn&#x27;t I look for a device like this a long time ago.</li>
            <li>The top set releases the foil (to replace it if damaged, or to wash it separately), while the lower set partially removes the housing around the head, so you can more easily clean the blade assembly.</li>
            <li>(all brands), your best approach on one in this moderate price range is to use it as long</li>
            <li>First of all, make sure you wash your face really well with a washcloth.</li>
            <li>Overall, though, it does a decent job leaving legs smooth and soft and at a very good price for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>It is such a smooth shave, it is quiet, it has a great pop-up trimmer that really works, and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I recommend this shaver highly!!!</li>
            <li>Worked exactly like I wanted it to!</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to clean and how long the battery life lasts.</li>
            <li>Probably my mistake first time!</li>
            <li>I paid $55 for this shaver in February 2012 and replacement foils are about $30, meaning it&#x27;s almost more worth it just to buy a new shaver rather than replace the foils.</li>
            <li>This new one  is a good value, but it doesn&#x27;t shave as well as the old one (not as close), and the trimmer extension is quite inferior.</li>
            <li>very low noise, very easy to clean</li>
            <li>its a great one easy to use and clean and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s wonderfully quiet, and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Gives me a smooth face quickly and charge last more than two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, ready to go to work, easy to clean, charges super fast and shaves me like a dream...bald head and all.</li>
            <li>This thing is a great little razor for the price.</li>
            <li>Intended as a decent compromise but is actually better than the higher priced model.</li>
            <li>This would be fine as a tradeoff for a good shave, but pressing hard isnâ€™t necessary to get a good shave with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is good but hard to use on my chin, so letting it grow more than 3-4 days causes problems.</li>
            <li>very close shave and leaves my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>It gives a  smooth shave with no pulling or scratching, and it holds a charge very well.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s smooth and very quite and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Amazing a one hour charge lasted me just under three weeks of daily shaving.&lt;br /&gt;MARVELLOUS</li>
            <li>It is extremely quiet, give an amazingly close shave...</li>
            <li>Its not quite a real shave, but light years ahead of anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Fits hand very well, comfortable to hold, screen allows close shave without skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver is the only electric shaver I have used that I liked.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this for a couple weeks, but it&#x27;s been great so far.</li>
            <li>but you, and the irritation/time it saves is worth it.</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The battery performance is poor at best.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic offers so many razors, one cannot even get their head around all of the differences.  </li>
            <li>As good as I expected.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve been a blade and shaving cream guy for most of my adult life.  </li>
            <li>, in the future I want to try a more advanced.</li>
            <li>Holds charge for 5 days worth of shaving</li>
            <li>I bought another Panasonic since I liked the old one so much</li>
            <li>Much better than the old one</li>
            <li>I found the Panasonic ES-RT51 fantastic for fact that it shaves soft and smoothly without scratching my skin.</li>
            <li>Always looks fresh.</li>
            <li>and it works like my old one did except faster, quieter, and a better battery life.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to get an even better shaver, and spent about $20 more on this men&#x27;s shaver.</li>
            <li>I think it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Provides a good shave, however some work is involved for a really close shave (subjective as every face is different).</li>
            <li>and I get a week&#x27;s worth of</li>
            <li>I find myself going over the same spots multiple times and still not being able to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like our &amp;#34;throw away&amp;#34; society, but it made more economic sense to replace the whole thing.</li>
            <li>but wet gelled shaves are good.</li>
            <li>Nice and quiet.</li>
            <li>this shaver is pretty good, considering i&#x27;ve been a mach 3 guy for as long as i can remember.  </li>
            <li>it charges fast, shaves fast, shaves close, doesn&#x27;t hurt, and it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li>will try the 5 blade and see if the cost is worth it.</li>
            <li>so you aren&#x27;t surprised with a drained battery when you need it most.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is not as good as my former Panasonic referenced below that lasted over 8 years, but price is very competitive for the quality of shave.   </li>
            <li>8-9 years ago, I purchased a similar Panasonic razor from a now defunct popular catalog company in one of their retail stores.  </li>
            <li>So far I am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It was worth all the research.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco was much faster and a much closer shave, and my son is able to use it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve encountered some things worth noting)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is slightly better than my old Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li>This is an ok shaver, but my old remington gets ALL the hairs.</li>
            <li>Painfully loud, head pieces keep falling off and battery mostly shot after one year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good, but not as close a shave as I expected.</li>
            <li>The important review is that this does not shave as close as my cheap old Braun.</li>
            <li>I love the wet/dry function of the shaver which my old Braun had too.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it is well worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li>Excellent especially when wet.</li>
            <li>The price at Amazon and what you receive is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>the percent charge display is useful too.</li>
            <li>This one, I&#x27;m convinced, does better than my old Braun ever could have.</li>
            <li>The shaver does a nice job---however the corded re-charger takes up extra room in my luggage---no problem.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s somewhat solid and robust feeling and glides nicely across the face.</li>
            <li>I am getting a week&#x27;s worth of shaves from a charge.  </li>
            <li>The box advertises 45 minutes or up to 2 weeks worth of battery life.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.  </li>
            <li>and this little portable is very handy.</li>
            <li>Love using this new razor always used a three headed model, this was the first time using a razor like this.</li>
            <li>I still have the old one to use as a backup, but I am very satisfied with the new one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a female who tried using it for my bikini line and legs in order to avoid razor burn but honestly, learning how to shave the right way with</li>
            <li>(dry mode) and was very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Use a good quality soft soap to clean any \\&quot;goo\\&quot; left from the pre-shave/foam.</li>
            <li>it does exactly as it is programed to do .smooth quick with ease</li>
            <li>Quick clean shave for a decent price what else do you need.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used it for a little over a month and am pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>The ultrasonic movement that I appreciated in my original razor is \\&quot;standard\\&quot; now, and here it is for a fraction of what I paid for mine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my view, Linear Drive is what makes Panasonic shavers superior to ALL other brands out there.</li>
            <li>I originally bought one for my dad when he was in hospice and had tremors in his hands and still wanted to shave himself and this worked very well for him.</li>
            <li>It does not cut as good as other reviewers claimed, I wanted it for my legs</li>
            <li>I must shave with this panasonic other wise</li>
            <li>I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell the difference in closeness, however, the new foil seemed to move more smoothly over my face and maybe it had an easier time when I&#x27;d let my beard grow out a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the Panasonic (finally, right?)  </li>
            <li>He was right handed.</li>
            <li>Run it right under the fawcet</li>
            <li>I have had closer shaves but for a quickie its all right</li>
            <li>Right before shaving I use either Johnson &amp; Johnson baby powder or the powder stick (Shave Saver from Remington).</li>
            <li>This razor cuts right through the 4 day stubble.  </li>
            <li>Works very well at giving a close clean shave.</li>
            <li>Shaving quality is decent on a light beard.  </li>
            <li>The hair clipper on back works fine, and actually can be used for nose hairs, and performs better in that area that most dedicated ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first got it I gave it a full charge and then used it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>- I just want a fast, close, clean shave.  </li>
            <li>It is very good in recharge the power however it is not able to shave with a complete and clean effect.</li>
            <li>This one arrived quickly via Amazon Prime and has continued my positive experience with Panasonic wet/dry shavers.</li>
            <li>For a close and smooth shave i highly recommend the Panasonic ES-RT51-S 3 blade electric razor.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic is slimmer and lighter (only by 1 ounce, but it feels like more), so itâ€™s more comfortable to hold even if you have big hands.</li>
            <li>If you are a perfectionist like me, you&#x27;ll follow up the electric razor with a five blade razor to get the very best, closest, most comfortable shave of all time...and those really expensive five blade razors will last five times longer.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t justify paying $50 or more each year for a new electric razor.</li>
            <li>This razor is fantastic, charges very quickly and indicates the amount of charge left</li>
            <li>He especially liked the dry or wet choice for shaving.  </li>
            <li>About 15 years ago, I switched to a Panasonic wet and dry electric razor and was very happy with it until it died after about 5 years.</li>
            <li>The  shaver is comfortable, easy to use, quiet and best of all can be used wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>This razor delivers a smooth cut, is quiet, and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My business trips tend to be 3 to 4 days in length and it holds the charge easily for that length of time, is very compact, and is very ergonomically designed.</li>
            <li>My husband does not have a super heavy beard , it takes a good amount of time to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>The head comes off in two different ways for a quick rinse or a more thorough one.  </li>
            <li>However, its wet feature makes it very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The clean up is very easy since it is built to get wet.</li>
            <li>In fact, it still works fine, but the battery just isn&#x27;t holding a charge like it did when new.  </li>
            <li>I just order a higher end electric razor, also a Panasonic, and hopefully it&#x27;ll be worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied for the money spent and the features in this Panasonic shaver ES-RT51-S.  </li>
            <li>I have used it with just water, no water, and with the Total Shaving solution oil drops, and by far the oil drops are the best possible choice (for me.)  </li>
            <li>So, generally, I was satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Iâ€™ve owned Panasonic razors in the past and have always been happy.</li>
            <li>This one is no exception and has performed great over the past year Iâ€™ve been using it.</li>
            <li>My husband was thrilled and said he got the closest shave with it that any razor has given him in a long time.  </li>
            <li>I liked the charge display, the ergonomics, and the long charge length of this razor</li>
            <li>Right out of the box, easy to use, for my 16 year old.</li>
            <li>But if you have sensitive skin &amp; a light to medium beard, I highly recommend this fine shaver.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a bonus, right? ;-)</li>
            <li>It certainly did not do the job for me!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money, and actually shaves better than my Braun.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver last spring after my 5+ year old Panasonic ES8017 started falling apart (but motor and batteries were still good).  </li>
            <li>It features a tilting head to follow contours, pop-up trimmer, button lock, digital charge remaining display, wet/dry use, comfortable in hand rubber grip with angled ribs, corded charger included, and free delivery.      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used electric shavers my whole life, and this is by far my favorite design.  </li>
            <li>With the quick charge time this electric shaver is very convenient.</li>
            <li>My son has a heavier beard and finds the Norelco(just a few $ more) does a better job for him.</li>
            <li>I have nothing but good things to say about my previous Panasonic shaver, which I used for 7 years.</li>
            <li>this shaver takes 3, 4 or sometimes 5 passes to cleanly shave a given area, whereas my older one required MAXIMUM two passes.</li>
            <li>and then you will , as smooth has a baby&#x27;s behind lol</li>
            <li>an quickly realized that it was very ineffective at shaving.</li>
            <li>My old rotary Norelcos cut better and shave smoother, and one of those sounds like it&#x27;s ready to explode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am happy I bought it, but then again I only paid $30 for it as a daily deal on a competitors site (Shmew Shmegg)</li>
            <li>I have at least 10 electric shavers in boxes that I have purchase over the years hoping to find one that works good and shaves close and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The wet shave was more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to try one again and this one has been great especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to male and female alike, my wife is now using my first Panasonic and is quite happy with it..</li>
            <li>The Barbasol, on the other hand, provides all the glide that I want but, curiously, is more or less &amp;#34;erased&amp;#34; by the shaver as it glides over it, making for a tidy and satisfying shave.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES-RT51-S electric razor is good but not special.</li>
            <li>Arrived very fast and was well packed.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivered.</li>
            <li>is very much faithful to the features shown on the box.  </li>
            <li>Price was also very reasonable.</li>
            <li>still like this shaver very much.</li>
            <li>Like the portability and attractiveness of shaver...charges very fast..</li>
            <li>It lasts all week on one charge and recharges very fast.</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is quiet and very smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Recharge is very fast, about three times faster than phone.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Still not sure if i&#x27;m using the shaver right yet need more time to use to give a better review.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers have mentioned a &amp;#34;linear motor&amp;#34; available on higher-end models, so they may do a better job.  </li>
            <li>I think that being able to use a wet shaver compared to a dry one will produce a superior shave regardless of brand.</li>
            <li>The main reason I am giving this product 3 stars:&lt;br /&gt;It does not give me a full shave.</li>
            <li>I have NO idea what you would get for the price difference, but their high end shavers must be pretty special because this shaver rocks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So when I bought the ES-RT51-S, I thought I was getting a better model, mainly because it had a battery meter whereas my old shaver did not.</li>
            <li>When I dry shave the shaver is quick and leaves me with a better shave than a blade.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this little puppy for seven months and it works as good as the first day.</li>
            <li>All shaved only OK.</li>
            <li>my first shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>First one lasted me over two years.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this shaver FOR WOMEN!!</li>
            <li>Gone are the days of the loud but mighty</li>
            <li>That will only be an issue on trips greater than one week.  </li>
            <li>I picked up this Panasonic on sale last month on a whim and have got to say it is much better than the electric shavers of yesteryear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>I seem to need to go over areas more than once to get a close enough shave.</li>
            <li>So i decided to try this model first</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;nano\\&quot; razor runs at a much slower RPM and it feels like it&#x27;s pulling your beard not cutting.  </li>
            <li>Recently purchased this shaver mainly based on my previous experience with Panasonic equipment, which has been uniformly excellent and well-priced.  </li>
            <li>I intend to buy the company ;)</li>
            <li>Like most electric razors I have ever owned, it will not shave as close as a double edge razor.</li>
            <li>the others are nowhere near as comfortable.</li>
            <li>First time not using blades</li>
            <li>It seems to run at a higher speed than the Braun, though Iâ€™m</li>
            <li>And this shaver and its charger are so light, I might just toss my old Braun travel shaver, too.</li>
            <li>I started using it and had no problems the first two weeks.</li>
            <li>work that great on thick</li>
            <li>My beard is light, with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed virtually no pulling of whiskers, a first for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will be more aware next time datz all</li>
            <li>Just a quick puff can clean it if you do not wet shave.</li>
            <li>I love its traditional style and design.</li>
            <li>I find I get the closest after a hot shower</li>
            <li>hot water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to try.  </li>
            <li>Now I have to charge every 2 days to be sure it doesn&#x27;t die in the middle of a shave.</li>
            <li>I decided to see how many days the battery would last</li>
            <li>It shaves just as well as my last shaver, so I am completely satisfied with this model.</li>
            <li>Had the prior model that worked well for many years.</li>
            <li>Overall - I am satisfied with this product, for the functioning and price.</li>
            <li>I think this will also last many years.  </li>
            <li>They missed a lot of hair, especially on my neck no matter how many times I would go over that</li>
            <li>I first opened this and held it, I could tell it was a quality shaver.  </li>
            <li>Love the grip and overall design.</li>
            <li>For the price I was expecting a mediocre shave, but I am very happy with result of this electric razor from Panasonic</li>
            <li>side blade broke the first time I tried to use it.</li>
            <li>Worked well for the first year.</li>
            <li>Light years beyond my old razor.  </li>
            <li>It also retains its charge pretty well.</li>
            <li>So I ended up ditching this one and bought the ES8103S, which is the cheapest Linear Drive model with a battery meter that I am aware of.</li>
            <li>So much better  than the last electric razor I owned.</li>
            <li>After several weeks of use, I like the Panasonic better.  </li>
            <li>Great buy , give your face at least 3 or 4 days of trying this razor , letting your face get used to this product</li>
            <li>Working VERY WELL!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would recommend trying another product, I might try some of the higher end models and hopefully they get the job done.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m only 22, I think I will wait a couple more years for that investment.</li>
            <li>In general I would have to say that this shaver does a good job providing a nice close shave, especially for the money spent on it.</li>
            <li>This is not a big deal but notable.</li>
            <li>and I think that I am a bit more objective.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love my money back.</li>
            <li>Works, but takes many passes on my coarse beard.</li>
            <li>It is so quiet compared to bruan&#x27;s and a much better cut.</li>
            <li>Panasonic&#x27;s \\&quot;nanotech\\&quot; resulted in a razor with micro-utility;)  </li>
            <li>It gives a great, close shave (I&#x27;m still on the same cutter), though it requires you to shave a bit more slowly than others like the Braun shavers.  </li>
            <li>When I first had this shaver, the charge level would go all the way to 0% before I&#x27;d run out of power.  </li>
            <li>Not close enough shave,I was hoping for better performance.</li>
            <li>He has been using disposable shaving blades and said it was pretty comparable to the disposables.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps if I used the razor more often it would last longer.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with a foil</li>
            <li>It does the job for the most part but requires you to go over and over the same spot to obtain a rather close shave.</li>
            <li>When I used it for the first time I was planning to use it to shave my beard and mustache</li>
            <li>The first one lasted two years</li>
            <li>I no longer need to shower first to soften the whiskers.</li>
            <li>It is bigger than it looks in the picture, but I haven&#x27;t seen another one more compact.</li>
            <li>The battery finally wore out on my Remington after many years</li>
            <li>I have been searching for an electric razor to do the job of a blade for more than 25 years - I finally found one and it did not cost me a fortune.  </li>
            <li>This shaver would probably be better for someone with finer facial hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>For the first 6-12 months you can get about 6 shaves between charges.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first foil shaver.  </li>
            <li>Like most men I don&#x27;t like the daily regimen of face shaving.</li>
            <li>Maybe the shave would go faster if a lotion or oil were applied first.</li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t get as close as razor shave, but very close!</li>
            <li>Shaver does exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Absolute junk!</li>
            <li>Norelco 3 head which cuts the first time</li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>Worked exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a pop-up trimmer on the back which I love.</li>
            <li>I have been used to Norelco products that have a longer shaving time but will no longer pay the much higher price of a Norelco.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although this razor has no charging/ cleaning station, it feels way more solid</li>
            <li>so he&#x27;d wanted a replacement and told me exactly which one to buy.</li>
            <li>When I first started using the Panasonic, it shaved about as well as the Braun.  </li>
            <li>In summary, the razor does exactly as I hoped....</li>
            <li>I hoped to get a better battery life out of the shaver but it definitely held up well after my year of usage.</li>
            <li>The cost to replace those is higher than the Wahl</li>
            <li>The first one I had for 6 years and replaced the blades once.</li>
            <li>This razor wouldn&#x27;t cut hot butter.</li>
            <li>My first panasonic shaver lasted me over 2 years and then the battery died on it.</li>
            <li>the first attempt was unsuccessful, but when I  tried again, no problem.</li>
            <li>thick beard lol</li>
            <li>It is also easy to clean and stays charged a long time.</li>
            <li>pretty displeased with it.</li>
            <li>this is my first shaver</li>
            <li>Panasonic has the feel of my first Norelco of 1969 vintage.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Have owned a few electric shavers and this is as good as any.&lt;br</li>
            <li>; shaver is to never use it wet because even fine stainless steel corrodes more readily in the presence of water.  </li>
            <li>Even the neck area under my chin which usually gets irritated very easy was  smooth and not all bumpy.  </li>
            <li>This razor would be fine if you just want to clean yourself up every few days, but won&#x27;t cut it for jobs that require you to be clean</li>
            <li>Gives very smooth shave and stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li>Battery lasts long and very smooth operation</li>
            <li>Panasonic needs very few passes to give an excellent shave, even on my neck, where the Braun required dozens of passes and still routinely missed individual hairs and even whole patches.</li>
            <li>NOT REALLY A CLOSE SHAVE, BUT EASY TO CLEAN</li>
            <li>This is by FAR the best shaver I ever had - WHY waiting? - any girl shaver in comparison with this Panasonic ES-RT51-S 3 Blade nano tech Wet/dry rechargeable shaver is poor in performance, its cleaning and looks.</li>
            <li>Replacement razor that is much nicer than the prior one and shaves more closely (so says my boyfriend).  </li>
            <li>I needed to replace my old Panasonic shaver, which was more then 10 years old.</li>
            <li>This unit replaced a model that cost more than double and had a much shorter battery life and fewer features.</li>
            <li>Making matters worse, I&#x27;m going on five weeks of trying to get Panasonic to honor its warranty for the razor but the best they have offered so far is to replace the charger (not the razor or its battery mind you.. the charger).  </li>
            <li>It was my first time and it didn&#x27;t go very well.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my son for his birthday and my other son liked it so much that he also wanted one for his birthday.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately the battery life, which was great to start, has deteriorated significantly.  </li>
            <li>But in the long run, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper and better for the environment.</li>
            <li>At first he wanted a Braun, but when he found out  that Braun is made in China rather than Germany he opted for a reasonably priced Panny.</li>
            <li>I am sure it won&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li>I had a higher end Panasonic shaver before and made the mistake to save too much.  </li>
            <li>This is way too long for a bathroom counter top.</li>
            <li>After the first shave, I was ready to return the product...</li>
            <li>I love how long the charge lasts on this shaver.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver slightly less than 2 years ago and it was a good shaver while new.</li>
            <li>will not give a clean shave on my heavy beard if I go more than 1 day</li>
            <li>aextremely fast, very fine cutting (high speed)  very similar to the first electric Panasonic razor owned years ago... the best!!!!</li>
            <li>Shaves smooth - even 2 day old scruff and doesn&#x27;t hurt or pull - smooth as blade (mostly) without pushing hard into my neck as I had with others.  </li>
            <li>Bang for your buck, this is the best, most comfortable, least expensive razor you can buy.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ve had it for a little more than two weeks and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li>Overall, not bad!</li>
            <li>The panasonic ES-RT51 which is now going for about $59.00 was one of the more expensive shavers and now is at its 59.00 reduced price, charges in an hour and has the super high speed motor, i also own this one and for the price</li>
            <li>New battery and screen cost more than this new razor which has a lithium battery vs the old nicad so I upgraded.  </li>
            <li>But I decided I like a dry shave better.</li>
            <li>Selling point from description and review was the easy care and the ability to just rinse entire unit under running water.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my dry legs and love the close shave.  </li>
            <li>My beard is light to normal, not heavy.  </li>
            <li>good shaves and long lasting battery</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also quiet and easy to clean &amp; maintain, and cost lots less than the highly advertised top brands..  </li>
            <li>it certainly won&#x27;t work on a man&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li>The charge indicator screen claims that the charge is a certain percentage, like 100%, but it is not.</li>
            <li>I did not like the large head</li>
            <li>Easy to use, shaves close wet or dry w/o razor burn, easy to clean and operate.</li>
            <li>Instead, in one week, I was shipped a brand new unit, and not the same model as I had, but their top of the line model (ES-LV61-A).  </li>
            <li>My last Panasonic I had for more than 6 years and rather than replace its battery and &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; it was cheaper to purchase this new shaver.</li>
            <li>Works great wet or dry.</li>
            <li>wet/dry capability is liberating, and it feels great both wet and dry.  </li>
            <li>Great for wet &amp; dry.</li>
            <li>It would recharge quickly, and had a feature that would allow you to plug it in for a few minutes and get one more shave out of it if it was discharged.  </li>
            <li>The reviews you may read that state that the cheaper Panasonic shavers work just as good or better than the EXPENSIVE Panasonic shavers is true, Ive used Panasonic shavers for the last twenty years or so.</li>
            <li>but for the extra money, this works just fine</li>
            <li>The next day, 24 hours, as I was beginning to pack to mail it back, I tried one more time, it started !</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used an electric is quite some time, the last one i had was a Braun 360 which was fine.</li>
            <li>regular razor works fine</li>
            <li>Get it, not a razor at all, a cleverly designed, pretty looking POC.</li>
            <li>Keeps a decent charge on the battery, pretty close shave, and</li>
            <li>All were very high quality.  </li>
            <li>VERY HIGH QUALITY SHAVER, CHARGES IN ABOUT 30 MIN.</li>
            <li>Nice little item.</li>
            <li>electric razor rarely gets as close as a wet shave, and that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>First time using this brand but would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It takes a little time to acclimate to a foil shave and should probably be done everyday for best results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve liked them all, but they don&#x27;t give me a very close shave because I have a fairly heavy beard.  </li>
            <li>The shave is much closer than electric or cartridge razors, the blades are readily available and relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves this raiser.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Seems to be very sturdy build quality.</li>
            <li>Shaves very close and equals the blade on my face but not quite so on my neck.</li>
            <li>Does perform somewhat better on a wet shave.  </li>
            <li>(It charges REALLY FAST)</li>
            <li>Very close shave for an electric.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>The Norelco was a rotary three-head which was durable, but never gave a very close shave</li>
            <li>, this whole, \\&quot;the head moves/</li>
            <li>It does not shave very well</li>
            <li>and it still might not be smooth enough for some spouses/girlfriends.  </li>
            <li>Some were really pricey and had a lot of features.  </li>
            <li>Better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly !</li>
            <li>Very close.  </li>
            <li>B0043DMNHS Panasonic ES-RT51-S 3-Blade Nanotech Wet/dry Rechargeable Shaver, Silver] for about a month now, and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like this razor.  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic model does not give a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to give a very close shave.</li>
            <li>It gives me a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a rotary for years, and while the shave was closer, it really irritated my neck.  </li>
            <li>This thing really hums fast.</li>
            <li>Really like the wet/dry feature and water clean-up.  </li>
            <li>Body wash very practical.</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver</li>
            <li>Very close Shave&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It does not shave very close and pulls hair.</li>
            <li>His last shaver pulled a lot, but this is pain free.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work very well at all at getting rid of hair.</li>
            <li>If you think that one year of service for $50 to $60 is acceptable (you can spend that much on blades for a razor), you might consider it.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>The razor performs well, but I now have to plug it in 15-20 minutes before shaving so that it will work for me when I am ready.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it several weeks now and it shaves fantastic.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a woman shaving your pubic hair, don&#x27;t try to shave fast at all with this, you&#x27;ll hurt yourself.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product to anyone wanting a smooth quiet shave.</li>
            <li>Very close shave for an electric from day one.  </li>
            <li>I like it so much that I bought one for my wife&#x27;s dad.</li>
            <li>He said he really likes the shave that he gets and that he doesn&#x27;t have to recharge it every time.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>Well I decided to try this and really like it.</li>
            <li>plus it is much quieter.</li>
            <li>but I really doubt that is did not work for them</li>
            <li>/&gt;2) Being able to get it wet or use it in the shower is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The market has many choices, this particular razor is not adequate for even the most basic of needs.</li>
            <li>Recharges fast and tells you what charge remains - 80% 60% etc.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really give the close shave you&#x27;d get with a real razor.</li>
            <li>It is really  a shame that Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Does sell replacement blades at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Very pleased...great value on Amazon.</li>
            <li>We bought this so that our adult son, who has an intellectual disability, could learn to shave himself.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;nanocoating\\&quot; or whatever it is seems very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I like a very close shave).</li>
            <li>I did receive in the time promised, tried it, and found it to work , even better when I se it wet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it more useful to trim sparse body hair short enough to be cut by the foil, though both the trimmer and the foil can draw blood in some areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Likes the charging indicator and that unit holds a charge for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>I can go much faster with a Mach 3 disposable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The day after Christmas, i saw him and he had me feel his face, it was smooth as butter, and he said it only took him 2-3</li>
            <li>Also the battery seems to wear out much faster than advertised.  </li>
            <li>so much I order this for a replacement off the onther one I have</li>
            <li>Although still made in Japan, this razor was absolute junk.</li>
            <li>This head is not a curved like an Arc IV but is straight.</li>
            <li>and I really appreciate Amazon.com&#x27;s fast and efficient service.  </li>
            <li>It follows then that my primary critique of this shaver is that the total shave takes a lot of time.</li>
            <li>So much for battery</li>
            <li>I expected a better performance in terms of results.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reviewing a multitude of shavers and options I came to the conclusion I really didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a process (electric shave)</li>
            <li>Seems to perform very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Charges up fairly fast, about 45 minutes from a 20% charged battery.</li>
            <li>Sounds like a real bumble bee, but the vibration is soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Charges fast in about an hr.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>very short.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Solid and smooth.</li>
            <li>Shaves very well.</li>
            <li>really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If it had actually left me with a smooth face</li>
            <li>in all, I really like this razor.</li>
            <li>I found the price to be reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Close shaves after 1 month adjustment period and fast charging times.</li>
            <li>I travelled with it and appreciated the unobtrusive and easy-to-manage safety on the switch.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m much happier with it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s much easier on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you know how much charge you have.</li>
            <li>That one lasted for years and now quality has dropped so much.</li>
            <li>For $60, I expected a better shave.</li>
            <li>I get a straight razor shave with a tenth the hassle.</li>
            <li>He used it and say - what is it really like.</li>
            <li>and it shaved my face very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, because I really did like it, but I can&#x27;t recommend this to anyone because of the lack of battery life.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>guess if you have course hair it will not work very well.</li>
            <li>but I think my old narelco was much smother and cut better without going over and over the same area.  </li>
            <li>It holds a charge for a reasonable length of time.</li>
            <li>Works  very well.  </li>
            <li>However, this model has a digital meter that tells you just how much life is left in the battery between charges, which is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>I kinda wish I hadn&#x27;t have bought it because my hand held razors get closer and don&#x27;t miss so much</li>
            <li>; Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>THANKS.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t shave very close at all-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and very quiet and charges in no time.</li>
            <li>It shaves very well.  </li>
            <li>It cuts close and charges fast.</li>
            <li>I expected more from Panasonic.</li>
            <li>It shaves very close and fast, and is the quietest shaver of all the Panasonics I have had.  </li>
            <li>This one is a three blade and has an indicator that tells you how much is remaining on the battery.  </li>
            <li>He has very course hair</li>
            <li>my view there is absolutely no need to spend any more on an electric shaver than this one.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It frequently misses spots and I have to go over the same spot many times.</li>
            <li>Handy shaver works well if you use EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li>But overall good wet shaver.</li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 stars as I do find I have to make more passes over areas than I did with my old shaver.  </li>
            <li>However it has only 2 replacable blades,and some kind of \\&quot;stationary\\&quot; thing in the middle that Panasonic calls a blade.</li>
            <li>it gets really close, better than i expected, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like i thought it would.</li>
            <li>Good razor- worth the price - but not a great razor.</li>
            <li>Worked nicely for a whopping 3 months and is now dead.</li>
            <li>I gave up and went back to the Braun, which shaves much better (even with an old foil) than the two-month-old Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small enough to handle easily and the shaving head fits your face and under the chin nicely.  </li>
            <li>Good, but not great razor due to the fact that it takes many more passes (especially on the neck) to do the job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer on the back is very powerful, but tends to get caught on thicker hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had four Panasonic electric shavers over the past 25 odd years, and all of them have been excellent performers for me.</li>
            <li>This thing shaves as close as a new blade the first time.</li>
            <li>I am Extremely happy with this shaver, it works well with my Aveeno shave cream and gets my face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind!!</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for a long period of time and is easily cleaned with running water.  </li>
            <li>The RPM&#x27;s of this NON-LINEAR motor are adequate and the general shave is satisfactory.   </li>
            <li>The curved blades were far better than the flat blades in this unit.  </li>
            <li>I tried using it wet with shaving gel at first, and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>Just clean frequently with a soft brush and compressed air.  </li>
            <li>This is my third Panasonic Linear shaver, and it has not disappointed me yet.</li>
            <li>Other Panasonic models are much better.</li>
            <li>buy the cheaper Panasonics, they work great and last just as long as the big boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then thought I would get this razor for my wife and take my original Arc 3 back.</li>
            <li>I was going to get a Braun, but other blogs said this was even better than a Braun.  </li>
            <li>As I indicated above, Braun &amp; Remington have significantly reduced the quality of their razors.</li>
            <li>Have not used the wet part yet (other than to clean it with water, which worked nicely).  </li>
            <li>Each new shaver that I have purchased to replace the old has been better than the last.</li>
            <li>The combination is the only way I can get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Obviously this to clean away stubble.</li>
            <li>Shaves close enough to give a clean shaven look.</li>
            <li>Such a clean shave</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually had to supplement this with a safety razor to clean my neckline.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe that this razor shaves quite as close as the Norelco, but it is much faster, particularly if you don&#x27;t shave every day.  </li>
            <li>If you are just looking for a simple clean shave, this&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li>but overall it gives a clean close shave.</li>
            <li>The battery has a long usage time and the digital meter measuring remaining charge is a nice idea.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t sound like a long time but that is daily use and original battery.  </li>
            <li>It shaves very smooth and clean, in wet or dry.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this razor very much but so far I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>Really like this model and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>But no matter how good and sharp the blades are if you don&#x27;t have high enough CPM with a motor that can handle high CPM</li>
            <li>The only concern I have is when it comes time to buy replacement blades it is often almost as cheap to buy a new razor.  </li>
            <li>I have a tough beard, and the 3041 cut quickly and closely on the first pass, with very light pressure and no razor burn.</li>
            <li>Looking for an electric razor for a special needs teen.</li>
            <li>it is ok if it was half the money that they are charging,i wouldn&#x27;t buy it again for this much money.</li>
            <li>youâ€™ve tried a Braun travel shaver, you know that itâ€™s possible to get a good shaver for less than $20.</li>
            <li>wet n dry is a good thing,</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried it with wet cream, but cuts fairly close dry.</li>
            <li>that was very new</li>
            <li>If you shave every day or every other day, it might be OK for you but for me, even on 1 or 2 day&#x27;s growth, it was only adequate.</li>
            <li>Long battery endurance (over a week), with an accurate % Charge indicator</li>
            <li>That is a fast charge rate and consistent with the specs of one hour for full charge from empty.</li>
            <li>What I also love about it is that there is a digital readout that tells you how much charge you have left to go.  </li>
            <li>; razors said that the motor sucked and they generally weren&#x27;t worth it and recommended this model.</li>
            <li>It requires many, many passes over the same area in different directions due to its design, but it eventually does the job.</li>
            <li>But when you switch it on, especially after a full charge, it basically sounds like it&#x27;s running at about a hundred thousand RPM, and gives you sort of a lackluster cut.  </li>
            <li>I have a heavy beard and this works so very well, no chafing and it glides along, giving a close, clean quick shave.</li>
            <li>I only get 3 shaves on each full charge.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver of one kind or another for the past 15+ years.  </li>
            <li>nice small grip</li>
            <li>Works pretty well so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would return it, but adding the increased cost of a better razor to the hassle of returning and reordering, makes the return not worth it.</li>
            <li>He also has a very thick and coarse beard and it seems to shave him very good.</li>
            <li>Razor must be completely dried out to use on a dry face, but it shaves pretty good that way too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After using this shaver for about a month I am a bit disappointed with the shaver as it&#x27;s twice as much as the one I was using before and does not deliver as good of a shave, although it is better than most other  brands as they can not be used in the shower the way I use mine.</li>
            <li>The motor is very powerful yet not loud at all.</li>
            <li>really shave any better than other razors I&#x27;ve used, and probably not as well as my old (corded) Remington.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really do that when your parts pricing policy attempts to encourage existing customers to throw millions of older products into landfills and buy new.</li>
            <li>Once I get comfortable with \\&quot;dry shaving\\</li>
            <li>For a shaver that cost  me less than $50, it works better than any shaver I&#x27;ve had before.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get half as many shaves on a charge as I used to.</li>
            <li>Not only did it arrive quickly and BEFORE the promised date, it also has exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly for &amp;#34;between-shave&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This was like going back to one of the older Brauns only better.</li>
            <li>Works better than the more expensive razor I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li>Simply delivers a nice close shave, cleans up easily under the faucet and does not sound like a lawn mower next to my ear.</li>
            <li>The only shortcoming is that it must be charged more often than my last (Remington) shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and efficient and charges quickly.  </li>
            <li>It replaces an older model that I had for a number of years.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly and has quiet operation.</li>
            <li>Settled on the Panasonic as it is wet/dry, holds a decent charge, and seems to be everything he needed.  </li>
            <li>drive&amp;#34; motor that my older one had.</li>
            <li>I have never replaced the blades and I can still get a decent shave</li>
            <li>and you expend a lot of time trying to get a decent shave that never get.</li>
            <li>Using a razor with shaving cream has also produced razor burn, particularly under my chin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I prefer the leather zip case that came with the older razor and use it instead.</li>
            <li>you can bring this back up to 100% quickly</li>
            <li>I only use an electric razor for a quick touch up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent, but just that.  </li>
            <li>better then the most expensive one.</li>
            <li>although I have had better razors they were MUCH more expensive.</li>
            <li>It charged up quickly, shows a digital display</li>
            <li>Does a decent job of shaving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s a decent deal for the price, and</li>
            <li>Shaves quick, close and quiet.  </li>
            <li>no problems except now that it is older</li>
            <li>Holds charge for a decent amt. of time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much better the more expensive ones are</li>
            <li>(I tried this with my regular mug, brush, and soap, but I found that canned shaving cream actually works better.)</li>
            <li>I just discovered: You can&#x27;t get a super close shave by only paying $30 for a shaver, no matter what the ads say.  </li>
            <li>I replaced an older Panasonic wet/dry one blade unit.  </li>
            <li>I had an older version of this</li>
            <li>For the price it is a decent value.</li>
            <li>It could give a closer shave but does a decent job of shaving .</li>
            <li>Was pushed into purchase because Panasonic said they no longer supplied the cutters and foils for an older model.</li>
            <li>When this one arrived it has identical cutters and foil as the older one.</li>
            <li>I had an older version of this shaver</li>
            <li>and my friend bought the same model recently - he claims it gives him a  better shave than the Braun models he used for decades.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that the battery is getting discharged quickly.</li>
            <li>I am not sure whether my hair type isn&#x27;t very compatible, but I have noticed it did a slightly better job at certain lengths.</li>
            <li>But all the before mentioned with 13,000 CPM is the &amp;#34;sales close&amp;#34; concerning this item as 13,000 CPM makes it a member of the most powerful 1% of electric shavers on the market, it&#x27;s the Briggs and Stratton engine of electric shavers, can and will mow down the toughest beard!!!  </li>
            <li>The design is special, although in reality they are just AA batteries with little prongs welded on, Ironically, I pulled my old Norelco out of the drawer while waiting for the new batteries, and it performed fine.  </li>
            <li>This one works great - clean close shave with little hassle wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Good solid shaver that should last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I get a good shave out of it, but I have found the on/off switch to be weak</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly reccomend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this razor, but I was also hesitant.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>High quality and performance.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product for everyone.</li>
            <li>It shaves cleanly and the rechargeable battery has a long life.</li>
            <li>When the battery died in my old one after MANY years of use, I didn&#x27;t consider any other brand but Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>Many men find an electric less appealing if they have a heavy beard, &amp; I would tend to agree.</li>
            <li>The flip-out trimmer is also not a very aggressive cutter, but it&#x27;s fine inasmuch as it won&#x27;t let you get too out-of-control on your moustache.  </li>
            <li>This is far better than any other shaver I have used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far better than all other makes that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>I bought a single foil travel shaver that worked very well and decided to replace my old Remington with this foil shaver as my primary shaver because it was on sale.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little longer to shave with a safety razor and there is more razor burn.</li>
            <li>I would invest a little more in a newer model.</li>
            <li>It appears to give a better trim, and is a little easier to control.  </li>
            <li>When it was time to replace the blades again at $32, I decided to pay a little more and get this one.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend keeping a stiff-bristle brush on hand, because running water won&#x27;t clean it up completely.</li>
            <li>It does a good job on tough areas like chin and neck.</li>
            <li>first foil shaver and its not bad at all considering its half the price of my rotary shaver, I&#x27;m sure the more expensive foil raisers can match rotary cutters.</li>
            <li>The battery life has never been as good as the older one and is getting worse.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product to anyone that wants a razor to use in or out of the shower and has a sensitive face.</li>
            <li>A good second addition for the average man, but not the one you want to use before that major presentation  at the shareholders meeting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Superb sharpness, fits perfectly in my hand, holds a charge for freaking ever, travels well, I cannot say anything bad about it.</li>
            <li>It gives a close, but comfortable shave wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m really liking it.</li>
            <li>If this is like old one, heads will last at best 6 months and are expensive, so check that cost beforehand.</li>
            <li>Charging was much faster than my old razor at about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>clean then take it apart to dry...</li>
            <li>Its much quitier than old Remington.</li>
            <li>So far very happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave a close or as fast as my old Braun</li>
            <li>This product is not wonderful but the price was great.  </li>
            <li>I like to use an electric razor on my face when it&#x27;s clean and dry.</li>
            <li>About a week for normal shaving.</li>
            <li>I know it says that you normally have a break in period for electric shavers, but for me there was none.</li>
            <li>It does a better job than my Braun 320-4 and with a heavy beard</li>
            <li>takes more effort to shave, although will do the job if you keep at it long enough.  </li>
            <li>This shaver works OK (similar to my braun and remington electic shavers that I used several years ago) but nowhere near as close a shave as with a blade.</li>
            <li>However, my facial hair grows slower than most of my friends-heck, my 14 year old cousin&#x27;s facial hair is heavier than mine</li>
            <li>The buzzing is considerably quieter with this model than with my 82xx, and that surprised me when I first turned it on.  </li>
            <li>I found that this Panasonic is quiet and powerful.</li>
            <li>I tested it from 100%, let it run non-stop, and it went to 0% normally.</li>
            <li>If someone had trouble with the battery, that&#x27;s one thing, but as a shaver, you&#x27;re not going to find a better shaver than this one.</li>
            <li>Then after a few more months it would shut off at 20%.  </li>
            <li>SPEND A FEW BUCKS MORE AND GET A PANOSONIC LINERA WITH A 10,000 RPM MOTOR.</li>
            <li>I use a razor first but follow up with the Panasonic for a really close shave that will last 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>I got tired of the slow-healing shaving nicks brought on by anticoagulant therapy and thought an electric might be a good alternative to the multi-blade razors I&#x27;ve always used.</li>
            <li>Despite the accident, he has dropped the shiver and cause the broken blade; replace and good till now.</li>
            <li>I cannot improve on the hundreds of other positive reviews here, but I just want to do a shout out to Panasonic for manufacturing a GREAT wet dry razor.</li>
            <li>Every man wants the best, close shave with the least amount of effort wet or dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are other shavers that have more gadgets on them that are more expensive, but I am content enough will this one to not care about it.</li>
            <li>I also like the sound, higher pitched than my Bruan, with far less vibration.</li>
            <li>Much better than any of the other major name brands.  </li>
            <li>and i would rather have a new razor for a few bucks more then replacing blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shaver continues to forego any razor burn, even under the chin, which is a major positive.</li>
            <li>I had to throw it in the trash and switch back to my 5 year old model, which I had luckily kept as a spare.  </li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve got a similar 2-blade travel model as well, and it&#x27;s much less effective.  </li>
            <li>the benefit of shaving dry or wet is nice.</li>
            <li>I have owned other brands and they don&#x27;t cut as well or are more difficult to get a good cut.</li>
            <li>experience has been right in the middle.</li>
            <li>Great wet and dry shaving, and I will go against the grain and say I prefer dry.</li>
            <li>Although, considerably more expensive than my previous Panasonic razors, it was still the best value as compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>my facial hair is only slightly thick, and i have lots of difficulty to use the trimmer to make accurate and effective cuts with this shaver.</li>
            <li>So, with the face shaved mostly clean, I go along the center of my adams apple, the edge of my chin left and right, and around my mouth.</li>
            <li>I also started shaving wet and it is a significant improvement.</li>
            <li>This shaver runs quieter than the other model and ever bit as smooth a shave.  </li>
            <li>very good, only one thing not perfect, can&#x27;t use it when charging the battery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned to live with</li>
            <li>and I used it for 3 years with no problems, but it needed a new blade head</li>
            <li>, it was time to get a new Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>If you like it, might as well just buy a new one once a year.</li>
            <li>I use them until I think the battery is about to die, then buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I never seemed to have a new cartridge when I needed it anyway.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now on the market for a new shaver, but it won&#x27;t be a Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I could not be happier with my new Panasonic shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can live with that</li>
            <li>I can attest to the recommendation to replace the foil every year as both of my razors needed a new foil.  </li>
            <li>I have used my new panasonic for over a month</li>
            <li>Panasonic my new shaver.(Quick charge).a+ a+ a+</li>
            <li>Recommended this to my Dad and anyone else who mentions needing a new electric shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to order a new razor and it will not be a Panasonic.</li>
            <li>When I went to order new blades, again, in November, I decided to give this new Panasonic wet/dry another try.</li>
            <li>so I will just live with it.</li>
            <li>Everything I was looking for in a new electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>shaves then buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>Cost of replacement foil and blades is almost as much as a new unit.</li>
            <li>On balance, if I wasn&#x27;t using the Mach 3 on my face, I&#x27;d probably have returned this shaver for a new rotary.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy a new razor.</li>
            <li>and after shaving three times with this new shaver, it is still at 100% charge according to the readout.</li>
            <li>I just get a new razor.</li>
            <li>When new, after about 40 minutes it would go to 20%, then die.  </li>
            <li>Instead of buying a new foil and new blades I decided to save some money and try this razor.</li>
            <li>But, the new shaver is lower cost than the replacement blades with the head.</li>
            <li>this one in a New York</li>
            <li>I have had no problems whatsoever and would recommend this model to any man needing a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>The weight and heft are much more comfortable and substantial than the comparably-priced new Remingtons (I tried one and returned it) which feel lightweight and cheesy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about being able to swivel left and right</li>
            <li>very quickly (again, my previous model took 15+ hours according to the manual).</li>
            <li>However, after a few passes from different directions even that cleaned up nice and close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, this is the closest shave that I have ever had and with the help of shaving oil and shaving while wet, I love this razor and will definitely buy another when I wear this on out.</li>
            <li>Along with his heavy beard, he has sensitive skin and most razors irritate it.  </li>
            <li>I was a Braun user for many years, but the last cutter/foil I purchased gave me rough shaves.  </li>
            <li>I only have it as an emergency back up if I forget to charge my primary</li>
            <li>Went back to real blades, these razors don&#x27;t really do the job...</li>
            <li>It also shows how much charge is left, a real convenience.</li>
            <li>Shaves very well, but takes more passes than an Arc IV, at least on my face, which docked it a star.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s entirely too big and will hardly fit into any compact shower/travel bag.</li>
            <li>it shaves well, and keeps the cuttings in until yopu are ready to clean it--unlike the braun i had previously.</li>
            <li>It is too early to tell how mu capacity Panasonic has engineered into this particular model.  </li>
            <li>There will be some strong points to use less hurt the skin.</li>
            <li>That gets you a new device, under warranty, for very little more than the replacement parts.  </li>
            <li>Granted, I&#x27;m coming from a very old women&#x27;s Remington (26009HE).  </li>
            <li>think if you have a very round face and a very light beard this razor may work well for you.</li>
            <li>Battery will last up to 3 shaves and it charges up very fast.</li>
            <li>this comes very near to equaling the closeness of the shave when I want to shave another way.</li>
            <li>The basic design is similar, but it is obvious the blades don&#x27;t move nearly as fast and the motor is not as strong.  </li>
            <li>It charges fast but runs down quite quickly too.  </li>
            <li>I wonder if this is part of the problem - you end up effectively with a big flat surface, rather than the curve of a single foil head.  </li>
            <li>I do miss the \\&quot;ARC\\&quot; feature of my old shaver because it seemed to fit my face better, but I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this line of products.</li>
            <li>At this point I am not sure if I will try a better razor.</li>
            <li>you have to realize that first, any electric shaver takes time to train a beard and second, for a face to get use to it.</li>
            <li>shave in the shower with shaving cream with a tri-blade standard razor first, then I follow with this.</li>
            <li>Battery consistently drains to 80% after just 2 shaves although you can charge it back up in under an hour.  </li>
            <li>Even my old Panasonic ES-4001 came with a dock!</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I also appreciate the modest cost!</li>
            <li>construction is first-rate and the first thing that struck me was how quiet it was.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would add to this shaver is a pretty girl to use it on my face.  </li>
            <li>The other two were great although they didn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, I occasionally nick myself with the trimmer.</li>
            <li>He said it was ok, but did not cut as well as Panasonics he has had in the past.</li>
            <li>and oh, yes... this is the first electric shaver I have ever had that has a trimmer that actually works!</li>
            <li>This is the second Panasonic ES-RT51-S I have owned, the first one I purchased almost eleven years ago...</li>
            <li>I have been using Panasonic wet/dry shaver for the past 10 years and love them.  </li>
            <li>But going back to my original plan of switching from blade to electric, after four weeks I am going back to the blade.  </li>
            <li>Recharging is very fast.&lt;br /&gt;I switched from Braun a few years ago and find that middle of the line Panasonic shavers work just as well for my beard and prices are better, considering Braun is also made is China and not Germany.</li>
            <li>I will look at Panasonic products first for all future purchases!</li>
            <li>Overall, I am satisfied with this product because I found other usages for it</li>
            <li>, it was his favorite gift this past</li>
            <li>Of the dozens of items that I have purchased at Amazon over the years, this is the first and only item that I returned for a refund.  </li>
            <li>When the repaired unit comes back, I have a spare, or as I did with the first, I give it to my son.  </li>
            <li>Sent back paying shipment  first one as it does not cut, for replacement which does not cut either.</li>
            <li>This is so much has quieter, much smoother operation than my old R-brand that I stuck with for 10 years and several purchases.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it was just user error, but apparently i just bought a razor that is absolute garbage.</li>
            <li>I have purchased several panasonics over the years and only the first two, bought back ten years ago and more, have met my standards.</li>
            <li>I bought it thinking hey this looks like a cool razor that you can use wet.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the wet feature although I thought it might be cool when I bought it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand why a much newer model wouldn&#x27;t shave as well as the older one, but it&#x27;s definitely not as a close a shave.</li>
            <li>Does as good a job as my previous Remington shaver that was half the cost.  </li>
            <li>currently only use this now to shave my mustache when it starts looking crusty and just let my beard be for a couple days and then use a regular razor again whenever I need to get a clean</li>
            <li>The shaver is fairly quiet and can be easily cleaned dry with a tooth brush or with a stream of water if you prefer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>really sucks on very fine hair (ex:</li>
            <li>So I used to use electric shavers way back when in high school and college because they were fast and convenient</li>
            <li>It is fast, smooth, ultra quiet and sharp.  </li>
            <li>For $40 I have a whole new shaver as a back up, and plenty of time for modifications to my new charging system.  </li>
            <li>So, what I do is wait until about 15 months and buy a new one, then send the old one for repair.</li>
            <li>I bought this instead of buying a new foil for my old Braun 1775 shaver.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased to say the least and actually don&#x27;t dread shaving.</li>
            <li>and it is fantastic as everyone said previously.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I wanted a foil shaver that would be quieter because my wife didn&#x27;t like the sound of my previous shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shaver cleans easily with a couple of drops of liquid soap and water every few days.</li>
            <li>and it did not dry the shaver very well.</li>
            <li>I recently bought two of these as a replacement to my old shaver, and as my son&#x27;s first shaver.</li>
            <li>But remember you might take more than your usual time to complete the job.</li>
            <li>And as far as the battery goes, I am still on the first charge and have 60% left after 6 shaves.  </li>
            <li>With a dry shave, I&#x27;ve had the best results so far with a combination of rapid back and forth moves, combined with long slow moves, all against the grain of the beard.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This model had the wider head that all Braun shavers now have (a change that I think the company completed around 2010), and it required many many passes to shave well and often failed to get long hairs.</li>
            <li>battery life is great, should last at least 5 shaves per charge, depending on how long it takes you each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had a better experience shaving on wet skin than on dry</li>
            <li>I like it better as a wet shaver than a dry one.</li>
            <li>Works perhaps slightly better dry than wet.  </li>
            <li>Love that it can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li>This one requires much more pressure, several passes, and leaves a slight razor burn.  </li>
            <li>It features a kick-ass, high RPM motor, an LCD battery gauge, and some very sharp blades with Nanotech coating that do quick work.  </li>
            <li>It is of course much cheaper to buy a new one such as this model - rather than getting the old one repaired, which is a</li>
            <li>bought this because the blades in my old one had gotten dull and I discovered (to my surprise and annoyance) that I could buy a new shaver (with warranty) for just a bit more than the price of a replacement head for the old one.</li>
            <li>that you can use this wet or dry shaving, I just don&#x27;t like that you don&#x27;t get a close, smooth shave as with a real razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already on day 24 of its very first charge and only now it is starting to fade.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I don&#x27;t have a super heavy beard, just a normal, have to shave daily type of beard.</li>
            <li>: Close, smooth shave with little or no irritation.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>However, the new shaver has very poor build quality and died for good after about 6 months of use.  </li>
            <li>I liked it enough but the battery was on its last limp and buying a new battery cost as much as buying the same shaver again.</li>
            <li>A dull disposable did a better job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This razor looks good and feels a little heavy.</li>
            <li>was a great disappointment.</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t had a problem with this except in 1 area: the very end of my mustache near the corner of my mouth sometimes requires a second pass to get maybe 1 or 2 hairs that didn&#x27;t get cut.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-No cleaning brush is included (you can run this razor under water with soap to clean), so hang onto your brush from your previous razor if you have one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;MY FACE WOULD CLEAR UP.</li>
            <li>The battery is clearly dying.</li>
            <li>Close shave and less clean up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my fourth shaver after a bunch of cheap Remingtons with which I wasn&#x27;t careful and broke the foils</li>
            <li>my old wet/dry shaver had just died.</li>
            <li>that damned near could chop</li>
            <li>one thing that I really like about this model is that it has a digital display to show how much charge is left in the battery.  </li>
            <li>I never let the battery drain completely</li>
            <li>This is similar to the Remington Shaver Saver, but the Oster Kool Lube is much, much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>So, the only thing I don&#x27;t really care for is that fact that it \\&quot;pivots\\</li>
            <li>: Takes several passes to get a really close shave</li>
            <li>I bought this razor when my old Panasonic&#x27;s batteries wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and a lot of thing irritate me.</li>
            <li>bought for husband for Christmas, so far does the job, with no complaints.</li>
            <li>The exposed charging contacts at the bottom of the shaver is my only real gripe...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t encountered any negatives so far.</li>
            <li>(The head of the Panasonic even looks like that of the old narrow-head</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a complete novice at this</li>
            <li>so I was surprised when he didn&#x27;t have to come ask me for help.</li>
            <li>Tried using it with lather but found that I got a much closer shave using it the regular way with Lectri shave.</li>
            <li>I always had touch up with my old shaver after shaving with this shaver.</li>
            <li>Replaced and old Norelco.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;BY FAR, this is the finest shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The second was how fast the shave heads are moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old Braun would do it in one sweep.  </li>
            <li>My Panasonic ES-RT51 is now about two years old.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s ready for the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a really sensitive face and have even had electric razors that make my face break out.</li>
            <li>So far I have used this razor once</li>
            <li>so it does not turn on in your luggage which happened to my old razor.</li>
            <li>I was looking to replace my old Panasonic 2 blade shaver.</li>
            <li>Also, the readout indicating how much battery strength is left before needing to recharge is not reliable.</li>
            <li>three uses thus far and still at 80% battery.</li>
            <li>And unlike my old razors, it cannot be used while plugged in to a wall outlet.</li>
            <li>Have not used the mustache trimmer much because the actual device blocks the view in the mirror.</li>
            <li>and actually only shaves about every 3 days saying his beard just doesn&#x27;t grow that fast anymore.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s 93 and has always used a straight regular razor with shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I warned him that he will still need to use his disposable razor every now and again around the neck area as none of the electrics I&#x27;ve ever owned do a complete job on the neck.  </li>
            <li>When you turn it on, it tells you how much power is left before you have to recharge it.</li>
            <li>So far the razor is doing well and meets all of my expectations</li>
            <li>Needed something for my son with sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use a razor without it tearing up his face.  </li>
            <li>Old time technology, avoid it.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace an old electric razor.</li>
            <li>Its environmental statement says that it will &amp;#34;practice prudent, sustainable use of earth&#x27;s natural resources and the protection of our environment&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My old triple took about a minute.</li>
            <li>It takes a lot longer to shave with the electric and the shave is no where near as close as a blade razor...</li>
            <li>The pop up trimmer does a reasonable job of trimming around my goatee and back of my neck.  </li>
            <li>I might just find someone on ebay that has a bunch of blades, buy a supply and keep the old one running.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old ES8077, which had the Arc system.  </li>
            <li>With my old ES8077, i needed to shave every day.  </li>
            <li>I was not using the self-cleaning features of the old shaver and decided to buy just the shaver.</li>
            <li>however I sent the shaver back to Panasonic and they replaced it in a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li>) Short on funds I opted for the \\&quot;much</li>
            <li>Purchased for husband as his old Braun shaver would no longer hold a charge.  </li>
            <li>$50 does not go as far as it used to....</li>
            <li>I shave early in the morning</li>
            <li>After nearly 65 years, I started getting razor rash after shaving with my blade.  </li>
            <li>I am a 67 year old retiree and have had to shave twice a day since I was in my 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Battery lasted until early 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s an inherent problem with such designs as compared to the rotary blade setup in the Norelco - I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>I was also surprised to see it began rusting at the recharge port.</li>
            <li>(I am using my old Remington case)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Time will tell but I like the results, so far, and I didn&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li>My son wanted a razor that had a straight across blade and found this one for his Christmas present.  </li>
            <li>AS A 2YR OLD PANASONIC BATTERY DIED.  </li>
            <li>It looks like it will die completely within the year.</li>
            <li>Make sure the last few strokes go directly against the lie of your beard</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now 75 years old and have used lather and blade up until about 9 months ago when I purchased an under thirty bucks corded Norelco for the convenience while traveling and camping.  </li>
            <li>I also like the charge feature where you always know how much charge is left.</li>
            <li>my old one.  </li>
            <li>While it has some bells and whistles that the 3041 didn&#x27;t have, it doesn&#x27;t do the job nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>it doesnt shave as well as my 10 year old razor.  </li>
            <li>but he says &amp;#34;so far, so good&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to everyone who wants to shave with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>had to switch to electric razor after open heart surgery and was placed on blood thinners for a period of time,had always used a razor and blade,this is much safer.hope to continue to use after the med is</li>
            <li>my old one did.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 92 year old Dad in a nursing home.  </li>
            <li>I bought for my boyfriend who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I had an early model of Panasonic razor, with identical parts.</li>
            <li>I have used many different electric razors and few do a thorough job.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re still good; my thin facial hair obviously doesn&#x27;t cause much wear on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My experience so far leads me to believe rotaries cut better, or at least faster.</li>
            <li>Since there&#x27;s nothing spectacular about the shave and the power management is poor, I&#x27;m giving it a 2-star.</li>
            <li>Good shaver, I have a sad history of shavers not working</li>
            <li>My last one which is about two years old and was very expensive worked fine but fit and finish had much to be desired, after about two weeks the swivel lock for the head pretty much broke, long story shory</li>
            <li>As a guy who likes to sharpen his own tools, I gotta think, theoretically, the extra lubrication SHOULD make the blades stay sharp longer and, at the same time, be easier on the motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is also the first shaver I&#x27;ve bought that you can take in the shower with you, so again, I prove I am no expert and a little behind the times, but I HAVE tried a lot of ways to mow my crop, including straight razors, and I can say this razor, used with shaving cream, really gives me a smooth shave, fast.</li>
            <li>The original batteries died after a little over a year.  </li>
            <li>While it is not as close as a blade it is very good in about the same or less time and without the mess as I haven&#x27;t had to use the wet shave feature to do it.</li>
            <li>The motor isn&#x27;t as strong, you have to struggle to get an equal shave, and you have to recharge it before the batteries go down below 60 percent or</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase after never previously owning a Panasonic razor before.  </li>
            <li>...does a better job in less time and with less work (the Pany has to have shave foam in order to really get a close shave and it just takes longer to get the job done).</li>
            <li>Since I was satisfied with Panasonic&#x27;s wet linear style shavers, I had this model purchased for me which was a fraction of the cost of the other one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned at least 3 other Panasonic razors and loved them all.  </li>
            <li>As for the quality, it seems pretty decent and time will tell as to how long this product will last.</li>
            <li>The pop-up trimmer on that model stopped working, it needed new foil and blades, so I decided to replace the entire unit since the replacement foil/blades cost about $30 and this new unit</li>
            <li>, you&#x27;d think there are plenty of potential new customers coming up for new products and they might consider revising their pricing policy on repair parts to bring it in line with their stated environmental policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it was the same price for a new shaver vs new foils/blades.</li>
            <li>donâ€™t have to bang the thing on the sink to clean, just put in a little soap and turn it on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of the Main things i really like about this razor is the fact that you can wet shave with it....</li>
            <li>I use this wet or dry so far it seems to be fine.</li>
            <li>I have a thick, full beard that is very tough, so this shaver is truly performing great.  </li>
            <li>Now several more months later, it runs down to 40% and shuts off.  </li>
            <li>I will be shopping for an older Panasonic shaver from when they actually produced a quality product.</li>
            <li>The first one, roughly 15 years old, is in the RV and it still performs like a champ.</li>
            <li>The main reason I bought this model was because I happen to have two extra cutter/foil packages for another shaver that I was using and malfunctioned.  </li>
            <li>My only minimally non-positive comment on this unit is that I do notice a difference between the previous unit&#x27;s 13k rpm motor and this unit&#x27;s 10k rpm motor, in regards to catching some errant hairs along my jaw line.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had luck with both, but after my last high dollar Braun bit the dust after just 18 months</li>
            <li>This razor leaves spots on my neck literally untouched, despite a half-dozen passes over the same, highly visible coin-sized patch of hair.  </li>
            <li>know I am going to sound like a bit of a shill because I have only used this product recently, but I have shaved with several different brands and models of electric shavers over the years.</li>
            <li>Finally, tired with constant charging, I send the unit back to Panasonic for service (2 year warranty is great) and bought ES8103S from Amazon to replace it while left without a shaver.</li>
            <li>The price on these parts are almost as much as buying a new unit.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, but NO thanks.</li>
            <li>The wet shave is definitely the way to go, a little Nivea Men&#x27;s Face Wash and some warm water</li>
            <li>Smooth shave both wet and dry.</li>
            <li>I attribute this more to the Panasonic&#x27;s design and less to the wet shave.</li>
            <li>Panasonic razors are the best, but this one falls short, at least for tough beards.</li>
            <li>I have very dry sensitive skin on my face and am very particular with my electric shavers.</li>
            <li>still seems to hold charge reasonably long and still charges fast</li>
            <li>it ok but not good as i though</li>
            <li>have really coarse facial hair and go through razors fast as a young man in my 30s.</li>
            <li>It keeps its&#x27; charge for a long time and recharges fast.</li>
            <li>Pretty close to a blade if you do it wet or in shower.  </li>
            <li>this unit shaved well and close for the first week, then, it started shaving roughly, and did not give a close shave, almost like a woman had used it to shave her legs, and coarsened it.  </li>
            <li>was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>They usually come with a cleaner/ recharger station and to be honest don&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>he only used it a few times and went back to disposables because they worked better.</li>
            <li>At present, it&#x27;s good for at least five shaves to empty.</li>
            <li>This was the first electric razor that I&#x27;ve used, so maybe my expectations were a little bit too high.</li>
            <li>You can spend much more money on other models, but this one works very well on my thick beard.  </li>
            <li>I have moved into the 21st century with this new Panasonic electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I finally said To hell with it, and ordered new brushes from you folks, which  are on the way.</li>
            <li>The only option is to purchase a new razor.</li>
            <li>tried an experiment with keeping the same blade for about a year, then comparing it with a new blade (foil, cutter, etc.)  </li>
            <li>Got my new Panasonic ES-RT51-s last night, AND BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY IT IS ALMOST AS CLOSE</li>
            <li>11/12/15 I finally gave in and purchased a new Braun.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the pivot action of the head is that helpful as it seems a tad bit too tense for easy movement, but it&#x27;s not a hindrance to my shaving, either.</li>
            <li>After using Panasonic Wet &amp; Dry shavers for years and trying many different models I thought I had found the one I would stay with but low and behold</li>
            <li>My old Norelco died an early death and this is a terrific replacement.  </li>
            <li>and I always have to replace the blades to fast, the Norelco had 3 circular blades which took me multiple attempts over the same area</li>
            <li>I fully expect this one to last as long and shave as well as the first Panasonic did.</li>
            <li>As a lifelong Panasonic Razor customer, I have always enjoyed their razors and understand they need to be replaced every few years.  </li>
            <li>Even after multiple passes, I still have very visible facial hair.</li>
            <li>I used to have a Panasonic long time back when they first came out with washable shavers.</li>
            <li>Pop-up trimmer works fine, and the long hair foil in the middle of the two main foils does seem to catch longer hairs in a few passes.  </li>
            <li>for sensitive skin (I&#x27;ve never been able to use an electric razor behind my knees before, but I could with this.  </li>
            <li>Almost as good as expensive regular razors.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a back up to my very old Panasonic ES-8017, which I have replaced the batteries myself with rechargeable batteries.    </li>
            <li>Shaving with this razor requires an excess of facial gymnastics to cut every whisker as it seems to be very sensitive to the direction in which the hair grows.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice razor, looks very expensive  </li>
            <li>Is ok, work good , the only thing that the blades are very expensive, half the price of the same item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned all the major brands and you cannot beat the Panasonic and price</li>
            <li>No regrets!</li>
            <li>No other shaver has even come close to this machine for me.</li>
            <li>It allows me to shave with a gel and prevent razor burn which is a major plus for me.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I am extremely pleased with this electric razor!</li>
            <li>It does take some time, not perfect on the first pass, however once complete my face is as smooth as a razor without any cuts, redness, or irritation.  </li>
            <li>If you just need dry, then you can go even cheaper and still get the exact same shave quality.  </li>
            <li>quick to recharge [usually about an hour for a complete charge, which renders about 8, 3 minute shaves.</li>
            <li>A full charge will only last long enough for one shave.  </li>
            <li>Previously I used Panasonic&#x27;s ES8109S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade model for many years until it broke down.</li>
            <li>They truly provide an extremely close comfortable wet shave.</li>
            <li>I had an electric razor a long time ago and didn&#x27;t like it, I just couldn&#x27;t get a decent shave without it taking forever.</li>
            <li>They use special proprietary batteries which cost $20+ for two little batteries that look like a AA battery only that they have a metal prong welded on each end.  </li>
            <li>I have experienced some pretty bad shaver burns over the years using other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have only recently gotten a decent shave, after resorting to a pre-shave lotion (Afta).  </li>
            <li>Issues with longer beards, not a huge difference between this and a Norelco as I hoped; still have to make multiple passes to get clean shaven.</li>
            <li>However it does a decent job of cutting and has a nice grip.</li>
            <li>BUT AS WITH THE HIGH END UNITS, DOES NOT CUT LONG BEARD HAIR.</li>
            <li>battery does not last as long as previous razors, however I am easily getting 5-6 shaves out of a charge</li>
            <li>Have had teh razor only a little over a month; if continues as at present, 5 stars are justified.</li>
            <li>But having to charge it every other day or two gets old quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: When it went from 60%-0%, the blades would click/move ever so slightly, making a &#x27;tik-tik-tik&#x27; sound.</li>
            <li>Also, when I am running late I have used this dry and there is ZERO tug and pull, it is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I generally use blade shavers but like to use an electric about once or twice a week to give my skin a break.</li>
            <li>I generally like Panasonic products</li>
            <li>I shave in the shower and generally would get about a week out of a charge.  </li>
            <li>Does not cut long hair very well, but simple matter to use pop out clipper for that.</li>
            <li>So far we have had over 20 different manual razors and electric razors over 5.</li>
            <li>My old Razor, which cost about the same as this one, was made in Japan not China, and it supposedly ran at 13000 RPM.  </li>
            <li>So far he has only dropped it twice, but it did not crash into a million pieces.</li>
            <li>If you want a shaver that glides harmlessly over sensitive skin without necessarily taking off your beard, Braun might be the shaver for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve decided to go back to using an old fashioned safety razor.</li>
            <li>I could barely even feel it against my face and it cleared every hair off my neck.  </li>
            <li>Even with it flashing at 0 % urging me to charge it, it still has enough juice for me to complete my shave.</li>
            <li>Second charging appeared to complete after 14 hrs, but the shaver would not work.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li>We went back to using an old Norelco which I had almost discarded.  </li>
            <li>that if it is plugged in, it will not run which can be a problem if you don&#x27;t charge frequently and don&#x27;t notice you are on low juice.</li>
            <li>He used the wet shaving feature and said it was a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m old, so I&#x27;ve owned lots of different shavers.</li>
            <li>For the environment I wish they made one with a complete set of replaceable parts so you could keep it going without throwing out the body and charger only to buy it again.</li>
            <li>Another thing, it has a digital readout to tell you how much of a charge is left in the battery --- which incidentally only took 1 hour to fully charge ----</li>
            <li>Nowhere near the shaving results as before with the same model.</li>
            <li>I always shave wet, and get a very close shave every time.</li>
            <li>I can only get 3-4 shaves after a full charge before it&#x27;s completely dead.  </li>
            <li>Also, worth noting the charger and razor do not fit inside the bag provided.  </li>
            <li>I actually laughed when it stopped cutting in mid-shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s charge for quite a few shaves, so it is not really inconvenient to pull out the charging cord and let it sit on the counter till charged.</li>
            <li>Afterwords, I take the head off the shaver and turn the sink water on high and rinse the head off, give it a shake and dry it on a towel.  </li>
            <li>Battery charges very fast in less than 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>gives agood shave without irritating my sensitive skin.no cords to hassle with definitely a good price .can use wet or dry shave.</li>
            <li>It was cheaper to replace the entire shaver than simply purchasing new blades/foil.&lt;br /&gt;Go figure.  </li>
            <li>I figured that I would probably be better off with a new shaver, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li>Normally i will wait for deals on panasonic razors that are normally around $120 that are half off.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quieter than my previous one and it provide good shave (not great).</li>
            <li>The big plusses are that it gives a very close shave (especially where the beard grows sidways and flat)</li>
            <li>On looking further into the reviews, there are many complaints of getting less and less shaves as time passes.  </li>
            <li>For someone who has never used a wet/dry shaver it&#x27;s an odd sensation at first -</li>
            <li>I got about 15 shaves on the first charge and the recharge took less than an hour.</li>
            <li>definitely better than other electric razors of past years.</li>
            <li>Not only does it work, but it will actually shave his heavy beard--even after several days&#x27; growth--to a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>It works just as good as my expensive razor and to replace the foil is under $20 and uses the same blades as my more expensive Panasonic razor does.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s wet performance since I always use it dry, right after washing my face</li>
            <li>During use, it can tilt left and right and can be pushed in slightly, so it has some &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; when applying pressure to stubborn hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I do notice after going over my whole face and then rubbing over the skin with my other hand</li>
            <li>this shaver and the other Panasonic I purchased were both under a $100.00 and about over a hundred dollars cheaper than the one with all the bells and whistles and work VERY well.</li>
            <li>and I really wonder why men pay up to five times this price for any other shaver.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I get a better, closer shave with the Panasonic than I ever got with a conventional razor, and no more nicks.</li>
            <li>otherwise, not a single issue</li>
            <li>I have always owned Panasonic wed dry shavers because the wet dry&#x27;s are the easiest to clean.</li>
            <li>Would give 5 stars, but razor doesn&#x27;t run directly off of AC, only off charged DC internal battery.</li>
            <li>You will not get the same close shave that you get with a regular old fashion razor.</li>
            <li>I have written to panasonic direct expressing how the newer models do NOT last (have owned 5 models) and only got a reply of \\&quot;we are sorry\\&quot;!  </li>
            <li>Having the digital readout was worth the slight extra $5.</li>
            <li>The only issue is that the product description says the razor has Li-Ion battery, but it actually has NMH battery instead like the old one does.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as saying this shaver is horrible, but it isn&#x27;t the best.   </li>
            <li>First, when using dry, you do have to shave slowly to get all the hairs the first time.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little iffy about the idea of wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting very close shaves (much closer than Norelco, without the occasional chaffing irritation of the skin)that last all day with very little effort.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first little thing is just the cost of the shaver versus replacement foils.</li>
            <li>failure mode on all 5 of my Panasonics (yes, 10.5 years worth!)</li>
            <li>the shave is not good or comfortable</li>
            <li>I find I have to go over areas two or three times and still get only a barely passable shave.  </li>
            <li>I owned an old model a long time ago and wanted a wet/dry shaver</li>
            <li>A few years ago I got my first Panasonic Shaver as a birthday gift and never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;Things</li>
            <li>First few shaves take it</li>
            <li>Took care of heavy stubble beard on the first try.  </li>
            <li>Just squirt some antibacterial hand soap into the head run for a few seconds and flush with hot water.</li>
            <li>The charging cord is not curled round, but a super long, straight, 5ft, typical electronics style charging cord.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much for the product, due to the fact it is not in my possession, but I can say that the purchase was a breeze as always with amazon!</li>
            <li>With little variety on the market I was pretty much left with the Norelco or Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>Better than some other brands I had in the past!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an Asian male with mostly straight facial hair, some spots are straight but may grow a little slanted in one direction which require a couple of passes if left too long without shaving.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable when using a shaving gel but irritating when used dry.</li>
            <li>I have already ordered a replacement set of foils, the mfg wants $30, but they can be had for less.    </li>
            <li>my previous shavers used induction charging so there were no exposed contacts...but again, for the price, can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>just bought a Norelco, for less money (a rotary type shaver) which I like a whole lot</li>
            <li>Norelco 730 gives me a much closer shave in less time</li>
            <li>My personal preference is Every Man Jack shave creme (the one that comes in a tube, not can) since it&#x27;s not foamy and it does not dry out my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All you do is rinse the head hot water WHILE it is on, then power off and remove the head, turn it back on and rinse the blades by themselves for a few seconds, again while running.</li>
            <li>Worthy replacement for the ES8077, which I think I&#x27;ve had for at least five years.</li>
            <li>and I already have a single blade Panasonic electric shaver that is a backup to my old Remington 2 blade shaver.  </li>
            <li>It took about 3x the time to shave as my old Remington and longer than even my single blade Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>Second, in terms of design, the pop up trimmer does not allow use with the main heads as some other shavers to grab those stubborn neck hairs.</li>
            <li>The weak point is the battery which isn&#x27;t readily available as a replacement.</li>
            <li>Gets very close, and with significantly less irritation than the last razor I owned.</li>
            <li>trying a few electrics over past years I have generally not been satisfied.  </li>
            <li>So I have to downgrade this review from the four-star rating of &amp;#34;I like it&amp;#34; to the two-star rating of &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like it.&amp;#34; Maybe it just needs a new battery, but I&#x27;m not interested in paying another chunk of money to find out.</li>
            <li>So I have to downgrade this review from the four-star rating of &amp;#34;I like it&amp;#34; to the two-star rating of &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like it.&amp;#34; Maybe it just needs a new battery, but I&#x27;m not interested in paying another chunk of money to find out.</li>
            <li>This one is a little lower on the RPM&#x27;s but much quieter and actually gives an even closer shave.  </li>
            <li>If I go slow or fast, press hard or light, with the grain or not.</li>

            <li> Very nice shave.</li>
            <li> Very nice cut for the price.</li>
            <li> Very effective.  </li>

            <li> Very nice shaver.</li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> this is a awesome shaver,gets super close,i love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> it works good and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> This one is no different...solid build, good cut (nothing will be as close as a razor) for a great price (under $60).</li>
            <li> This shaver is built well, looks great, &amp; does a good job for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver, holds its charge for many shaves...</li>
            <li> In fact, the battery life is one of the most impressive things about this device.</li>
            <li> i think panasonic make best shaver much better then Braun(over price) and Norelco( did not work well at all)</li>
            <li> So as I stated this unit feels good in your hands while shaving, gives a great shave and has a killer battery.  </li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver of the many I&#x27;ve owned over 50+ years.  </li>
            <li> Glad I did because he is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> He says it is the best electric shaver he has ever had, and I know we paid more for some of the others.  </li>
            <li> Great shaved and good price</li>
            <li> I use a Neutrogena shave lotion, some warm water, the the Panasonic performs just like a razor without the burn or cuts!  </li>
            <li> Does the job, nothing particularly remarkable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d like to give all of you some good advice on how to get a great electric shave.</li>
            <li> The one thing that I&#x27;m most impressed with is the battery.  </li>
            <li> If it gave a good shave it would be a very nice item.</li>
            <li> It fits my needs, has nice feel, and is a good price!</li>
            <li> and this one is a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> They say it is very easy to get a good shave!</li>
            <li> Charging this is very easy as it has a display to indicate the battery life of the shaver!</li>
            <li> amazon the pest good  item.</li>
            <li> good quality for the price</li>
            <li> I think is a good pirchase</li>
            <li> all was good.</li>
            <li> good service</li>
            <li> They are good designs and priced well.</li>
            <li> The cheapest one available with the best reviews was the Panasonic ES-RT51-s.  </li>
            <li> Quite, gives a good shave</li>
            <li> This surprisingly did not.</li>
            <li> life is good.  </li>
            <li> HE SAID GO AND BUY YOU AN ELECTRIC RAZOR (A GOOD ONE )</li>
            <li> A GOOD ONE.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used foil type Remington Shavers for years...and loved them.</li>
            <li> The trimmer adjustment is really good.</li>
            <li> Good for sideburns and nape of neck/hairline.     </li>
            <li> Discount brands are not as good setting up your beard.</li>
            <li> Not as good as a blade</li>
            <li> loved that this was waterproof, and could be used in the shower and with shaving cream/gel.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> To be fair, this electric razor otherwise functions as advertised.</li>
            <li> You must move slower to get a good shave, but the shave IS good.  </li>
            <li> good razor for the price.</li>
            <li> I got it for under $50, which makes it a good value too.</li>
            <li> Not so good of a product.</li>
            <li> Holds a good charge.</li>
            <li> Good price point.  </li>
            <li> After my boyfriend fighting with his shaver for MONTHS before Christmas it was time to invest in a good one.  </li>
            <li> good quality</li>
            <li> It is not as good as the lady&#x27;s shaver (though it is sharper and shaves closer), for my purposes.</li>
            <li> This gift for my husband was a good choice.  </li>
            <li> Good ergonomics, (weight, balance, shape).</li>
            <li> Good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Does good shaving.</li>
            <li> I got what I pay for , doesn&#x27;t shave good</li>
            <li> As good as advertised.</li>
            <li> I imagine this one is just as good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that good.</li>
            <li> Good weight and well balanced.  </li>
            <li> The reviews looked good</li>
            <li> I have been using a Phillips Norelco Razor for years (the type with the three spinning disks), and I could never get a good shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The battery indicator is actually surprisingly helpful as well.  </li>
            <li> Decided to try an Arc 3 8103  and loved it.</li>
            <li> Good price for good quality .</li>
            <li> Good product... recomended 100%</li>
            <li> A good close shave, which is what this razor gives.</li>
            <li> Good product does good job .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of electric razors (Braun, Norelco, Remington and Walgreens) and this Panasonic is probably the best value available.</li>
            <li> Smoothest Shave and good battery life.</li>
            <li> Using a shaving gell felt really good with this shaver.</li>
            <li> But the Panasonic is a superior shaver compared to others in its class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> think I got a good product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, it does not do a good job shaving you.</li>
            <li> The person it was bought for loved it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;good good</li>
            <li> I still believe that any electric razor will never be as good as a blade.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The trimmer is not as good as my beard trimmer (go figure), but works in a pinch.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic wet/dry sounded like a good choice as the price was comparable to the replacement blades for Norelco.</li>
            <li> Seems like a good value</li>
            <li> Battery is good for about 14 shaves but</li>
            <li> a couple years would be nice lol...</li>
            <li> good shaver.</li>
            <li> Good batter life.</li>
            <li> works good</li>
            <li> It gives a good close shave.</li>
            <li> The shaver gives a good shave.</li>
            <li> It shaves good.</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> It has a good appearance and I like the t-handle</li>
            <li> The battery is good.</li>
            <li> Side-burn razor works good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have felt it was a good bargain.</li>
            <li> Does a really good job for the price.</li>
            <li> Does a good job retaining the shavings/whisker dust as well, so I can walk around the house or use it while reading the computer screen, etc...</li>
            <li> probably a good choice for anyone needing a travel razor, or just likes the convenience of rechargeable.</li>
            <li> This is about as good of an electric razor as you&#x27;re going to find today.</li>
            <li> Good price, prompt shipping.  </li>
            <li> Good price, good warranty ( 2 years ).</li>
            <li> THE PRICE WAS GOOD, BUT</li>
            <li> but i didn&#x27;t work good at all</li>
            <li> I like Panasonic razors and this one is a good one.</li>
            <li> anyway good deal for me.</li>
            <li> I bought for my hubby and he loved it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do jaw line good for me..</li>
            <li> Good shave for about 9 months.  </li>
            <li> My husband loved it.</li>
            <li> Good value too.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I got a good deal on it.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice razor with some nice features.</li>
            <li> a clean face gives me the best shave).</li>
            <li> great razor consistently gives a close shave, and feels great doing it!  </li>
            <li> Liked this shaver so much I bought another one!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> the razor was a gift for a special person, and he is very happy with the shaver, said never had one like it.  </li>
            <li> This one is very smooth and never hurts my face and works great in the shower as well.</li>
            <li> Although it gives a very good shave I cannot give it 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t give me that ultra smooth close shave all over my face.</li>
            <li> This is a very light razor, easy to handle and has an excellent trimmer.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This is what I bought and I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I owned a Panasonic 8033 shaver and was very pleased with it</li>
            <li> I am so happy not to need a separate cleaning system, but can use something that most all of us have,</li>
            <li> and I have been very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> but he was very pleased with the ease and end</li>
            <li> Gives great shaves, love it...</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my purchase of this razor.</li>
            <li> I love the razor does as great job</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the shaver.</li>

            <li> Been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It does look very nice and the display is ok.</li>
            <li> Can clean up the beard, very good.</li>
            <li> It gives me a good shave and cleans our very easy.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> gave this shaver a FIVE star, but I wish I could give it more!</li>
            <li> after many contacts with Panasonic attempting to  obtain the brush, I felt like I was dealing with Washington!</li>
            <li> so just a ok shaver!</li>
            <li> I cannot imagine a better shave!</li>
            <li> Am I glad I did!</li>
            <li> is has a higher speed and doesn&#x27;t grab, but I&#x27;m not too impressed with either one of them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in the process of \\&quot;training\\&quot; my beard, but the results have been phenomenal and NO RAZOR RASH !</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> Exactly what was hoping for...this inexpensive Panasonic shaver is perfect for my husband&#x27;s needs.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It made him happy to be able to do some self care with this easy to use shaver!</li>
            <li> Also very easy to keep clean and gets a very good shave.</li>
            <li> A very nice shaver, easy to use</li>
            <li> The shave is great; the razor is comfortable to hold and it runs quieter than any others I have owned.  </li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> It is amazing.  </li>
            <li> friend who recommended this amazing shaver, told me that he has been on it for 3+years and the shaver still perform it&#x27;s duty..</li>
            <li> I can take a nice leisurely shave on my drive in and it still registers 80% charge.  </li>
            <li> It gives him a nice close shave and he can handle it well, given the problems with his hands.  </li>
            <li> Nice feature: displays the remaining battery charge in 10% decrements.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that good love it.</li>
            <li> No razor burn, and this all done with no water,shaving cream,or lotion of any kind.      </li>
            <li> Holds a charge for 6+ shaves and gives me a nice, close shave.  </li>
            <li> I think you get a really nice shave either way.</li>
            <li> Nicely, the foil heads are inter changeable with the 31 RT, so I have 2 to use again.</li>
            <li> Keep it charged up, however, and it does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> This is the 5th Panasonic shaver I own.</li>
            <li> The charge indicator is nice.</li>
            <li> Panasonic shavers are the best and this one shaves close and fast.</li>
            <li> Overall, great value for money with a great shave!</li>
            <li> The wet/dry shaving aspect is nice too - you can use shaving cream, use it in the shower, etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This shaver gives me a nice close shave and causes virtually no irritation.  </li>
            <li> Now we each have one of our own.</li>
            <li> I thought the power indicator was a nice feature.</li>
            <li> it has a side burn trimmer which is handy.</li>
            <li> It contours nicely to your hand.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES RT51S gets a four star rating for providing a close shave that is nearly as good as the top of the line models offered by Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I have found that to shave effectively</li>
            <li> I used to own a Remington  rotary razor cordless.</li>
            <li> The lower part of the shaver becomes slightly warm during recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice razor and all</li>
            <li> pop-up trimmer is handy and effective.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really give me the best results.</li>
            <li> Provides a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li> It charged within an hour and the numerical battery indicator was a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice combination wet/dry shaver.....</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best shaver I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> This is an all around nice model for a medium beard.  </li>
            <li> The ES-RT51-S looks nice</li>
            <li> nice.</li>
            <li> His was thrilled with it and the features it has.</li>
            <li> Honestly this razor is a bargin and works</li>
            <li> Nice features and charging system but does not cut my beard close by any means.  </li>
            <li> Braun &amp; Remington, who used to make the best electric razors, absolutely stink today.</li>
            <li> My dad tried it and he liked it.</li>
            <li> I found I liked it and decided to upgrade to this ES-RT51.  </li>
            <li> This shaver gets the job done in an effective manner.</li>
            <li> That feature is handy if you neglect to charge it.</li>
            <li> My husband was delighted to be able to find another Panasonic razor.  </li>
            <li> it is nice</li>
            <li> It has a nice reassuring heft to it as well.</li>
            <li> I particularily liked the fact that it could be cleaned by rinsing with water.</li>
            <li> It is a nice shaver.</li>
            <li> However, this Panasonic does a nice job, and I like having the built-in trimmer.</li>
            <li> Very nice and comfortable</li>
            <li> Shaver gave a very good close shave and charging was very fast.</li>
            <li> With the caveat that I am someone with a very light beard, I am very satisfied with its performance.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic is made with high quality and does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> Free shipping is nice too!</li>
            <li> Good shave, easy to clean, great value</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic wet/dry shavers for about 5 years and my new ES-RT51-S 3 gives me the best shave yet.</li>
            <li> Best shave when used wet, but either way it will give you a great shave.</li>
            <li> It is great for a quick shave when in a hurry or maybe out camping.</li>
            <li> This shaver holds a good charge and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works great, charges quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this model shaver for many years, and love it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> If I enjoyed shaving, the Panasonic would rate 5 stars for eternal love!</li>
            <li> Great Shaver...and charges up very fast!</li>
            <li> This shaver does a good job of shaving, and the trimmer works just fine.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and gets a very good charge in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> I was the proud owner of a made in Japan ultrasonic wet/dry shaver that lasted pretty close to 15 years!  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping but quality of razor wasn&#x27;t very good</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is by far the BEST ELECTRIC RAZOR</li>
            <li> As far as using this shaver with shave gel or foam, pre-shave oil feels best.  </li>
            <li> It was good value for money, and free shipping.</li>
            <li> This is by near the best electric cordless shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> After 6 months of using it, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s so far the best electric razor for me.</li>
            <li> This was absolutely perfect for my 91 year old Dad.  </li>
            <li> It is nice to be able to use this shaver in the shower.</li>
            <li> Wow, very impressed with this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65 years old and this razor is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This unit has more difficulty catching longer hairs, even if I miss shaving for two days, than the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My legs are nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> Good for light shaving and on the go.</li>
            <li> Great recharging process, good system for alerting that battery is low, feels good in the hand, gives a good, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> If you want something you can grow with and maneuver more comfortably, I&#x27;d recommend a good ol&#x27; hair trimmer, you know the kind that often come with numbered attachments, bottle of lubricant, brush, ect.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric razor I have had ...</li>
            <li> It comfortable to hold and using, and the battery life is good.</li>
            <li> This is a very fine product.</li>
            <li> is a very fine product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i love the panasonic brand and have found them to be the best for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This one is really great because it actually cuts and the &amp;#34;side burn trimmer&amp;#34; works great on the bikini line.  </li>
            <li> I am comparing this to two others one a Remington Rotary and one a Braun foil and the Panasonic feels better in the hand and seems to have a better quality and the comfort of the Panasonic is amazing</li>
            <li> Excellent Shaver, used everyday and works great.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, and the battery has great life--charged it two+ weeks ago</li>
            <li> the price was very reasonable and the product had great reviews.</li>
            <li> Great Deal &amp; Very Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> but is nothing special but good for the price</li>
            <li> , I actually enjoyed shaving, it&#x27;s quick, easy, no cuts and best I could wash everything under water to keep it clean.</li>
            <li> great razor, fast, cuts closely, easy on the face, fast charging, holds the charge, excellent!</li>
            <li> I replaced the blades yearly, as advertised, and was pretty happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It feels very comfortable in my hand and</li>
            <li> It is also very light weight for travel.</li>
            <li> The battery is good for 6 to 8 shaves and it charges quickly.  </li>
            <li> I had the Panasonic ES8103 and then went to this one when I needed a new one since it had good reviews and was a good price.</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s never had an electric razor and has loved how smooth and easy this is to use.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a nice electric razor that would provide a nice quick shave for legs and underarms.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This shaver is excellent, I am using electric razors for more than 20 years, this one is really really makes the cut, very close shave, in the beginning I had some irritation, maybe because the foil isn&#x27;t hyper-allergic, or something else, but after a week or so, the skin got used to it, huge upgrade from 30 series, nice motor buzzing!</li>
            <li> Good value, comfortable shave, very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Charges quick cleans easy!!</li>
            <li> What a huge contrast in Service!  </li>
            <li> So if you shave in the car like me make sure you charge it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this model razor for about 10 years and it is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> and I realy love it.</li>
            <li> So if you are traveling for more than a week, you will need to bring the charger cable, which is somewhat bulky.</li>
            <li> Im sure theres better out there, but not at the price.</li>
            <li> and I was so pleased with this one.  </li>
            <li> I would gladly get another for him...</li>
            <li> As you&#x27;d expect, as the blades become duller, more passes are required.  </li>
            <li> but I sure am glad I did.</li>
            <li> but this razor is much better.</li>
            <li> It did an ok job.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shaver.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for the closest shave better get a 5 blade Razor.</li>
            <li> I love them for weekend shaves, since women dig the Saturday evening scruff effect.</li>
            <li> A more powerful motor means the  blades work faster, so I am very favorably impressed.  </li>
            <li> On top of that, the price just rocks.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve become more prone to cuts or nicks to my face with a razor.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found it to be much better than the ES-RT51-s</li>
            <li> I truly cannot understand why Panasonic decided to produce such a piece of junk after it once had the best shavers on the market.  </li>
            <li> One of many Panasonic wet/dry shavers, which can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> This makes it nice and smooth for whomever may be feeling it, aside from me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I would want anything more.</li>
            <li> shaving quality, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall quite pleased with this shaver and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> but I know many women don&#x27;t shave there.  </li>
            <li> That being said, a razor will always give you a closer shave (with more irritation).</li>
            <li> Initially I was very happy with the ES-RT51.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t trust their build quality any more.</li>
            <li> Here lies the Achilles heal to most Panasonic shavers:    </li>
            <li> Now I will be able to charge my shaver</li>
            <li> More often then not i have to use my razor to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> FOR MANY YEARS,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;D BEEN PLAGUED WITH FOR MANY YEARS .  </li>
            <li> In fact, even superior to the old Remington shavers that I loved.</li>
            <li> They love it and have no complaints about it at all.</li>
            <li> When traveling, be sure to use the plastic blade cover.</li>
            <li> Also got one of these shavers for my son who likes it better than his Norelco.</li>
            <li> Simply the best bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> Simply the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun shaver for so many years I can&#x27;t remember.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never paying $300 for a shaver again, that&#x27;s for danged sure.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES-RT51 is so much better than the Braun 370</li>
            <li> get a better shave.</li>
            <li> This is a ok shaver</li>
            <li> I have found that most electric razors do not give me a close shave.  </li>
            <li> the Flexible Pivoting Head help to cut all, and works better whe</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I should have known better - you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> However, I find myself actually enjoying the shave now.</li>
            <li> Perhaps even better than a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the razor...</li>
            <li> Love thse Panasonic razors.</li>
            <li> This one is much better in that arena, and a wet/dry to boot.  </li>
            <li> He was able to use it by himself, without me having to help him.</li>
            <li> Very close shave and great value for the money.</li>
            <li> I had one just like it for many years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Under the chin and neck which has always been the most stubborn area I am still satisfied by the performance of this</li>
            <li> Maybe there are better electric razors out there</li>
            <li> very happy with my product and would definitely recommend it to others</li>
            <li> I have had many brands through the years</li>
            <li> I love the wet/dry option.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would try a foil razor because many reviews indcated they gave a closer shave for a heavier beard.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I wish this could give me more of a closer shave.</li>
            <li> but if you are more than 30...</li>
            <li> It is okay</li>
            <li> I have used many electric shavers in my lifetime including name brands like Norelco, Braun and Remington.</li>
            <li> and I can get more than 10 shaves per charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if there&#x27;s a lot more hair one would have to charge more often.  </li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s more of a gimmick than anything.</li>
            <li> bought this Panasonic and it was so much better than anything I had ever owned.</li>
            <li> Does not shave well, if you have more than a days growth.</li>
            <li> This shaver is ok thought it was the liner blade system that Panasonic has</li>
            <li> I was very happy with it initially.  </li>
            <li> but after 7 years the battery was still better than the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> My husband says its The best shaver, he&#x27;s personally ever had the experience of using.</li>
            <li> I MORE THAN PLEASED WITH THIS RAZOR.</li>
            <li> How many things can you say about a razor that does not cut.</li>
            <li> This thing would be better at doing an oil change on my car than as a razor.</li>
            <li> This is more sophisticated and has a helpful power meter.</li>
            <li> I wish there was more options to trim</li>
            <li> and i love the battery life percentage.</li>
            <li> This is the case with most electric razors these days.</li>
            <li> I use it along with a trimmer (since the lady&#x27;s shaver has a trimmer and this newer, better shaver does not):</li>
            <li> This electric shaver replaced another Panasonic from many many years ago.  </li>
            <li> this shave better than Norelco...</li>
            <li> However, this latest model died on me within six months.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a rotary shaver, I believe you will get a better shave</li>
            <li> better than any Braun or Norelco I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and works great.</li>
            <li> I switched on a dozen more times.</li>
            <li> woman&#x27;s electric shaver, Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver, was much better than this shaver.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll just keep supplying this shaver with replacements, as needed, thank you. :)</li>
            <li> Pass on this one and spend more money.</li>
            <li> And unlike the top of the line models, the rechargeable batteries in the RT51S can be replaced.</li>
            <li> Good battery life and easy to clean under running water.  </li>
            <li> Works better than my Braun and hold a longer charge.</li>
            <li> I had to apply more pressure to get some sort of result and doing so resulted in a world of pain.</li>
            <li> If you want my opinion don&#x27;t buy, it just causes more pain, and that&#x27;s why I returned it.</li>
            <li> I always missed many hairs, and if I got too close to the skin, it began to burn.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> For my face the flatter head surface does a slightly better job than the 8103</li>
            <li> I looked at so many and compared them all.  </li>
            <li> I will surely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Have to press more that I would like.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> and I love the battery charge indicator.  </li>
            <li> Gave me the best shave next to a blade and no cuts.</li>
            <li> Gets the hairs on neck unlike most electrics.</li>
            <li> This razor allows him to safely shave himself without all the fuss.</li>
            <li> The reviews of this razor compared more favourably than the equivalent from Philips or Braun.</li>
            <li> but I end up doing that most days as this doesn&#x27;t get the stuble.</li>
            <li> No doubt, this is the best three blade shaver I have had the pleasure of owning, my third.</li>
            <li> I take leisurely shaves, probably longer than most without irritation.</li>
            <li> If you shave every day, it works much better.</li>
            <li> For me, since my skin never gets used to it (tried for many years), I prefer the electric overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this unit for several weeks now and am very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> love my Panasonic ES-RT51-S3</li>
            <li> Its ok for now.</li>
            <li> a Norelco might suit that person better.</li>
            <li> For the price, the Panasonic ES8103 is a much better razor</li>
            <li> so pay more and get a better shave -</li>
            <li> So, the shaver ended up costing me $12 more</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t too many reviews by women for a man&#x27;s razor.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it</li>
            <li> For the price it is ok</li>
            <li> Panasonic has always been my favorite razor.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic shaves closer than the rotary, but takes more passes to catch every hair.</li>
            <li> They provide excellent service and last three to four years.  </li>
            <li> So, if I had it to do over again, I&#x27;d do more research and get a better model.  </li>
            <li> This is something I&#x27;ve noticed from Panasonic for many years and one of the reasons I bought it, as they rarely make anything that isn&#x27;t good.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t expect much more out of this one.</li>
            <li> so I wanted a product from a reputable company but not outragously priced.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several elecric shavers and found (for the money) that this is one of the best.</li>
            <li> Love the battery indicator on the front of the shaver.</li>
            <li> The difference I&#x27;m experiencing is that i need to do more passes with this shaver to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Love the way it shaves.  </li>
            <li> I will keep it, but use it for travel mostly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it with shaving cream, maybe that will be better.  </li>
            <li> Trimming blade could be better.</li>
            <li> Fantastic appliance; built like a watch and shaved as well as an old Remington, which is to say, perfectly.</li>
            <li> It simply gives me the best shave with the smoothest skin ever.  </li>
            <li> Ok shaver.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price.</li>
            <li> and I love the battery level indicator.  </li>
            <li> , Silver works a lot better than my Norelco.</li>
            <li> It does not leave as many razor stubs.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> I am pleased with its performance...</li>
            <li> 100% better than the cheap lady electric razors!</li>
            <li> What more can a person ask for?</li>
            <li> The display is great and very helpful for not running out of power.</li>
            <li> it did a better job.</li>
            <li> the reason why I gave 4  stara from 5 is that you can not shave with it while charging, but everything is ok</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using &#x27;many brand&#x27; of shaver for more than 15years..</li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> and I am sure I shave longer than most.  </li>
            <li> Pop the top, run cover under water, run razor under water while turned on</li>
            <li> I wish it came with a better bag/case.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic is easily my favorite razor to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyone considering using an electric shaver after many years of using a razor and shave cream should look into trying this shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just looking for quality at the best possible price.</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s considered cheap, so be it!</li>
            <li> The results are much better, too.</li>
            <li> THIS SHAVER DOES OK.  </li>
            <li> I would probably have done better with a lithium battery.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this raiser but I would still like a closer shave without going over my face so many times.</li>
            <li> I think it should give more options&lt;</li>
            <li> Maybe a rotary one would do a better job.</li>
            <li> I shave after taking a shower and use a face scrub before going into the shower to make sure my face isn&#x27;t oily at all when shaving.</li>
            <li> Most men do this to get a closer shave (but at the cost of in-grown hairs)&lt;br</li>
            <li> and glad I did.  </li>
            <li> The ES-LV61-A is even better by the way, but that will have to be a separate review.</li>
            <li> Much better than the rotating head type razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a week, and already I love it.</li>
            <li> It replaces an over-the-hill Remington MS3 1000, and is vastly better: quieter, faster, closer.  </li>
            <li> I still love it.  </li>
            <li> Quite possibly better than my Braun</li>
            <li> nice close shave for a cheap price.  </li>
            <li> For how I&#x27;m using the item, I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> I switched to the Panasonic and it has performed better than any of the Norelco products that I have used over the years.</li>
            <li> maybe a Braun would be a better way to go.</li>
            <li> it sure beats any Braun razor that I have owned.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see the point in paying more.</li>
            <li> Much better then</li>
            <li> I am satisfied to the point that I won&#x27;t be returning it, but if I could find another ES3041, I&#x27;d deep-six</li>
            <li> The shaver uses a Lithium ion battery, not the outmoded Nickel Cadmium type that most cheap-quality, battery-powered consumer products come with.  </li>
            <li> but Iâ€™d prefer the gauge to be more</li>
            <li> It works very well for that purpose and was a great deal.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I waited.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I have it.</li>
            <li> mostly I&#x27;m the shower.</li>
            <li> Norelco is better.</li>
            <li> So glad I puchased it.</li>
            <li> The design fits comfortably in my hand and the shaving head does a nice job working against the grain on my beard.</li>
            <li> Love it all aspects as an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> this is the best electric razor I have owned, although i have only tried the cheaper varieties.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had many.</li>
            <li> Seems ok and I like it</li>
            <li> so this is okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for many years.</li>
            <li> Will them one more try.</li>
            <li> Ok  there are better shavers.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought one.</li>
            <li> It does the job, have to go over shaved area many times to get the desired results.</li>
            <li> I feel like I need to make so many passes with this</li>
            <li> Am quite pleased with the razor.  </li>
            <li> but i forgot what it was called, i fell in love with that one and now ive fallen in love with this one, close shave, doesnt jam up, rechargable,</li>
            <li> what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> (That shaver cost $20 more than this one).  </li>
            <li> For the price, it seems to be just about right and feels good.  </li>
            <li> A VERY NICE QUALITY RAZOR FOR A REASONABLE PRICE.</li>
            <li> Good clean and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> My husband found it easy to use, good quality, and a good replacement for an old one like it.</li>
            <li> The foil on the older razor is still going great after about 1.5 years use every day.</li>
            <li> I have had good Panasonic shavers in the past and I would say that this might be the best of them all.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut very clean and evenly.</li>
            <li> AND IT GIVES A PRETTY GOOD SHAVE.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> The first was an ES4026NC which was, and still is, quite good</li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> quit.would recommend at anytime.amazon&#x27;s price was pretty good also.</li>
            <li> OMG, my husband has been using this new shaver for a week now and he can&#x27;t stop raving about how great it is.  </li>
            <li> This one is easy to use and safe.</li>
            <li> The shave is nice and close, and it&#x27;s easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> very easy to clean .</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to clean up.  </li>
            <li> still on the first charge which is impressive, but it is new.</li>
            <li> very smooth and comfortable , pleasing outcome</li>
            <li> It has a good feel in my hand and gave a better shave than the older model.  </li>
            <li> Very good battery life and digital readout showing remaining battery life a plus.</li>
            <li> But overall very good product for the price.</li>
            <li> The RT51, though Chinese made, is a very good shaver.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a very good razor</li>
            <li> But finally I got smart and went on Amazon in advance of my flight to see him and found this great razor at this great price.  </li>
            <li> Great shave, light weight, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works ok on smooth parts of face.</li>
            <li> Ended up buying a cheap Remington and it shaves much better.  </li>
            <li> Really great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far works great.</li>
            <li> I use it wet on my underarms and it works great too!!!  </li>
            <li> ES-RT51 seems to be quieter than my old model, which makes the wife happy.</li>
            <li> It does not eat away at the top of the beard like a safety razor and leaves my cheeks and neck smooth.  </li>
            <li> First time I used an electric razor and im very pleased with this one.</li>
            <li> That seems to be because I must do more than two or three passes over each area to get the smooth</li>
            <li> and I bought this to replace an old lady shaver that was not all that great to begin with.</li>
            <li> I was able to get a smooth shave both ways.</li>
            <li> One perspective I have is that the razor pivots quite a bit from side to side--more than up and down--and I&#x27;ve found that by engaging this aspect it gives me an even better shave.  </li>
            <li> It works fantastic and my shaves are as close as with most razors.</li>
            <li> Good shave without much irritation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Was very close to giving up on Panasonic, but have never had good results with the Braun products.</li>
            <li> It feels good to hold and that fact this it is wet/dry is a real bonus.</li>
            <li> However, if it won&#x27;t give a good shave, that doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> in all, a good shave for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It delivers a good reasonably close shave without the pulling sensation on the hairs which I have sometimes</li>
            <li> My son really finds it quite good and it suits his purposes.  </li>
            <li> still use this razor because I can run it across my face real quick after a shower, get most of the hair, then quickly finish up with a manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rarely shave with them, but they are exceptionally close, and once the blood stops flowing, I notice the shaver cut isn&#x27;t quite a match for a good old Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> Very precisely made and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> This razor gives me the best shave out of approximately 10 other mfr&#x27;s I have purchased before.  </li>
            <li> I originally brought this shaver thinking that a man&#x27;s electric shaver will cut the hair closer and better than a woman&#x27;s shaver.</li>
            <li> and yeah, I still have a full head of hair on my head!)</li>
            <li> I might even buy another one for the future, just because its that good!</li>
            <li> The battery charges very quickly though.</li>
            <li> Cleaning was a breeze, charging seems very quick and not deafening.    </li>
            <li> and I plan on replacing the blades when it recommends because it&#x27;s easy and not too</li>
            <li> Cleans easily.</li>
            <li> easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> Also cleans up under the tap very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to use,</li>
            <li> Easy cleanup, and</li>
            <li> The movement of flexible pivoting head, designed for man face, is OPTIMUM for the legs adjusting to the contours and makes shaving SMOOTH, fast and easy.</li>
            <li> He can easily use this.</li>
            <li> Charge easily lasts about a week.  </li>
            <li> Trimmer angle makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> easy it will</li>
            <li> took away the foil to make sure the blades were not obstructed by anything, everything was clean and appeared to be in order.</li>
            <li> easy to clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s easy to grab the Panasonic shaver and shave while watching the news, on the throne, or anywhere...even in your car.  </li>
            <li> Easy to handle and use.</li>
            <li> The recharger is compact and easy to store at home or on a trip.</li>
            <li> The shaver is easy to use and gives you a close shave.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use and recharge.</li>
            <li> guard easily snaps on and off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Charges just as advertised-- very quickly.</li>
            <li> The rinse-clean is convenient and easy.  </li>
            <li> I love it, easy to use and clean after using it.</li>
            <li> got this for my husband because he seems to get razor burn easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a very adequate shaver.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer blade on the back is a nice feature and does a good job on sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I am elderly and so I mainly want to shave and have it do a good job.</li>
            <li> Good charge, and shaves well with the main blades.  </li>
            <li> I never had a close shave like this from an electric razor, the battery is strong.</li>
            <li> Still a good  design and doesn&#x27;t really feel as cheap as it is.</li>
            <li> and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> realize that I should have attempted to return it; however, I have a strong adversity to the hassle of returns.</li>
            <li> and I used it for years and does as good of a job as the older one.  </li>
            <li> Great razor, very easy to use and holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It shaves OK but nothing special.</li>
            <li> : Nice close smooth shave, not as good as a blade but close enough.  </li>
            <li> I found a vendor on ebay (cost-$23), and replaced them myself, which was a tricky procedure that I managed to complete successfully.</li>
            <li> i kind of missed the recharging station at first but the battery holds</li>
            <li> Too much fuss to get a good, clean shave for my liking.</li>
            <li> Easy cleanup, long charge life and a good shave!</li>
            <li> Sanyo Enloop AA batteries to the rescue, which powers the unit fine.</li>
            <li> the charging system seems to be fine as well.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works fine.</li>
            <li> and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> It does fine for touch ups</li>
            <li> Battery life is fine.</li>
            <li> Works just fine .</li>
            <li> Best of all, I did not experience the typical razor burn that has plagued me for years.</li>
            <li> For my needs a lower priced model is fine.</li>
            <li> Light , easy charge, wet/dry cut</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price and Build quality is so fine &amp; GOOD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I get 6 years out of this razor and original battery like the other one, I&#x27;ll be a happy man!</li>
            <li> The Norelcos worked pretty good when they were fresh, but that was all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will say the recharge is quick!</li>
            <li> I love the quick charges as well as the power remaining screen.</li>
            <li> This new shaver gives a really nice shave and has better battery life than the ES4026NC.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: Very good razor; could be better with more reasonable long term support.</li>
            <li> Percent of Charge remaining digital window is a great feature and it&#x27;s easy to charge.&lt;br /&gt;Looks</li>
            <li> Easy to take apart and clean, easy to resemble.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, charges quikly after use, Easy to clean</li>
            <li> The product is easy to handle and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Love this electric razor, it charges very quickly lasts long, gives a close clean shave,  I&#x27;d buy another if this wasn&#x27;t already great.</li>
            <li> As I have a light beard it suits me just fine.</li>
            <li> My new Panasonic is excellent, I get the smoothest, cut free shave ever, better than multiple blade razors and the cut throat razor at the barbers...</li>
            <li> After using the 49.00 cheaper,slower motor panasonic razor I have found that the shavers with the super high speed motors are much better than the cheaper slower motor shavers, the cheaper ones work good but the higher speed motors work much better</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!  </li>
            <li> Clean shave and good battery life when it was new.  </li>
            <li> I was happy to find that the same razor was still available.  </li>
            <li> Works great without any gels or shaving fines, after shaving skin is smooth and is not bristly at all (!)</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase considering the vast range of prices and shaver types available.  </li>
            <li> Power is strong and the shaving is clean, but sometimes hurts the skin, not as smooth as the Philps I used before.</li>
            <li> I kind of wish I ordered the style that has the three circular shaving pads for more contour and pivot action</li>
            <li> Again though there&#x27;s a huge price difference between this shaver and my rotary.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a great gift that not only my husband gets to enjoy.</li>
            <li> However, after 1 year, the battery life greatly diminished with the shaver dying when the indicator light still showed 60% of charge left.</li>
            <li> Still same great shave.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Loves the shave - close and smooth.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s fairly easy to clean after shaving.</li>
            <li> None were cheap except the Remington.</li>
            <li> : shaves well, easy to clean, great build quality trimmer actually works, seems to use about 10% of the charge per shave</li>
            <li> : shaves well, easy to clean, great build quality trimmer actually works, seems to use about 10% of the charge per shave</li>
            <li> I just put on some shaving cream and in two or three minutes - smooth face.</li>
            <li> That is so great because that&#x27;s what died on my last shaver.  </li>
            <li> It is just as the advertisement claimed and it gives me a close smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It flexes just enough to follow your contours, and feels great in your hand.  </li>
            <li> so it wouldn&#x27;t move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that I get a great shave with this basic shaver</li>
            <li> ex: armpit, bikini, and thicker leg hair, which for me is only below the knee)&lt;br /&gt;-The extendable trimmer is a nifty addition, great for the bikini area</li>
            <li> It is cheap and good&lt;</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BE CHEAP BUY</li>
            <li> The razor is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It dose such a great job that I can go 2 to three days without the need to save again</li>
            <li> The ES-RT-51 is a fantastic shaver.</li>
            <li> The shaver is smooth, and doesn&#x27;t bite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 2 Panasonic shavers in the last 15 years...and was happy with each.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve been using, I want to give a detailed comparison here for anyone else whoâ€™s looking for a Braun alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just judging by sound.</li>
            <li> Smooth going against the hair to the touch!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to use it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll stick with razor blades for my primary shaving method.</li>
            <li> The cleaning is simply under water for practical and hygiene solution, which is great.</li>
            <li> but, shaving in the shower with gel is incredibly comfortable and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The noise is acceptable and easy to was and clean.</li>
            <li> I have a smooth face for this item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and keeps the charge</li>
            <li> This shaver performs as advertised-a close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I have a relatively light beard, so I decided on a foil shaver instead of a rotary.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it gives me the shave I&#x27;m looking for, close, smooth, and no irritation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean, recharge and has a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> Amazon has been fantastic to work with</li>
            <li> and it was not giving me a smooth  shave.  </li>
            <li> This one is through and gentle and amazing.  </li>
            <li> After three months:  Fits my hand well / comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It leaves smooth shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to clean and the charge indicator  is a plus</li>
            <li> Compact &amp; light weight.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I use it for emergency sideburn trims, but I&#x27;d probably stay away from any precise mustache work at first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Get the cheap Panasonic, and if you want wet/dry then this is the one.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaver provides a smooth close shave.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and fits comfortably in my hand.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, close shaves and quieter than most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Contact was smooth and effortless.  </li>
            <li> Great travel and daily razor.</li>
            <li> a clicking sound</li>
            <li> such a great deal\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> or I leave my primary at home.</li>
            <li> but it just doesn&#x27;t compare to the Panasonic shaver that I got before that which was powerful, heavier and could tell it was made of better parts.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and use - have to fight off my wife so she may get one for mothers day</li>
            <li> it makes the Braun sound like a chain saw.  </li>
            <li> Strong, reliable, clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Light</li>
            <li> Smooth shave with no pulling.</li>
            <li> but it does a fair job of shaving; of course not equal to a safety razor but more comfortable to my face.  </li>
            <li> I actually enjoy shaving</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, and store.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic shaver is so easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> I like buying the cheap ones since the replacement blades are a rip off</li>
            <li> Went to amazon hoping to find a cheap razor and found this</li>
            <li> I found the shave to be quite close and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely buy another one, it is great product</li>
            <li> Fabulous purchase.</li>
            <li> The above heading should tell you that I am a proud Grandfather.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> The razor works as advertised and gives a close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> This came in handy for my vacation trip abroad, one charge lasted the whole trip.</li>
            <li> I only use it &amp;#34;dry,&amp;#34; but it works great.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> though now I quite enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> of course, real razors are better as I never get a close  shave, no matter how many time i go over the area.</li>
            <li> It still works fairly well, except the battery has deteriorated to the point I cannot get two complete shaves without recharging.</li>
            <li> Does seem to be adequately waterproof, as I usually clean it under running water and have done so many times now.</li>
            <li> Very close shave and the digital read-out for power is great!</li>
            <li> This is the third Panasonic shaver I have owned, and it is absolutely the best electric shaver ever.  </li>
            <li> The razor gives a close shave, the charge lasts exactly one week, and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The charge lasts me about 3-4 full leg shaves, but it recharges very quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps in six months or a year or so, I&#x27;ll come back to this review and report my long term findings, but in the meantime, great shaver at a great price.</li>
            <li> Cleanup with soap and water mandatory after each use to keep the blades clean and running smoothly</li>
            <li> For once an electric razor that shaves smoothly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> Easy set up, quick charge, close shave.</li>
            <li> quick and easy return.</li>
            <li> I love Panasonic stuff normally, but this isn&#x27;t about what I love.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad shaver, just not quite as good as the old 3 head remington I had.</li>
            <li> up is easy and it recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> I love his smooth face thanks!</li>
            <li> br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied,&lt;br /&gt;Function is very strong for me,</li>
            <li> Their design has not changed much, but they are very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I purchase a new one every 2-4 years when the battery ultimately fades, and have been very happy with them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too noisy, easy to clean and seems to charge up fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and charges quickly.</li>
            <li> easy to use, no issues, battery is good and last for a period of time.</li>
            <li> And super easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> AND GIVES A CLOSE SHAVE RECOMEND THE SHAVER AS IT GIVES A VERY CLOSE SHAVE AND IS VERY EASY TO CLEAN , JUST RINSE IT UNDER THE FAUSET</li>
            <li> shaves close, charges fast and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> the first one would still be in use after many years except for my damaging one blade side piece.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember what the model number was of my first shaver, but it was better than any Braun or Norelco that I had ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Then I bought a Panasonic ES8077 which was even better than the first</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the remarkable shaving experience, the next step is a breeze - cleanup.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver and keeps its charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> After using this shaver for a couple of weeks I feel that I have to add to my original review.</li>
            <li> Initial charging was successful.  </li>
            <li> My son couldn&#x27;t do it at all, and it took me applying significant pressure to see any results.  </li>
            <li> very pleased so far with the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> was excited to get this</li>
            <li> and originally I was at almost two weeks.  </li>
            <li> My first Panasonic and much better than the 2 Norelco ones before it.</li>
            <li> My face and chin cleaned up nicely with this new razor.</li>
            <li> I use a blade at home and get clean shaves.</li>
            <li> and it was a pain to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> Waterproof means you can shave and clean it in the shower or under running water.  </li>
            <li> but as with most electric razors, it needs too many passes to achieve a complete shave.</li>
            <li> clean up.</li>
            <li> The probable cause was me tapping it against the sink to clean it.</li>
            <li> to clean.</li>
            <li> Use it to clean up what my razor blade misses.  </li>
            <li> gives clean shave.</li>
            <li> You can make a difference by choosing some skin preparation oil and keeping the blade basically clean.</li>
            <li> This razor cleanly shaved among all of them.</li>
            <li> I clean them every month or so</li>
            <li> Powerful and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Panasonic definitely cut some corners on this latest version, probably because it was so popular.</li>
            <li> Shaves clean and close.</li>
            <li> AFTER 6-12 months, you will be recharging more and more frequently until by 18 months</li>
            <li> Reasons vary, but we do it because want to be clean shaven.</li>
            <li> Use and clean-</li>
            <li> So clean and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> clean up takes seconds.  </li>
            <li> a brush to clean.</li>
            <li> , it shaved rather well and did give me a very close smooth shave on most parts of my face.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even resemble a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Powerful motor and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Only thing I liked better was the cleaning.</li>
            <li> This shaver again is at the low end, but my far the best shave I ever gotten from an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> battery indicator works very well, and I liked the fact that it shaved at full power right until the battery was drained.  </li>
            <li> This model is very close to my original model and it shaves better.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, a good second razor, for quick, light, on the go shaves.</li>
            <li> Panasonic, like many large corporations does not quite &amp;#34;walk the walk&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how many times I go over certain spots, it doesn&#x27;t get the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had a credit for amazon for $20 off so the price was right!</li>
            <li> I was right, this is one wimpy shaver!</li>
            <li> Excellent close shave particularly when used wet.  </li>
            <li> not as close as a blade but very good for everyday use and holds is charge.  </li>
            <li> I almost never use the wet option, but it&#x27;s great to have and makes cleaning a snap.  </li>
            <li> The wet shaving and cleaning ability is great.</li>
            <li> anyone looking for a great shave at an awesome price I would suggest they try this one,I do not think anyone will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews, expected it to be great.</li>
            <li> It has performed great and I find it not too rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> He can grow a full beard in a week and he can shave 2 times a day.  </li>
            <li> I get about 5 shaves with a full charge.</li>
            <li> But this bulkiness is true with all electric razors.</li>
            <li> I gave it a full month</li>
            <li> Very close, but you may have to make sure you got all the hairs in some problem areas.</li>
            <li> then plummet to 0% requiring a full recharge.  </li>
            <li> , it is a good size razor - I also use a smaller Panasonic -</li>
            <li> Dont try to take on a full beard here haha.&lt;br /&gt;*works</li>
            <li> This is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Freaking sweet...</li>
            <li> /&gt;4 to 5 shaves from a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> The last Panasonic just gave a good shave and lasted a while.  </li>
            <li> The descriptions are true.</li>
            <li> That was my last Panasonic and I loved it.  </li>
            <li> The item&#x27;s look is so cool.</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic shaver and it&#x27;s as good as they get.</li>
            <li> Overall, good product.</li>
            <li> It is good for only about 8-10 shaves before it needs recharged.</li>
            <li> With a full charge, I got about 5, 4 minute shaves.</li>
            <li> OK if I use it every day, but it doesn&#x27;t shave my neck very well and it doesn&#x27;t give me the consistency of blades.</li>
            <li> Really good features and a solid product.</li>
            <li> after full charging,I turned on my razor.</li>
            <li> Love the lithium-ion battery, much improved over ni-cads.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews before purchasing it and everything printed was true.  </li>
            <li> This met all my wants and more.</li>
            <li> Even though shaver was showing full charge it did not work all of the time.  </li>
            <li> you must pay more attention to the &amp;#34;grain&amp;#34; of the hairs, but the result is much cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES-Rt51-S3 razor charges in a hour for a full charge.</li>
            <li> This model is a good mid range and entry level into the Panasonic family.</li>
            <li> Does a good job even with daily use.</li>
            <li> Each charge good enough for five shaves.</li>
            <li> Time will tell the true value of the product.</li>
            <li> Its true.</li>
            <li> So you start with a full charge at 100%, then it drops to 80%, and so on.  </li>
            <li> Definitely does not provide a good shave.</li>
            <li> My last Norelco delivered a closer shave, but I like the feel of this in my hand and it looks good.  </li>
            <li> And now I went to turn it on with a full charge yesterday, December 11, and it shook but didn&#x27;t turn on and the battery perecentage had dropped to 0%.  </li>
            <li> My wife is grateful that I have such a good razor now.</li>
            <li> I never pay full price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to have the digital screen shows the battery capacity.</li>
            <li> Who knows, if I like this option, I really wouldn&#x27;t mind spending more money especially around the holiday season if I can catch a good sale.</li>
            <li> This razor is good for angular faces, especially jaws.</li>
            <li> so one full charge on this one gives me three shaves.  </li>
            <li> I cant understand how this shaver got such good ratings.  </li>
            <li> good shaver and trimmer, still working 2.5 years later.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, good feel and relatively quiet.</li>
            <li> price was reasonable compared to many others yet gets the job done for him.</li>
            <li> Looks cool, too.</li>
            <li> Many thanks to Panasonic and Amazon.</li>
            <li> Been using regular razors for years, but decided to get this and see how good it worked.</li>
            <li> The display is in 20% increments of full charge.  </li>
            <li> Replaced a Remington which was not bad</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> So, therefore, 1 of 2 is not bad.</li>
            <li> However, the price being considerably lower, the results are pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad unit</li>
            <li> knew I wanted a wet / dry shaver and Panasonic had the most models available and some of the best reviews.  </li>
            <li> The new one is very adorable, compact, quiet, and gives a nice shaving.</li>
            <li> The old model worked great, but the new \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; is junk.  </li>
            <li> The LCD meter is easy to read in reasonable light.</li>
            <li> In fact, I don&#x27;t intend to do anything more than basic rinses any more, and occasionally clean underneath the cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do like the easy cleanup, and it works pretty well, but invariably I have a lot of missed areas although I&#x27;ve gone over and over them.  </li>
            <li> This shaver can easily cut skin on the pubic area, will not cut hairs that are too fine or too long, and it takes many passes to get the skin perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li> I have also found that the battery life is quite good and the unit is very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For tougher beards or less frequent shavers a Norelco might suit that person better.</li>
            <li> Easy to use Very clean,If the sound is smaller the better,I hope there are many more promotions can participate.</li>
            <li> Powerful and made clean shaves.</li>
            <li> After owning device, shaving is so fun and clean.</li>
            <li> However the trimmer does a good (if not perfect) job there and does a great job with the side burns.</li>
            <li> I had to shave for 15 minutes and still wasn&#x27;t happy, not to mention when shaving near the ears I nearly went deaf.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m assured of a close quick shave to begin with...  </li>
            <li> Although the build quality is more than acceptable, the quality of the shaves has been mediocre, at best.  </li>
            <li> but I should have bought the one with the higher speed motor as I shave my head and the higher speed would do a better job.</li>
            <li> I will keep for quick jobs, but will continue to use another brand I have for a closer shave.</li>
            <li> The battery charges quickly</li>
            <li> After what I hoped was adequate research, I settled on this model by Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Quick 1 hour charge.</li>
            <li> I started with Edge for the shaving cream but found that this gel-based cream does not rinse quickly from the razor.</li>
            <li> I was a former Phillips user for many many years.</li>
            <li> He has curly hair and uses a pre-shave lotion and gets a great, fast, close enough shave.  </li>
            <li> It got the job done quickly and conformed to my face well.</li>
            <li> This shaver is better in most ways than the Braun of similar design</li>
            <li> Main problem is the chin and neck for me; may just be age :)</li>
            <li> so if I go anywhere at night this razor is a quick alternative for the blade.</li>
            <li> Amazon was quick as well.</li>
            <li> Its easy to clean, really doesn&#x27;t require cleaning often.</li>
            <li> it has been seven months and the battery is going quickly.  </li>
            <li> Great razor, holds up to travel very well, and usually only need to recharge it on the weekends.  </li>
            <li> With quick shaving the battery lasts a month.</li>
            <li> He actually doesn&#x27;t have to shave until 2 days later, awesome!</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;m a loyal Braun customer)  </li>
            <li> A quick 5-min.</li>
            <li> This shaver charges quickly.  </li>
            <li> I like it,thanks for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a closer and more comfortable shave than any of the others I&#x27;ve owned,by far.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an adequate shaver.</li>
            <li> However I like to have a electric back-up for quick shaves when needed.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> They are very pleased - especially convenient when traveling with their sports teams</li>
            <li> I doubt using it in the shower every week is the best move as far as usable life goes, but the battery will give out in due time anyway.  </li>
            <li> The first two were fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I personally have not used it yet, but my son was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I have received the gift shipped oversea, I like it very much!</li>
            <li> Amazon of course shipped very fast!</li>
            <li> First shave was smooth, effortless, and close.</li>
            <li> A fully charged battery is good for two long and close shaves.</li>
            <li> It provide convenience for shaving in an clean and efficient approach and provide nice feeling in the same time.</li>
            <li> It offers a smooth, comfortable shave and the wet use function allows me to use it in the shower, which is great.  </li>
            <li> It gives a decent shave, but don&#x27;t expect a super clean cut!     </li>
            <li> Replacement parts cost as much or more than a new razor and this is where I deducted one star.</li>
            <li> So, I purchased a new unit as a better option.</li>
            <li> I love my new razor.  </li>
            <li> With the use of Lectra Shave, it works great between the mundane lather shaves.</li>
            <li> As good as an electric can work dry</li>
            <li> It shaves very well and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and does work somewhat better, or at least more comfortably, when using shaving cream.</li>
            <li> a normal razor is way more worth buying this product.</li>
            <li> You will be more than pleased and say why didn&#x27;t I look for a device like this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> The top set releases the foil (to replace it if damaged, or to wash it separately), while the lower set partially removes the housing around the head, so you can more easily clean the blade assembly.</li>
            <li> (all brands), your best approach on one in this moderate price range is to use it as long</li>
            <li> First of all, make sure you wash your face really well with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> Overall, though, it does a decent job leaving legs smooth and soft and at a very good price for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> It is such a smooth shave, it is quiet, it has a great pop-up trimmer that really works, and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I recommend this shaver highly!!!</li>
            <li> Worked exactly like I wanted it to!</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to clean and how long the battery life lasts.</li>
            <li> Probably my mistake first time!</li>
            <li> I paid $55 for this shaver in February 2012 and replacement foils are about $30, meaning it&#x27;s almost more worth it just to buy a new shaver rather than replace the foils.</li>
            <li> This new one  is a good value, but it doesn&#x27;t shave as well as the old one (not as close), and the trimmer extension is quite inferior.</li>
            <li> very low noise, very easy to clean</li>
            <li> its a great one easy to use and clean and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s wonderfully quiet, and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Gives me a smooth face quickly and charge last more than two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, ready to go to work, easy to clean, charges super fast and shaves me like a dream...bald head and all.</li>
            <li> This thing is a great little razor for the price.</li>
            <li> Intended as a decent compromise but is actually better than the higher priced model.</li>
            <li> This would be fine as a tradeoff for a good shave, but pressing hard isnâ€™t necessary to get a good shave with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is good but hard to use on my chin, so letting it grow more than 3-4 days causes problems.</li>
            <li> very close shave and leaves my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> It gives a  smooth shave with no pulling or scratching, and it holds a charge very well.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s smooth and very quite and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Amazing a one hour charge lasted me just under three weeks of daily shaving.&lt;br /&gt;MARVELLOUS</li>
            <li> It is extremely quiet, give an amazingly close shave...</li>
            <li> Its not quite a real shave, but light years ahead of anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Fits hand very well, comfortable to hold, screen allows close shave without skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver is the only electric shaver I have used that I liked.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a couple weeks, but it&#x27;s been great so far.</li>
            <li> but you, and the irritation/time it saves is worth it.</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The battery performance is poor at best.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic offers so many razors, one cannot even get their head around all of the differences.  </li>
            <li> As good as I expected.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been a blade and shaving cream guy for most of my adult life.  </li>
            <li> , in the future I want to try a more advanced.</li>
            <li> Holds charge for 5 days worth of shaving</li>
            <li> I bought another Panasonic since I liked the old one so much</li>
            <li> Much better than the old one</li>
            <li> I found the Panasonic ES-RT51 fantastic for fact that it shaves soft and smoothly without scratching my skin.</li>
            <li> Always looks fresh.</li>
            <li> and it works like my old one did except faster, quieter, and a better battery life.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get an even better shaver, and spent about $20 more on this men&#x27;s shaver.</li>
            <li> I think it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Provides a good shave, however some work is involved for a really close shave (subjective as every face is different).</li>
            <li> and I get a week&#x27;s worth of</li>
            <li> I find myself going over the same spots multiple times and still not being able to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like our &amp;#34;throw away&amp;#34; society, but it made more economic sense to replace the whole thing.</li>
            <li> but wet gelled shaves are good.</li>
            <li> Nice and quiet.</li>
            <li> this shaver is pretty good, considering i&#x27;ve been a mach 3 guy for as long as i can remember.  </li>
            <li> it charges fast, shaves fast, shaves close, doesn&#x27;t hurt, and it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> will try the 5 blade and see if the cost is worth it.</li>
            <li> so you aren&#x27;t surprised with a drained battery when you need it most.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is not as good as my former Panasonic referenced below that lasted over 8 years, but price is very competitive for the quality of shave.   </li>
            <li> 8-9 years ago, I purchased a similar Panasonic razor from a now defunct popular catalog company in one of their retail stores.  </li>
            <li> So far I am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It was worth all the research.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco was much faster and a much closer shave, and my son is able to use it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve encountered some things worth noting)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is slightly better than my old Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> This is an ok shaver, but my old remington gets ALL the hairs.</li>
            <li> Painfully loud, head pieces keep falling off and battery mostly shot after one year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good, but not as close a shave as I expected.</li>
            <li> The important review is that this does not shave as close as my cheap old Braun.</li>
            <li> I love the wet/dry function of the shaver which my old Braun had too.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it is well worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li> Excellent especially when wet.</li>
            <li> The price at Amazon and what you receive is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> the percent charge display is useful too.</li>
            <li> This one, I&#x27;m convinced, does better than my old Braun ever could have.</li>
            <li> The shaver does a nice job---however the corded re-charger takes up extra room in my luggage---no problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat solid and robust feeling and glides nicely across the face.</li>
            <li> I am getting a week&#x27;s worth of shaves from a charge.  </li>
            <li> The box advertises 45 minutes or up to 2 weeks worth of battery life.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the money.  </li>
            <li> and this little portable is very handy.</li>
            <li> Love using this new razor always used a three headed model, this was the first time using a razor like this.</li>
            <li> I still have the old one to use as a backup, but I am very satisfied with the new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female who tried using it for my bikini line and legs in order to avoid razor burn but honestly, learning how to shave the right way with</li>
            <li> (dry mode) and was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Use a good quality soft soap to clean any \\&quot;goo\\&quot; left from the pre-shave/foam.</li>
            <li> it does exactly as it is programed to do .smooth quick with ease</li>
            <li> Quick clean shave for a decent price what else do you need.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used it for a little over a month and am pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> The ultrasonic movement that I appreciated in my original razor is \\&quot;standard\\&quot; now, and here it is for a fraction of what I paid for mine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my view, Linear Drive is what makes Panasonic shavers superior to ALL other brands out there.</li>
            <li> I originally bought one for my dad when he was in hospice and had tremors in his hands and still wanted to shave himself and this worked very well for him.</li>
            <li> It does not cut as good as other reviewers claimed, I wanted it for my legs</li>
            <li> I must shave with this panasonic other wise</li>
            <li> I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell the difference in closeness, however, the new foil seemed to move more smoothly over my face and maybe it had an easier time when I&#x27;d let my beard grow out a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the Panasonic (finally, right?)  </li>
            <li> He was right handed.</li>
            <li> Run it right under the fawcet</li>
            <li> I have had closer shaves but for a quickie its all right</li>
            <li> Right before shaving I use either Johnson &amp; Johnson baby powder or the powder stick (Shave Saver from Remington).</li>
            <li> This razor cuts right through the 4 day stubble.  </li>
            <li> Works very well at giving a close clean shave.</li>
            <li> Shaving quality is decent on a light beard.  </li>
            <li> The hair clipper on back works fine, and actually can be used for nose hairs, and performs better in that area that most dedicated ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first got it I gave it a full charge and then used it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> - I just want a fast, close, clean shave.  </li>
            <li> It is very good in recharge the power however it is not able to shave with a complete and clean effect.</li>
            <li> This one arrived quickly via Amazon Prime and has continued my positive experience with Panasonic wet/dry shavers.</li>
            <li> For a close and smooth shave i highly recommend the Panasonic ES-RT51-S 3 blade electric razor.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is slimmer and lighter (only by 1 ounce, but it feels like more), so itâ€™s more comfortable to hold even if you have big hands.</li>
            <li> If you are a perfectionist like me, you&#x27;ll follow up the electric razor with a five blade razor to get the very best, closest, most comfortable shave of all time...and those really expensive five blade razors will last five times longer.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t justify paying $50 or more each year for a new electric razor.</li>
            <li> This razor is fantastic, charges very quickly and indicates the amount of charge left</li>
            <li> He especially liked the dry or wet choice for shaving.  </li>
            <li> About 15 years ago, I switched to a Panasonic wet and dry electric razor and was very happy with it until it died after about 5 years.</li>
            <li> The  shaver is comfortable, easy to use, quiet and best of all can be used wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> This razor delivers a smooth cut, is quiet, and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My business trips tend to be 3 to 4 days in length and it holds the charge easily for that length of time, is very compact, and is very ergonomically designed.</li>
            <li> My husband does not have a super heavy beard , it takes a good amount of time to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> The head comes off in two different ways for a quick rinse or a more thorough one.  </li>
            <li> However, its wet feature makes it very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The clean up is very easy since it is built to get wet.</li>
            <li> In fact, it still works fine, but the battery just isn&#x27;t holding a charge like it did when new.  </li>
            <li> I just order a higher end electric razor, also a Panasonic, and hopefully it&#x27;ll be worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied for the money spent and the features in this Panasonic shaver ES-RT51-S.  </li>
            <li> I have used it with just water, no water, and with the Total Shaving solution oil drops, and by far the oil drops are the best possible choice (for me.)  </li>
            <li> So, generally, I was satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve owned Panasonic razors in the past and have always been happy.</li>
            <li> This one is no exception and has performed great over the past year Iâ€™ve been using it.</li>
            <li> My husband was thrilled and said he got the closest shave with it that any razor has given him in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I liked the charge display, the ergonomics, and the long charge length of this razor</li>
            <li> Right out of the box, easy to use, for my 16 year old.</li>
            <li> But if you have sensitive skin &amp; a light to medium beard, I highly recommend this fine shaver.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a bonus, right? ;-)</li>
            <li> It certainly did not do the job for me!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money, and actually shaves better than my Braun.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver last spring after my 5+ year old Panasonic ES8017 started falling apart (but motor and batteries were still good).  </li>
            <li> It features a tilting head to follow contours, pop-up trimmer, button lock, digital charge remaining display, wet/dry use, comfortable in hand rubber grip with angled ribs, corded charger included, and free delivery.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers my whole life, and this is by far my favorite design.  </li>
            <li> With the quick charge time this electric shaver is very convenient.</li>
            <li> My son has a heavier beard and finds the Norelco(just a few $ more) does a better job for him.</li>
            <li> I have nothing but good things to say about my previous Panasonic shaver, which I used for 7 years.</li>
            <li> this shaver takes 3, 4 or sometimes 5 passes to cleanly shave a given area, whereas my older one required MAXIMUM two passes.</li>
            <li> and then you will , as smooth has a baby&#x27;s behind lol</li>
            <li> an quickly realized that it was very ineffective at shaving.</li>
            <li> My old rotary Norelcos cut better and shave smoother, and one of those sounds like it&#x27;s ready to explode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am happy I bought it, but then again I only paid $30 for it as a daily deal on a competitors site (Shmew Shmegg)</li>
            <li> I have at least 10 electric shavers in boxes that I have purchase over the years hoping to find one that works good and shaves close and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The wet shave was more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to try one again and this one has been great especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to male and female alike, my wife is now using my first Panasonic and is quite happy with it..</li>
            <li> The Barbasol, on the other hand, provides all the glide that I want but, curiously, is more or less &amp;#34;erased&amp;#34; by the shaver as it glides over it, making for a tidy and satisfying shave.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES-RT51-S electric razor is good but not special.</li>
            <li> Arrived very fast and was well packed.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivered.</li>
            <li> is very much faithful to the features shown on the box.  </li>
            <li> Price was also very reasonable.</li>
            <li> still like this shaver very much.</li>
            <li> Like the portability and attractiveness of shaver...charges very fast..</li>
            <li> It lasts all week on one charge and recharges very fast.</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is quiet and very smooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Recharge is very fast, about three times faster than phone.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Still not sure if i&#x27;m using the shaver right yet need more time to use to give a better review.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have mentioned a &amp;#34;linear motor&amp;#34; available on higher-end models, so they may do a better job.  </li>
            <li> I think that being able to use a wet shaver compared to a dry one will produce a superior shave regardless of brand.</li>
            <li> The main reason I am giving this product 3 stars:&lt;br /&gt;It does not give me a full shave.</li>
            <li> I have NO idea what you would get for the price difference, but their high end shavers must be pretty special because this shaver rocks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So when I bought the ES-RT51-S, I thought I was getting a better model, mainly because it had a battery meter whereas my old shaver did not.</li>
            <li> When I dry shave the shaver is quick and leaves me with a better shave than a blade.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this little puppy for seven months and it works as good as the first day.</li>
            <li> All shaved only OK.</li>
            <li> my first shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> First one lasted me over two years.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this shaver FOR WOMEN!!</li>
            <li> Gone are the days of the loud but mighty</li>
            <li> That will only be an issue on trips greater than one week.  </li>
            <li> I picked up this Panasonic on sale last month on a whim and have got to say it is much better than the electric shavers of yesteryear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I seem to need to go over areas more than once to get a close enough shave.</li>
            <li> So i decided to try this model first</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;nano\\&quot; razor runs at a much slower RPM and it feels like it&#x27;s pulling your beard not cutting.  </li>
            <li> Recently purchased this shaver mainly based on my previous experience with Panasonic equipment, which has been uniformly excellent and well-priced.  </li>
            <li> I intend to buy the company ;)</li>
            <li> Like most electric razors I have ever owned, it will not shave as close as a double edge razor.</li>
            <li> the others are nowhere near as comfortable.</li>
            <li> First time not using blades</li>
            <li> It seems to run at a higher speed than the Braun, though Iâ€™m</li>
            <li> And this shaver and its charger are so light, I might just toss my old Braun travel shaver, too.</li>
            <li> I started using it and had no problems the first two weeks.</li>
            <li> work that great on thick</li>
            <li> My beard is light, with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed virtually no pulling of whiskers, a first for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be more aware next time datz all</li>
            <li> Just a quick puff can clean it if you do not wet shave.</li>
            <li> I love its traditional style and design.</li>
            <li> I find I get the closest after a hot shower</li>
            <li> hot water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to try.  </li>
            <li> Now I have to charge every 2 days to be sure it doesn&#x27;t die in the middle of a shave.</li>
            <li> I decided to see how many days the battery would last</li>
            <li> It shaves just as well as my last shaver, so I am completely satisfied with this model.</li>
            <li> Had the prior model that worked well for many years.</li>
            <li> Overall - I am satisfied with this product, for the functioning and price.</li>
            <li> I think this will also last many years.  </li>
            <li> They missed a lot of hair, especially on my neck no matter how many times I would go over that</li>
            <li> I first opened this and held it, I could tell it was a quality shaver.  </li>
            <li> Love the grip and overall design.</li>
            <li> For the price I was expecting a mediocre shave, but I am very happy with result of this electric razor from Panasonic</li>
            <li> side blade broke the first time I tried to use it.</li>
            <li> Worked well for the first year.</li>
            <li> Light years beyond my old razor.  </li>
            <li> It also retains its charge pretty well.</li>
            <li> So I ended up ditching this one and bought the ES8103S, which is the cheapest Linear Drive model with a battery meter that I am aware of.</li>
            <li> So much better  than the last electric razor I owned.</li>
            <li> After several weeks of use, I like the Panasonic better.  </li>
            <li> Great buy , give your face at least 3 or 4 days of trying this razor , letting your face get used to this product</li>
            <li> Working VERY WELL!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would recommend trying another product, I might try some of the higher end models and hopefully they get the job done.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m only 22, I think I will wait a couple more years for that investment.</li>
            <li> In general I would have to say that this shaver does a good job providing a nice close shave, especially for the money spent on it.</li>
            <li> This is not a big deal but notable.</li>
            <li> and I think that I am a bit more objective.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love my money back.</li>
            <li> Works, but takes many passes on my coarse beard.</li>
            <li> It is so quiet compared to bruan&#x27;s and a much better cut.</li>
            <li> Panasonic&#x27;s \\&quot;nanotech\\&quot; resulted in a razor with micro-utility;)  </li>
            <li> It gives a great, close shave (I&#x27;m still on the same cutter), though it requires you to shave a bit more slowly than others like the Braun shavers.  </li>
            <li> When I first had this shaver, the charge level would go all the way to 0% before I&#x27;d run out of power.  </li>
            <li> Not close enough shave,I was hoping for better performance.</li>
            <li> He has been using disposable shaving blades and said it was pretty comparable to the disposables.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps if I used the razor more often it would last longer.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a foil</li>
            <li> It does the job for the most part but requires you to go over and over the same spot to obtain a rather close shave.</li>
            <li> When I used it for the first time I was planning to use it to shave my beard and mustache</li>
            <li> The first one lasted two years</li>
            <li> I no longer need to shower first to soften the whiskers.</li>
            <li> It is bigger than it looks in the picture, but I haven&#x27;t seen another one more compact.</li>
            <li> The battery finally wore out on my Remington after many years</li>
            <li> I have been searching for an electric razor to do the job of a blade for more than 25 years - I finally found one and it did not cost me a fortune.  </li>
            <li> This shaver would probably be better for someone with finer facial hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> For the first 6-12 months you can get about 6 shaves between charges.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first foil shaver.  </li>
            <li> Like most men I don&#x27;t like the daily regimen of face shaving.</li>
            <li> Maybe the shave would go faster if a lotion or oil were applied first.</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t get as close as razor shave, but very close!</li>
            <li> Shaver does exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Absolute junk!</li>
            <li> Norelco 3 head which cuts the first time</li>
            <li> Really!</li>
            <li> Worked exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a pop-up trimmer on the back which I love.</li>
            <li> I have been used to Norelco products that have a longer shaving time but will no longer pay the much higher price of a Norelco.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although this razor has no charging/ cleaning station, it feels way more solid</li>
            <li> so he&#x27;d wanted a replacement and told me exactly which one to buy.</li>
            <li> When I first started using the Panasonic, it shaved about as well as the Braun.  </li>
            <li> In summary, the razor does exactly as I hoped....</li>
            <li> I hoped to get a better battery life out of the shaver but it definitely held up well after my year of usage.</li>
            <li> The cost to replace those is higher than the Wahl</li>
            <li> The first one I had for 6 years and replaced the blades once.</li>
            <li> This razor wouldn&#x27;t cut hot butter.</li>
            <li> My first panasonic shaver lasted me over 2 years and then the battery died on it.</li>
            <li> the first attempt was unsuccessful, but when I  tried again, no problem.</li>
            <li> thick beard lol</li>
            <li> It is also easy to clean and stays charged a long time.</li>
            <li> pretty displeased with it.</li>
            <li> this is my first shaver</li>
            <li> Panasonic has the feel of my first Norelco of 1969 vintage.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Have owned a few electric shavers and this is as good as any.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; shaver is to never use it wet because even fine stainless steel corrodes more readily in the presence of water.  </li>
            <li> Even the neck area under my chin which usually gets irritated very easy was  smooth and not all bumpy.  </li>
            <li> This razor would be fine if you just want to clean yourself up every few days, but won&#x27;t cut it for jobs that require you to be clean</li>
            <li> Gives very smooth shave and stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts long and very smooth operation</li>
            <li> Panasonic needs very few passes to give an excellent shave, even on my neck, where the Braun required dozens of passes and still routinely missed individual hairs and even whole patches.</li>
            <li> NOT REALLY A CLOSE SHAVE, BUT EASY TO CLEAN</li>
            <li> This is by FAR the best shaver I ever had - WHY waiting? - any girl shaver in comparison with this Panasonic ES-RT51-S 3 Blade nano tech Wet/dry rechargeable shaver is poor in performance, its cleaning and looks.</li>
            <li> Replacement razor that is much nicer than the prior one and shaves more closely (so says my boyfriend).  </li>
            <li> I needed to replace my old Panasonic shaver, which was more then 10 years old.</li>
            <li> This unit replaced a model that cost more than double and had a much shorter battery life and fewer features.</li>
            <li> Making matters worse, I&#x27;m going on five weeks of trying to get Panasonic to honor its warranty for the razor but the best they have offered so far is to replace the charger (not the razor or its battery mind you.. the charger).  </li>
            <li> It was my first time and it didn&#x27;t go very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son for his birthday and my other son liked it so much that he also wanted one for his birthday.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the battery life, which was great to start, has deteriorated significantly.  </li>
            <li> But in the long run, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper and better for the environment.</li>
            <li> At first he wanted a Braun, but when he found out  that Braun is made in China rather than Germany he opted for a reasonably priced Panny.</li>
            <li> I am sure it won&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li> I had a higher end Panasonic shaver before and made the mistake to save too much.  </li>
            <li> This is way too long for a bathroom counter top.</li>
            <li> After the first shave, I was ready to return the product...</li>
            <li> I love how long the charge lasts on this shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver slightly less than 2 years ago and it was a good shaver while new.</li>
            <li> will not give a clean shave on my heavy beard if I go more than 1 day</li>
            <li> aextremely fast, very fine cutting (high speed)  very similar to the first electric Panasonic razor owned years ago... the best!!!!</li>
            <li> Shaves smooth - even 2 day old scruff and doesn&#x27;t hurt or pull - smooth as blade (mostly) without pushing hard into my neck as I had with others.  </li>
            <li> Bang for your buck, this is the best, most comfortable, least expensive razor you can buy.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve had it for a little more than two weeks and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Overall, not bad!</li>
            <li> The panasonic ES-RT51 which is now going for about $59.00 was one of the more expensive shavers and now is at its 59.00 reduced price, charges in an hour and has the super high speed motor, i also own this one and for the price</li>
            <li> New battery and screen cost more than this new razor which has a lithium battery vs the old nicad so I upgraded.  </li>
            <li> But I decided I like a dry shave better.</li>
            <li> Selling point from description and review was the easy care and the ability to just rinse entire unit under running water.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my dry legs and love the close shave.  </li>
            <li> My beard is light to normal, not heavy.  </li>
            <li> good shaves and long lasting battery</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also quiet and easy to clean &amp; maintain, and cost lots less than the highly advertised top brands..  </li>
            <li> it certainly won&#x27;t work on a man&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> The charge indicator screen claims that the charge is a certain percentage, like 100%, but it is not.</li>
            <li> I did not like the large head</li>
            <li> Easy to use, shaves close wet or dry w/o razor burn, easy to clean and operate.</li>
            <li> Instead, in one week, I was shipped a brand new unit, and not the same model as I had, but their top of the line model (ES-LV61-A).  </li>
            <li> My last Panasonic I had for more than 6 years and rather than replace its battery and &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; it was cheaper to purchase this new shaver.</li>
            <li> Works great wet or dry.</li>
            <li> wet/dry capability is liberating, and it feels great both wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> Great for wet &amp; dry.</li>
            <li> It would recharge quickly, and had a feature that would allow you to plug it in for a few minutes and get one more shave out of it if it was discharged.  </li>
            <li> The reviews you may read that state that the cheaper Panasonic shavers work just as good or better than the EXPENSIVE Panasonic shavers is true, Ive used Panasonic shavers for the last twenty years or so.</li>
            <li> but for the extra money, this works just fine</li>
            <li> The next day, 24 hours, as I was beginning to pack to mail it back, I tried one more time, it started !</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric is quite some time, the last one i had was a Braun 360 which was fine.</li>
            <li> regular razor works fine</li>
            <li> Get it, not a razor at all, a cleverly designed, pretty looking POC.</li>
            <li> Keeps a decent charge on the battery, pretty close shave, and</li>
            <li> All were very high quality.  </li>
            <li> VERY HIGH QUALITY SHAVER, CHARGES IN ABOUT 30 MIN.</li>
            <li> Nice little item.</li>
            <li> electric razor rarely gets as close as a wet shave, and that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> First time using this brand but would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It takes a little time to acclimate to a foil shave and should probably be done everyday for best results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked them all, but they don&#x27;t give me a very close shave because I have a fairly heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> The shave is much closer than electric or cartridge razors, the blades are readily available and relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves this raiser.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Seems to be very sturdy build quality.</li>
            <li> Shaves very close and equals the blade on my face but not quite so on my neck.</li>
            <li> Does perform somewhat better on a wet shave.  </li>
            <li> (It charges REALLY FAST)</li>
            <li> Very close shave for an electric.</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> The Norelco was a rotary three-head which was durable, but never gave a very close shave</li>
            <li> , this whole, \\&quot;the head moves/</li>
            <li> It does not shave very well</li>
            <li> and it still might not be smooth enough for some spouses/girlfriends.  </li>
            <li> Some were really pricey and had a lot of features.  </li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly !</li>
            <li> Very close.  </li>
            <li> B0043DMNHS Panasonic ES-RT51-S 3-Blade Nanotech Wet/dry Rechargeable Shaver, Silver] for about a month now, and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic model does not give a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to give a very close shave.</li>
            <li> It gives me a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a rotary for years, and while the shave was closer, it really irritated my neck.  </li>
            <li> This thing really hums fast.</li>
            <li> Really like the wet/dry feature and water clean-up.  </li>
            <li> Body wash very practical.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver</li>
            <li> Very close Shave&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It does not shave very close and pulls hair.</li>
            <li> His last shaver pulled a lot, but this is pain free.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well at all at getting rid of hair.</li>
            <li> If you think that one year of service for $50 to $60 is acceptable (you can spend that much on blades for a razor), you might consider it.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> The razor performs well, but I now have to plug it in 15-20 minutes before shaving so that it will work for me when I am ready.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it several weeks now and it shaves fantastic.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a woman shaving your pubic hair, don&#x27;t try to shave fast at all with this, you&#x27;ll hurt yourself.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to anyone wanting a smooth quiet shave.</li>
            <li> Very close shave for an electric from day one.  </li>
            <li> I like it so much that I bought one for my wife&#x27;s dad.</li>
            <li> He said he really likes the shave that he gets and that he doesn&#x27;t have to recharge it every time.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> Well I decided to try this and really like it.</li>
            <li> plus it is much quieter.</li>
            <li> but I really doubt that is did not work for them</li>
            <li> /&gt;2) Being able to get it wet or use it in the shower is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The market has many choices, this particular razor is not adequate for even the most basic of needs.</li>
            <li> Recharges fast and tells you what charge remains - 80% 60% etc.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really give the close shave you&#x27;d get with a real razor.</li>
            <li> It is really  a shame that Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Does sell replacement blades at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Very pleased...great value on Amazon.</li>
            <li> We bought this so that our adult son, who has an intellectual disability, could learn to shave himself.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;nanocoating\\&quot; or whatever it is seems very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I like a very close shave).</li>
            <li> I did receive in the time promised, tried it, and found it to work , even better when I se it wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it more useful to trim sparse body hair short enough to be cut by the foil, though both the trimmer and the foil can draw blood in some areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Likes the charging indicator and that unit holds a charge for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> I can go much faster with a Mach 3 disposable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The day after Christmas, i saw him and he had me feel his face, it was smooth as butter, and he said it only took him 2-3</li>
            <li> Also the battery seems to wear out much faster than advertised.  </li>
            <li> so much I order this for a replacement off the onther one I have</li>
            <li> Although still made in Japan, this razor was absolute junk.</li>
            <li> This head is not a curved like an Arc IV but is straight.</li>
            <li> and I really appreciate Amazon.com&#x27;s fast and efficient service.  </li>
            <li> It follows then that my primary critique of this shaver is that the total shave takes a lot of time.</li>
            <li> So much for battery</li>
            <li> I expected a better performance in terms of results.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reviewing a multitude of shavers and options I came to the conclusion I really didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a process (electric shave)</li>
            <li> Seems to perform very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Charges up fairly fast, about 45 minutes from a 20% charged battery.</li>
            <li> Sounds like a real bumble bee, but the vibration is soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Charges fast in about an hr.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> very short.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Solid and smooth.</li>
            <li> Shaves very well.</li>
            <li> really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it had actually left me with a smooth face</li>
            <li> in all, I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> I found the price to be reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Close shaves after 1 month adjustment period and fast charging times.</li>
            <li> I travelled with it and appreciated the unobtrusive and easy-to-manage safety on the switch.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m much happier with it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s much easier on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you know how much charge you have.</li>
            <li> That one lasted for years and now quality has dropped so much.</li>
            <li> For $60, I expected a better shave.</li>
            <li> I get a straight razor shave with a tenth the hassle.</li>
            <li> He used it and say - what is it really like.</li>
            <li> and it shaved my face very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame, because I really did like it, but I can&#x27;t recommend this to anyone because of the lack of battery life.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> guess if you have course hair it will not work very well.</li>
            <li> but I think my old narelco was much smother and cut better without going over and over the same area.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a reasonable length of time.</li>
            <li> Works  very well.  </li>
            <li> However, this model has a digital meter that tells you just how much life is left in the battery between charges, which is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> I kinda wish I hadn&#x27;t have bought it because my hand held razors get closer and don&#x27;t miss so much</li>
            <li> ; Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> THANKS.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t shave very close at all-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and very quiet and charges in no time.</li>
            <li> It shaves very well.  </li>
            <li> It cuts close and charges fast.</li>
            <li> I expected more from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> It shaves very close and fast, and is the quietest shaver of all the Panasonics I have had.  </li>
            <li> This one is a three blade and has an indicator that tells you how much is remaining on the battery.  </li>
            <li> He has very course hair</li>
            <li> my view there is absolutely no need to spend any more on an electric shaver than this one.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It frequently misses spots and I have to go over the same spot many times.</li>
            <li> Handy shaver works well if you use EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li> But overall good wet shaver.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars as I do find I have to make more passes over areas than I did with my old shaver.  </li>
            <li> However it has only 2 replacable blades,and some kind of \\&quot;stationary\\&quot; thing in the middle that Panasonic calls a blade.</li>
            <li> it gets really close, better than i expected, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like i thought it would.</li>
            <li> Good razor- worth the price - but not a great razor.</li>
            <li> Worked nicely for a whopping 3 months and is now dead.</li>
            <li> I gave up and went back to the Braun, which shaves much better (even with an old foil) than the two-month-old Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to handle easily and the shaving head fits your face and under the chin nicely.  </li>
            <li> Good, but not great razor due to the fact that it takes many more passes (especially on the neck) to do the job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer on the back is very powerful, but tends to get caught on thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had four Panasonic electric shavers over the past 25 odd years, and all of them have been excellent performers for me.</li>
            <li> This thing shaves as close as a new blade the first time.</li>
            <li> I am Extremely happy with this shaver, it works well with my Aveeno shave cream and gets my face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind!!</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long period of time and is easily cleaned with running water.  </li>
            <li> The RPM&#x27;s of this NON-LINEAR motor are adequate and the general shave is satisfactory.   </li>
            <li> The curved blades were far better than the flat blades in this unit.  </li>
            <li> I tried using it wet with shaving gel at first, and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> Just clean frequently with a soft brush and compressed air.  </li>
            <li> This is my third Panasonic Linear shaver, and it has not disappointed me yet.</li>
            <li> Other Panasonic models are much better.</li>
            <li> buy the cheaper Panasonics, they work great and last just as long as the big boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then thought I would get this razor for my wife and take my original Arc 3 back.</li>
            <li> I was going to get a Braun, but other blogs said this was even better than a Braun.  </li>
            <li> As I indicated above, Braun &amp; Remington have significantly reduced the quality of their razors.</li>
            <li> Have not used the wet part yet (other than to clean it with water, which worked nicely).  </li>
            <li> Each new shaver that I have purchased to replace the old has been better than the last.</li>
            <li> The combination is the only way I can get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Obviously this to clean away stubble.</li>
            <li> Shaves close enough to give a clean shaven look.</li>
            <li> Such a clean shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually had to supplement this with a safety razor to clean my neckline.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that this razor shaves quite as close as the Norelco, but it is much faster, particularly if you don&#x27;t shave every day.  </li>
            <li> If you are just looking for a simple clean shave, this&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li> but overall it gives a clean close shave.</li>
            <li> The battery has a long usage time and the digital meter measuring remaining charge is a nice idea.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t sound like a long time but that is daily use and original battery.  </li>
            <li> It shaves very smooth and clean, in wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this razor very much but so far I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Really like this model and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> But no matter how good and sharp the blades are if you don&#x27;t have high enough CPM with a motor that can handle high CPM</li>
            <li> The only concern I have is when it comes time to buy replacement blades it is often almost as cheap to buy a new razor.  </li>
            <li> I have a tough beard, and the 3041 cut quickly and closely on the first pass, with very light pressure and no razor burn.</li>
            <li> Looking for an electric razor for a special needs teen.</li>
            <li> it is ok if it was half the money that they are charging,i wouldn&#x27;t buy it again for this much money.</li>
            <li> youâ€™ve tried a Braun travel shaver, you know that itâ€™s possible to get a good shaver for less than $20.</li>
            <li> wet n dry is a good thing,</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it with wet cream, but cuts fairly close dry.</li>
            <li> that was very new</li>
            <li> If you shave every day or every other day, it might be OK for you but for me, even on 1 or 2 day&#x27;s growth, it was only adequate.</li>
            <li> Long battery endurance (over a week), with an accurate % Charge indicator</li>
            <li> That is a fast charge rate and consistent with the specs of one hour for full charge from empty.</li>
            <li> What I also love about it is that there is a digital readout that tells you how much charge you have left to go.  </li>
            <li> ; razors said that the motor sucked and they generally weren&#x27;t worth it and recommended this model.</li>
            <li> It requires many, many passes over the same area in different directions due to its design, but it eventually does the job.</li>
            <li> But when you switch it on, especially after a full charge, it basically sounds like it&#x27;s running at about a hundred thousand RPM, and gives you sort of a lackluster cut.  </li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and this works so very well, no chafing and it glides along, giving a close, clean quick shave.</li>
            <li> I only get 3 shaves on each full charge.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver of one kind or another for the past 15+ years.  </li>
            <li> nice small grip</li>
            <li> Works pretty well so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would return it, but adding the increased cost of a better razor to the hassle of returning and reordering, makes the return not worth it.</li>
            <li> He also has a very thick and coarse beard and it seems to shave him very good.</li>
            <li> Razor must be completely dried out to use on a dry face, but it shaves pretty good that way too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After using this shaver for about a month I am a bit disappointed with the shaver as it&#x27;s twice as much as the one I was using before and does not deliver as good of a shave, although it is better than most other  brands as they can not be used in the shower the way I use mine.</li>
            <li> The motor is very powerful yet not loud at all.</li>
            <li> really shave any better than other razors I&#x27;ve used, and probably not as well as my old (corded) Remington.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really do that when your parts pricing policy attempts to encourage existing customers to throw millions of older products into landfills and buy new.</li>
            <li> Once I get comfortable with \\&quot;dry shaving\\</li>
            <li> For a shaver that cost  me less than $50, it works better than any shaver I&#x27;ve had before.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get half as many shaves on a charge as I used to.</li>
            <li> Not only did it arrive quickly and BEFORE the promised date, it also has exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly for &amp;#34;between-shave&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This was like going back to one of the older Brauns only better.</li>
            <li> Works better than the more expensive razor I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> Simply delivers a nice close shave, cleans up easily under the faucet and does not sound like a lawn mower next to my ear.</li>
            <li> The only shortcoming is that it must be charged more often than my last (Remington) shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and efficient and charges quickly.  </li>
            <li> It replaces an older model that I had for a number of years.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly and has quiet operation.</li>
            <li> Settled on the Panasonic as it is wet/dry, holds a decent charge, and seems to be everything he needed.  </li>
            <li> drive&amp;#34; motor that my older one had.</li>
            <li> I have never replaced the blades and I can still get a decent shave</li>
            <li> and you expend a lot of time trying to get a decent shave that never get.</li>
            <li> Using a razor with shaving cream has also produced razor burn, particularly under my chin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer the leather zip case that came with the older razor and use it instead.</li>
            <li> you can bring this back up to 100% quickly</li>
            <li> I only use an electric razor for a quick touch up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent, but just that.  </li>
            <li> better then the most expensive one.</li>
            <li> although I have had better razors they were MUCH more expensive.</li>
            <li> It charged up quickly, shows a digital display</li>
            <li> Does a decent job of shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s a decent deal for the price, and</li>
            <li> Shaves quick, close and quiet.  </li>
            <li> no problems except now that it is older</li>
            <li> Holds charge for a decent amt. of time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much better the more expensive ones are</li>
            <li> (I tried this with my regular mug, brush, and soap, but I found that canned shaving cream actually works better.)</li>
            <li> I just discovered: You can&#x27;t get a super close shave by only paying $30 for a shaver, no matter what the ads say.  </li>
            <li> I replaced an older Panasonic wet/dry one blade unit.  </li>
            <li> I had an older version of this</li>
            <li> For the price it is a decent value.</li>
            <li> It could give a closer shave but does a decent job of shaving .</li>
            <li> Was pushed into purchase because Panasonic said they no longer supplied the cutters and foils for an older model.</li>
            <li> When this one arrived it has identical cutters and foil as the older one.</li>
            <li> I had an older version of this shaver</li>
            <li> and my friend bought the same model recently - he claims it gives him a  better shave than the Braun models he used for decades.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that the battery is getting discharged quickly.</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether my hair type isn&#x27;t very compatible, but I have noticed it did a slightly better job at certain lengths.</li>
            <li> But all the before mentioned with 13,000 CPM is the &amp;#34;sales close&amp;#34; concerning this item as 13,000 CPM makes it a member of the most powerful 1% of electric shavers on the market, it&#x27;s the Briggs and Stratton engine of electric shavers, can and will mow down the toughest beard!!!  </li>
            <li> The design is special, although in reality they are just AA batteries with little prongs welded on, Ironically, I pulled my old Norelco out of the drawer while waiting for the new batteries, and it performed fine.  </li>
            <li> This one works great - clean close shave with little hassle wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Good solid shaver that should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I get a good shave out of it, but I have found the on/off switch to be weak</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly reccomend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this razor, but I was also hesitant.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> High quality and performance.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product for everyone.</li>
            <li> It shaves cleanly and the rechargeable battery has a long life.</li>
            <li> When the battery died in my old one after MANY years of use, I didn&#x27;t consider any other brand but Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> Many men find an electric less appealing if they have a heavy beard, &amp; I would tend to agree.</li>
            <li> The flip-out trimmer is also not a very aggressive cutter, but it&#x27;s fine inasmuch as it won&#x27;t let you get too out-of-control on your moustache.  </li>
            <li> This is far better than any other shaver I have used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far better than all other makes that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> I bought a single foil travel shaver that worked very well and decided to replace my old Remington with this foil shaver as my primary shaver because it was on sale.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little longer to shave with a safety razor and there is more razor burn.</li>
            <li> I would invest a little more in a newer model.</li>
            <li> It appears to give a better trim, and is a little easier to control.  </li>
            <li> When it was time to replace the blades again at $32, I decided to pay a little more and get this one.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend keeping a stiff-bristle brush on hand, because running water won&#x27;t clean it up completely.</li>
            <li> It does a good job on tough areas like chin and neck.</li>
            <li> first foil shaver and its not bad at all considering its half the price of my rotary shaver, I&#x27;m sure the more expensive foil raisers can match rotary cutters.</li>
            <li> The battery life has never been as good as the older one and is getting worse.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product to anyone that wants a razor to use in or out of the shower and has a sensitive face.</li>
            <li> A good second addition for the average man, but not the one you want to use before that major presentation  at the shareholders meeting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Superb sharpness, fits perfectly in my hand, holds a charge for freaking ever, travels well, I cannot say anything bad about it.</li>
            <li> It gives a close, but comfortable shave wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m really liking it.</li>
            <li> If this is like old one, heads will last at best 6 months and are expensive, so check that cost beforehand.</li>
            <li> Charging was much faster than my old razor at about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> clean then take it apart to dry...</li>
            <li> Its much quitier than old Remington.</li>
            <li> So far very happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave a close or as fast as my old Braun</li>
            <li> This product is not wonderful but the price was great.  </li>
            <li> I like to use an electric razor on my face when it&#x27;s clean and dry.</li>
            <li> About a week for normal shaving.</li>
            <li> I know it says that you normally have a break in period for electric shavers, but for me there was none.</li>
            <li> It does a better job than my Braun 320-4 and with a heavy beard</li>
            <li> takes more effort to shave, although will do the job if you keep at it long enough.  </li>
            <li> This shaver works OK (similar to my braun and remington electic shavers that I used several years ago) but nowhere near as close a shave as with a blade.</li>
            <li> However, my facial hair grows slower than most of my friends-heck, my 14 year old cousin&#x27;s facial hair is heavier than mine</li>
            <li> The buzzing is considerably quieter with this model than with my 82xx, and that surprised me when I first turned it on.  </li>
            <li> I found that this Panasonic is quiet and powerful.</li>
            <li> I tested it from 100%, let it run non-stop, and it went to 0% normally.</li>
            <li> If someone had trouble with the battery, that&#x27;s one thing, but as a shaver, you&#x27;re not going to find a better shaver than this one.</li>
            <li> Then after a few more months it would shut off at 20%.  </li>
            <li> SPEND A FEW BUCKS MORE AND GET A PANOSONIC LINERA WITH A 10,000 RPM MOTOR.</li>
            <li> I use a razor first but follow up with the Panasonic for a really close shave that will last 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> I got tired of the slow-healing shaving nicks brought on by anticoagulant therapy and thought an electric might be a good alternative to the multi-blade razors I&#x27;ve always used.</li>
            <li> Despite the accident, he has dropped the shiver and cause the broken blade; replace and good till now.</li>
            <li> I cannot improve on the hundreds of other positive reviews here, but I just want to do a shout out to Panasonic for manufacturing a GREAT wet dry razor.</li>
            <li> Every man wants the best, close shave with the least amount of effort wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are other shavers that have more gadgets on them that are more expensive, but I am content enough will this one to not care about it.</li>
            <li> I also like the sound, higher pitched than my Bruan, with far less vibration.</li>
            <li> Much better than any of the other major name brands.  </li>
            <li> and i would rather have a new razor for a few bucks more then replacing blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shaver continues to forego any razor burn, even under the chin, which is a major positive.</li>
            <li> I had to throw it in the trash and switch back to my 5 year old model, which I had luckily kept as a spare.  </li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve got a similar 2-blade travel model as well, and it&#x27;s much less effective.  </li>
            <li> the benefit of shaving dry or wet is nice.</li>
            <li> I have owned other brands and they don&#x27;t cut as well or are more difficult to get a good cut.</li>
            <li> experience has been right in the middle.</li>
            <li> Great wet and dry shaving, and I will go against the grain and say I prefer dry.</li>
            <li> Although, considerably more expensive than my previous Panasonic razors, it was still the best value as compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> my facial hair is only slightly thick, and i have lots of difficulty to use the trimmer to make accurate and effective cuts with this shaver.</li>
            <li> So, with the face shaved mostly clean, I go along the center of my adams apple, the edge of my chin left and right, and around my mouth.</li>
            <li> I also started shaving wet and it is a significant improvement.</li>
            <li> This shaver runs quieter than the other model and ever bit as smooth a shave.  </li>
            <li> very good, only one thing not perfect, can&#x27;t use it when charging the battery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to live with</li>
            <li> and I used it for 3 years with no problems, but it needed a new blade head</li>
            <li> , it was time to get a new Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> If you like it, might as well just buy a new one once a year.</li>
            <li> I use them until I think the battery is about to die, then buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I never seemed to have a new cartridge when I needed it anyway.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on the market for a new shaver, but it won&#x27;t be a Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I could not be happier with my new Panasonic shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can live with that</li>
            <li> I can attest to the recommendation to replace the foil every year as both of my razors needed a new foil.  </li>
            <li> I have used my new panasonic for over a month</li>
            <li> Panasonic my new shaver.(Quick charge).a+ a+ a+</li>
            <li> Recommended this to my Dad and anyone else who mentions needing a new electric shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to order a new razor and it will not be a Panasonic.</li>
            <li> When I went to order new blades, again, in November, I decided to give this new Panasonic wet/dry another try.</li>
            <li> so I will just live with it.</li>
            <li> Everything I was looking for in a new electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> shaves then buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> Cost of replacement foil and blades is almost as much as a new unit.</li>
            <li> On balance, if I wasn&#x27;t using the Mach 3 on my face, I&#x27;d probably have returned this shaver for a new rotary.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> and after shaving three times with this new shaver, it is still at 100% charge according to the readout.</li>
            <li> I just get a new razor.</li>
            <li> When new, after about 40 minutes it would go to 20%, then die.  </li>
            <li> Instead of buying a new foil and new blades I decided to save some money and try this razor.</li>
            <li> But, the new shaver is lower cost than the replacement blades with the head.</li>
            <li> this one in a New York</li>
            <li> I have had no problems whatsoever and would recommend this model to any man needing a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> The weight and heft are much more comfortable and substantial than the comparably-priced new Remingtons (I tried one and returned it) which feel lightweight and cheesy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about being able to swivel left and right</li>
            <li> very quickly (again, my previous model took 15+ hours according to the manual).</li>
            <li> However, after a few passes from different directions even that cleaned up nice and close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , this is the closest shave that I have ever had and with the help of shaving oil and shaving while wet, I love this razor and will definitely buy another when I wear this on out.</li>
            <li> Along with his heavy beard, he has sensitive skin and most razors irritate it.  </li>
            <li> I was a Braun user for many years, but the last cutter/foil I purchased gave me rough shaves.  </li>
            <li> I only have it as an emergency back up if I forget to charge my primary</li>
            <li> Went back to real blades, these razors don&#x27;t really do the job...</li>
            <li> It also shows how much charge is left, a real convenience.</li>
            <li> Shaves very well, but takes more passes than an Arc IV, at least on my face, which docked it a star.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s entirely too big and will hardly fit into any compact shower/travel bag.</li>
            <li> it shaves well, and keeps the cuttings in until yopu are ready to clean it--unlike the braun i had previously.</li>
            <li> It is too early to tell how mu capacity Panasonic has engineered into this particular model.  </li>
            <li> There will be some strong points to use less hurt the skin.</li>
            <li> That gets you a new device, under warranty, for very little more than the replacement parts.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;m coming from a very old women&#x27;s Remington (26009HE).  </li>
            <li> think if you have a very round face and a very light beard this razor may work well for you.</li>
            <li> Battery will last up to 3 shaves and it charges up very fast.</li>
            <li> this comes very near to equaling the closeness of the shave when I want to shave another way.</li>
            <li> The basic design is similar, but it is obvious the blades don&#x27;t move nearly as fast and the motor is not as strong.  </li>
            <li> It charges fast but runs down quite quickly too.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if this is part of the problem - you end up effectively with a big flat surface, rather than the curve of a single foil head.  </li>
            <li> I do miss the \\&quot;ARC\\&quot; feature of my old shaver because it seemed to fit my face better, but I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this line of products.</li>
            <li> At this point I am not sure if I will try a better razor.</li>
            <li> you have to realize that first, any electric shaver takes time to train a beard and second, for a face to get use to it.</li>
            <li> shave in the shower with shaving cream with a tri-blade standard razor first, then I follow with this.</li>
            <li> Battery consistently drains to 80% after just 2 shaves although you can charge it back up in under an hour.  </li>
            <li> Even my old Panasonic ES-4001 came with a dock!</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> I also appreciate the modest cost!</li>
            <li> construction is first-rate and the first thing that struck me was how quiet it was.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would add to this shaver is a pretty girl to use it on my face.  </li>
            <li> The other two were great although they didn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, I occasionally nick myself with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> He said it was ok, but did not cut as well as Panasonics he has had in the past.</li>
            <li> and oh, yes... this is the first electric shaver I have ever had that has a trimmer that actually works!</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic ES-RT51-S I have owned, the first one I purchased almost eleven years ago...</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic wet/dry shaver for the past 10 years and love them.  </li>
            <li> But going back to my original plan of switching from blade to electric, after four weeks I am going back to the blade.  </li>
            <li> Recharging is very fast.&lt;br /&gt;I switched from Braun a few years ago and find that middle of the line Panasonic shavers work just as well for my beard and prices are better, considering Braun is also made is China and not Germany.</li>
            <li> I will look at Panasonic products first for all future purchases!</li>
            <li> Overall, I am satisfied with this product because I found other usages for it</li>
            <li> , it was his favorite gift this past</li>
            <li> Of the dozens of items that I have purchased at Amazon over the years, this is the first and only item that I returned for a refund.  </li>
            <li> When the repaired unit comes back, I have a spare, or as I did with the first, I give it to my son.  </li>
            <li> Sent back paying shipment  first one as it does not cut, for replacement which does not cut either.</li>
            <li> This is so much has quieter, much smoother operation than my old R-brand that I stuck with for 10 years and several purchases.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it was just user error, but apparently i just bought a razor that is absolute garbage.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several panasonics over the years and only the first two, bought back ten years ago and more, have met my standards.</li>
            <li> I bought it thinking hey this looks like a cool razor that you can use wet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the wet feature although I thought it might be cool when I bought it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why a much newer model wouldn&#x27;t shave as well as the older one, but it&#x27;s definitely not as a close a shave.</li>
            <li> Does as good a job as my previous Remington shaver that was half the cost.  </li>
            <li> currently only use this now to shave my mustache when it starts looking crusty and just let my beard be for a couple days and then use a regular razor again whenever I need to get a clean</li>
            <li> The shaver is fairly quiet and can be easily cleaned dry with a tooth brush or with a stream of water if you prefer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> really sucks on very fine hair (ex:</li>
            <li> So I used to use electric shavers way back when in high school and college because they were fast and convenient</li>
            <li> It is fast, smooth, ultra quiet and sharp.  </li>
            <li> For $40 I have a whole new shaver as a back up, and plenty of time for modifications to my new charging system.  </li>
            <li> So, what I do is wait until about 15 months and buy a new one, then send the old one for repair.</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of buying a new foil for my old Braun 1775 shaver.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased to say the least and actually don&#x27;t dread shaving.</li>
            <li> and it is fantastic as everyone said previously.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted a foil shaver that would be quieter because my wife didn&#x27;t like the sound of my previous shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shaver cleans easily with a couple of drops of liquid soap and water every few days.</li>
            <li> and it did not dry the shaver very well.</li>
            <li> I recently bought two of these as a replacement to my old shaver, and as my son&#x27;s first shaver.</li>
            <li> But remember you might take more than your usual time to complete the job.</li>
            <li> And as far as the battery goes, I am still on the first charge and have 60% left after 6 shaves.  </li>
            <li> With a dry shave, I&#x27;ve had the best results so far with a combination of rapid back and forth moves, combined with long slow moves, all against the grain of the beard.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This model had the wider head that all Braun shavers now have (a change that I think the company completed around 2010), and it required many many passes to shave well and often failed to get long hairs.</li>
            <li> battery life is great, should last at least 5 shaves per charge, depending on how long it takes you each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a better experience shaving on wet skin than on dry</li>
            <li> I like it better as a wet shaver than a dry one.</li>
            <li> Works perhaps slightly better dry than wet.  </li>
            <li> Love that it can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> This one requires much more pressure, several passes, and leaves a slight razor burn.  </li>
            <li> It features a kick-ass, high RPM motor, an LCD battery gauge, and some very sharp blades with Nanotech coating that do quick work.  </li>
            <li> It is of course much cheaper to buy a new one such as this model - rather than getting the old one repaired, which is a</li>
            <li> bought this because the blades in my old one had gotten dull and I discovered (to my surprise and annoyance) that I could buy a new shaver (with warranty) for just a bit more than the price of a replacement head for the old one.</li>
            <li> that you can use this wet or dry shaving, I just don&#x27;t like that you don&#x27;t get a close, smooth shave as with a real razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already on day 24 of its very first charge and only now it is starting to fade.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t have a super heavy beard, just a normal, have to shave daily type of beard.</li>
            <li> : Close, smooth shave with little or no irritation.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> However, the new shaver has very poor build quality and died for good after about 6 months of use.  </li>
            <li> I liked it enough but the battery was on its last limp and buying a new battery cost as much as buying the same shaver again.</li>
            <li> A dull disposable did a better job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This razor looks good and feels a little heavy.</li>
            <li> was a great disappointment.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t had a problem with this except in 1 area: the very end of my mustache near the corner of my mouth sometimes requires a second pass to get maybe 1 or 2 hairs that didn&#x27;t get cut.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-No cleaning brush is included (you can run this razor under water with soap to clean), so hang onto your brush from your previous razor if you have one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;MY FACE WOULD CLEAR UP.</li>
            <li> The battery is clearly dying.</li>
            <li> Close shave and less clean up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my fourth shaver after a bunch of cheap Remingtons with which I wasn&#x27;t careful and broke the foils</li>
            <li> my old wet/dry shaver had just died.</li>
            <li> that damned near could chop</li>
            <li> one thing that I really like about this model is that it has a digital display to show how much charge is left in the battery.  </li>
            <li> I never let the battery drain completely</li>
            <li> This is similar to the Remington Shaver Saver, but the Oster Kool Lube is much, much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> So, the only thing I don&#x27;t really care for is that fact that it \\&quot;pivots\\</li>
            <li> : Takes several passes to get a really close shave</li>
            <li> I bought this razor when my old Panasonic&#x27;s batteries wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and a lot of thing irritate me.</li>
            <li> bought for husband for Christmas, so far does the job, with no complaints.</li>
            <li> The exposed charging contacts at the bottom of the shaver is my only real gripe...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t encountered any negatives so far.</li>
            <li> (The head of the Panasonic even looks like that of the old narrow-head</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a complete novice at this</li>
            <li> so I was surprised when he didn&#x27;t have to come ask me for help.</li>
            <li> Tried using it with lather but found that I got a much closer shave using it the regular way with Lectri shave.</li>
            <li> I always had touch up with my old shaver after shaving with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Replaced and old Norelco.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;BY FAR, this is the finest shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The second was how fast the shave heads are moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old Braun would do it in one sweep.  </li>
            <li> My Panasonic ES-RT51 is now about two years old.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s ready for the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a really sensitive face and have even had electric razors that make my face break out.</li>
            <li> So far I have used this razor once</li>
            <li> so it does not turn on in your luggage which happened to my old razor.</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my old Panasonic 2 blade shaver.</li>
            <li> Also, the readout indicating how much battery strength is left before needing to recharge is not reliable.</li>
            <li> three uses thus far and still at 80% battery.</li>
            <li> And unlike my old razors, it cannot be used while plugged in to a wall outlet.</li>
            <li> Have not used the mustache trimmer much because the actual device blocks the view in the mirror.</li>
            <li> and actually only shaves about every 3 days saying his beard just doesn&#x27;t grow that fast anymore.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s 93 and has always used a straight regular razor with shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I warned him that he will still need to use his disposable razor every now and again around the neck area as none of the electrics I&#x27;ve ever owned do a complete job on the neck.  </li>
            <li> When you turn it on, it tells you how much power is left before you have to recharge it.</li>
            <li> So far the razor is doing well and meets all of my expectations</li>
            <li> Needed something for my son with sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use a razor without it tearing up his face.  </li>
            <li> Old time technology, avoid it.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an old electric razor.</li>
            <li> Its environmental statement says that it will &amp;#34;practice prudent, sustainable use of earth&#x27;s natural resources and the protection of our environment&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My old triple took about a minute.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot longer to shave with the electric and the shave is no where near as close as a blade razor...</li>
            <li> The pop up trimmer does a reasonable job of trimming around my goatee and back of my neck.  </li>
            <li> I might just find someone on ebay that has a bunch of blades, buy a supply and keep the old one running.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old ES8077, which had the Arc system.  </li>
            <li> With my old ES8077, i needed to shave every day.  </li>
            <li> I was not using the self-cleaning features of the old shaver and decided to buy just the shaver.</li>
            <li> however I sent the shaver back to Panasonic and they replaced it in a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li> ) Short on funds I opted for the \\&quot;much</li>
            <li> Purchased for husband as his old Braun shaver would no longer hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> $50 does not go as far as it used to....</li>
            <li> I shave early in the morning</li>
            <li> After nearly 65 years, I started getting razor rash after shaving with my blade.  </li>
            <li> I am a 67 year old retiree and have had to shave twice a day since I was in my 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Battery lasted until early 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s an inherent problem with such designs as compared to the rotary blade setup in the Norelco - I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I was also surprised to see it began rusting at the recharge port.</li>
            <li> (I am using my old Remington case)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Time will tell but I like the results, so far, and I didn&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li> My son wanted a razor that had a straight across blade and found this one for his Christmas present.  </li>
            <li> AS A 2YR OLD PANASONIC BATTERY DIED.  </li>
            <li> It looks like it will die completely within the year.</li>
            <li> Make sure the last few strokes go directly against the lie of your beard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 75 years old and have used lather and blade up until about 9 months ago when I purchased an under thirty bucks corded Norelco for the convenience while traveling and camping.  </li>
            <li> I also like the charge feature where you always know how much charge is left.</li>
            <li> my old one.  </li>
            <li> While it has some bells and whistles that the 3041 didn&#x27;t have, it doesn&#x27;t do the job nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> it doesnt shave as well as my 10 year old razor.  </li>
            <li> but he says &amp;#34;so far, so good&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to everyone who wants to shave with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> had to switch to electric razor after open heart surgery and was placed on blood thinners for a period of time,had always used a razor and blade,this is much safer.hope to continue to use after the med is</li>
            <li> my old one did.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 92 year old Dad in a nursing home.  </li>
            <li> I bought for my boyfriend who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I had an early model of Panasonic razor, with identical parts.</li>
            <li> I have used many different electric razors and few do a thorough job.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re still good; my thin facial hair obviously doesn&#x27;t cause much wear on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My experience so far leads me to believe rotaries cut better, or at least faster.</li>
            <li> Since there&#x27;s nothing spectacular about the shave and the power management is poor, I&#x27;m giving it a 2-star.</li>
            <li> Good shaver, I have a sad history of shavers not working</li>
            <li> My last one which is about two years old and was very expensive worked fine but fit and finish had much to be desired, after about two weeks the swivel lock for the head pretty much broke, long story shory</li>
            <li> As a guy who likes to sharpen his own tools, I gotta think, theoretically, the extra lubrication SHOULD make the blades stay sharp longer and, at the same time, be easier on the motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is also the first shaver I&#x27;ve bought that you can take in the shower with you, so again, I prove I am no expert and a little behind the times, but I HAVE tried a lot of ways to mow my crop, including straight razors, and I can say this razor, used with shaving cream, really gives me a smooth shave, fast.</li>
            <li> The original batteries died after a little over a year.  </li>
            <li> While it is not as close as a blade it is very good in about the same or less time and without the mess as I haven&#x27;t had to use the wet shave feature to do it.</li>
            <li> The motor isn&#x27;t as strong, you have to struggle to get an equal shave, and you have to recharge it before the batteries go down below 60 percent or</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase after never previously owning a Panasonic razor before.  </li>
            <li> ...does a better job in less time and with less work (the Pany has to have shave foam in order to really get a close shave and it just takes longer to get the job done).</li>
            <li> Since I was satisfied with Panasonic&#x27;s wet linear style shavers, I had this model purchased for me which was a fraction of the cost of the other one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned at least 3 other Panasonic razors and loved them all.  </li>
            <li> As for the quality, it seems pretty decent and time will tell as to how long this product will last.</li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer on that model stopped working, it needed new foil and blades, so I decided to replace the entire unit since the replacement foil/blades cost about $30 and this new unit</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;d think there are plenty of potential new customers coming up for new products and they might consider revising their pricing policy on repair parts to bring it in line with their stated environmental policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was the same price for a new shaver vs new foils/blades.</li>
            <li> donâ€™t have to bang the thing on the sink to clean, just put in a little soap and turn it on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of the Main things i really like about this razor is the fact that you can wet shave with it....</li>
            <li> I use this wet or dry so far it seems to be fine.</li>
            <li> I have a thick, full beard that is very tough, so this shaver is truly performing great.  </li>
            <li> Now several more months later, it runs down to 40% and shuts off.  </li>
            <li> I will be shopping for an older Panasonic shaver from when they actually produced a quality product.</li>
            <li> The first one, roughly 15 years old, is in the RV and it still performs like a champ.</li>
            <li> The main reason I bought this model was because I happen to have two extra cutter/foil packages for another shaver that I was using and malfunctioned.  </li>
            <li> My only minimally non-positive comment on this unit is that I do notice a difference between the previous unit&#x27;s 13k rpm motor and this unit&#x27;s 10k rpm motor, in regards to catching some errant hairs along my jaw line.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had luck with both, but after my last high dollar Braun bit the dust after just 18 months</li>
            <li> This razor leaves spots on my neck literally untouched, despite a half-dozen passes over the same, highly visible coin-sized patch of hair.  </li>
            <li> know I am going to sound like a bit of a shill because I have only used this product recently, but I have shaved with several different brands and models of electric shavers over the years.</li>
            <li> Finally, tired with constant charging, I send the unit back to Panasonic for service (2 year warranty is great) and bought ES8103S from Amazon to replace it while left without a shaver.</li>
            <li> The price on these parts are almost as much as buying a new unit.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, but NO thanks.</li>
            <li> The wet shave is definitely the way to go, a little Nivea Men&#x27;s Face Wash and some warm water</li>
            <li> Smooth shave both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> I attribute this more to the Panasonic&#x27;s design and less to the wet shave.</li>
            <li> Panasonic razors are the best, but this one falls short, at least for tough beards.</li>
            <li> I have very dry sensitive skin on my face and am very particular with my electric shavers.</li>
            <li> still seems to hold charge reasonably long and still charges fast</li>
            <li> it ok but not good as i though</li>
            <li> have really coarse facial hair and go through razors fast as a young man in my 30s.</li>
            <li> It keeps its&#x27; charge for a long time and recharges fast.</li>
            <li> Pretty close to a blade if you do it wet or in shower.  </li>
            <li> this unit shaved well and close for the first week, then, it started shaving roughly, and did not give a close shave, almost like a woman had used it to shave her legs, and coarsened it.  </li>
            <li> was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> They usually come with a cleaner/ recharger station and to be honest don&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> he only used it a few times and went back to disposables because they worked better.</li>
            <li> At present, it&#x27;s good for at least five shaves to empty.</li>
            <li> This was the first electric razor that I&#x27;ve used, so maybe my expectations were a little bit too high.</li>
            <li> You can spend much more money on other models, but this one works very well on my thick beard.  </li>
            <li> I have moved into the 21st century with this new Panasonic electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I finally said To hell with it, and ordered new brushes from you folks, which  are on the way.</li>
            <li> The only option is to purchase a new razor.</li>
            <li> tried an experiment with keeping the same blade for about a year, then comparing it with a new blade (foil, cutter, etc.)  </li>
            <li> Got my new Panasonic ES-RT51-s last night, AND BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY IT IS ALMOST AS CLOSE</li>
            <li> 11/12/15 I finally gave in and purchased a new Braun.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the pivot action of the head is that helpful as it seems a tad bit too tense for easy movement, but it&#x27;s not a hindrance to my shaving, either.</li>
            <li> After using Panasonic Wet &amp; Dry shavers for years and trying many different models I thought I had found the one I would stay with but low and behold</li>
            <li> My old Norelco died an early death and this is a terrific replacement.  </li>
            <li> and I always have to replace the blades to fast, the Norelco had 3 circular blades which took me multiple attempts over the same area</li>
            <li> I fully expect this one to last as long and shave as well as the first Panasonic did.</li>
            <li> As a lifelong Panasonic Razor customer, I have always enjoyed their razors and understand they need to be replaced every few years.  </li>
            <li> Even after multiple passes, I still have very visible facial hair.</li>
            <li> I used to have a Panasonic long time back when they first came out with washable shavers.</li>
            <li> Pop-up trimmer works fine, and the long hair foil in the middle of the two main foils does seem to catch longer hairs in a few passes.  </li>
            <li> for sensitive skin (I&#x27;ve never been able to use an electric razor behind my knees before, but I could with this.  </li>
            <li> Almost as good as expensive regular razors.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a back up to my very old Panasonic ES-8017, which I have replaced the batteries myself with rechargeable batteries.    </li>
            <li> Shaving with this razor requires an excess of facial gymnastics to cut every whisker as it seems to be very sensitive to the direction in which the hair grows.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice razor, looks very expensive  </li>
            <li> Is ok, work good , the only thing that the blades are very expensive, half the price of the same item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned all the major brands and you cannot beat the Panasonic and price</li>
            <li> No regrets!</li>
            <li> No other shaver has even come close to this machine for me.</li>
            <li> It allows me to shave with a gel and prevent razor burn which is a major plus for me.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am extremely pleased with this electric razor!</li>
            <li> It does take some time, not perfect on the first pass, however once complete my face is as smooth as a razor without any cuts, redness, or irritation.  </li>
            <li> If you just need dry, then you can go even cheaper and still get the exact same shave quality.  </li>
            <li> quick to recharge [usually about an hour for a complete charge, which renders about 8, 3 minute shaves.</li>
            <li> A full charge will only last long enough for one shave.  </li>
            <li> Previously I used Panasonic&#x27;s ES8109S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade model for many years until it broke down.</li>
            <li> They truly provide an extremely close comfortable wet shave.</li>
            <li> I had an electric razor a long time ago and didn&#x27;t like it, I just couldn&#x27;t get a decent shave without it taking forever.</li>
            <li> They use special proprietary batteries which cost $20+ for two little batteries that look like a AA battery only that they have a metal prong welded on each end.  </li>
            <li> I have experienced some pretty bad shaver burns over the years using other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only recently gotten a decent shave, after resorting to a pre-shave lotion (Afta).  </li>
            <li> Issues with longer beards, not a huge difference between this and a Norelco as I hoped; still have to make multiple passes to get clean shaven.</li>
            <li> However it does a decent job of cutting and has a nice grip.</li>
            <li> BUT AS WITH THE HIGH END UNITS, DOES NOT CUT LONG BEARD HAIR.</li>
            <li> battery does not last as long as previous razors, however I am easily getting 5-6 shaves out of a charge</li>
            <li> Have had teh razor only a little over a month; if continues as at present, 5 stars are justified.</li>
            <li> But having to charge it every other day or two gets old quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: When it went from 60%-0%, the blades would click/move ever so slightly, making a &#x27;tik-tik-tik&#x27; sound.</li>
            <li> Also, when I am running late I have used this dry and there is ZERO tug and pull, it is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I generally use blade shavers but like to use an electric about once or twice a week to give my skin a break.</li>
            <li> I generally like Panasonic products</li>
            <li> I shave in the shower and generally would get about a week out of a charge.  </li>
            <li> Does not cut long hair very well, but simple matter to use pop out clipper for that.</li>
            <li> So far we have had over 20 different manual razors and electric razors over 5.</li>
            <li> My old Razor, which cost about the same as this one, was made in Japan not China, and it supposedly ran at 13000 RPM.  </li>
            <li> So far he has only dropped it twice, but it did not crash into a million pieces.</li>
            <li> If you want a shaver that glides harmlessly over sensitive skin without necessarily taking off your beard, Braun might be the shaver for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve decided to go back to using an old fashioned safety razor.</li>
            <li> I could barely even feel it against my face and it cleared every hair off my neck.  </li>
            <li> Even with it flashing at 0 % urging me to charge it, it still has enough juice for me to complete my shave.</li>
            <li> Second charging appeared to complete after 14 hrs, but the shaver would not work.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li> We went back to using an old Norelco which I had almost discarded.  </li>
            <li> that if it is plugged in, it will not run which can be a problem if you don&#x27;t charge frequently and don&#x27;t notice you are on low juice.</li>
            <li> He used the wet shaving feature and said it was a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m old, so I&#x27;ve owned lots of different shavers.</li>
            <li> For the environment I wish they made one with a complete set of replaceable parts so you could keep it going without throwing out the body and charger only to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Another thing, it has a digital readout to tell you how much of a charge is left in the battery --- which incidentally only took 1 hour to fully charge ----</li>
            <li> Nowhere near the shaving results as before with the same model.</li>
            <li> I always shave wet, and get a very close shave every time.</li>
            <li> I can only get 3-4 shaves after a full charge before it&#x27;s completely dead.  </li>
            <li> Also, worth noting the charger and razor do not fit inside the bag provided.  </li>
            <li> I actually laughed when it stopped cutting in mid-shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s charge for quite a few shaves, so it is not really inconvenient to pull out the charging cord and let it sit on the counter till charged.</li>
            <li> Afterwords, I take the head off the shaver and turn the sink water on high and rinse the head off, give it a shake and dry it on a towel.  </li>
            <li> Battery charges very fast in less than 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> gives agood shave without irritating my sensitive skin.no cords to hassle with definitely a good price .can use wet or dry shave.</li>
            <li> It was cheaper to replace the entire shaver than simply purchasing new blades/foil.&lt;br /&gt;Go figure.  </li>
            <li> I figured that I would probably be better off with a new shaver, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Normally i will wait for deals on panasonic razors that are normally around $120 that are half off.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quieter than my previous one and it provide good shave (not great).</li>
            <li> The big plusses are that it gives a very close shave (especially where the beard grows sidways and flat)</li>
            <li> On looking further into the reviews, there are many complaints of getting less and less shaves as time passes.  </li>
            <li> For someone who has never used a wet/dry shaver it&#x27;s an odd sensation at first -</li>
            <li> I got about 15 shaves on the first charge and the recharge took less than an hour.</li>
            <li> definitely better than other electric razors of past years.</li>
            <li> Not only does it work, but it will actually shave his heavy beard--even after several days&#x27; growth--to a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li> It works just as good as my expensive razor and to replace the foil is under $20 and uses the same blades as my more expensive Panasonic razor does.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wet performance since I always use it dry, right after washing my face</li>
            <li> During use, it can tilt left and right and can be pushed in slightly, so it has some &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; when applying pressure to stubborn hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I do notice after going over my whole face and then rubbing over the skin with my other hand</li>
            <li> this shaver and the other Panasonic I purchased were both under a $100.00 and about over a hundred dollars cheaper than the one with all the bells and whistles and work VERY well.</li>
            <li> and I really wonder why men pay up to five times this price for any other shaver.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I get a better, closer shave with the Panasonic than I ever got with a conventional razor, and no more nicks.</li>
            <li> otherwise, not a single issue</li>
            <li> I have always owned Panasonic wed dry shavers because the wet dry&#x27;s are the easiest to clean.</li>
            <li> Would give 5 stars, but razor doesn&#x27;t run directly off of AC, only off charged DC internal battery.</li>
            <li> You will not get the same close shave that you get with a regular old fashion razor.</li>
            <li> I have written to panasonic direct expressing how the newer models do NOT last (have owned 5 models) and only got a reply of \\&quot;we are sorry\\&quot;!  </li>
            <li> Having the digital readout was worth the slight extra $5.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that the product description says the razor has Li-Ion battery, but it actually has NMH battery instead like the old one does.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as saying this shaver is horrible, but it isn&#x27;t the best.   </li>
            <li> First, when using dry, you do have to shave slowly to get all the hairs the first time.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little iffy about the idea of wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting very close shaves (much closer than Norelco, without the occasional chaffing irritation of the skin)that last all day with very little effort.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first little thing is just the cost of the shaver versus replacement foils.</li>
            <li> failure mode on all 5 of my Panasonics (yes, 10.5 years worth!)</li>
            <li> the shave is not good or comfortable</li>
            <li> I find I have to go over areas two or three times and still get only a barely passable shave.  </li>
            <li> I owned an old model a long time ago and wanted a wet/dry shaver</li>
            <li> A few years ago I got my first Panasonic Shaver as a birthday gift and never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;Things</li>
            <li> First few shaves take it</li>
            <li> Took care of heavy stubble beard on the first try.  </li>
            <li> Just squirt some antibacterial hand soap into the head run for a few seconds and flush with hot water.</li>
            <li> The charging cord is not curled round, but a super long, straight, 5ft, typical electronics style charging cord.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much for the product, due to the fact it is not in my possession, but I can say that the purchase was a breeze as always with amazon!</li>
            <li> With little variety on the market I was pretty much left with the Norelco or Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> Better than some other brands I had in the past!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Asian male with mostly straight facial hair, some spots are straight but may grow a little slanted in one direction which require a couple of passes if left too long without shaving.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable when using a shaving gel but irritating when used dry.</li>
            <li> I have already ordered a replacement set of foils, the mfg wants $30, but they can be had for less.    </li>
            <li> my previous shavers used induction charging so there were no exposed contacts...but again, for the price, can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> just bought a Norelco, for less money (a rotary type shaver) which I like a whole lot</li>
            <li> Norelco 730 gives me a much closer shave in less time</li>
            <li> My personal preference is Every Man Jack shave creme (the one that comes in a tube, not can) since it&#x27;s not foamy and it does not dry out my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All you do is rinse the head hot water WHILE it is on, then power off and remove the head, turn it back on and rinse the blades by themselves for a few seconds, again while running.</li>
            <li> Worthy replacement for the ES8077, which I think I&#x27;ve had for at least five years.</li>
            <li> and I already have a single blade Panasonic electric shaver that is a backup to my old Remington 2 blade shaver.  </li>
            <li> It took about 3x the time to shave as my old Remington and longer than even my single blade Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> Second, in terms of design, the pop up trimmer does not allow use with the main heads as some other shavers to grab those stubborn neck hairs.</li>
            <li> The weak point is the battery which isn&#x27;t readily available as a replacement.</li>
            <li> Gets very close, and with significantly less irritation than the last razor I owned.</li>
            <li> trying a few electrics over past years I have generally not been satisfied.  </li>
            <li> So I have to downgrade this review from the four-star rating of &amp;#34;I like it&amp;#34; to the two-star rating of &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like it.&amp;#34; Maybe it just needs a new battery, but I&#x27;m not interested in paying another chunk of money to find out.</li>
            <li> So I have to downgrade this review from the four-star rating of &amp;#34;I like it&amp;#34; to the two-star rating of &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like it.&amp;#34; Maybe it just needs a new battery, but I&#x27;m not interested in paying another chunk of money to find out.</li>
            <li> This one is a little lower on the RPM&#x27;s but much quieter and actually gives an even closer shave.  </li>
            <li> If I go slow or fast, press hard or light, with the grain or not.</li>
            <li> biggest complaint is the battery meter â€“ it will show 60% and last enough for a full shave as long as I donâ€™t turn it off.</li>
            <li> The foil and blade does get a little hot if insufficient liquid is used (water or foam), therefore dry-shaving would have to be limited.</li>
            <li> Shaves very close, i recommend wet shave instead of dry shave just to reduce minor skin irritation.</li>
            <li> The shaving head is flat, and contains a simple blade replacement, rather than one of the more expensive</li>
            <li> I have owned 2 of this model shaver now and both of them lost their sharpness quickly and also after less than a year will only hold a charge a few days.</li>
            <li> but ingrown hairs caused by blades have caused me to try something new, and this razor has not let me down.</li>
            <li> I did a little research and found that this would be a shaver that I could purchase to replace my older Wahl shaver.  </li>
            <li> The prior reviews were pretty evenly polarized between love it or hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Originally I was not happy with the shave, but continued use has made me a believer.</li>
            <li> So instead of replacing the battery I bought a new unit just one model less gadgets.  </li>
            <li> Protective cover seems a little weak, but I&#x27;m sure it will last.</li>
            <li> Gave it 4 stars because I know of no better razor, but it really deserves only 3 stars.</li>
            <li> note: If you pass the shaver over some hair several times and it doesn&#x27;t get cut, the hair is probably too long to get properly caught by the blades.</li>
            <li> They all only last so long before they burn out.</li>
            <li> The only thing I do not like is when the device is plugged in you can use the shaver, this device must be disconnected to work so as long as the battery last</li>
            <li> He is older and has trouble seeing.</li>
            <li> One would have to press pretty hard against the skin to get the swivel to work</li>
            <li> Shaves smoothly wet or dry and doesn&#x27;t irritate my somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> take on why some shavers are SO expensive is that they&#x27;re easy and obvious gift items for men.</li>
            <li> An ode to the joys of male grooming.clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For tougher beards or less frequent shavers</li>
            <li> It has all the features one needs and no more, at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it not completely cut your unwanted hair,   </li>
            <li> Doesnt shave either long or short hairs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Panasonic which means it is a well made item designed to last a long time and work well.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts really long, and it has a charge meter to indicate relative life.</li>
            <li> Hope it lasts as long as my last shaver, a Norelco, for about 20 years.</li>
            <li> Even so, it has missed long hairs on my neck only twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> However, the battery didn&#x27;t last as long as I would hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t dunked the thing in water or had it long enough to see how the lithium battery holds up.</li>
            <li> The long term review, however, is quite a different story.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the shaving feature is not in use long enough to judge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hen</li>
            <li> The only thing I  might ask for (and it&#x27;s turning out to be minor) is a wider trimmer.  </li>
            <li> the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> The units works fine but failed to work after only two charges.</li>
            <li> With its center cutter (which gets the long hairs well), it&#x27;s equivalent to my former, more expensive shaver (also a Panasonic).</li>
            <li> This one costs about half as much as the one I owned before it, but it is the closest shave I have had in the last year, hands down.</li>
            <li> Replacement batteries were not available, prompting me to buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I tried fully charging and discharging it (takes a VERY long time) several times to get rid of the memory but to no avail.</li>
            <li> and I have only used it dry.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a wet/dry shaver, but i&#x27;ve only used it dry</li>
            <li> Currently, i&#x27;m just using it as a dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> Try it with gel; it&#x27;s a definite improvement over dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I even came back to this site was to look in to getting replacement blades and foil as I haven&#x27;t been getting a very close shave lately.  </li>
            <li> The old razor simply quit while I was shaving a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do the job, despite moving it around to different angles, and I&#x27;m frequently forced to use a razor to finish up the job.</li>
            <li> For the first few months I could run the battery down to 0% before the shaver would stop.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is about an inch wide, located on the back well below the shaver blades, and is a little hard to position accurately when using on my mustache since the position of blade is almost invisible while in use.  </li>
            <li> My latest Norelco just gave up the ghost a couple of weeks ago, so I have been shaving with shaving cream and a regular razor since --- and cutting the heck out of my skin (you know, the old hangy down skin under the chin!)</li>
            <li> Those amazing little shavers arenâ€™t well suited to everyday use (no rechargeable battery and no easy way to deal with long hairs), but they prove that you donâ€™t have to spend a lot of money to get a decent shave, even if you have a tough, fast-growing beard like mine.</li>
            <li> Terrific razor, gets all the way down to the skin like a regular blade, charge remains for a long time, and holding it you can tell that it has a solid design and is well put-together.  </li>
            <li> Our opinions were basicly the same after trying wet and dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor and im a female having read other female reviews...</li>
            <li> I have tried dry and wet multiple times for the last couple months.</li>
            <li> This model has less perks but performs as well and costs half as much.</li>
            <li> My \\&quot;old reliable\\&quot; Norelco is still working on 15 year old batteries, only issue is replacement blades are getting tough to find.</li>
            <li> The RT51S is equipped with 30 degree blades like the more expensive shavers but the motor is a conventional type instead of a linear motor.</li>
            <li> thinking of getting one for my son for Christmas now.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for gentleman that has poor hand control or is eldery and has a hard time with a traditional razor for sure.</li>
            <li> I have owned expensive shavers and cheap shavers and all those in between.</li>
            <li> The performance is simply not there as expected.</li>
            <li> so I have to spent some extra time in those areas, but the pivoting head makes it easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if the more expensive Panasonic models are worth it since the Panasonic ES-RT51-s does everything that I would expect from an expensive one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the automatic cleaning station for long on the shaver that featured it.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use an electric shaver in a long time ,was going to go for the five head .</li>
            <li> The shave was not nearly as close as the Remington&#x27;s I had used and the price was excessive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES-RT51 offers everything I want in an everyday electric shaver.</li>
            <li> these things are relatively minor and I&#x27;ll adapt to them easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wet method will provide instant gratification.</li>
            <li> and I bought it for a long time now</li>
            <li> For some reason I had a few minor cuts for the first few uses.</li>
            <li> Pitiful excuse for a razor.</li>
            <li> good:&lt;br /&gt;1) Battery lasts a long time and charges quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waited too long to return it</li>
            <li> It does appear well made however and holds a charge for what seems like a long time.</li>
            <li> I am a long time Norelco user.  </li>
            <li> so it lays on the counter and has a long cord.</li>
            <li> It charges in a jiffy and holds it&#x27;s charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The razor is head and shoulders ahead of my Braun that is not old.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;ll only use it wet, so I can&#x27;t rate</li>
            <li> was ready to try a different make only because Panasonic&#x27;s website was so frustrating.</li>
            <li> it has lived up to my expectations being a long time Panasonic user....</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long long time.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as \\&quot;complete\\&quot; as the shave that I got with my Norelco.  </li>
            <li> The actual razor is only like 1.25&amp;#34; wide while the foil head is about 2&amp;#34; wide.</li>
            <li> The battery life is long.</li>
            <li> weekend i went to shave and my old one was dead.  </li>
            <li> gave it two tries, before wrapping it up, and placing it back in the box.  </li>
            <li> the shave was close and my face felt smoother than it has in a long time.  </li>
            <li> Only the shaving cream (wet) shave meets &amp;#34;standards&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> All I can say is technology has come a long ways.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen long hairs growing in areas where I might have gone over them tow or three times</li>
            <li> Takes twice as long to get all the whiskers cut.</li>
            <li> I am a wet shave, regular razor, guy.  </li>
            <li> I hope ES-RT51-S will serve me well for a long time as well.</li>
            <li> I attempted several exceedingly long shave sessions, trying to learn how to use the product, but in the end, I never got anywhere close to a satisfactory shave, wet or dry.</li>
            <li> This one is less noisy but cleaning it is more difficult.</li>
            <li> My previous Panasonic wet/dry shaver finally died after 15 years of use (!)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a wet &amp; dry shaver look no further.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t comment on performance as a wet shaver because I do dry only.</li>
            <li> I like to alternate every other day with this and a gillette mach</li>
            <li> Charging and other maintenance is also simple.</li>
            <li> If Panasonic can&#x27;t resolve  a small problem like this since early March of this year, they ought to hang it up!</li>
            <li> Low battery life, really struggles if I let my beard grow past a few days.  </li>
            <li> experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little anxious at first on recharging -</li>
            <li> Really hard to get a decent shave on the neck.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very thick facial hair at all, so I figured this would do the job without an issue, but the shave with this razor isn&#x27;t very close at all.</li>
            <li> only problem that i have is that when using it dry the mid blade irritates me a little.</li>
            <li> I used it for a very long time 5~6 years.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long anymore</li>
            <li> Its hard to beat this product for the money, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It got so that he would ask me not to shave him because it was becoming such an unpleasant experience.  </li>
            <li> After each use, I use liquid hand soap and rinseit off and air dry it.  </li>
            <li> and you must leave it out disassembled to dry after each use, a bit of a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried disassembling it to clean the battery contacts, etc., but was unable to get it running again.  </li>
            <li> Shaves well on my 2 day stubble (dry shave, have not tried shaving cream yet) and does this without giving me a rash either.</li>
            <li> you are in a hurry, you can use it dry but you won&#x27;t get as close a shave.  </li>
            <li> It will take your face a couple days to get used to the dry shaving method.</li>
            <li> Hubby just rinses unit and screen under running water and places on a towel to dry.  </li>
            <li> After that I just used it solely for dry shaves.</li>
            <li> I use it without any foam or shaving cream, and always DRY.</li>
            <li> I normally shave with  water, hot or cold.</li>
            <li> always performing perfectly...wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s performance dry,</li>
            <li> Shake it as dry as you can and let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> (it accelerates to remove hair), dry it off and you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The dry face shave is fastest, and the shaving cream shave gives the closest and gentlest cut.</li>
            <li> the dry shave isn&#x27;t all that close.</li>
            <li> You can use it dry, with gel or lather.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and the RT51 performs just as well as the more expensive models on my not-so-young face.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the digital readout on the handle continues to read 100% even when battery is dead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 84!years old and have used dozens of electric razors over the years and this is by far the worse of the bunch.</li>
            <li> but it takes at least 10 minutes to get a decent shave -</li>
            <li> I was skeptical (because it was so inexpensive), but my expensive Braun had gotten old and to fix it (just new blades and screen) would have cost as much as the new Panasonic</li>
            <li> Again the Braun would do me for around 10 days on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> and I have to recharge after every single shave.  </li>
            <li> The battery on this one does not last as long as my previous model.  </li>
            <li> Previous razors left long hairs -- it has been almost two months</li>
            <li> This razor does a very poor job on more than a few days growth.</li>
            <li> My beard is average, so a touch-up only takes a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not like the old electrics that i have tried in the past and failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Put a small drop directly on the cutters, replace the foil, &amp; run for 20 seconds, rinse.</li>
            <li> Those oily pre-shave liquids are messy and, generally, for the birds.</li>
            <li> The old razor served me well for the past 6 yr.</li>
            <li> I only mention this because itâ€™s possible that someone with sensitive skin could find this shaver a bit irritating.</li>
            <li> now it does not hold a charge as long, dies after showing 60% ON THE GAUGE, and still seems rough.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used very expensive shavers before, and they don&#x27;t perform any better than this one.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used this shaver for 3 weeks and something broke loose inside the motor.  </li>
            <li> I never seemed to get a close shave when I left the head loose to move, so I always locked the head down</li>
            <li> My ES8077 would last for 3 or 4 shaves and if I pressed it and it slowed down, I could plug it in and continue shaving.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that took it down was that the battery</li>
            <li> I cannot simply shave down in one stroke, unless I&#x27;d like to get razor burn.</li>
            <li> I occasionally miss hairs, and it struggles with longer hairs, but it has a built in sideburns trimmer that can be used to get the longer hairs down.  </li>
            <li> (up, down - this ensures the hair will grow the same way and helps to prevent ingrown hairs)</li>
            <li> Now will only shave until battery is down to 80% (indicated), and then dies and requires recharge.</li>
            <li> and I was slow in getting around to purchasing this new one from Amazon.</li>
            <li> (The cutting head comes off easily to let it dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got this to replace the Panasonic I previously had for over 10 years that finally gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li> Works as stated in wet or dry conditions.</li>
            <li> Wet or dry.</li>
            <li> So, then I got this Panasonic ES-RT51 which looked similar to my previous Panasonics.  </li>
            <li> and then it will suddenly stop working half way through the shave.  </li>
            <li> I like to the fact that you can dry or wet shave.</li>
            <li> Actually this is a replacement for my previous Panasonic.</li>
            <li> In the past I have always used a rotary shaver and have only tried this style of shaver once although a different brand than this.  </li>
            <li> Wet Dry</li>
            <li> Can use wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It is advertised to be a wet or dry shaver</li>
            <li> Not sure how it would work on men&#x27;s facial hair but definitely not a choice buy with women&#x27;s hair removal.</li>
            <li> I can use it  for dry or wet shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Due to slower speed - 10,000 cycles per second - this shave is not comparable with other faster Panasonic shavers (13,000 or 14,000 cps) that I have owned.  </li>
            <li> Turns out this thing doesn&#x27;t shave half as well as a $20 norelco (the model I was using earlier).</li>
            <li> can use wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Since it takes me longer to shave, I get less than some reviewers â€” about 6 shaves on a charge while traveling (at home its constantly plugged into the charger).</li>
            <li> Works wet or dry.</li>
            <li> The previous was also a Panasonic, this is what brought me back to this brand.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s different for everyone, but if you haven&#x27;t tried it, I recommend a sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my rotary shaver, the Panasonic is slightly louder in volume.  </li>
            <li> Works well wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It is wet and dry razor.</li>
            <li> Panasonic shaves quite close for wet shaves but not as close for dry shaves.</li>
            <li> Previous shaver was a Remmington with similar design.</li>
            <li> Wet or dry</li>
            <li> Does not make a difference wet or dry use, it just doesn&#x27;t cut.</li>
            <li> I used this razor (dry), may vary using the wet method.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this to anyone seeking a razor that works either dry or wet.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not realistic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this razor on a dry face (dry), in a shower (wet), and using shaving cream (wet).</li>
            <li> I have shaved with it dry and wet.</li>
            <li> This one was so close to the last one &amp; it was about $40.00 less.</li>
            <li> The Norelco has a lot of trouble with the long stuff, but excels at the short stuff.  </li>
            <li> It works well dry and wet</li>
            <li> Tried wet and dry for 3 weeks per the instructions.</li>
            <li> It is a substantial improvement over what I have used for years, plus it can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> it says wet / dry</li>
            <li> I had other electric razor in the past (long ago) only to end up throwing them in the trash dur to not shaving me close enough.</li>
            <li> Whether we used it wet or dry, it was very hard to get anything like a real shave.  </li>
            <li> The only slightly negative is that the battery does not last that long.</li>
            <li> Battery life is not as long as other shavers, but the battery power indicator will never leave you guessing.</li>
            <li> As other reviews state will not cut longer whiskers or Grey hair either.</li>
            <li> Time will tell how long the foil and blades stay sharp.</li>
            <li> Now, after a few months on new batteries, they died rather quickly a few days ago, so I&#x27;m suspecting another battery death is imminent.</li>
            <li> This is at least my 4th Panasonic wet/dry razor, they are very durable &amp; this model charges in about 30 min or less.</li>
            <li> the other hand, the Panasonic&#x27;s shaving acumen is about the same as the Braun while slightly less than the Norelco&#x27;s regardless of whether I shave wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It Will only work on soft fuzz and it is afraid of a real beard, Not worth the money I spent.</li>
            <li> I do not have a heavy or coarse beard and this gives me a close shave whether I use it dry or wet.</li>
            <li> l used other brands in the past, and so far this one has exceeded m y expectations.. even under wet conditions.</li>
            <li> Works quietly and smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;A little disapointed from the knife in the side.</li>
            <li> Vibration is a little too big!</li>
            <li> I realize all I need to do is plug in the razor again, but the battery should last a little longer than 3 shaves  * the \\&quot;sock\\&quot; type razor case.  </li>
            <li> I suppose this is understandable as the combs on the cutting head are unidirectional, but the number of passes it takes to get a clean shave is excessive and frequently resulted in shaver burn when shaving dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is just a little bit bigger then what I expected.</li>
            <li> I did not know how dull my old razor was (another Panasonic) until i started using this one.</li>
            <li> For the last year or so, I shaved less of my face due to growing a beard, so have not purchased foil or blades.</li>
            <li> I suspect that the tiny holes in the Panasonic head are slightly larger than those of the Braun head because pressing the Panasonic hard against my skin produces the slightest burning sensation.</li>
            <li> Definitely WAY better than buying the stupid underpowered pink razors they market to women.</li>
            <li> like after ordinary manual shaver(s).&lt;br /&gt;The only one question I have - how long blades will stay incisive.&lt;br /&gt;Time</li>
            <li> They do not last long , not more than 2 years.</li>
            <li> This unit was a replacement for a more expensive Panasonic shaver (ES8075) I had for at least 6 years.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the shaving head bends side-to-side but not front to back.</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is that the battery indicator has been indicating 0% for the last 6 days but it still kept shaving like it was fully charged.  </li>
            <li> it also works on wet skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> rough to use there.  </li>
            <li> like you&#x27;re just moving shave cream around and not really shaving - until you run your hand over the finished process.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as I expected this was a replacement for the one I had.</li>
            <li> been dealing with norelcos with the 3 round blades and like them, this probably is similar in the cut.</li>
            <li> but I forgot about it a few times and left it charging overnight,</li>
            <li> I tried using it in a wet shave with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I like the wet shaving option.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all levels of Panasonic shavers over the last few years.  </li>
            <li> I use it wet with shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> Amazons website indicates that returns cannot be expected beyond June 2014.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic doesnâ€™t miss anything if you use it carefully.</li>
            <li> , I just have to be careful to charge it when it tells me to.</li>
            <li> There is no irritation or razor burn unlike wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Shaves well, but it has some drag to it.</li>
            <li> The men&#x27;s shaver is also bulkier than the woman&#x27;s shaver, making it harder to maneuver.</li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer can be useful, but it&#x27;s also at a weird angle when shaving pubic hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s got a heavy solid heft to it--feels quality and doesn&#x27;t vibrate your hand the way</li>
            <li> Received the device back and now the battery is dead again after one charge.</li>
            <li> I used it for wet shaving and was amazed.  </li>
            <li> Never would I have expected this product to perform so well.  </li>
            <li> Ladies electric razors are such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t used a wet shaver before (as I had not)</li>
            <li> Now it only holds a few days of charge on the battery.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver as a surprise Christmas gift (meaning I hadn&#x27;t picked it out or even expected to get one).</li>
            <li> not shave closed</li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t comment on wet use.</li>
            <li> I did read that it didn&#x27;t give a close shave unless you spent alot of time with it.</li>
            <li> But what I found out is if I am going to go wet</li>
            <li> These negatives though are offset when using as a wet shaver as the unit gives a closer shave when using wet.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, I received faster than expected.</li>
            <li> What I have not done is used a wet electric shaver before.</li>
            <li> I emailed the repair / replacement center in Texas 3 times.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t try it wet or with cream, yet.  </li>
            <li> , it suddenly goes to 0% and is dead.</li>
            <li> a wet shave</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t shave as I close as I expected, but</li>
            <li> I like the wet feature.</li>
            <li> But the recharge time is also short, from fully dead to fully charged in about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why there&#x27;s so much empty space in the shaving head.</li>
            <li> found that going a bit slower and using the shaver when wet helped.</li>
            <li> like I expected from a Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> Once I tried this razor with a wet shave, I was hooked.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;ll attempt the \\&quot;wet shaving\\&quot; process, although that seems counter-intuitive.</li>
            <li> I can actually shave everyday again which hasn&#x27;t happened in 3 years.</li>
            <li> have not used it as wet shaver yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of using an electric razor wet.</li>
            <li> Since rechargeable batteries have a finite lifespan, I accepted this as basically the cost of wet shaving with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> My shaver will state that it has 80% battery left, but when I turn it on, the shaver goes dead and flashes 0%.</li>
            <li> It is also can be used as wet shaver.</li>
            <li> but it is not very quite.</li>
            <li> The Mach 3/4/5, whatever they are now, is tremendously faster, very messy, and tough for me to use in a shower with no mirror.  </li>
            <li> I thought that by bidding on this product get a good shave my beard as it would be as shown in the publication, but it is not, is very poor when shaving leaves me lots of hair uncut.</li>
            <li> I had a very old dry electric shaver before this one that I used at most once a month because it was just miserable.  </li>
            <li> I have to shave daily in order to keep stubble length in the range that is comfortable for this unit, but I&#x27;m not sure that is such a bad thing.</li>
            <li> Trimmer blade is a little rough when he goes too long</li>
            <li> Description did not say anything about the charging stand, and I was a little surprised when there was none in the box, just s small plug-in charger.</li>
            <li> You have to finish charging before using it-- perhaps for safety due to the wet shaving feature.</li>
            <li> The battery charge indicator is not very useful.  </li>
            <li> The previous Panasonic foil shaver battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long</li>
            <li> It takes ten minutes and numerous repetitions and , still, the shave is not good.</li>
            <li> Little rough when dry</li>
            <li> but when I first turned it on after charging the battery to 100%, I could tell that this is a very weak shaver.  </li>
            <li> Changing the battery proved to be difficult, so I just bought a new razor (same model).</li>
            <li> my only complaint, and it&#x27;s a very minor one, is that you can&#x27;t use it with the charger plugged in, but that&#x27;s probably because it&#x27;s a wet/dry, so they don&#x27;t want you to get electrocuted.</li>
            <li> THIS UNIT IS VERY QUIET AND VERY LITTLE VIBRATION.  </li>
            <li> hair that lays flat on my neck if too long is hard to get.</li>
            <li> We have gotten Panasonic wet dry shavers brand for quite a few years.  </li>
            <li> I purchased 2, for both of my sons because of the ratings, unfortunately the ratings were not accurate, my sons have thick facial hair, and it really takes a long time to remove the hair,  than to just shave with a manual shaver, also its not a very close shave either, and it does leave some slight facial rash, for a day or 2.</li>
            <li> After not having much luck with a rotary Philishave (broke and gave me a bad rash) and not wanting to break the bank either on any specific shaver as such, I decided on this linear Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> Chart claims this, and all other panasonic models are lithium ion powered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Panasonic shaver for more than a decade, and I&#x27;m disappointed to see they come up w/ something like this.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see me using any other method now</li>
            <li> the blades came sharp and it does cut through my beard effortlessly.</li>
            <li> No knicks, scrapes or other embarassing mishaps with a razor.</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve used several brands of electric shavers:  Sunbeam, Remington, Norelco, and Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I could not be more disappointed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The replacement blades and foil are expensive and together cost almost as much as the shaver itself!</li>
            <li> I have checked the shaver heads and they appear to be sharp, but they do not provide a close shave.  </li>
            <li> The other 2 are still running, but needed foils at about $30 each.</li>
            <li> The other&#x27;s switch does not respond (does not turn on).</li>
            <li> I did try other brands like Norelco product (Philips and others).</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband while deployed, since he dropped and shattered his other into about 7 or 8 pieces...</li>
            <li> There are corresponding buttons on the other side of the shaver&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> Even the long hair trimmer could not remove a few millimetres of stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other comparison is with disposable razor shaving.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t charge this thing but every other week.  </li>
            <li> In case you are wondering, the charger, and other components are NOT interchangeable between models!&lt;br</li>
            <li> If in a hurry, I use a Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razor, but need to switch to an electric shaver due to sensitivity issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im unsure about the cut because dont have any other electr to compare</li>
            <li> so if you do a few long shaves..</li>
            <li> Compared to other shavers, quieter and almost no vibrations.</li>
            <li> that any of the other ones i have used.  </li>
            <li> so there is no need to spend hundreds on Panasonic&#x27;s other models.</li>
            <li> I just need to figure out what to do with all the other shavers that are collecting dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Ive owned 2 other circular shavers in between to try them out</li>
            <li> And replacement foils and blades are cheaper than the other brands.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money!</li>
            <li> i have put it away with the other junk i have accumulated.</li>
            <li> COMPARED TO OTHER PANASONIC LINEAR RAZORS THAT i&#x27;VE OWNED, THE MOTOR RPM ON THIS SHAVER</li>
            <li> Well, It does the job, Nothing extra ordinary about it.</li>
            <li> I mean, if they can produce and price a complete razor for less than $50, why is the foil and blade set over $35?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend this razor, and for the price, it&#x27;s tough to turn down.  </li>
            <li> That being said, it&#x27;s really no big deal, it is still firm, with what I would call a little \\&quot;flex\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> But lately, the Braun has been letting me down in quality (not holding a charge very long, screens not lasting, etc).</li>
            <li> Before I started using Panasonic I had tried various other electrical razors and hated most of them.  </li>
            <li> He has a bad neck and this is easy for him to shave with</li>
            <li> have used many electric shavers, and this is by far the worst.  </li>
            <li> I used mainly Remington and Norelco shavers for the previous 8 years and was not happy with any of those shavers at any time.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have spent the extra money for a 5 or at the least 4 blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It provided average cutting capability, but left certain areas around the neck/ear area slightly longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I have noticed less irritation when using this shaver, especially around my mouth and neck, it was fairly difficult and time consuming to complete a shave.  </li>
            <li> Hereâ€™s the low-down on Panasonic conventional vs linear motors.  </li>
            <li> At this rate of deterioration, I&#x27;ll be back to using the old Braun I replaced with this piece of Chicom Crap when the old Panasonic ES3041 died!</li>
            <li> you want an electric shaver that will last a long time and can knock down the toughest of beards, mow down a redwood forest of face hair: BUY THIS little monster!!!</li>
            <li> It is hard for this machine to cut the hairs properly since they are so angled.</li>
            <li> only negative I&#x27;ve noticed is that, if I let the charge indicator dip below 80%, the fall-off in performance is noticeable.</li>
            <li> The battery meter is now nearly useless also, going from 60% straight to 0%.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;d prefer 10% increments, but at least a &amp;#34;plug&amp;#34; icon starts blinking when the device needs a recharge.</li>
            <li> mediocre product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Not worth my money ....</li>
            <li> I have to rate that as supreme customer service and it garners at least an extra star.  </li>
            <li> Because of this, I was forced to go back to a electric</li>
            <li> Not as irritating as the old electrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I just get it wet, put a drop of dish soap on the cutter, run it for a few seconds and rinse it off.</li>
            <li> It always leaves some unless you press hard enough to the point of giving a slight irritation to your skin.</li>
            <li> Only downfall is that it slowly works less as well as the battery dies.</li>
            <li> The display goes down in 20% increments.  </li>
            <li> After two uses, it goes down by 20%.  </li>
            <li> I do wait for the indicator to get down to about 20 - 40 %...</li>
            <li> I do think that the charging port should have a cover though, since water can sometimes run down to that area.</li>
            <li> razor has one down side.</li>
            <li> it was money down the drain.  </li>
            <li> Down graded to three stars...</li>
            <li> Down to three shaves per charge, maybe.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or a tough bread or anything, so i have no special needs from a shaver.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend on the other hand loves it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too cheap to buy a $200-300 shaver, but was sick of manually shaving all the time.  </li>
            <li> So I must be crazy right?  </li>
            <li> have used Braun and Remington in past - always dry shaved.  </li>
            <li> Down to less than 5 days of shaving</li>
            <li> However, within about two months, the quality of the shave deteriorated badly, even though I was keeping it clean.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to roll in with half a beard.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to take all the paraphernalia required for the blade through airport security (one quart plastic bags, 1 oz or less etc.).</li>
            <li> Takes less than a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the Panasonic, I shave in about half the time I used to take with the Braunand</li>
            <li> The Panasonic also costs significantly less than</li>
            <li> I owned the previous version of this shaver and after 4 years, the battery life would drain after 4 shaves and the blades were in dire need of replacement along with the foil.  </li>
            <li> This will do about half that.  </li>
            <li> previous razor was a Braun.  </li>
            <li> The wider head, meant less passes on my face and allowed for a faster shave.</li>
            <li> My previous electric shaver was an old-old Remington three-screen.  </li>
            <li> They lasted about 30 months which is considerably less than a person</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll also notice in the promotional image that there&#x27;s two black buttons on the side of the head.</li>
            <li> Even with it plugged in for several hours, I could only get a faint hum and no blade movement.</li>
            <li> Even with it plugged in for several hours, I could only get a faint hum and no blade movement.</li>
            <li> I shave 7 days a week and it recharges in less than an hour.</li>
            <li> less than an hour&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used less than a year</li>
            <li> My main complaint with it is that it is awkwardly located, making really accurate cuts somewhat difficult.  </li>
            <li> I bought this about a year and a half ago, a replacement for a still-functioning Norelco, which I had used for 15 years.  </li>
            <li> the flip up trimmer is narrower and less convenient to use than Braun&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It stopped working in less than 1 year</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;er looking for perfection, less time consuming, and a closer shave, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> A black pouch holds the razor, but you can force the charging unit in with the razor.</li>
            <li> My previous razor was a Wahl.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if it had the self cleaning and lockable head feature as the  previous version.  </li>
            <li> Mostly bought Norelco Shavers, the last shaver I had was a Remington (it was the worst of the bunch)</li>
            <li> Previously, I have owned shavers made by Braun and Norelco.</li>
            <li> Not true for the ES-RT51</li>
            <li> No opportunity to shop around for price, as my visits are usually a couple of days and he is in a remote area.  </li>
            <li> I have shaved with a blade for 40 years without complaint, other than time spent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even a little quieter than my previous model.</li>
            <li> Too bulky to get into tight places like under my nose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;CONS: doesn&#x27;t get into tight places</li>
            <li> /&gt;CONS: doesn&#x27;t get into tight places well.</li>
            <li> I reinserted them tightly and reassembled it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what&#x27;s wrong with the new generation of Remington.  </li>
            <li> however now I have to find time to send back and continue to shave while my shaver is gone... not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Two things I know about Panny shavers: (1) they are good and (2) they are expensive.</li>
            <li> Strikes me as a bit expensive in the long run, considering how basic</li>
            <li> little maintenance and holds a charge for at leat 4 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;I would reccomend this Panasonic Razor to a friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor a little over two years.  </li>
            <li> No more razor burn, no more constant disposable razors, no more shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver a little over a month</li>
            <li> http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JS5C/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o02_s00_i02, which makes it a little easier.</li>
            <li> but maybe Panasonic quality control slipped a little.</li>
            <li> I splash on a little Williams Lectric Shave after my shower, then shave for 3-4 minutes max.</li>
            <li> No complaints about this little Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I get concerned about water getting into little nooks and crannies and getting moldy, but after a month this hasn&#x27;t happened.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its capacity is indicated in 20% increments on a little LCD panel on the front, and it took a couple shaves to even reach 80%.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve had this shaver for a little over a year now.  </li>
            <li> There is a cloth pouch for storage not suitable for use after a wet shave.</li>
            <li> Little bulky.</li>
            <li> NOT EXCITED ABOUT IT.</li>
            <li> When the blades and head wear out, the shaver also picks up a little noise.  </li>
            <li> His other one died &amp; he didn&#x27;t want to pay a small fortune to replace it.  </li>
            <li> gave me little hope for an affordable electric shaver...</li>
            <li> I have used Panasonic wet dry shavers for decades and just in the last few years and last few shavers have I been disappointed.</li>
            <li> ordered this because my skin gets easily irritated from regular razor; my neck was the worst, so I figured switching to an electric razor might do the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few other points are that the pivoting mechanism is really useless and the blades and insides are difficult to clean with a brush as I am used to cleaning this way.  </li>
            <li> However it has a tough time at reaching the hairs below the jaw line on the neck and takes extra time to do so.</li>
            <li> My beard is so tough that i have to use both an electric and a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> One year of use and battery life is down to just 2 shaves!</li>
            <li> but this Panasonic beat&#x27;s my Braun hands down!</li>
            <li> No worries, if you forget to charge and it dies on you a few minute charge from a car inverter will get you a couple minutes of shaving</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few shaves here is my verdict.</li>
            <li> I got tired of using a regular razor and decided to try an electric.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> My trouble spots are under the jaw and neck</li>
            <li> Even after charging to 100%, it goes completely dead after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li> Way too much trouble and expense buying those washer cartridges.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver a few times a week for a year now</li>
            <li> Until now, I just kept buying that expensive brand at his local Drug Store when I was visiting him and discovered the old one broken.  </li>
            <li> When I cut the razor on, it is dead.</li>
            <li> 5 months of use and the battery is dead.  </li>
            <li> I got two weeks out of a charge and it wasn&#x27;t yet dead when I recharged it.</li>
            <li> , this shaver conked out a few months ago, despite infrequent usage.</li>
            <li> or it did burn a few places on my lower neck and</li>
            <li> It feels too narrow and flimsy to be of any use.</li>
            <li> I meticulously cleaned it, replaced the foil and cutter, etc., and it still died in predictable fashion after 25 months.  </li>
            <li> The shaver power level reads 60% and goes completely dead.</li>
            <li> The one thing I do not enjoy about this</li>
            <li> The instructions with the razor states it will take a few weeks for your beard to get adjusted to the razor.</li>
            <li> He says it works well for everyday shaving once a close has be achieved.  </li>
            <li> Nice looking shaver but terrible performance.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone with a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> I am on the phone with Panasonic now for warranty repair after 11 months because the charge goes to 40% and then totally dead.  </li>
            <li> Husband loves it, he has used quite a few razors but enjoyes this one</li>
            <li> If you let your beard grow for over a week, you may have to use the trimmer to reduce the size of some hairs that are missed after a few strokes in order to shave it off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like to shave wet at least once a week to rinse the razor afterwards.</li>
            <li> have a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;02/11/2014: After about a year of everyday use, I have to downgrade my rating to 2 stars.  </li>
            <li> A few days ago I got the  Panasonic ES-RT51-S wet/dry rechargeable shaver.</li>
            <li> I had an old Remington radial shaver that I&#x27;ve had for years and the battery started to fail.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take but a few shaves to get used to it</li>
            <li> I was in Arizona  a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> i have used it few times with same poor result.</li>
            <li> over the past 4 years...or so..never let me down..</li>
            <li> It usually takes 10 minutes for a close shave, which ends up draining the battery down to 60 or 40%</li>
            <li> I was leery about ordering this item at first because of the bad luck I have had with other electric/rechargeable shavers I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have shaved with a blade in the past and would have to say that this is just as close with less the hassle as was my Wahl shaver.</li>
            <li> No more noisy cleaner/charger to mess around with.</li>
            <li> recently purchased this model to replace a dead 82xx model, and found that it is equal in shave quality to the very expensive Panasonic models with all the self-cleaning jazz.</li>
            <li> @ 60% the motor does slow down a little (just a tad but noticeable).</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m confused as to how the fine clipper portion works since it seems to bend back to being closed in the direction that it will shave your hair (very annoying).</li>
            <li> Cutting system is high quality and holds&lt;br /&gt;its edges.</li>
            <li> When dry shaving (w/ powder), I have to go over an area at least 5-7 times to cut just two strands!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8068N was a wet / dry shaver and it was expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have had two  less expensive and earlier models of this razor.  </li>
            <li> I rinse off the head afterward with cold water, dry off, and put back in the supplied cloth pouch.</li>
            <li> Unable to get a close shave using it either wet or dry.</li>
            <li> and it got wet inside, not good for a WET/DRY product</li>
            <li> It has worked well although I have to supplement with a blade razor to get to a few small areas on my face that the electric can&#x27;t reach.  </li>
            <li> it works well to cut facial hair which is all I use it for, but the battery life seems shorter than other electrics, and I don&#x27;t like how hard it is to see what I&#x27;m cutting due to the clunkiness of these type of razors.</li>
            <li> Furthermore , all those passes leaves your face feeling raw.</li>
            <li> I have to go over and over it, and my face ends up getting raw...</li>
            <li> Very tight and may tear the pouch,  eventually.</li>
            <li> The only real big con, the pop-up trimmer is REALLY REALLY BAD.</li>
            <li> But the Norelco seemed to be in slow motion, as far as the blade, and it grabbed a lot, along with a weird charging instruction.  </li>
            <li> I am no Grizzly Adams--I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair but what i do have is stiff and sometimes difficult to clip.  </li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t been disappointed with the dry shaving process.</li>
            <li> Uneven, not close enough and very irritating.</li>
            <li> have very dark, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> usually have to shave and then take a razor to finish.</li>
            <li> Bought this a while back, I was uncomfortable for the money I was dishing out at the time for it</li>
            <li> Of course can&#x27;t get a refund since its past the 30 days.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all I need to know; with a heavy beard!  </li>
            <li> No more buying cleaning solution over and over.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor for the past 15</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I gave up on that</li>
            <li> Not sure where the issue is</li>
            <li> but this has started within the past 3 months.</li>
            <li> Thus we will be cutting the cord on the old Panasonic charger and soldering it into the Sanyo charger.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure if its just my face</li>
            <li> At 40%, I found it pointless to continue.</li>
            <li> My beard is not too heavy or thick.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed that this current electric shavers gives closer shaves than electric shavers from years past.</li>
            <li> Eventually I got lazy and shaved maybe a couple of times a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually shave with a disposable razor in the shower.</li>
            <li> No more cut.</li>
            <li> I would say it is not perfect but darn close especially for the price.</li>
            <li> A small detail, but no reason not to mention it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use the beard trimmer on it, then shave that spot like usual.</li>
            <li> I usually still have 60% showing when I recharge after 7 days.</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic I have had in the last 8 years, and I have never been disappointed by either machine.</li>
            <li> He usually uses a razor and still feels stubbles.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;It failed after only 8 months</li>
            <li> I had a Braun for the past 10 years.  </li>
            <li> If I wait 2-3 days to shave there is no more pain.</li>
            <li> The storage or travel bag is a simple cheesy cloth sack with drawstrings.</li>
            <li> &gt; No more thoughts</li>
            <li> not then they sent me the wrong razor with only two heads!!!</li>
            <li> He had one in the past, for a couple of years</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, both of these failed in the same way after about a year or two, where the battery indicated fully charged</li>
            <li> This shaver was no better than one I purchased 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> I have owned 2 Panasonic and 3 Norelco shavers over the past 43 years.  </li>
            <li> I usually shave with a disposable razor in the shower, and using gel shaving foam</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t this shaver is no better or worse  than any other.</li>
            <li> considering I shave every day and have a very heavy beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We purchased this shaver at the end of April, 2014, for my husband who has a VERY HEAVY beard.  </li>
            <li> It was whisper quiet and the shaving quality was very poor.  </li>
            <li> second problem is what&#x27;s really annoying, starting a couple months ago.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco rotary razors for decades and I have been displeased with the life of the cutting heads in the last few years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed, but can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m surprised because it IS a men&#x27;s razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Previously, I also purchased the cleaning system which was unnecessary</li>
            <li> it is big, heavy and very uncomfortable in use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very frustrating that it takes so long for a shave.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve got to buy a new razor because this one is useless, needless to say, it won&#x27;t be a Panasonic.</li>
            <li> But one can hardly find them anymore.</li>
            <li> If there is a decline in shaving head rpms at 20% charge, it is hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> some spots are even hard to reach.</li>
            <li> That would indicate perfection, and I&#x27;m a hard</li>
            <li> It was hard to get him to try it</li>
            <li> Manufacturer says need to press hard and still doesn&#x27;t cut.</li>
            <li> But for the price, it is hard to complain.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hardly an expert of electric shavers.</li>
            <li> so it sometimes doesn&#x27;t grab the hard to reach stuff</li>
            <li> Previously, with other products, I hated a daily shave--cuts, etc--</li>
            <li> Too bad I had already disposed of my old shaver...</li>
            <li> This thing sucks stick with norelco.</li>
            <li> Although it will still vibrate, it does not put enough force on the cutting bar and it will just remain motionless.  </li>
            <li> (Review is a year late</li>
            <li> The cutting edge can only make slow progress without binding.</li>
            <li> Nothing negative can be said about it.</li>
            <li> Web page confusing.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaves just as close as my late Braun and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
            <li> I reject some of the negative reviews of some people who say it missed hairs.</li>
            <li> but I never really liked the shave it provides.  </li>
            <li> but i end up with annoying hairs that just no matter how much i try to get them , they stay in place.</li>
            <li> No matter what the box or the instructions say, if you have a thick beard, this razor will not give you a close shave.</li>
            <li> but you have to shave slow and it takes up a lot of time to shave</li>
            <li> SEEMS REALLY SLOW.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m shopping Norelcos in anticipation of another failure.  </li>
            <li> (my shower borders my neighbor&#x27;s wall, and I HATE that they can normally hear my shave.  </li>
            <li> We regret that in our disappointment in this product, which we intended to be a life enhancing gift, we waited too long to return it.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I already have a multi-angle pivot for my razor, it&#x27;s called my \\&quot;wrist\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> In the month Iâ€™ve been using it, Iâ€™ve grown careless with it because it requires so much less diligence than the Braun.</li>
            <li> What I found with them was that there was no point in replacing the blades because by the time the blades were dull, the motor and batteries were too weak to bother with.</li>
            <li> it is a little weird to apply an electric razor to your face covered with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> They are all about the same which isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> not good on mustache area.  </li>
            <li> Not a good shaver.</li>
            <li> i guess im not a good prospect for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this shaver conked out a few months ago, despite infrequent usage.</li>
            <li> has been the center cutting bar mechanism.</li>
            <li> but it is not good as a razor if you can call it that.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s certainly not as good as a blade, but I&#x27;ve never had a shaver that was.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I figured I would be out a shaver for a few weeks, then get a refurb to use until that one failed.  </li>
            <li> When it went South, I bought one of the new \\&quot;slick looking&#x27; Norelco&#x27;s and it was the worst.</li>
            <li> but they gutted the motor with a whimpy weak one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I suffered through the 3 blade shavers for the past 20 years.</li>
            <li> I like the razor and it has been reliable, but the batteries are the weak link.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a shaver or know someone who is looking for one as a gift I definitely recommend this shaver you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Gets very hard to get areas.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when it didn&#x27;t even get through my one day beard wet , dry foam ,..</li>
            <li> Without exception, they have all failed after approximately two years (just past the warranty period,</li>
            <li> the Dual-blade variety is less expensive than this, but I&#x27;m unable to get a close shave with the dual blade.  </li>
            <li> He has a tough beard and if he says it close, it must be.  </li>
            <li> I am a fan of the design, the closeness of the shave on my tough beard and the ease of cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The tip-and-tilt is irrelevant, as you would never push that hard against your skin.  </li>
            <li> Razors were just too irritating and time consuming.  </li>
            <li> After replacing cutters/combs on a Norelco I&#x27;d used for two years, the quality of the replacement blades was so poor that I decided to switch to another brand.</li>
            <li> As for me, I am returning to Norelco and hoping that whatever the reason for poor quality replacement blades has been addressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also annoyed with the charging system since you have to keep it plugged in</li>
            <li> That can be frustrating at times.</li>
            <li> I was wrong, or at least for this model.  </li>
            <li> battery leaves something to be desired, but would otherwise be acceptable if not for the blades poor performance.  </li>
            <li> Another review notes that the battery life is extremely poor.</li>
            <li> The razor leaves a lot of hairs behind on the neck.</li>
            <li> I got tired of them dying as soon as the warranty expires.  </li>
            <li> The product performs poorly.</li>
            <li> the power behind the shave starts to dwindle after the 8th use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mainly bought this (2 of them) for the convenience of my 2 sons going off to college and figured I would give it a shot after their poor reviews.</li>
            <li> purchase will be from a company that stands behind</li>
            <li> The shaver has an LCD display that shows the approximate charge remaining in 20% increments.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with this shaver...i&#x27;ve always used Norelco or Remingron...</li>
            <li> Compared to my older Wahl it is awful.  </li>
            <li> The price ranges are so dramatic.  </li>
            <li> Not good!</li>
            <li> or else it will loose its charge (which is annoying since it takes up counter space).</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s little change in the way it shaves, which is BAD.  </li>
            <li> but I always hated the stubble and facial irritation</li>
            <li> Leaves lots of uncut hairs behind.</li>
            <li> I can only conclude that Panasonic have sold me a razor with faulty blades or a refurbished razor with blunt blades because the performance has been very bad</li>
            <li> less expensive\\&quot; wet/dry and have not been disappointed...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very weak.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed the return policy only lasted 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When the blades get dull after about a year, the shaving gets really bad - a lot of irritation, ingrown hair, missed patches, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that has not been my experience with this product.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, for the money and quality, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this unit.</li>
            <li> They failed to provide me with a cleaning brush with my shave.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to get the razor apart as one would expect in a waterproof razor.</li>
            <li> This is my third Panosonic and definitley the worst performing.</li>
            <li> that it now is you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> if your looking to save some money then you cant go wrong with this shaver</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong...</li>
            <li> And, with replacement shaver heads so expensive</li>
            <li> 9/8/2016 -  Battery is beginning to fail when display shows 60%.</li>
            <li> I was sad to let it go.  </li>
            <li> that the on/off switch is a push type and not a button type that on the Norelco if you held it wrong you kept turning it off.  </li>
            <li> think the units seal failed</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: After 7 months of usage, the battery failed.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with panasonic</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find anything wrong with it.  </li>
            <li> Expensive Braun shaver I gave away within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to buy any funky and expensive cleaning accessories.</li>
            <li> This item is too expensive for me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless for use as a razor travel case.    </li>
            <li> Really weird.</li>
            <li> This shaver failed in that regard.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother unless you want an expensive pretend electric razor to let your kids play with when it&#x27;s not charged.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> The foil and cutter blade are very tough and long-lasting, as Iâ€™ve come to expect from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Very poor shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s placement makes it difficult or impossible to see what you are trying to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When it was time to replace the cutting blades on my ES8103</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although you can use it in the shower, I do NOT since I&#x27;m afraid that I&#x27;d drop and break</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to bore people with crazy specs.</li>
            <li> Got this for my father inlaw as he was cutting himself with disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> It vibrates like crazy and cut my skin.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I can&#x27;t recommend the Panasonic ES-RT51!</li>
            <li> And not too expensive!</li>
            <li> Very frustrating!</li>
            <li> It has a cord to recharge instead of an idiotic stand.</li>
            <li> Not too bad</li>
            <li> My husband has always had bad luck with electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> Bad choice.  </li>
            <li> bad Shaver i need also to use Razor to finishing %100</li>
            <li> I have always used electric shavers since blades give me bad razor burns.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This wouldn&#x27;t be bad if it were a corded/cordless model because I could just plug it in and keep going.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t expect help from Panasonic if it goes bad.  </li>
            <li> But hey... maybe I just got a bad egg.</li>
            <li> I called Panasonic and they in formed me that it was a bad battery and</li>
            <li> After 5 minutes I get frustrated and either pick up a razor or use my husbands</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m very disappointed and will be purchasing another brand from now on.  </li>
            <li> Terrible for shaving, was unable to get a close shave at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been disappointed by the closeness of electric shavers</li>
            <li> Sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I am disappointed with how close it shaves.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my son and he can now shave without cutting his face up!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in both Panasonic and foil razors.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed</li>
            <li> Thoroughly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and we were disappointed to find that it doesn&#x27;t work at all... on any type of hair.</li>
            <li> Was somewhat disappointed in the charging.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing on sideburns or longer hairs even with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing razor.</li>
            <li> I hate them for the irritation they can dole out as the blades heat up under the screens.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s probably because you already know that remington and norelco are worthless.</li>
            <li> For years I hate shaving, I&#x27;ve tried Gillet, Norelco and one of the battery operated hand razors.</li>
            <li> I had a Remington F5790 and this piece of crap doesn&#x27;t come close to it&#x27;s shave.</li>
            <li> Ever since Panasonic stopped making their shavers in Japan and went over to China the quality has become crap.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving so this is a boon.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and it was still - awful.</li>
            <li> This razor does a terrible job.</li>
            <li> Shavers that are for women are horrible!!!  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!  </li>
            <li> FACE LOOKS AWFUL.</li>
            <li> One night while in use, it made a terrible noise.</li>
            <li> Quality of shave and blade sharpness has gotten terrible.</li>
            <li> Battery life is terrible.  </li>
            <li> but the pop out trim razor works horrible</li>
            <li> Norelco has cheapened their products terribly over time.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

            <li> I had a prior version that lasted 5 years.  Doesn&#x27;t sound like a long time but that is daily use and original battery.  New battery and screen cost more than this new razor which has a lithium battery vs the old nicad so I upgraded.  Still same great shave.  Not as close as a blade but as close as you can get from an electric. Pretty close to a blade if you do it wet or in shower.  Like all others, the cord only charges it but won&#x27;t run it.  So if you shave in the car like me make sure you charge it.  I can take a nice leisurely shave on my drive in and it still registers 80% charge.  No worries, if you forget to charge and it dies on you a few minute charge from a car inverter will get you a couple minutes of shaving so you don&#x27;t have to roll in with half a beard.  I&#x27;ve owned all the major brands and you cannot beat the Panasonic and price was never a concern for me so it was strictly a functional evaluation.  If you need to show off a $250 razor to your friends you&#x27;ll just have to settle for a subpar shave vs this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this model razor for about 10 years and it is fantastic!  Great shave, and great quality.  You just can&#x27;t beat Panasonic&#x27;s razors.</li>
            <li> Chart claims this, and all other panasonic models are lithium ion powered. I just received mine and the manual says nickle metal hydride powered.  On looking further into the reviews, there are many complaints of getting less and less shaves as time passes.  I may have to return this! UPDATE: One year of use and battery life is down to just 2 shaves!</li>
            <li> amazon the pest good  item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Panasonic shaver for more than a decade, and I&#x27;m disappointed to see they come up w/ something like this. The performance is simply not there as expected. I will definitely consider returning it.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver is the only electric shaver I have used that I liked.  When the battery died in my old one after MANY years of use, I didn&#x27;t consider any other brand but Panasonic.  I was not disappointed.  Best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used or will use.</li>
            <li> Got this to replace the Panasonic I previously had for over 10 years that finally gave up the ghost. Not only did it arrive quickly and BEFORE the promised date, it also has exceeded my expectations. Shaves smoothly wet or dry and doesn&#x27;t irritate my somewhat sensitive skin. It&#x27;s also quiet and easy to clean &amp; maintain, and cost lots less than the highly advertised top brands..  Love it!</li>
            <li> i love the panasonic brand and have found them to be the best for my sensitive skin. my old wet/dry shaver had just died. as i was looking for one similar i came across this one. the price was very reasonable and the product had great reviews. i purchased it and when i got it i usede it that night after it was charged. i know the product says give it a couple weeks for your skin to get used to it, but i saw immediate results. very close shave and leaves my skin smooth. very easy to clean . 5 stars for this one.</li>
            <li> good quality for the price just you d&#x27;ont have a stand when you charge the shaver I think is a good pirchase</li>
            <li> it is ok if it was half the money that they are charging,i wouldn&#x27;t buy it again for this much money.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor as a back-up to my Braun and I realy love it. It gives a close, but comfortable shave wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;Very little maintenance and holds a charge for at leat 4 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;I would reccomend this Panasonic Razor to a friend. It&#x27;s worth the money, and actually shaves better than my Braun.</li>
            <li> I been use in it for 18 months now and still work perfect.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I have ever had. Works great wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a couple weeks, but it&#x27;s been great so far. I had a credit for amazon for $20 off so the price was right! Great shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> I already have one of these razors and it needed to be repaired so I ordered another while waiting for it to be repaired.  It has given me the closest shave of any wet-dry razor.</li>
            <li> This shaver works well considering its price. It is easy to clean. The only slightly negative is that the battery does not last that long. About a week for normal shaving. So if you are traveling for more than a week, you will need to bring the charger cable, which is somewhat bulky. The battery charges very quickly though.</li>
            <li> definitely better than other electric razors of past years.</li>
            <li> I have always owned Panasonic wed dry shavers because the wet dry&#x27;s are the easiest to clean. This one is quite and simple.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just received my razor yesterday. I cannot improve on the hundreds of other positive reviews here, but I just want to do a shout out to Panasonic for manufacturing a GREAT wet dry razor. Easy set up, quick charge, close shave. Great product, great delivery service from Amazon. Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> My husband had to use an electric raiser because he started on Coumadin.  He absolutely loves this raiser.  He can grow a full beard in a week and he can shave 2 times a day.  He questioned if he would find a shaver that would work for him.  He said this is great.  Loves that you can put it in water.  Loves the shave - close and smooth.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t been using an electric shave in ages. So I wanted to (re)start with something not too fancy.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver does the job. I get about 5 shaves with a full charge. I like that it also works on wet skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a better experience shaving on wet skin than on dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it&#x27;s fairly easy to clean after shaving. The one thing that I don&#x27;t like is that you can&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;use it while you&#x27;re recharging the batteries.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend and he loves it. Great razor for the money. Shipped on time when it said it would. .</li>
            <li> Arrived very fast and was well packed. Replaced my Braun after I used it for 10 years. I&#x27;ve owned Norelco, Braun, Remington shavers over the years. All were quality except the Remington. None were cheap except the Remington. All shaved only OK. I use a blade at home and get clean shaves. When I am on the road (about a total of 4-5 weeks a year) I use an electric. I don&#x27;t like to take all the paraphernalia required for the blade through airport security (one quart plastic bags, 1 oz or less etc.). I&#x27;ve learned to live with the sub standard shaves on the road.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the shaver review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be very sturdy build quality. Charged it up and it took about 30 minutes to go from 20% to 100%.  That is a fast charge rate and consistent with the specs of one hour for full charge from empty. The LCD meter is easy to read in reasonable light. I shave in the shower so next morning my first shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet shaving with an electric is a different experience from a blade. I learned to shave against the grain instead of across the grain of my beard. My face and chin cleaned up nicely with this new razor. Took a while to get the neck area done as the hairs don&#x27;t follow a grain direction like my face does. However, after a few passes from different directions even that cleaned up nice and close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few shaves here is my verdict. Shaves very close and equals the blade on my face but not quite so on my neck. No razor burn. Too bulky to get into tight places like under my nose. However the trimmer does a good (if not perfect) job there and does a great job with the side burns. But this bulkiness is true with all electric razors. They just aren&#x27;t compact enough to get in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean up is a breeze, just hold it up under the water and every so often (once a week) take the head off, rinse it off while running under the water and rinse the foils under water as well. Takes less than a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the BEST ELECTRIC RAZOR I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: shaves well, easy to clean, great build quality trimmer actually works, seems to use about 10% of the charge per shave so about 9-10 days&lt;br /&gt;CONS: doesn&#x27;t get into tight places well.OR I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: shaves well, easy to clean, great build quality trimmer actually works, seems to use about 10% of the charge per shave so about 9-10 days&lt;br /&gt;CONS: doesn&#x27;t get into tight places well.</li>
            <li> over all closer shave. not good on mustache area.  rough to use there.  that&#x27;s about all i have to say</li>
            <li> I got tired of using a regular razor and decided to try an electric.  It has worked well although I have to supplement with a blade razor to get to a few small areas on my face that the electric can&#x27;t reach.  Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Works very well at giving a close clean shave. However it has a tough time at reaching the hairs below the jaw line on the neck and takes extra time to do so.</li>
            <li> I just received this shaver and found it to be the best electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had!    Some history. I&#x27;ve shaved with a Norelco rotary for years. When the last one died and considering the cost of replacement heads I went to a Braun foil. I don&#x27;t recall the model but it wasn&#x27;t the cheapest or the most expensive. I gave it a full month and it was still - awful. I had to shave for 15 minutes and still wasn&#x27;t happy, not to mention when shaving near the ears I nearly went deaf. I cleaned it up and gave it to my son.    I ordered this one based on the wet/dry capabilities. Face prep? None. I just put on some shaving cream and in two or three minutes - smooth face. I guess it depends on your beard but my neck is always a problem area but this Panasonic did the trick. Cleaning was a breeze, charging seems very quick and not deafening.    I am very pleased to say the least and actually don&#x27;t dread shaving. For someone who has never used a wet/dry shaver it&#x27;s an odd sensation at first - like you&#x27;re just moving shave cream around and not really shaving - until you run your hand over the finished process. I can&#x27;t see me using any other method now and if it endures, I&#x27;ll come back to Panasonic!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as saying this shaver is horrible, but it isn&#x27;t the best.   It gives a decent shave, but don&#x27;t expect a super clean cut!     Battery life is great!    The only real big con, the pop-up trimmer is REALLY REALLY BAD. (no exaggeration)  Not only does it not completely cut your unwanted hair,   it attacks your hair with microscopic cuts and tears and turns it fuzzy and rugged.  I doubt even the finest hair products have the ability to heal your hair after going through THAT trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is my third Panasonic Linear shaver, and it has not disappointed me yet. I do miss the \\&quot;ARC\\&quot; feature of my old shaver because it seemed to fit my face better, but I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this line of products. This one costs about half as much as the one I owned before it, but it is the closest shave I have had in the last year, hands down. Its hard to beat this product for the money, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It was for my husband and he says it does not give him a close shave</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t had a problem with this except in 1 area: the very end of my mustache near the corner of my mouth sometimes requires a second pass to get maybe 1 or 2 hairs that didn&#x27;t get cut. I&#x27;ve been using it with shaving cream for about a month and it&#x27;s an excellent shave. Very close, but you may have to make sure you got all the hairs in some problem areas. otherwise, not a single issue</li>
            <li> First one lasted me over two years. Not too bad considering I shave every day and have a very heavy beard.&lt;br /&gt;Battery held a charge well for about 18 months, then had to be recharged after every shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very good razor for a very fair price. Im sure theres better out there, but not at the price.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as I expected this was a replacement for the one I had. all was good.</li>
            <li> Great shaver.  Moved from a Norelco to this Panasonic and the difference in quality is night and day.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> excellent appliance...my second razor of same model...the first one would still be in use after many years except for my damaging one blade side piece.</li>
            <li> Purchased not one but two of them for teenage grandsons. They are very pleased - especially convenient when traveling with their sports teams</li>
            <li> My husband has always had bad luck with electric shavers.  He was so happy and I was so pleased with this one.  It gives him a nice close shave and he can handle it well, given the problems with his hands.  I would gladly get another for him...</li>
            <li> I know it says that you normally have a break in period for electric shavers, but for me there was none. This shaver worked without irritation on my face from day 1. Razors were just too irritating and time consuming.  Works as stated in wet or dry conditions. Doesn&#x27;t get as close as a razor, but it gets so close, no one will notice the difference but you, and the irritation/time it saves is worth it. I&#x27;m sure there are other shavers that have more gadgets on them that are more expensive, but I am content enough will this one to not care about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor a little over two years.  Shaving quality is decent on a light beard.  As you&#x27;d expect, as the blades become duller, more passes are required.  Does perform somewhat better on a wet shave.  Charging system leaves a lot to be desired.  Cannot be used with recharging cord plugged in.  The battery charge indicator is not very useful.  The razor will now discharge to 60 - 80% level then plummet to 0% requiring a full recharge.  Does recharge fully in about an hour.  Since there&#x27;s nothing spectacular about the shave and the power management is poor, I&#x27;m giving it a 2-star.</li>
            <li> I think this is a god razor. been dealing with norelcos with the 3 round blades and like them, this probably is similar in the cut. of course, real razors are better as I never get a close  shave, no matter how many time i go over the area. usually have to shave and then take a razor to finish. but, I feel there all the same. does have a felt bag to go with it, but you cant include the cord in it</li>
            <li> It came on a timely manner and he lover it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Terrible for shaving, was unable to get a close shave at all. Wet or dry. Very disappointing on sideburns or longer hairs even with the trimmer. Will not purchase an electric again, going back to razors.</li>
            <li> Hereâ€™s the low-down on Panasonic conventional vs linear motors.  I&#x27;ve owned at least 3 other Panasonic razors and loved them all.  They all had the high-RPM linear motor.  When it was time to replace the cutting blades on my ES8103 this razor was the same price so I figured I&#x27;d try it.  Bad choice.  The motor isn&#x27;t as strong, you have to struggle to get an equal shave, and you have to recharge it before the batteries go down below 60 percent or else there&#x27;s a noticeable reduction in power.  Stick with Panasonic but spend the extra for the one with the linear motor.</li>
            <li> Shaves close and its a great price too.</li>
            <li> shaves close without irritation.  very quiet. was shipped and received promptly.  good service</li>
            <li> Does not produce a close shave.  Does irritate the skin.  Not good!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on the overall reviews and ratings.  This razor does a terrible job. I don&#x27;t think it shaved any hair on my legs.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  At this point I am not sure if I will try a better razor. If this wouldn&#x27;t work on my legs it certainly won&#x27;t work on a man&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> Bought this a while back, I was uncomfortable for the money I was dishing out at the time for it but I sure am glad I did. No more razor burn, no more constant disposable razors, no more shaving cream. Still cuts like a beast and I plan on replacing the blades when it recommends because it&#x27;s easy and not too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says you aren&#x27;t support to keep it plugged in after it gets charged to 100% (It charges REALLY FAST) but I forgot about it a few times and left it charging overnight, still seems to hold charge reasonably long and still charges fast so I hope it stays that way.</li>
            <li> Performed above expectations would recommend product</li>
            <li> As good as an electric can work dry I suppose.  I bought this so I&#x27;d have something to keep in the car when I don&#x27;t have time to shave with a razor in the morning.</li>
            <li> after 7 years using braun iam going to try panasonic</li>
            <li> Great Deal &amp; Very Fast Shipping Thanks!</li>
            <li> Best electric I have owned. Very close shave for an electric. Very good battery life and digital readout showing remaining battery life a plus. Replaced a Remington which was not bad but this razor is much better.</li>
            <li> So far we have had over 20 different manual razors and electric razors over 5. none has helped me, but this product is perfect and I recommend all this money, plus those from Amazon I have delivered 1 day earlier</li>
            <li> Very disappointing razor. Doesnt shave either long or short hairs well - leaves me with a short stubble after every shave</li>
            <li> Great product.  Shaves well and evenly.</li>
            <li> I would describe my beard as being a bristle brush. I have used many different electric razors and few do a thorough job. In fact, if I am going out I use an electric razor and then finish up with a blade razor with shaving cream. The combination is the only way I can get a clean shave. In my review of this Panasonic ES-RT51-S you have to realize that first, any electric shaver takes time to train a beard and second, for a face to get use to it. I have just started using this Panasonic so I can only comment on the razor&#x27;s ergonomics and feel. It feels sturdy, it is a good size razor - I also use a smaller Panasonic - the blades came sharp and it does cut through my beard effortlessly. I tried using it in a wet shave with shaving cream. It was my first time and it didn&#x27;t go very well. This morning I was in a rush and I splashed some water on my beard and then used the Panasonic. It did an ok job. If I was on a date I would have had to use a blade razor with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> very smooth and comfortable , pleasing outcome, It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> well worth the money.  not as close as a blade but very good for everyday use and holds is charge.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shaver.  I bought it to shave my legs.  Shavers that are for women are horrible!!!  They don&#x27;t work.  I had just bought one recently and it didn&#x27;t cut at all!  I couldn&#x27;t find the receipt so I ended throwing it out.  This one is really great because it actually cuts and the &amp;#34;side burn trimmer&amp;#34; works great on the bikini line.  What I also love about it is that there is a digital readout that tells you how much charge you have left to go.  That is so great because that&#x27;s what died on my last shaver.  The charger no longer worked.  So with this shaver when it reaches 100% you unplug and you don&#x27;t overcharge.  LOVE IT!!  I HIGHLY recommend this shaver FOR WOMEN!!</li>
            <li> This thing just doesn&#x27;t work.  Legit will take you 5 times longer every morning.  Trimmer also is second rate.  Do yourself a favor and buy a different model!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try an electric razor and this one did not dissapoint. It is just as the advertisement claimed and it gives me a close smooth shave. I would use this seller again.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my husband and after only 2 months it quit charging. Of course can&#x27;t get a refund since its past the 30 days. Won&#x27;t buy again was a waist of money. Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> 13,000 CPM!!!  That&#x27;s all I need to know; with a heavy beard!  It&#x27;s a Panasonic which means it is a well made item designed to last a long time and work well. Three blades and some of the sharpest in the industry so I&#x27;m assured of a close quick shave to begin with...  But all the before mentioned with 13,000 CPM is the &amp;#34;sales close&amp;#34; concerning this item as 13,000 CPM makes it a member of the most powerful 1% of electric shavers on the market, it&#x27;s the Briggs and Stratton engine of electric shavers, can and will mow down the toughest beard!!!  It&#x27;s always been the CPM (or RPM if you like) that makes or breaks an electric shaver; that and the quality of the blades.  But no matter how good and sharp the blades are if you don&#x27;t have high enough CPM with a motor that can handle high CPM the blades can&#x27;t do their best job for you.  That&#x27;s what&#x27;s wrong with the new generation of Remington.  Some of the greatest blades on the market...but they gutted the motor with a whimpy weak one.  Gone are the days of the loud but mighty MS-390 that damned near could chop wood!&lt;br /&gt;If you want an electric shaver that will last a long time and can knock down the toughest of beards, mow down a redwood forest of face hair: BUY THIS little monster!!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!  It does a better job than my Braun 320-4 and with a heavy beard it was the only shaver that ever gave me a blade close shave...but this Panasonic beat&#x27;s my Braun hands down!</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic shaver.  They are good designs and priced well. The battery on this one does not last as long as my previous model.  That will only be an issue on trips greater than one week.  I will need to carry the charger for that. Regardless, I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the closest shave better get a 5 blade Razor. This gives you a close shave not even.</li>
            <li> Great !! I will definitely buy this again in future.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver which gives a nice close shave. Recharges quickly &amp; is a great value!! I recommend this shaver highly!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife to shave her legs.  She loves it.  No knicks, scrapes or other embarassing mishaps with a razor.</li>
            <li> Electric shavers are a love/hate thing with me.  I love them for weekend shaves, since women dig the Saturday evening scruff effect. I hate them for the irritation they can dole out as the blades heat up under the screens.  All of them, from the $300 Brauns to the $50 Remingtons, are best when combined with a pre-shave oil, like King of Shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic ES RT51-S is the best shaver in its class for the money, bar none.  It features a kick-ass, high RPM motor, an LCD battery gauge, and some very sharp blades with Nanotech coating that do quick work.  It flexes just enough to follow your contours, and feels great in your hand.  For the price point, it&#x27;s a home run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, you can wash the blades using a drop of liquid soap and water on the screen, turn it on for a three-count, rinse in the sink or shower, oil the screen for next time and you are done.  No more buying cleaning solution over and over.  As far as using this shaver with shave gel or foam, pre-shave oil feels best.  I doubt using it in the shower every week is the best move as far as usable life goes, but the battery will give out in due time anyway.  A more powerful motor means the  blades work faster, so I am very favorably impressed.  You should be, too.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I have ever owned and the list of shaver brands I have owned runs the gamut.  I have owned expensive shavers and cheap shavers and all those in between. This blows them all away!  On top of that, the price just rocks. Free shipping is nice too! Thank you Amazon. Keep up the great service  you have going. NO ONE CAN TOUCH THAT!!!!</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve used several brands of electric shavers:  Sunbeam, Remington, Norelco, and Panasonic.  I&#x27;ve always been disappointed by the closeness of electric shavers so I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor for the past 15+ years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now at the age when my skin has become thinner and I&#x27;ve become more prone to cuts or nicks to my face with a razor.  Because of this, I was forced to go back to a electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last two electric razors were the Norelco 3605X and the Panasonic ES8068N.  The Norelco was a rotary three-head which was durable, but never gave a very close shave and it was a pain to keep clean.  The Panasonic ES8068N was a wet / dry shaver and it was expensive.  I&#x27;m not sure why I gave up on that Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew I wanted a wet / dry shaver and Panasonic had the most models available and some of the best reviews.  The cheapest one available with the best reviews was the Panasonic ES-RT51-s.  This is what I bought and I am very pleased with it.  I don&#x27;t know if technology has improved electric shavers, but the Panasonic ES-RT51-s gives as close of a shave as a razor.  My trouble spots are under the jaw and neck so I have to spent some extra time in those areas, but the pivoting head makes it easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although you can use it in the shower, I do NOT since I&#x27;m afraid that I&#x27;d drop and break it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use it with shave creme.  My personal preference is Every Man Jack shave creme (the one that comes in a tube, not can) since it&#x27;s not foamy and it does not dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that I really like about this model is that it has a digital display to show how much charge is left in the battery.  This allows me to put away the recharging cord until necessary.  The display goes down in 20% increments.  After two uses, it goes down by 20%.  I never let the battery drain completely so I recharge it after 7-8 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is a breeze. After each use, I use liquid hand soap and rinseit off and air dry it.  Before I use it, I spray the head with a Oster Kool Lube.  This is similar to the Remington Shaver Saver, but the Oster Kool Lube is much, much cheaper.  I bought the Oster Kool Lube (14 oz) at my local Sally Beauty Supply store for $10.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the more expensive Panasonic models are worth it since the Panasonic ES-RT51-s does everything that I would expect from an expensive one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this my highest recommendation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  After two years, the razor died after water somehow entered the case and damaged the battery.  I replaced it with the Panasonic ES-SL41-s and I&#x27;ve found it to be much better than the ES-RT51-s since it&#x27;s lighter and thinner which makes it easier to handle when shaving.</li>
            <li> Quite, gives a good shave but I can get only 4 shaves before recharging it.</li>
            <li> This is the third Panasonic Shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  The first two were fantastic.  I don&#x27;t remember what the model number was of my first shaver, but it was better than any Braun or Norelco that I had ever owned.  Then I bought a Panasonic ES8077 which was even better than the first and I used it for 3 years with no problems, but it needed a new blade head and I couldn&#x27;t find one for sale anywhere.  So, then I got this Panasonic ES-RT51 which looked similar to my previous Panasonics.  I could not be more disappointed.  The battery performance is poor at best.  A full charge will only last long enough for one shave.  My ES8077 would last for 3 or 4 shaves and if I pressed it and it slowed down, I could plug it in and continue shaving.  Not true for the ES-RT51 -- it will show that I have 60% of my battery left and then it will suddenly stop working half way through the shave.  It will not work again until fully charged.  I truly cannot understand why Panasonic decided to produce such a piece of junk after it once had the best shavers on the market.  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS SHAVER.  I will be shopping for an older Panasonic shaver from when they actually produced a quality product.</li>
            <li> One of many Panasonic wet/dry shavers, which can be used in the shower. Nice feature: displays the remaining battery charge in 10% decrements. The Panasonics in this price range seem to function as well as the ones well over $100. I purchase a new one every 2-4 years when the battery ultimately fades, and have been very happy with them.</li>
            <li> I was the proud owner of a made in Japan ultrasonic wet/dry shaver that lasted pretty close to 15 years!  The only thing that took it down was that the battery finally failed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it was time to get a new Panasonic.  Times have changed.  Panasonic offers so many razors, one cannot even get their head around all of the differences.  The price ranges are so dramatic.  So, after reading extensively, reviews and information here in Amazon and the Panasonic website, I finally settled on this one. Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The ultrasonic movement that I appreciated in my original razor is \\&quot;standard\\&quot; now, and here it is for a fraction of what I paid for mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The shaving head is flat, and contains a simple blade replacement, rather than one of the more expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I don&#x27;t buy into the cleaning container with tablets idea. I took the advice of someone here and simply use softsoap after each use in the shower, then rinse it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It&#x27;s a great razor for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What don&#x27;t I like about it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, this whole, \\&quot;the head moves/pivots\\&quot; thing is a bunch of nonsense to me! Seriously, I already have a multi-angle pivot for my razor, it&#x27;s called my \\&quot;wrist\\&quot;.  So, the only thing I don&#x27;t really care for is that fact that it \\&quot;pivots\\&quot;. I wish it were simply pivotless.  That being said, it&#x27;s really no big deal, it is still firm, with what I would call a little \\&quot;flex\\&quot;. I would just prefer it without that.  The hair clipper on back works fine, and actually can be used for nose hairs, and performs better in that area that most dedicated ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, how do I use this razor?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave in the shower with shaving cream with a tri-blade standard razor first, then I follow with this. I do this because my hair is dense, yet, it grows in four directions, so I cannot simply shave down in one stroke, unless I&#x27;d like to get razor burn. So, with the face shaved mostly clean, I go along the center of my adams apple, the edge of my chin left and right, and around my mouth. This makes it nice and smooth for whomever may be feeling it, aside from me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there you go.  I don&#x27;t know why I would want anything more.</li>
            <li> As good as I expected.</li>
            <li> It does not shave very well</li>
            <li> After about 3 years of owning this razor, it just died. It no longer holds a charge, and it happened suddenly. Even after charging to 100%, it goes completely dead after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding shaving quality, it&#x27;s ok. It frequently misses spots and I have to go over the same spot many times. When the blades get dull after about a year, the shaving gets really bad - a lot of irritation, ingrown hair, missed patches, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement blades and foil are expensive and together cost almost as much as the shaver itself! If you like it, might as well just buy a new one once a year. It&#x27;ll still be cheaper than using cartridge razors .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. I just order a higher end electric razor, also a Panasonic, and hopefully it&#x27;ll be worth the investment.</li>
            <li> it is making noise like bearing is damaged.</li>
            <li> have had since Christmas so waited before making this.  Have no complaints, use it every morning and I have had to recharge once when it got to 20% (there is a window in the handle that gives you the current power percentage,)  When I received it the percentage was 20% so charged it for 2 hours and it was at 100%.  Have not used the wet part yet (other than to clean it with water, which worked nicely).  Good shaver, I have a sad history of shavers not working and this one is a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> I did not know how dull my old razor was (another Panasonic) until i started using this one. This is my fourth or fifth Panasonic. All have been great. I use them until I think the battery is about to die, then buy a new one. I like the wet shaving option. No complaints.</li>
            <li> So I used to use electric shavers way back when in high school and college because they were fast and convenient but I always hated the stubble and facial irritation so I&#x27;ve been a blade and shaving cream guy for most of my adult life.  I picked up this Panasonic on sale last month on a whim and have got to say it is much better than the electric shavers of yesteryear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Nice close smooth shave, not as good as a blade but close enough.  Waterproof means you can shave and clean it in the shower or under running water.  Not as irritating as the old electrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Takes several passes to get a really close shave and it still might not be smooth enough for some spouses/girlfriends.  Battery consistently drains to 80% after just 2 shaves although you can charge it back up in under an hour.  Cleanup with soap and water mandatory after each use to keep the blades clean and running smoothly and you must leave it out disassembled to dry after each use, a bit of a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall quite pleased with this shaver and will continue to use it.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I received the Panasonic ES-RT51-S about 2 weeks ago. It is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. It gives a  smooth shave with no pulling or scratching, and it holds a charge very well. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all levels of Panasonic shavers over the last few years.  Some were really pricey and had a lot of features.  Some were really basic.  All were very high quality.  I found, however, that I use them all the same way, regardless of what I paid for them and what features they had.  I wash my face, I apply shaving foam and I shave.  Afterwords, I take the head off the shaver and turn the sink water on high and rinse the head off, give it a shake and dry it on a towel.  Every week to ten days, I recharge it.  I didn&#x27;t use the automatic cleaning station for long on the shaver that featured it.  Way too much trouble and expense buying those washer cartridges.  I never seemed to have a new cartridge when I needed it anyway.  I got the same result just rinsing the heads with water after shaving.  Same with the flexible head feature.  I never seemed to get a close shave when I left the head loose to move, so I always locked the head down so it wouldn&#x27;t move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that I get a great shave with this basic shaver and I have the added benefit of not paying extra for features I will never use.</li>
            <li> Replacement razor that is much nicer than the prior one and shaves more closely (so says my boyfriend).  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Shaves well, your face need to get use to it. I bought it because I like Panasonic brand. It was good value for money, and free shipping. Bottom line it works good and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking at this razor it&#x27;s probably because you already know that remington and norelco are worthless. Stuck between a Braun and a Panasonic? I&#x27;ve had luck with both, but after my last high dollar Braun bit the dust after just 18 months, I knew it was time to go back to Panasonic. This thing gives a great, close shave at a great price.</li>
            <li> Very nice and comfortable</li>
            <li> I like it better as a wet shaver than a dry one. I seem to need to go over areas more than once to get a close enough shave.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!  Granted, I&#x27;m coming from a very old women&#x27;s Remington (26009HE).  Here&#x27;s a list of the Pros and Cons from what I&#x27;ve experienced thus far:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Charges very quickly (again, my previous model took 15+ hours according to the manual). This took only a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;-Quiet (my shower borders my neighbor&#x27;s wall, and I HATE that they can normally hear my shave.  No more!)&lt;br /&gt;-Great for sensitive skin (I&#x27;ve never been able to use an electric razor behind my knees before, but I could with this.  Also, no razor burn when shaving very short stubble)&lt;br /&gt;-Close shave on thicker hair (ex: armpit, bikini, and thicker leg hair, which for me is only below the knee)&lt;br /&gt;-The extendable trimmer is a nifty addition, great for the bikini area&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-It really sucks on very fine hair (ex: leg hair on the thighs), but I know many women don&#x27;t shave there.  I&#x27;m a little disappointed, but can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m surprised because it IS a men&#x27;s razor.&lt;br /&gt;-No cleaning brush is included (you can run this razor under water with soap to clean), so hang onto your brush from your previous razor if you have one.</li>
            <li> I have to notes about my experience with this item&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 is not shave enough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 the battery level always is on even without used</li>
            <li> Great gift for the man in your life, and no hair all over the sink. Can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES-RT51-S electric razor is good but not special. Used it for over a month and it shaves acceptably; but as with most electric razors, it needs too many passes to achieve a complete shave. Gave it 4 stars because I know of no better razor, but it really deserves only 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Worked exactly like I wanted it to!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use an electric shaver in a long time ,was going to go for the five head . So i decided to try this model first and i have to say, it gives as close as shave as my razer does. So  i will stay with this it&#x27;s that good love it.</li>
            <li> Works ok on smooth parts of face. will not give a clean shave on my heavy beard if I go more than 1 day</li>
            <li> The old model worked great, but the new \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; is junk.  Now I&#x27;ve got to buy a new razor because this one is useless, needless to say, it won&#x27;t be a Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor when my old Panasonic&#x27;s batteries wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore.  My old Razor, which cost about the same as this one, was made in Japan not China, and it supposedly ran at 13000 RPM.  This \\&quot;nano\\&quot; razor runs at a much slower RPM and it feels like it&#x27;s pulling your beard not cutting.  \\&quot;Nano Smano\\&quot; -- this thing is junk.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected. Gives a smooth,close shave. Great price.</li>
            <li> For once an electric razor that shaves smoothly and cleanly. Matches Gilette!</li>
            <li> Not a good shaver. Other Panasonic models are much better. This seems to have inadequate power.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best electric shavers that I have ever used. The battery has a long usage time and the digital meter measuring remaining charge is a nice idea. It shaves very well and is easy to handle. I recommend it highly !</li>
            <li> Was hoping to get a closer shave.  Not bad for the price.&lt;br /&gt;For me, next time I probably would buy a three head electric, my brother&lt;br /&gt;says he gets a closer shave with his.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
            <li> bad Shaver i need also to use Razor to finishing %100</li>
            <li> The perfect shaver. Love it!</li>
            <li> gives agood shave without irritating my sensitive skin.no cords to hassle with definitely a good price .can use wet or dry shave. highly reccomend.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased this shaver mainly based on my previous experience with Panasonic equipment, which has been uniformly excellent and well-priced.  Unfortunately, that has not been my experience with this product.  Although the build quality is more than acceptable, the quality of the shaves has been mediocre, at best.  I have checked the shaver heads and they appear to be sharp, but they do not provide a close shave.  Ended up buying a cheap Remington and it shaves much better.  Sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li> This one &#x27;shaves as close as a blade&#x27;. I intend to buy the company ;)&lt;br /&gt;And - the head does not drop off like another brand&#x27;s shaver head does. A very good machine!</li>
            <li> This is by near the best electric cordless shaver I have ever used. Good shave without much irritation. I have medium thickness hair. That being said, a razor will always give you a closer shave (with more irritation). I like to alternate every other day with this and a gillette mach whatever.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver last spring after my 5+ year old Panasonic ES8017 started falling apart (but motor and batteries were still good).  Initially I was very happy with the ES-RT51.  It has a good feel in my hand and gave a better shave than the older model.  However, the new shaver has very poor build quality and died for good after about 6 months of use.  Even though it is claimed to be a wet/dry shaver, mine suffered from water intrusion that caused corrosion stains to leach out from around the batteries, and caused the digital window to fog up.  I never used it in the shower, and the only water it had cotact with was when I rinsed the blades under the faucet after shaving.  After about 6 months the batteries started losing their charge quicker and quicker, then stopped working entirely.  I tried disassembling it to clean the battery contacts, etc., but was unable to get it running again.  I had to throw it in the trash and switch back to my 5 year old model, which I had luckily kept as a spare.  I&#x27;m now on the market for a new shaver, but it won&#x27;t be a Panasonic.  I can&#x27;t trust their build quality any more.</li>
            <li> It is cheap and good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied,&lt;br /&gt;Function is very strong for me, very low noise, very easy to clean, in the future I want to try a more advanced.</li>
            <li> I started seeing issues where the battery would go from 60% left to 0. Not sure where the issue is but this has started within the past 3 months.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied for the money spent and the features in this Panasonic shaver ES-RT51-S.  Any electric shave should be followed by a razor to get any missed hairs not wanted, PERIOD.     The RPM&#x27;s of this NON-LINEAR motor are adequate and the general shave is satisfactory.   As always, a touch up with my quad razor and Bob&#x27;s your Uncle.  No razor burn, and this all done with no water,shaving cream,or lotion of any kind.      It features a tilting head to follow contours, pop-up trimmer, button lock, digital charge remaining display, wet/dry use, comfortable in hand rubber grip with angled ribs, corded charger included, and free delivery.      I bought this as a back up to my very old Panasonic ES-8017, which I have replaced the batteries myself with rechargeable batteries.    Here lies the Achilles heal to most Panasonic shavers:    They use special proprietary batteries which cost $20+ for two little batteries that look like a AA battery only that they have a metal prong welded on each end.  The prong system interconnects in a V-groove connector. I refuse the price gouging of the replacement battery.  Sanyo Enloop AA batteries to the rescue, which powers the unit fine. The problem is, the Panasonic recharger won&#x27;t recharge the batteries.  Thus we will be cutting the cord on the old Panasonic charger and soldering it into the Sanyo charger.  Now I will be able to charge my shaver and/or a set AA batteries.  This all would be avoidable if Panasonic would make the entire line of shavers using the standard AA battery. Make money selling shavers and have HAPPY HAPPY customers, instead of ending the experience with a $20+ set of batteries. For $40 I have a whole new shaver as a back up, and plenty of time for modifications to my new charging system.  Thus, the path chosen.</li>
            <li> It works great &amp; holds a charge well.  I use it wet with shaving cream.  Like most electric razors I have ever owned, it will not shave as close as a double edge razor.</li>
            <li> I just wish I got this sooner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a couple weeks but it&#x27;s working great.  My old Norelco died an early death and this is a terrific replacement.  Holds a charge for 6+ shaves and gives me a nice, close shave.  No regrets!</li>
            <li> After 6 months of using it, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s so far the best electric razor for me. Powerful and made clean shaves. The only drawback is it does not come with a charging dock. Even my old Panasonic ES-4001 came with a dock!</li>
            <li> So after about a month or so of use, let me tell you a bit about this puppy over here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: *The battery is a champ. it last practically a week with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;*Close shave! I have sensitive skin and a lot of thing irritate me.This surprisingly did not. I like to the fact that you can dry or wet shave. I think you get a really nice shave either way. Obviously this to clean away stubble. Dont try to take on a full beard here haha.&lt;br /&gt;*works with shaving lotions and oils! I can&#x27;t tell you how awesome that is.&lt;br /&gt;*Easy clean up. You literally stick it in water and bam! clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: You get some stragglers. Im not sure if its just my face but i end up with annoying hairs that just no matter how much i try to get them , they stay in place. More often then not i have to use my razor to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all B. I would def recommend it but know that you&#x27;re probably going to need a razor to finish the job anyway.</li>
            <li> bought for husband for Christmas, so far does the job, with no complaints. Hope it lasts</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give a close shave.  Batt. life is good.  Unit is quiet.  If it gave a good shave it would be a very nice item.</li>
            <li> I USED AN ELECTRIC RAZOR FOR MANY YEARS, AT THE ADVICE OF A FRIEND. I&#x27;D GO TO WORK, A MAN IN MY 30&#x27;S WITH A BUMPY&lt;br /&gt;FACE THAT I&#x27;D BEEN PLAGUED WITH FOR MANY YEARS .  AND MY SUPERVISOR TOLD ME THAT IF I WOULD LISTEN TO HIS ADVISE&lt;br /&gt;MY FACE WOULD CLEAR UP. HE SAID GO AND BUY YOU AN ELECTRIC RAZOR (A GOOD ONE )DON&#x27;T BE CHEAP BUY A GOOD ONE.&lt;br /&gt;I BOUGHT A NORELCO THE 1ST TIME THEN I SPLURGED AND BOUGHT A BRAUN. I PAID OVER A $100.00 WANTED TO BE A BIG SHOT.&lt;br /&gt;MY PROBLEM HAS ALWAYS BEEN WHEN I DO SOMETHING I GO ALL OUT. SO JUST THIS YEAR I STARTED USING DOUBLED SHAVER&lt;br /&gt;WET BLADE SHAVING  &amp; I BOUGHT ALL KINDS OF SOAP RAZORS BRUSHES YOU NAME IT I BOUGHT IT . ONE MORNING MY WIFE SAID&lt;br /&gt;YOUR FACE LOOKS AWFUL. ALL RED &amp; SKINT THOSE RAZORS ARE RUINING YOUR FACE. SO HERE WE ARE ONCE AGAIN.YEP YOU&lt;br /&gt;GUESSED IT I BOUGHT A PANASONIC TRIPLE BLADE WET/DRY ELECTRIC RAZOR ME &amp; MY WIFE BOTH ARE TICKLED  TO DEATH...</li>
            <li> The razor is fantastic. It dose such a great job that I can go 2 to three days without the need to save again</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my dad and he loves it!</li>
            <li> I used foil type Remington Shavers for years...and loved them. But one can hardly find them anymore. I switched to Braun because of their reputation. I was very disappointed. The Braun was an inferior product. The shave was not nearly as close as the Remington&#x27;s I had used and the price was excessive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffered with the Braun for over a year until I finally was persuaded to try something else. With little variety on the market I was pretty much left with the Norelco or Panasonic.  My dad had Norelcos and I didn&#x27;t like his when I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the Panasonic (finally, right?)  WOW!  The Panasonic gave me a GREAT shave.  Very close.  In fact, even superior to the old Remington shavers that I loved. The ES-RT-51 is a fantastic shaver. Cleans easily. Shaves great. Trims great. Holds a charge...but @ 60% the motor does slow down a little (just a tad but noticeable). The grip is well designed.  It feels very comfortable in my hand and the weight and balance is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be happier with my new Panasonic shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this model....you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son for his birthday and my other son liked it so much that he also wanted one for his birthday. They love it and have no complaints about it at all. We would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Panasonic shaver in 15 years. The other 2 are still running, but needed foils at about $30 each. The shaver is smooth, and doesn&#x27;t bite. It is an excellent traveler in the car for shaving on way to work, at lunch touch ups, and before an appointment.    The battery lasts really long, and it has a charge meter to indicate relative life. I had a 31 RT series before this and had come to expect that.  When traveling, be sure to use the plastic blade cover. My only problems with my last 2 Panasonic&#x27;s were self induced tears in the foil by dropping it.    The trimmer adjustment is really good. Like a minature weed whacker. Good for sideburns and nape of neck/hairline.     Nicely, the foil heads are inter changeable with the 31 RT, so I have 2 to use again. I have already ordered a replacement set of foils, the mfg wants $30, but they can be had for less.    Also got one of these shavers for my son who likes it better than his Norelco.</li>
            <li> I orded 2 of these. 1 is still working. The other&#x27;s switch does not respond (does not turn on). So, therefore, 1 of 2 is not bad. Amazons website indicates that returns cannot be expected beyond June 2014.</li>
            <li> Simply the best bang for the buck. I highly recommend it. It shaves very smooth and clean, in wet or dry. Simply the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I have moved into the 21st century with this new Panasonic electric shaver. Hope it lasts as long as my last shaver, a Norelco, for about 20 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 2 Panasonic shavers in the last 15 years...and was happy with each. This one is no different...solid build, good cut (nothing will be as close as a razor) for a great price (under $60). I don&#x27;t think the pivot action of the head is that helpful as it seems a tad bit too tense for easy movement, but it&#x27;s not a hindrance to my shaving, either. The exposed charging contacts at the bottom of the shaver is my only real gripe...my previous shavers used induction charging so there were no exposed contacts...but again, for the price, can&#x27;t complain too much. Bottom line: it shaves as well as a $100 shaver.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, shaves close wet or dry w/o razor burn, easy to clean and operate. I&#x27;ve been using this Panasonic[ [ASIN:B0043DMNHS Panasonic ES-RT51-S 3-Blade Nanotech Wet/dry Rechargeable Shaver, Silver] for about a month now, and I really like it. I haven&#x27;t encountered any negatives so far.</li>
            <li> I was leery about ordering this item at first because of the bad luck I have had with other electric/rechargeable shavers I have used in the past.  I am Extremely happy with this shaver, it works well with my Aveeno shave cream and gets my face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind!! Also, when I am running late I have used this dry and there is ZERO tug and pull, it is very comfortable.  I am comparing this to two others one a Remington Rotary and one a Braun foil and the Panasonic feels better in the hand and seems to have a better quality and the comfort of the Panasonic is amazing the others are nowhere near as comfortable.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.  I&#x27;m impressed with the close shave, and the ease of cleaning.  First time not using blades and I am impressed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver a few times a week for a year now and it&#x27;s still performing well. I use it mainly for &amp;#34;between-shave&amp;#34; cleanup when I don&#x27;t have time for a blade shave. It&#x27;s not too noisy, easy to clean and seems to charge up fairly quickly. My beard is average, so a touch-up only takes a couple of minutes. The trimmer blade on the back is a nice feature and does a good job on sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I&#x27;ve noticed is that, if I let the charge indicator dip below 80%, the fall-off in performance is noticeable. At 40%, I found it pointless to continue. Keep it charged up, however, and it does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> I did a little research and found that this would be a shaver that I could purchase to replace my older Wahl shaver.  This Panasonic model does not give a very close shave.  Compared to my older Wahl it is awful.  The features are very good and the charge lasts a couple weeks but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to give a very close shave.</li>
            <li> This is the 5th Panasonic shaver I own. It&#x27;s quieter than my previous one and it provide good shave (not great). The charge indicator is nice. I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair. This is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun shaver for so many years I can&#x27;t remember. But lately, the Braun has been letting me down in quality (not holding a charge very long, screens not lasting, etc). So when it came time to look for a replacement I decided to look at a lesser priced model instead. To my amazement, the Panasonic kicks the Braun&#x27;s proverbial a&amp;&amp;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Superb sharpness, fits perfectly in my hand, holds a charge for freaking ever, travels well, I cannot say anything bad about it. It rocks! I&#x27;m never paying $300 for a shaver again, that&#x27;s for danged sure. Great job Panasonic, you&#x27;ve stepped up to the plate and hit it out of the park with this model shaver. Freaking sweet...</li>
            <li> This was absolutely perfect for my 91 year old Dad.  He keeps dropping his razors, and I keep replacing them.  Until now, I just kept buying that expensive brand at his local Drug Store when I was visiting him and discovered the old one broken.  No opportunity to shop around for price, as my visits are usually a couple of days and he is in a remote area.  But finally I got smart and went on Amazon in advance of my flight to see him and found this great razor at this great price.  So far he has only dropped it twice, but it did not crash into a million pieces.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES-RT51 is so much better than the Braun 370 Iâ€™ve been using, I want to give a detailed comparison here for anyone else whoâ€™s looking for a Braun alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of believing that Braun shavers were awesome, the model 370 I got a couple of years ago was a great disappointment. This model had the wider head that all Braun shavers now have (a change that I think the company completed around 2010), and it required many many passes to shave well and often failed to get long hairs. So after a couple of years of struggling with it, I bought the Panasonic ES-RT51. This was like going back to one of the older Brauns only better. (The head of the Panasonic even looks like that of the old narrow-head Brauns.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic needs very few passes to give an excellent shave, even on my neck, where the Braun required dozens of passes and still routinely missed individual hairs and even whole patches. The Panasonic doesnâ€™t miss anything if you use it carefully. In the month Iâ€™ve been using it, Iâ€™ve grown careless with it because it requires so much less diligence than the Braun. Even so, it has missed long hairs on my neck only twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does the Panasonic work so well? It seems to run at a higher speed than the Braun, though Iâ€™m just judging by sound. I suspect that the tiny holes in the Panasonic head are slightly larger than those of the Braun head because pressing the Panasonic hard against my skin produces the slightest burning sensation. This would be fine as a tradeoff for a good shave, but pressing hard isnâ€™t necessary to get a good shave with the Panasonic. I only mention this because itâ€™s possible that someone with sensitive skin could find this shaver a bit irritating. If you want a shaver that glides harmlessly over sensitive skin without necessarily taking off your beard, Braun might be the shaver for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Panasonic, I shave in about half the time I used to take with the Braunand get a better shave. The Panasonic is slimmer and lighter (only by 1 ounce, but it feels like more), so itâ€™s more comfortable to hold even if you have big hands. The Panasonic also costs significantly less than the Braun I replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If youâ€™ve tried a Braun travel shaver, you know that itâ€™s possible to get a good shaver for less than $20. Those amazing little shavers arenâ€™t well suited to everyday use (no rechargeable battery and no easy way to deal with long hairs), but they prove that you donâ€™t have to spend a lot of money to get a decent shave, even if you have a tough, fast-growing beard like mine. The Panasonic ES-RT51 offers everything I want in an everyday electric shaver. And this shaver and its charger are so light, I might just toss my old Braun travel shaver, too.</li>
            <li> This is a very fine product. I know Panasonic products. Actually this is a replacement for my previous Panasonic. I used it for a very long time 5~6 years. It&#x27;s still working, it just the battery is dead, and it become very noisy. The new one is very adorable, compact, quiet, and gives a nice shaving.</li>
            <li> it was bought for my workmate.She is satified with its guality and competitive price.</li>
            <li> This is a ok shaver but I should have bought the one with the higher speed motor as I shave my head and the higher speed would do a better job. It is nice to be able to use this shaver in the shower.</li>
            <li> Very good shaver at a very good price.</li>
            <li> I have found that most electric razors do not give me a close shave.  I don&#x27;t this shaver is no better or worse  than any other.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I&#x27;ve used. Very nice shave. Works better than the more expensive razor I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> This is a great choise. the Flexible Pivoting Head help to cut all, and works better whe you used under water.</li>
            <li> Looking for an electric razor for a special needs teen. This one is easy to use and safe. Not too intimidating.</li>
            <li> I started using it and had no problems the first two weeks. One night while in use, it made a terrible noise. I was courious and took it apart. I noticed two inner screws floating inside the head assembly. I reinserted them tightly and reassembled it. It has functioned perfect since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I could have returned it. But I didn&#x27;t want make a trip to the store to purchase disposable razors and then wait for the replacement. The probable cause was me tapping it against the sink to clean it.</li>
            <li> NOT REALLY A CLOSE SHAVE, BUT EASY TO CLEAN</li>
            <li> One of my smartest purchases.  Performs as promised.</li>
            <li> VERY HIGH QUALITY SHAVER, CHARGES IN ABOUT 30 MIN. AND GIVES A CLOSE SHAVE RECOMEND THE SHAVER AS IT GIVES A VERY CLOSE SHAVE AND IS VERY EASY TO CLEAN , JUST RINSE IT UNDER THE FAUSET</li>
            <li> I have always used electric shavers since blades give me bad razor burns.  In the past I have always used a rotary shaver and have only tried this style of shaver once although a different brand than this.  I have to admit, this is the closest shave that I have ever had and with the help of shaving oil and shaving while wet, I love this razor and will definitely buy another when I wear this on out.</li>
            <li> My hubby said he loves it. He has a bad neck and this is easy for him to shave with so he doesn&#x27;t have to bend his neck. He also has a very thick and coarse beard and it seems to shave him very good.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this shaver.  It gives me a very close shave.  Smooth going against the hair to the touch!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not like the old electrics that i have tried in the past and failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Doses not pull the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Close shave though best with shaving soap or gel.&lt;br /&gt;Great battery.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Does NOT irratate my skin!!!  YAY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;The back trimmer is just for sideburns and dosen&#x27;t work that great on thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;The hair that lays flat on my neck if too long is hard to get.</li>
            <li> I owned a Panasonic 8033 shaver and was very pleased with it but the battery died and I can&#x27;t find a replacement so I bought this one.  I should have known better - you get what you pay for.  I find I have to go over areas two or three times and still get only a barely passable shave.  I suggest you pay the extra money to get a shaver that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Panasonic shavers are the best and this one shaves close and fast. Also cleans up under the tap very quickly.</li>
            <li> this unit shaved well and close for the first week, then, it started shaving roughly, and did not give a close shave, almost like a woman had used it to shave her legs, and coarsened it.  now it does not hold a charge as long, dies after showing 60% ON THE GAUGE, and still seems rough.  had this for 5 months now, and looking to find something else when i can affrod to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both electric &amp; blade razors. My beard is light, with sensitive skin. This razor does a superb job. Easy to use, quick to recharge [usually about an hour for a complete charge, which renders about 8, 3 minute shaves. If there is a decline in shaving head rpms at 20% charge, it is hardly noticeable. My Braun electric shaver would be noticing the depleted charge at this point. I also like the sound, higher pitched than my Bruan, with far less vibration. I&#x27;ve also noticed virtually no pulling of whiskers, a first for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is attractive, I think. I dislike shaving, always have. However, I find myself actually enjoying the shave now. Recommend Williams Electric Shave as a pre-shave. Discount brands are not as good setting up your beard. Also, this shaver does quite well shaving after a shower [if you choose not to shave in the shower]. Perhaps even better than a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is just holding the shaver under the faucet, no brushes. Use a good quality soft soap to clean any \\&quot;goo\\&quot; left from the pre-shave/foam. Put a small drop directly on the cutters, replace the foil, &amp; run for 20 seconds, rinse. Thats it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Remington, Norelco, Braun &amp; now Panasonic. This shaver is built well, looks great, &amp; does a good job for me. Many men find an electric less appealing if they have a heavy beard, &amp; I would tend to agree. But if you have sensitive skin &amp; a light to medium beard, I highly recommend this fine shaver.</li>
            <li> After not having much luck with a rotary Philishave (broke and gave me a bad rash) and not wanting to break the bank either on any specific shaver as such, I decided on this linear Panasonic shaver. Wow, very impressed with this item. Shaves well on my 2 day stubble (dry shave, have not tried shaving cream yet) and does this without giving me a rash either. Really great for sensitive skin. As for the quality, it seems pretty decent and time will tell as to how long this product will last. Overall, great value for money with a great shave!</li>
            <li> I love the razor...plenty of shaves...over the past 4 years...or so..never let me down..the charging system seems to be fine as well. I do wait for the indicator to get down to about 20 - 40 %...before charging..Love thse Panasonic razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a rotary for years, and while the shave was closer, it really irritated my neck.  This one is much better in that arena, and a wet/dry to boot.  Easy cleanup, and it does a great job.  So far I&#x27;m really liking it.</li>
            <li> great razor, my son loves it1</li>
            <li> Buyer beware.... It says 3 blades on da box but... open it up and take da foil off it only has 2 blades.  I been dealing with it for awhile now.  I will be more aware next time datz all</li>
            <li> This thing really hums fast. Not as good as a blade but I did not expect that. It is great for a quick shave when in a hurry or maybe out camping. My beard is not too heavy or thick. Instructions for cleaning stink. Just a quick puff can clean it if you do not wet shave.</li>
            <li> My son seems to like this shaver.  He has had no issues with it and is a beginning shaver. Arrived on time as scheduled.</li>
            <li> I recently bought two of these as a replacement to my old shaver, and as my son&#x27;s first shaver.I personally have not used it yet, but my son was very pleased with it. He was able to use it by himself, without me having to help him. He read the manual himself, and then proceeded to shave himself without getting cut or without any complaints. He&#x27;s a complete novice at this so I was surprised when he didn&#x27;t have to come ask me for help. Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this model shaver for many years, and love it!  I&#x27;ve used electric shavers my whole life, and this is by far my favorite design.  I think the 3-blade aspect is key - I&#x27;ve got a similar 2-blade travel model as well, and it&#x27;s much less effective.  The wet/dry shaving aspect is nice too - you can use shaving cream, use it in the shower, etc.</li>
            <li> takes more effort to shave, although will do the job if you keep at it long enough.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this razor, but I was also hesitant. The prior reviews were pretty evenly polarized between love it or hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience has been right in the middle. It provided average cutting capability, but left certain areas around the neck/ear area slightly longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved that this was waterproof, and could be used in the shower and with shaving cream/gel. The cleanup was a snap, and couldn&#x27;t be easier. Charging and other maintenance is also simple. However, the battery didn&#x27;t last as long as I would hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all though, its just an incredibly mediocre razor, and I feel like it should perform better then it did.</li>
            <li> Very close shave and great value for the money. Like the charge indicator. Holds charge for 5 days worth of shaving</li>
            <li> Very fast delivered. Good product.  It is comfortable to use it. I love its traditional style and design. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had one just like it for many years.  In fact, it still works fine, but the battery just isn&#x27;t holding a charge like it did when new.  I was happy to find that the same razor was still available.  The shave is great; the razor is comfortable to hold and it runs quieter than any others I have owned.  The only reason I rate it a 4 is that it does not work with a cord.  I can live with that, I just have to be careful to charge it when it tells me to.</li>
            <li> Works perhaps slightly better dry than wet.  Have owned a few electric shavers and this is as good as any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under the chin and neck which has always been the most stubborn area I am still satisfied by the performance of this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 to 5 shaves from a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Works great without any gels or shaving fines, after shaving skin is smooth and is not bristly at all (!) like after ordinary manual shaver(s).&lt;br /&gt;The only one question I have - how long blades will stay incisive.&lt;br /&gt;Time will show.&lt;br /&gt;So definitely I&#x27;m not dissapointed with this order.</li>
            <li> The previous Panasonic foil shaver battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long so thought I&#x27;d replace it with another.  The last Panasonic just gave a good shave and lasted a while.  This one is a little lower on the RPM&#x27;s but much quieter and actually gives an even closer shave.  Very nice!!  I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J</li>
            <li> Love using this new razor always used a three headed model, this was the first time using a razor like this. Tried using it with lather but found that I got a much closer shave using it the regular way with Lectri shave.</li>
            <li> I have had two  less expensive and earlier models of this razor.  I can attest to the recommendation to replace the foil every year as both of my razors needed a new foil.  Buying from Amazon puts replacement parts at your fingertips.  This razor gives me the best shave out of approximately 10 other mfr&#x27;s I have purchased before.  Maybe there are better electric razors out there but I haven&#x27;t found them.  I also appreciate the modest cost!</li>
            <li> This shaver just does not work for my type of beard.  I always had touch up with my old shaver after shaving with this shaver.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!!!! bought this after reading another woman&#x27;s review. very happy with my product and would definitely recommend it to others</li>
            <li> This is a very nice razor with some nice features. I have had many brands through the years but I think this one is the best I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace a Panasonic ES8152 that I had for about 10 years.  The pop-up trimmer on that model stopped working, it needed new foil and blades, so I decided to replace the entire unit since the replacement foil/blades cost about $30 and this new unit cost about $50.  I bought another Panasonic since I liked the old one so much and it lasted so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver gives me a nice close shave and causes virtually no irritation.  I have a thick, full beard that is very tough, so this shaver is truly performing great.  I almost never use the wet option, but it&#x27;s great to have and makes cleaning a snap.  I find I get the closest after a hot shower and once my face is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the things I do not like about this shaver, and why I am not giving it five stars:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  You can&#x27;t use the shaver with the cord plugged in, only works off battery power.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It doesn&#x27;t come with a charging base.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The pop-up trimmer looks fragile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these things are relatively minor and I&#x27;ll adapt to them easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Louis James</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in several years and thought the technology had improved. I was not impressed that this current electric shavers gives closer shaves than electric shavers from years past. This shaver works OK (similar to my braun and remington electic shavers that I used several years ago) but nowhere near as close a shave as with a blade. I&#x27;ll use this electric shaver for &amp;#34;touch ups&amp;#34; for 5 o&#x27;clock shadow but I&#x27;ll stick with razor blades for my primary shaving method. To be fair, this electric razor otherwise functions as advertised.</li>
            <li> I am a girl. This is by FAR the best shaver I ever had - WHY waiting? - any girl shaver in comparison with this Panasonic ES-RT51-S 3 Blade nano tech Wet/dry rechargeable shaver is poor in performance, its cleaning and looks. The movement of flexible pivoting head, designed for man face, is OPTIMUM for the legs adjusting to the contours and makes shaving SMOOTH, fast and easy. The cleaning is simply under water for practical and hygiene solution, which is great. The feel of the shaver in the hand is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely announced it as UNISEX.</li>
            <li> We purchased 2 of these Shavers for my wife and I. Now we each have one of our own. The descriptions are true. After using one of these several times, you will not go back to razor that requires blades.</li>
            <li> I wish they still made the 8077.  That was my last Panasonic and I loved it.  This razor is not the same.  The basic design is similar, but it is obvious the blades don&#x27;t move nearly as fast and the motor is not as strong.  You must move slower to get a good shave, but the shave IS good.  The battery is good for 6 to 8 shaves and it charges quickly.  I love the wet/dry option.  I use shave cream in the shower and it works great.  Razor must be completely dried out to use on a dry face, but it shaves pretty good that way too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the design for the trimmer on these razors and I never use it.  It&#x27;s placement makes it difficult or impossible to see what you are trying to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good razor for the price.</li>
            <li> My son has a beard that grows back by 3pm after shaving at 8am. He loves this razor, what else can I say?</li>
            <li> Replaced and old Norelco.  Really like the wet/dry feature and water clean-up.  Don&#x27;t think it shaves as close as the Norelco but, shaving in the shower with gel is incredibly comfortable and smooth.  Battery life is as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several Norelco rotary razors.  I&#x27;ve liked them all, but they don&#x27;t give me a very close shave because I have a fairly heavy beard.  I thought I would try a foil razor because many reviews indcated they gave a closer shave for a heavier beard.  After using this razor for acouple of months I would agree.  This razor gives me closer shave then my rotary shaver (of course, still not as close as a blade).  I got it for under $50, which makes it a good value too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Panasonic Wet-Dry electric razor for going on 20 years. Bang for your buck, this is the best, most comfortable, least expensive razor you can buy.  The best shave is with a mirror in the shower using a moisturizing shave cream like the one from Kiss My Face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in a hurry, you can use it dry but you won&#x27;t get as close a shave.  It will take your face a couple days to get used to the dry shaving method. The wet method will provide instant gratification. If you are a perfectionist like me, you&#x27;ll follow up the electric razor with a five blade razor to get the very best, closest, most comfortable shave of all time...and those really expensive five blade razors will last five times longer.</li>
            <li> It does not shave the way I would like it to. Still leaves a beard. Not so good of a product.</li>
            <li> A great electric shaver that does a great job.</li>
            <li> Hope the replaceable blades were cheaper</li>
            <li> Still working and doing a very good job.  Very precisely made and easy to clean.  Screen holds up well</li>
            <li> Right out of the box, easy to use, for my 16 year old. Holds a good charge. Shaves close enough to give a clean shaven look.</li>
            <li> Simply delivers a nice close shave, cleans up easily under the faucet and does not sound like a lawn mower next to my ear. I  recommend it!</li>
            <li> Shaver gave a very good close shave and charging was very fast. The noise is acceptable and easy to was and clean. There is no irritation or razor burn unlike wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I have a smooth face for this item.I love it.The item&#x27;s look is so cool.</li>
            <li> Much better than the old one but I am disappointed with how close it shaves.</li>
            <li> I wish this could give me more of a closer shave. Still not sure if i&#x27;m using the shaver right yet need more time to use to give a better review.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if you are 15 years of age, this product will give you a close shave... but if you are more than 30... some spots are even hard to reach. I owned an old model a long time ago and wanted a wet/dry shaver and I thought that Panasonic had improved it... but NO... It is okay if you&#x27;re not going anywhere where a neat appearance is required, but a rather so... so.. one. I will keep for quick jobs, but will continue to use another brand I have for a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I have used many electric shavers in my lifetime including name brands like Norelco, Braun and Remington. I have also had numerous knockoffs and generic shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BY FAR, this is the finest shaver I have ever used. It removes my beard effortlessly and without any irritation since you can apply whatever type of shave cream, balm, etc. that you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The construction is first-rate and the first thing that struck me was how quiet it was. The second was how fast the shave heads are moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the remarkable shaving experience, the next step is a breeze - cleanup. All you do is rinse the head hot water WHILE it is on, then power off and remove the head, turn it back on and rinse the blades by themselves for a few seconds, again while running. I am so happy not to need a separate cleaning system, but can use something that most all of us have, hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this shaver a FIVE star, but I wish I could give it more!</li>
            <li> I owned the previous version of this shaver and after 4 years, the battery life would drain after 4 shaves and the blades were in dire need of replacement along with the foil.  It was cheaper to replace the entire shaver than simply purchasing new blades/foil.&lt;br /&gt;Go figure.  Regardless, for the money and quality, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this unit.</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic shaver and it&#x27;s as good as they get. The first one, roughly 15 years old, is in the RV and it still performs like a champ.</li>
            <li> Body wash very practical.Easy to use Very clean,If the sound is smaller the better,I hope there are many more promotions can participate.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver, it&#x27;s smooth and very quite and gets the job done. It&#x27;s light weight and keeps the charge</li>
            <li> This is my 6th or 7th Panasonic shaver so I may be biased. Before I started using Panasonic I had tried various other electrical razors and hated most of them.  The shave never was close enough or some areas were missed.  A few years ago I got my first Panasonic Shaver as a birthday gift and never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;Things I like about Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;- Battery charges very fast in less than 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;- Wet Dry&lt;br /&gt;- Very close Shave&lt;br /&gt;- Gets very hard to get areas.&lt;br /&gt;- Display shows battery charge so there are no surprises</li>
            <li> was exactly what I expected.  Good price point.  My son uses it at college every day.  would but another one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to bore people with crazy specs. I&#x27;m an Asian male with mostly straight facial hair, some spots are straight but may grow a little slanted in one direction which require a couple of passes if left too long without shaving. For years I hate shaving, I&#x27;ve tried Gillet, Norelco and one of the battery operated hand razors. Traditional razors gives cuts once in a while and I always have to replace the blades to fast, the Norelco had 3 circular blades which took me multiple attempts over the same area and it would cut me once in a while. Eventually I got lazy and shaved maybe a couple of times a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Panasonic ES-RT51-S, I actually enjoyed shaving, it&#x27;s quick, easy, no cuts and best I could wash everything under water to keep it clean. Now I shave almost every day. The battery charges quickly and I can get more than 10 shaves per charge. I&#x27;m sure if there&#x27;s a lot more hair one would have to charge more often.  I&#x27;m not sure about being able to swivel left and right, I think it&#x27;s more of a gimmick than anything. One would have to press pretty hard against the skin to get the swivel to work and it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m willing to try.  The trimmer works fine.</li>
            <li> I had used a Norelco for the last eleven years. When it went South, I bought one of the new \\&quot;slick looking&#x27; Norelco&#x27;s and it was the worst. I returned the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this Panasonic and it was so much better than anything I had ever owned. Great razor. Time will tell how well it survives, but for now I am happy with the purchase..</li>
            <li> It does not shave very close and pulls hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver and keeps its charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Good, but not great razor due to the fact that it takes many more passes (especially on the neck) to do the job.</li>
            <li> Purchased for care givers to use with my father. They say it is very easy to get a good shave! Can use wet or dry.</li>
            <li> They failed to provide me with a cleaning brush with my shave. after many contacts with Panasonic attempting to  obtain the brush, I felt like I was dealing with Washington! I finally said To hell with it, and ordered new brushes from you folks, which  are on the way. If Panasonic can&#x27;t resolve  a small problem like this since early March of this year, they ought to hang it up!</li>
            <li> Does not shave well, if you have more than a days growth.</li>
            <li> I would definitely say you get a close shave with this device but I do notice after going over my whole face and then rubbing over the skin with my other hand, it&#x27;s as if I haven&#x27;t used a shaver at all.  I have to back over it again and again.  My old Braun would do it in one sweep.  This shaver boasts a swiveling head but you have to grab it with both hands to get it to do so.  I think there are 4 foil heads side by side.  I wonder if this is part of the problem - you end up effectively with a big flat surface, rather than the curve of a single foil head.  It charges fast but runs down quite quickly too.  Again the Braun would do me for around 10 days on a single charge.  This will do about half that.  The Braun was probably more expensive too.  I wanted to save money and I do get a close shave so I suppose I&#x27;m reasonably happy.</li>
            <li> This razor is fantastic, charges very quickly and indicates the amount of charge left so you are never left with 1/2 a shave.</li>
            <li> For a close and smooth shave i highly recommend the Panasonic ES-RT51-S 3 blade electric razor.</li>
            <li> I found the Panasonic ES-RT51 fantastic for fact that it shaves soft and smoothly without scratching my skin. and the blade is water washable.</li>
            <li> This shaver is ok thought it was the liner blade system that Panasonic has but it is NOT!!! so just a ok shaver!</li>
            <li> My Panasonic ES-RT51 is now about two years old.  I was very happy with it initially.  Unfortunately the battery life, which was great to start, has deteriorated significantly.  It&#x27;s to the point I can only get 3-4 shaves after a full charge before it&#x27;s completely dead.  The battery meter is now nearly useless also, going from 60% straight to 0%.  What happened to 40% &amp; 20%???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wouldn&#x27;t be bad if it were a corded/cordless model because I could just plug it in and keep going.  Now I have to charge every 2 days to be sure it doesn&#x27;t die in the middle of a shave. If it does, I have to plug it in and wait 5-10 minutes to get enough charge to finish then charge again when finished so it&#x27;s ready for the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous razor was a Braun.  It wasn&#x27;t perfect (noisy &amp; not a wet/dry model) but after 7 years the battery was still better than the Panasonic.  It also had the advantage of being corded/cordless so if it died in mid-shave I could just plug it in and finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the Panasonic but I don&#x27;t want spend $$ replacing my razor every two years. It will probably be back to Braun for the next razor.</li>
            <li> My husband says its The best shaver, he&#x27;s personally ever had the experience of using. Will recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> My husband had a stroke. He can only use his left and. He was right handed. He can easily use this. It is great! His last shaver pulled a lot, but this is pain free.</li>
            <li> I have a really sensitive face and have even had electric razors that make my face break out. This one is very smooth and never hurts my face and works great in the shower as well. Would highly recommend this product to anyone that wants a razor to use in or out of the shower and has a sensitive face. Only downfall is that it slowly works less as well as the battery dies. But I keep it charged anyway s great product</li>
            <li> I have used my new panasonic for over a month and I have been very satisfied. I definitely found the change to electric from a blade shave takes tlme. Originally I was not happy with the shave, but continued use has made me a believer.</li>
            <li> Very happy.  I shave with a disposal razor but I never get close around my lips or chin.  Use it to clean up what my razor blade misses.  So far works great.</li>
            <li> I usually shave with a disposable razor in the shower. So far I have used this razor once (dry mode) and was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my old Panasonic shaver, which was more then 10 years old. It shaved well, but the battery would only last about two days. I travel frequently and lugging the stand to charge the shaver was a drag. I purchased this model on price and Panasonic reputation. Description did not say anything about the charging stand, and I was a little surprised when there was none in the box, just s small plug-in charger. My last Panasonic had induction charging stand. I decided to see how many days the battery would last and I am elated to say that it lasted from May 14th to today, June 10th without charging (shaving every day) . It even worked when display indicated zero charging level. It shaves just as well as my last shaver, so I am completely satisfied with this model.</li>
            <li> JUST GREAT. I MORE THAN PLEASED WITH THIS RAZOR. THE CHARGE LAST FOR EVER.... AND IT GIVES A PRETTY GOOD SHAVE.</li>
            <li> How many things can you say about a razor that does not cut. If I go slow or fast, press hard or light, with the grain or not. This thing would be better at doing an oil change on my car than as a razor. Get it, not a razor at all, a cleverly designed, pretty looking POC.</li>
            <li> So far, so good! This shaver performs as advertised-a close, comfortable shave. It is advertised to be a wet or dry shaver and I have only used it dry. I got about 15 shaves on the first charge and the recharge took less than an hour. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Had the prior model that worked well for many years. This is more sophisticated and has a helpful power meter. Charger didn&#x27;t work on delivery. If this is like old one, heads will last at best 6 months and are expensive, so check that cost beforehand. Overall, good product.</li>
            <li> This shaver does a good job of shaving, and the trimmer works just fine. The only shortcoming is that it must be charged more often than my last (Remington) shaver. It is good for only about 8-10 shaves before it needs recharged. However, it only takes about an hour to recharge.</li>
            <li> Longtime Norelco user. After replacing cutters/combs on a Norelco I&#x27;d used for two years, the quality of the replacement blades was so poor that I decided to switch to another brand. After what I hoped was adequate research, I settled on this model by Panasonic. It is very well made if just a bit heavy. The wet/dry feature is nice as using shave cream definitely improves the comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, now for the disappointing part. This razor does a very poor job on more than a few days growth. If you shave every day or every other day, it might be OK for you but for me, even on 1 or 2 day&#x27;s growth, it was only adequate. Shaving with this razor requires an excess of facial gymnastics to cut every whisker as it seems to be very sensitive to the direction in which the hair grows. I suppose this is understandable as the combs on the cutting head are unidirectional, but the number of passes it takes to get a clean shave is excessive and frequently resulted in shaver burn when shaving dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you have a very round face and a very light beard this razor may work well for you. It is easy to clean and does work somewhat better, or at least more comfortably, when using shaving cream. As for me, I am returning to Norelco and hoping that whatever the reason for poor quality replacement blades has been addressed.</li>
            <li> This razor works well for me. I used this type for several years. I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Shaves well, but it has some drag to it.</li>
            <li> Good solid shaver that should last a long time.  Like the locking on off switch for travelling so it does not turn on in your luggage which happened to my old razor.</li>
            <li> Good clean and comfortable shave.  Best shaver I have used.  With the quick charge time this electric shaver is very convenient. Mahalo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female who tried using it for my bikini line and legs in order to avoid razor burn but honestly, learning how to shave the right way with a normal razor is way more worth buying this product. Doesn&#x27;t work very well at all at getting rid of hair. Also I&#x27;m confused as to how the fine clipper portion works since it seems to bend back to being closed in the direction that it will shave your hair (very annoying). I&#x27;m also annoyed with the charging system since you have to keep it plugged in or else it will loose its charge (which is annoying since it takes up counter space). Not sure how it would work on men&#x27;s facial hair but definitely not a choice buy with women&#x27;s hair removal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver will only last for 1 year before water leaks into it and shorts it out.  If you think that one year of service for $50 to $60 is acceptable (you can spend that much on blades for a razor), you might consider it.</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my old Panasonic 2 blade shaver. I did try other brands like Norelco product (Philips and others). They do not last long , not more than 2 years. My last panasonic lasted around 11 years. This ES-RT51 is giving me the same confidence. Performance wise the best.</li>
            <li> l used other brands in the past, and so far this one has exceeded m y expectations.. even under wet conditions.</li>
            <li> Great product. Quick clean shave for a decent price what else do you need. Panasonic my new shaver.(Quick charge).a+ a+ a+</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s digital, the head of the shaver is flexible so it works in the grooves of jaw line. Always looks fresh. Perfect gift for anyone man. Ladies if your man isn&#x27;t keeping up, buy it, they will always use it.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Relied on the review to get this. It worked for 2 days but then never turned on afterwards. Been a month now and only the trimmer functions.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for a couple of years now. I get a good shave out of it, but I have found the on/off switch to be weak--sometimes it will powers on when I&#x27;m not using it--drains the battery--I have to stand it upright in my bathroom drawer. Also, the readout indicating how much battery strength is left before needing to recharge is not reliable. It may indicate 20% or 40%, but then stop working--in the middle of my shave--have to recharge. I will say the recharge is quick! I will continue using this razor, but will move onto another someday.</li>
            <li> It is the best shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to anyone who needs it.I can use it  for dry or wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;It gives clean shave.</li>
            <li> After my boyfriend fighting with his shaver for MONTHS before Christmas it was time to invest in a good one.  he could not be happier.  I wish there was more options to trim but the trimmer provided seems to do the trick for him.  good quality and i love the battery life percentage.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver, holds its charge for many shaves...three uses thus far and still at 80% battery. A very good buy.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to using this item. Had one similiar before and it works just fine. Can even use this item in the shower.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my future son-in-law.  He absolutely loves it.  The reviews already here on Amazon and the price of it helped me to decide which one to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;He told me that it was beyond what he thought it could be.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor to replace my last Panasonic razor which my son broke accidentally and for which I could no longer get parts. Although, considerably more expensive than my previous Panasonic razors, it was still the best value as compared to other brands. Initially it performed well. The wider head, meant less passes on my face and allowed for a faster shave. I thought the power indicator was a nice feature. With a full charge, I got about 5, 4 minute shaves. So I only had to charge it once every 5 days. Charging was much faster than my old razor at about 20 minutes. The charge level drops in 20% increments. But within about 6 months I noticed that the razor did not perform well when the power reached about 20%. Within a year that symptom started at 40%. Now, at about 16 months the razor dies once it reaches 80%. The battery is clearly dying. The case is sealed, so there is no way to replace it. And unlike my old razors, it cannot be used while plugged in to a wall outlet. This is the case with most electric razors these days. The only option is to purchase a new razor. I really can&#x27;t justify paying $50 or more each year for a new electric razor. So I&#x27;ve decided to go back to using an old fashioned safety razor. The shave is much closer than electric or cartridge razors, the blades are readily available and relatively inexpensive. It takes a little longer to shave with a safety razor and there is more razor burn. But in the long run, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper and better for the environment.</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic razor.As I have a light beard it suits me just fine.My son has a heavier beard and finds the Norelco(just a few $ more) does a better job for him.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver a little over a month and I use it approx. two times per week. This is because I don&#x27;t have to shave so often as before. Fits good in my hand, holds charge very good for my usage time. I do think that the charging port should have a cover though, since water can sometimes run down to that area. The foil and blade does get a little hot if insufficient liquid is used (water or foam), therefore dry-shaving would have to be limited. Have not used the mustache trimmer much because the actual device blocks the view in the mirror. Overall - I am satisfied with this product, for the functioning and price.</li>
            <li> Works fine. For those who complain about the shave should realize it takes up to a month for it to learn your face. I&#x27;ve had it a month and it works like my old one did except faster, quieter, and a better battery life.</li>
            <li> The shave is not as close as newer/improved models, so buyer beware.  I would invest a little more in a newer model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for over a month and I am using it daily. It does not even come close to the shave that I get out of my blades.  It does fine for touch ups and it works OK if I use it every day, but it doesn&#x27;t shave my neck very well and it doesn&#x27;t give me the consistency of blades.</li>
            <li> The Pansonic ES-RT51-S3. is very much faithful to the features shown on the box.  Amazing a one hour charge lasted me just under three weeks of daily shaving.&lt;br /&gt;MARVELLOUS</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in July and it worked great up until a couple of weeks ago. The charge indicator screen claims that the charge is a certain percentage, like 100%, but it is not. When I cut the razor on, it is dead. The razor performs well, but I now have to plug it in 15-20 minutes before shaving so that it will work for me when I am ready. That can be frustrating at times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it several weeks now and it shaves fantastic. I had other electric razor in the past (long ago) only to end up throwing them in the trash dur to not shaving me close enough. One of the Main things i really like about this razor is the fact that you can wet shave with it....NO IRRITATION.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for a Panasonic close curves Lady&#x27;s shaver which I had used for two years: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G0GW6K/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o05_s00_i00. I liked it enough but the battery was on its last limp and buying a new battery cost as much as buying the same shaver again. I was hoping to get an even better shaver, and spent about $20 more on this men&#x27;s shaver. It is not as good as the lady&#x27;s shaver (though it is sharper and shaves closer), for my purposes. This shaver can easily cut skin on the pubic area, will not cut hairs that are too fine or too long, and it takes many passes to get the skin perfectly smooth. I use it along with a trimmer (since the lady&#x27;s shaver has a trimmer and this newer, better shaver does not): http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JS5C/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o02_s00_i02, which makes it a little easier. The men&#x27;s shaver is also bulkier than the woman&#x27;s shaver, making it harder to maneuver. The pop-up trimmer can be useful, but it&#x27;s also at a weird angle when shaving pubic hair. If you&#x27;re a woman shaving your pubic hair, don&#x27;t try to shave fast at all with this, you&#x27;ll hurt yourself. I do like the battery life display, and that the charger has a cord. Works great for leg and underarm hair and I will continue to use it; but I think next time, I&#x27;ll go with the lady&#x27;s shaver, and leave this one to the big boys.</li>
            <li> This unit replaced a model that cost more than double and had a much shorter battery life and fewer features. Intended as a decent compromise but is actually better than the higher priced model. Very happy with this discovery. Holds a charge for days. Comfy and washable.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would add to this shaver is a pretty girl to use it on my face.  My previous electric shaver was an old-old Remington three-screen.  It did the job, but upgrading to this Panasonic was a very pleasant experience.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a heavy solid heft to it--feels quality and doesn&#x27;t vibrate your hand the way older-looser electric shavers do.&lt;br /&gt;The Percent of Charge remaining digital window is a great feature and it&#x27;s easy to charge.&lt;br /&gt;Looks great, feels great, and works great!</li>
            <li> This electric shaver replaced another Panasonic from many many years ago.  I think this will also last many years.  Great item.</li>
            <li> Excellent Shaver, used everyday and works great. It&#x27;s quiet and efficient and charges quickly.  I would recommend this shaver to anyone wanting a close and quiet shave.&lt;br /&gt;Drew Pitcher</li>
            <li> did not give a close shave like my blade razor . quick and easy return. i guess im not a good prospect for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> This gift for my husband was a good choice.  He especially liked the dry or wet choice for shaving.  Had others but this is the best.</li>
            <li> No matter what the box or the instructions say, if you have a thick beard, this razor will not give you a close shave.</li>
            <li> Terrific razor, gets all the way down to the skin like a regular blade, charge remains for a long time, and holding it you can tell that it has a solid design and is well put-together.  Recommended this to my Dad and anyone else who mentions needing a new electric shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite a task to shave uthing this shaver.</li>
            <li> I have received the gift shipped oversea, I like it very much!</li>
            <li> I bought this so I could shave in the shower.  I owned this about 4 months before I sold it for 5.00 at a garage sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many electric shavers, and this is by far the worst.  Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy because you think you are saving some money.  You will be throwing money away.</li>
            <li> This  razor meets every expectation I had for it.  It replaces an older model that I had for a number of years. I fully expect this one to last as long and shave as well as the first Panasonic did.</li>
            <li> Got this for my father inlaw as he was cutting himself with disposable razors.  He seems to like it alot and actually only shaves about every 3 days saying his beard just doesn&#x27;t grow that fast anymore. He&#x27;s 93 and has always used a straight regular razor with shaving cream.  I warned him that he will still need to use his disposable razor every now and again around the neck area as none of the electrics I&#x27;ve ever owned do a complete job on the neck.  I didn&#x27;t try it myself but appears similar to my Panasonic ES8043 only it shows the amount of charge where my 8043 does not..  The blades look very similar to my 8043 but didn&#x27;t notice anything about linear tech on it.  At first he wanted a Braun, but when he found out  that Braun is made in China rather than Germany he opted for a reasonably priced Panny.</li>
            <li> 5 months of use and the battery is dead.  Had device services by Panasonic by sending it back to the factory at my expense.  Received the device back and now the battery is dead again after one charge.</li>
            <li> The shaver does a great job. Quiet, close shave...fast. so why just 3 stars?  The readout for shaving time doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Always stays at 100 percent charge. I like this shave better than Norelco...but maybe Panasonic quality control slipped a little.</li>
            <li> excellent razor very satisfied</li>
            <li> Husband loves it! Says it&#x27;s the best shaver he&#x27;s ever used...</li>
            <li> I had never used an electric shaver when I bought this Panasonic. I got tired of the slow-healing shaving nicks brought on by anticoagulant therapy and thought an electric might be a good alternative to the multi-blade razors I&#x27;ve always used. I decided to give it a try. Knowing nothing, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on a pricy shaver only to find I didn&#x27;t like it. So after some research I settled on the ES-RT51-S at 44 bucks. I have a relatively light beard, so I decided on a foil shaver instead of a rotary. Now I&#x27;ve had it for a little more than two weeks and couldn&#x27;t be happier! The shave is incredible! In fact, I get a better, closer shave with the Panasonic than I ever got with a conventional razor, and no more nicks. I tried using it wet with shaving gel at first, and it worked fine. But I decided I like a dry shave better. I splash on a little Williams Lectric Shave after my shower, then shave for 3-4 minutes max. I cannot imagine a better shave! Battery life is fine. I got two weeks out of a charge and it wasn&#x27;t yet dead when I recharged it. I have no idea why anyone would spend $200-$300 on a more expensive model unless it induces virtual orgasm. No complaints about this little Panasonic. It&#x27;s a winner!</li>
            <li> As a lifelong Panasonic Razor customer, I have always enjoyed their razors and understand they need to be replaced every few years.  However, this latest model died on me within six months.  Specifically, its batteries will not hold a charge... it dies within a day of being fully charged.  Making matters worse, I&#x27;m going on five weeks of trying to get Panasonic to honor its warranty for the razor but the best they have offered so far is to replace the charger (not the razor or its battery mind you.. the charger).  Given the daily need for my razor, I think I&#x27;ve been overly patient with Panasonic&#x27;s warranty department.  Needless to say, I&#x27;m very disappointed and will be purchasing another brand from now on.  I&#x27;d advise you to either buy a different model if it has a different battery or shop for a different brand, or realize this is likely to be a &#x27;disposable 6 month electric razor.&#x27;</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying the Panasonic ES-RT1. I bought it because it gives me the shave I&#x27;m looking for, close, smooth, and no irritation. I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband while deployed, since he dropped and shattered his other into about 7 or 8 pieces...over a year ago and still works great!</li>
            <li> this thing shaves great</li>
            <li> I am elderly and so I mainly want to shave and have it do a good job. When you turn it on, it tells you how much power is left before you have to recharge it. it has a side burn trimmer which is handy. I think it is well worth the money. If you are looking for a rotary shaver, I believe you will get a better shave but for the extra money, this works just fine</li>
            <li> my facial hair is only slightly thick, and i have lots of difficulty to use the trimmer to make accurate and effective cuts with this shaver. i would go back and buy a different one if i could.</li>
            <li> I have struggled finding a quality shaver for about 8 years.  I&#x27;m too cheap to buy a $200-300 shaver, but was sick of manually shaving all the time.  I used mainly Remington and Norelco shavers for the previous 8 years and was not happy with any of those shavers at any time.  They missed a lot of hair, especially on my neck no matter how many times I would go over that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened this and held it, I could tell it was a quality shaver.  It contours nicely to your hand.  I used it for wet shaving and was amazed.  I could barely even feel it against my face and it cleared every hair off my neck.  No other shaver has even come close to this machine for me.</li>
            <li> Son loves it.&lt;br /&gt;He is a teenager and has stubble that needs 1-2x/week trimming.&lt;br /&gt;He tried another razer that pulled without cutting.&lt;br /&gt;No such problem here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I borrowed it for trimming my mustache and goatee. Worked perfectly. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Shaves smooth - even 2 day old scruff and doesn&#x27;t hurt or pull - smooth as blade (mostly) without pushing hard into my neck as I had with others.  Holds charge all week.  better than any Braun or Norelco I have ever purchased. Very happy Good job Panasonic!</li>
            <li> This shaver holds a good charge and is easy to use. It meets all if my qualifications for a shaver.</li>
            <li> Very Pleased! Shipped fast and works great. Gives an excellent shave. Love the grip and overall design. If you need a razor or are thinking of a gift...you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. Really good features and a solid product.</li>
            <li> My husband found it easy to use, good quality, and a good replacement for an old one like it.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this razor based on the reviews for the trimmer.  He did not like the way it trimmed, and we returned it.</li>
            <li> If you are bald headed purchase this device as it will save you weekly shaves at your local barber shop. You will be more than pleased and say why didn&#x27;t I look for a device like this a long time ago. It&#x27;s easy to clean, recharge and has a trimmer. No complaints from me as I saved a fortune.</li>
            <li> after full charging,I turned on my razor. would not start. I switched on a dozen more times. would not start. The next day, 24 hours, as I was beginning to pack to mail it back, I tried one more time, it started ! and has performed wonderful perfectly ever since!  a great shaver.!!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these in Dec 2011 and I do like the way it shaves and cleans, but the batteries gradually lost their ability to hold a charge and by June 2014 it was obvious that they needed to be replaced. They lasted about 30 months which is considerably less than a person should expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking this razor apart to get to the batteries is not a task for the timid. It was difficult to get the razor apart as one would expect in a waterproof razor. But, I CANNOT find replacement batteries anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to order a new razor and it will not be a Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Such a clean shave and I bought it for a long time now, it continues to impress me on how great it works!</li>
            <li> My previous Panasonic wet/dry shaver finally died after 15 years of use (!), so I did not hesitate to buy a replacement. This new one  is a good value, but it doesn&#x27;t shave as well as the old one (not as close), and the trimmer extension is quite inferior. The one improvement is batter life (and the battery gauge). I can&#x27;t understand why a much newer model wouldn&#x27;t shave as well as the older one, but it&#x27;s definitely not as a close a shave. But it&#x27;s close enough, so I&#x27;m keeping it and not complaining (after I finish this review).</li>
            <li> I originally brought this shaver thinking that a man&#x27;s electric shaver will cut the hair closer and better than a woman&#x27;s shaver. I was wrong, or at least for this model.  When dry shaving (w/ powder), I have to go over an area at least 5-7 times to cut just two strands! And then it still may not be a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;My woman&#x27;s electric shaver, Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver, was much better than this shaver.</li>
            <li> Provides a good shave, however some work is involved for a really close shave (subjective as every face is different). Good ergonomics, (weight, balance, shape). Love the lithium-ion battery, much improved over ni-cads. Battery life is not as long as other shavers, but the battery power indicator will never leave you guessing. Quick 1 hour charge. Great wet and dry shaving, and I will go against the grain and say I prefer dry. Price was also very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave both wet and dry. Comfortable in my hand. Good buy for the price. Charges quickly and has quiet operation.</li>
            <li> Every man wants the best, close shave with the least amount of effort wet or dry. I recommend this shaver for all applications. Amazon has been fantastic to work with so I&#x27;ll just keep supplying this shaver with replacements, as needed, thank you. :)</li>
            <li> when the razor arrived it was fully charged and it looked like somebody returned it.I started to use it and the razor kept stopping like it was overheating.I tried to shave with it and I give up and returned it.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews before purchasing it and everything printed was true.  My husband has had countless electric shavers over the years (he is now 84) and several different brands.  This one looks like a keeper.</li>
            <li> I had a Braum and it was not giving me a smooth  shave.  this one does.  It could be that I needed to replace the heads on the Braum but that costs also.  The only thing that I noticed about the panasonic is that the swival is only side to side  and not back to back  It also will not work if plugged in; you must unplug to use it.</li>
            <li> I like it. It does the job, it is very quiet. The head is flexible but only to the sides (left,right) not front,back. But overall very good product for the price. Does good shaving. Update after 3 years of using - excellent product.</li>
            <li> For the price I was expecting a mediocre shave, but I am very happy with result of this electric razor from Panasonic</li>
            <li> This is my third Panosonic and definitley the worst performing. The other two were great although they didn&#x27;t last long enough. (about 2 years each, still cheaper then blades) Pass on this one and spend more money. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It is hard for this machine to cut the hairs properly since they are so angled.</li>
            <li> Love this electric razor, it charges very quickly lasts long, gives a close clean shave,  I&#x27;d buy another if this wasn&#x27;t already great.</li>
            <li> The reviews you may read that state that the cheaper Panasonic shavers work just as good or better than the EXPENSIVE Panasonic shavers is true, Ive used Panasonic shavers for the last twenty years or so. My last one which is about two years old and was very expensive worked fine but fit and finish had much to be desired, after about two weeks the swivel lock for the head pretty much broke, long story shory this shaver and the other Panasonic I purchased were both under a $100.00 and about over a hundred dollars cheaper than the one with all the bells and whistles and work VERY well. The $49.00 shaver was only $4.00 more than the replacement foil and  blade combo for the expensive shaver. buy the cheaper Panasonics, they work great and last just as long as the big boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/12/14&lt;br /&gt; After using the 49.00 cheaper,slower motor panasonic razor I have found that the shavers with the super high speed motors are much better than the cheaper slower motor shavers, the cheaper ones work good but the higher speed motors work much better and they charge guicker. The panasonic ES-RT51 which is now going for about $59.00 was one of the more expensive shavers and now is at its 59.00 reduced price, charges in an hour and has the super high speed motor, i also own this one and for the price that it now is you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> I chose this razor from consumer report reviews.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very fine product.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone wanting a smooth quiet shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65 years old and this razor is the best I have ever used. Would highly recommend it. Better than Braun!! Cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> This shaver is excellent!! Closest shave, like if using a manual blade!! Charges quick cleans easy!! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> We purchased this shaver at the end of April, 2014, for my husband who has a VERY HEAVY beard.  Selling point from description and review was the easy care and the ability to just rinse entire unit under running water.  Never would I have expected this product to perform so well.  Not only does it work, but it will actually shave his heavy beard--even after several days&#x27; growth--to a smooth finish.  Along with his heavy beard, he has sensitive skin and most razors irritate it.  This one is through and gentle and amazing.  It is also very easy to clean up.  Hubby just rinses unit and screen under running water and places on a towel to dry.  It is now August, 2014 and after multiple times weekly use, we give this product six stars on a five-point scale!!</li>
            <li> Due to slower speed - 10,000 cycles per second - this shave is not comparable with other faster Panasonic shavers (13,000 or 14,000 cps) that I have owned.  However, the price being considerably lower, the results are pretty good.  The main reason I bought this model was because I happen to have two extra cutter/foil packages for another shaver that I was using and malfunctioned.  It is of course much cheaper to buy a new one such as this model - rather than getting the old one repaired, which is a pity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I do not like about this model is that the shaver head always floats; it cannot be locked.  I prefer locked head.</li>
            <li> it ok but not good as i though it wod be</li>
            <li> I am a female. I bought this shaver to use on my legs. Works pretty good. Ladies electric razors are such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is at least my 4th Panasonic wet/dry razor, they are very durable &amp; this model charges in about 30 min or less.</li>
            <li> I got what I pay for , doesn&#x27;t shave good</li>
            <li> Did not work properly.</li>
            <li> Literally perfect. Exactly as described, I occasionally nick myself with the trimmer. No complaints otherwise.</li>
            <li> As good as advertised.</li>
            <li> I bought the predecessor (the ES8043SC) to this razor and it is awesome. It holds a charge and cuts just as well as it did seven years ago. I imagine this one is just as good.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I have ever used.  Much better than any of the other major name brands.  I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Two things I know about Panny shavers: (1) they are good and (2) they are expensive. About the time I needed to replace my Remington rotary shaver (which I think so-so) I saw this Panny shaver on sale for 40 bucks at AMZ. That was an exceptional steal! At first I was a little iffy about the idea of wet/dry shaver. But since the shaver is designed for both uses I tried it with gel anyway. For some reason I had a few minor cuts for the first few uses. After that I just used it solely for dry shaves. No more cut. If I can summary my experience in one statement: I have the closest shave in my life! It&#x27;s just that good. It does a good job on tough areas like chin and neck. One note about the LCD battery display. Though it gives readings of 0-100 % it does so in 20 % increments (0, 20, 40 and so on). No big deal. Even with it flashing at 0 % urging me to charge it, it still has enough juice for me to complete my shave. Bravo!</li>
            <li> Got this for my son and like all Panasonic ES razors its a great one easy to use and clean and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Great value for the money...I use it to keep my head and face shaved close.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the shower with shaving gel every day.  BTW..30-45 minutes use in&lt;br /&gt;the shower only uses about 20% of the charge.  Run it right under the fawcet&lt;br /&gt;to clean then take it apart to dry...no problems at all.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES RT51S gets a four star rating for providing a close shave that is nearly as good as the top of the line models offered by Panasonic. The RT51S is equipped with 30 degree blades like the more expensive shavers but the motor is a conventional type instead of a linear motor. The linear motors found in the more expensive Panasonic shavers offer a closer shave but the RT51S fits my budget. And unlike the top of the line models, the rechargeable batteries in the RT51S can be replaced.</li>
            <li> After three months:  Fits my hand well / comfortable to hold.  Good weight and well balanced.  Very close shave for an electric from day one.  Charge easily lasts about a week.  Can&#x27;t use while plugged in but it charges in about an hour.  Easy to clean.  Have not tried to &amp;#34;wet shave&amp;#34;.  Trimmer angle makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> I wanted a shaver that didn&#x27;t pull and worked well. This met all my wants and more. It is such a smooth shave, it is quiet, it has a great pop-up trimmer that really works, and it is easy to clean. I would recommend this  ( and have) to anyone liking for a good shaver!</li>
            <li> Excellent close shave particularly when used wet.  Good battery life and easy to clean under running water.  This was a great purchase considering the vast range of prices and shaver types available.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Even though shaver was showing full charge it did not work all of the time.  Sometimes would just stop working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bounced back and forth between various shaver brands and models and razors but this is the solution that I&#x27;ll stay with. It is a pleasure to use this. It shaves close and never bites and I get a week&#x27;s worth of shaves out of a charge. If you haven&#x27;t used a wet shaver before (as I had not) it is a little weird to apply an electric razor to your face covered with shaving cream. But, oh, does it work well. I started with Edge for the shaving cream but found that this gel-based cream does not rinse quickly from the razor. I then tried Gillette Foamy but then ended up with Barabsol. The Gillette is actually too &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; and the shaver kinda pushes the foam around my face. The Barbasol, on the other hand, provides all the glide that I want but, curiously, is more or less &amp;#34;erased&amp;#34; by the shaver as it glides over it, making for a tidy and satisfying shave. I&#x27;ve been using this little puppy for seven months and it works as good as the first day. I like it so much that I bought one for my wife&#x27;s dad.</li>
            <li> side blade broke the first time I tried to use it. sent email to amazon almost a week ago with no response</li>
            <li> Works better than my Braun and hold a longer charge. happy with it.</li>
            <li> Does as good a job as my previous Remington shaver that was half the cost.  This one is less noisy but cleaning it is more difficult.</li>
            <li> This thing sucks stick with norelco. I bought it thinking hey this looks like a cool razor that you can use wet. The reviews looked good so I though hey its great. Turns out this thing doesn&#x27;t shave half as well as a $20 norelco (the model I was using earlier). I had to apply more pressure to get some sort of result and doing so resulted in a world of pain. If you want my opinion don&#x27;t buy, it just causes more pain, and that&#x27;s why I returned it.</li>
            <li> Pitiful excuse for a razor. Very poor shave. I purchased because of low price and because I thought it might be comparable to what I had. I had a Remington F5790 and this piece of crap doesn&#x27;t come close to it&#x27;s shave.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my grandson. He said he really likes the shave that he gets and that he doesn&#x27;t have to recharge it every time.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy to have recived it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver as a present for my husband.  He said it was ok, but did not cut as well as Panasonics he has had in the past.</li>
            <li> I have had Norelco twice, Remington, and finally went back to the razor. Then I ordered this electric shaver.  It is extremely quiet, give an amazingly close shave... and oh, yes... this is the first electric shaver I have ever had that has a trimmer that actually works!</li>
            <li> It is very good in recharge the power however it is not able to shave with a complete and clean effect.</li>
            <li> Excellent product,fast delivery,great seller..thanks.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Phillips Norelco Razor for years (the type with the three spinning disks), and I could never get a good shave.  I always missed many hairs, and if I got too close to the skin, it began to burn.&lt;br /&gt;This great razor consistently gives a close shave, and feels great doing it!  I occasionally miss hairs, and it struggles with longer hairs, but it has a built in sideburns trimmer that can be used to get the longer hairs down.  I have found that to shave effectively you must pay more attention to the &amp;#34;grain&amp;#34; of the hairs, but the result is much cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;The wet/dry capability is liberating, and it feels great both wet and dry.  I get concerned about water getting into little nooks and crannies and getting moldy, but after a month this hasn&#x27;t happened.&lt;br /&gt;The battery indicator is actually surprisingly helpful as well.  I will never recharge too often or too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor, and for the price, it&#x27;s tough to turn down.  I would buy this again and recommend it to a friend or family member.</li>
            <li> So far the razor is doing well and meets all of my expectations</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my son and he can now shave without cutting his face up!</li>
            <li> Great Razor, I would rate is at a 4.5. I was a former Phillips user for many many years. Decided to try an Arc 3 8103  and loved it. Well my wife took it for doing herself so I thought I would try and arc 4. I did not like the large head so I tried another newer Phillips. After using the Panasonic there was no comparison. Then thought I would get this razor for my wife and take my original Arc 3 back.Well I decided to try this and really like it. For my face the flatter head surface does a slightly better job than the 8103 plus it is much quieter. I would say it is not perfect but darn close especially for the price.For the people that say it does not work at all dont believe them. everyone&#x27;s face is different but I really doubt that is did not work for them or they did not try it for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> great value. shaves close, charges fast and very easy to clean. can use wet or dry.</li>
            <li> OMG, my husband has been using this new shaver for a week now and he can&#x27;t stop raving about how great it is.  He has curly hair and uses a pre-shave lotion and gets a great, fast, close enough shave.  he is recommending it to all the men in our family.</li>
            <li> Needed something for my son with sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use a razor without it tearing up his face.  I looked at so many and compared them all.  Settled on the Panasonic as it is wet/dry, holds a decent charge, and seems to be everything he needed.  I have heard no complaints from him, so it must be working well!</li>
            <li> My husband like this. It leaves smooth shave. I will surely recommend it. Good price for good quality . Thank you.</li>
            <li> I used to own a Remington  rotary razor cordless. When the battery went you had nothing. Took hours to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ES-Rt51-S3 razor charges in a hour for a full charge. Shaves close. Still have to get used using  it, like&lt;br /&gt;the size of the handle and shape. I am sure it won&#x27;t take long. Its much quitier than old Remington. This model is a good mid range and entry level into the Panasonic family. So far very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill</li>
            <li> This is just the razor i was looking for it does everything specified and and a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to clean and the charge indicator  is a plus</li>
            <li> this is a great shaver for the money if your looking for the best in a Panasonic get the arc 4 if your looking to save some money then you cant go wrong with this shaver</li>
            <li> This was the first electric razor that I&#x27;ve used, so maybe my expectations were a little bit too high. I don&#x27;t have very thick facial hair at all, so I figured this would do the job without an issue, but the shave with this razor isn&#x27;t very close at all. I find myself going over the same spots multiple times and still not being able to get a good shave. Even after multiple passes, I still have very visible facial hair. It doesn&#x27;t even come close to a $1 disposable razor. Just forget trying to get a close shave around the neck area. This razor would be fine if you just want to clean yourself up every few days, but won&#x27;t cut it for jobs that require you to be clean shaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;1) Battery lasts a long time and charges quickly.&lt;br /&gt;2) Being able to get it wet or use it in the shower is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;1) I can&#x27;t get a close shave to save my life.</li>
            <li> Not good. It vibrates like crazy and cut my skin. I quit using it after a couple weeks. Old time technology, avoid it.</li>
            <li> I have coarse hair, so it takes me longer to shave than some. With its center cutter (which gets the long hairs well), it&#x27;s equivalent to my former, more expensive shaver (also a Panasonic). It does the job well. Since it takes me longer to shave, I get less than some reviewers â€” about 6 shaves on a charge while traveling (at home its constantly plugged into the charger). Compact &amp; light weight. Why not 5 stars? That would indicate perfection, and I&#x27;m a hard grader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t rate it&#x27;s wet performance since I always use it dry, right after washing my face (I have oily skin, so a clean face gives me the best shave). However, its wet feature makes it very easy to clean. I just get it wet, put a drop of dish soap on the cutter, run it for a few seconds and rinse it off. (The cutting head comes off easily to let it dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because the blades in my old one had gotten dull and I discovered (to my surprise and annoyance) that I could buy a new shaver (with warranty) for just a bit more than the price of a replacement head for the old one. I don&#x27;t like our &amp;#34;throw away&amp;#34; society, but it made more economic sense to replace the whole thing. This shaver&#x27;s price/performance is an excellent value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My take on why some shavers are SO expensive is that they&#x27;re easy and obvious gift items for men. I&#x27;ve used very expensive shavers before, and they don&#x27;t perform any better than this one. So my advice is to go for brand quality, features you need and price.</li>
            <li> Horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dark, thick hair.  This razor leaves spots on my neck literally untouched, despite a half-dozen passes over the same, highly visible coin-sized patch of hair.  I&#x27;ve actually had to supplement this with a safety razor to clean my neckline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery leaves something to be desired, but would otherwise be acceptable if not for the blades poor performance.  Also, worth noting the charger and razor do not fit inside the bag provided.  A small detail, but no reason not to mention it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replaced after just 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Good product... recomended 100%</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an old electric razor. Extremely happy with the purchase. Not all the bells and whistles add the more expensive models, but what is a razor all about. A good close shave, which is what this razor gives. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor.</li>
            <li> Worked well for the first year. Now it only holds a few days of charge on the battery.</li>
            <li> With the caveat that I am someone with a very light beard, I am very satisfied with its performance.  It&#x27;s even a little quieter than my previous model.</li>
            <li> After using Panasonic Wet &amp; Dry shavers for years and trying many different models I thought I had found the one I would stay with but low and behold they stopped making it so I tried the ES-RT51-S which I received about a month ago. After using this shaver for about a month I am a bit disappointed with the shaver as it&#x27;s twice as much as the one I was using before and does not deliver as good of a shave, although it is better than most other  brands as they can not be used in the shower the way I use mine. Since I can use this shaver in the shower I am giving it a Three.</li>
            <li> Light years beyond my old razor.  And for the price? Amazing.</li>
            <li> This shaver is excellent, I am using electric razors for more than 20 years, this one is really really makes the cut, very close shave, in the beginning I had some irritation, maybe because the foil isn&#x27;t hyper-allergic, or something else, but after a week or so, the skin got used to it, huge upgrade from 30 series, nice motor buzzing! I use it without any foam or shaving cream, and always DRY.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver as a surprise Christmas gift (meaning I hadn&#x27;t picked it out or even expected to get one). Another review notes that the battery life is extremely poor. Based on my experience with it, however, I must conclude that he had a faulty unit. In fact, the battery life is one of the most impressive things about this device. Its capacity is indicated in 20% increments on a little LCD panel on the front, and it took a couple shaves to even reach 80%. It also retains its charge pretty well. Personally, I&#x27;d prefer 10% increments, but at least a &amp;#34;plug&amp;#34; icon starts blinking when the device needs a recharge. It also won&#x27;t operate when plugged in, but this is standard for wet-dry shavers, as a safety measure. The lower part of the shaver becomes slightly warm during recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll also notice in the promotional image that there&#x27;s two black buttons on the side of the head. There are corresponding buttons on the other side of the shaver&#x27;s head. The top set releases the foil (to replace it if damaged, or to wash it separately), while the lower set partially removes the housing around the head, so you can more easily clean the blade assembly. I definitely recommend keeping a stiff-bristle brush on hand, because running water won&#x27;t clean it up completely. The head itself is not removable. During use, it can tilt left and right and can be pushed in slightly, so it has some &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; when applying pressure to stubborn hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame that Panasonic forces you to buy proprietary battery replacements from them at $20 a pop. It&#x27;s another $20 or so to replace the blades. And there&#x27;s the foil as well. Strikes me as a bit expensive in the long run, considering how basic this shaver is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: If you pass the shaver over some hair several times and it doesn&#x27;t get cut, the hair is probably too long to get properly caught by the blades. Use the beard trimmer on it, then shave that spot like usual. The hair should disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8/9/2015: Sadly, this shaver conked out a few months ago, despite infrequent usage. Even with it plugged in for several hours, I could only get a faint hum and no blade movement. So I have to downgrade this review from the four-star rating of &amp;#34;I like it&amp;#34; to the two-star rating of &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like it.&amp;#34; Maybe it just needs a new battery, but I&#x27;m not interested in paying another chunk of money to find out. It shouldn&#x27;t need another this soon., this shaver conked out a few months ago, despite infrequent usage.

            <li> About 15 years ago, I switched to a Panasonic wet and dry electric razor and was very happy with it until it died after about 5 years. I decided to try Norelco on the advice of a friend, and stayed with Norelco for my next 2 shavers, for about 10 years. I replaced the blades yearly, as advertised, and was pretty happy with the results. When I went to order new blades, again, in November, I decided to give this new Panasonic wet/dry another try. Am I glad I did! First of all, I don&#x27;t have a super heavy beard, just a normal, have to shave daily type of beard. I&#x27;m getting very close shaves (much closer than Norelco, without the occasional chaffing irritation of the skin)that last all day with very little effort. I normally shave with  water, hot or cold. Yes, you don&#x27;t even need shave cream. I rinse off the head afterward with cold water, dry off, and put back in the supplied cloth pouch. I shave 7 days a week and it recharges in less than an hour. The L.E.D. in the handle displays charge remaining. I usually still have 60% showing when I recharge after 7 days. This thing shaves as close as a new blade the first time. I love it. I know it&#x27;ll cost about $35 to replace the blades and foil in a year or so, but I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll be using this shaver for quite a while. Give this shaver a try, you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent device. I have used it ever since it arrived... Would recomment it  to all!</li>
            <li> I have nothing but good things to say about my previous Panasonic shaver, which I used for 7 years. The only reason why I stopped using that one was because I lost it in a hotel, rather than it &amp;#34;giving out&amp;#34; after all those years. So when I bought the ES-RT51-S, I thought I was getting a better model, mainly because it had a battery meter whereas my old shaver did not. Boy was I wrong...this shaver takes 3, 4 or sometimes 5 passes to cleanly shave a given area, whereas my older one required MAXIMUM two passes. And using this one, I noticed that a part of my face began to show skin irritation after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I found out that this one uses the &amp;#34;conventional&amp;#34; motor rather than the &amp;#34;linear drive&amp;#34; motor that my older one had. I can only kick myself for assuming that this one had the same type motor. In my view, Linear Drive is what makes Panasonic shavers superior to ALL other brands out there. So I ended up ditching this one and bought the ES8103S, which is the cheapest Linear Drive model with a battery meter that I am aware of. And the difference has been like night and day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize that different shavers can have different effect depending on who&#x27;s using them, as everyone has different faces and facial hairs. But if you want to make a safer bet for your money, I&#x27;d say go with a Linear Drive.</li>
            <li> Works great, charges quickly. 3 blade is misleading, counting trimmer as third blade.</li>
            <li> Works just fine . Have to press more that I would like.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it had come with a cleaning kit !</li>
            <li> Good product does good job . Purchased for my Father he likes way it shaves.</li>
            <li> This is a very good razor; to summarize:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Close, smooth shave with little or no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;  Battery recharges in less than an hour&lt;br /&gt;  After 8 days/shaves, battery was at 60% charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Replacement parts cost as much or more than a new razor and this is where I deducted one star. Panasonic, like many large corporations does not quite &amp;#34;walk the walk&amp;#34;. Its environmental statement says that it will &amp;#34;practice prudent, sustainable use of earth&#x27;s natural resources and the protection of our environment&amp;#34;. Can&#x27;t really do that when your parts pricing policy attempts to encourage existing customers to throw millions of older products into landfills and buy new. I mean, if they can produce and price a complete razor for less than $50, why is the foil and blade set over $35?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With 7 billion people in the world today, you&#x27;d think there are plenty of potential new customers coming up for new products and they might consider revising their pricing policy on repair parts to bring it in line with their stated environmental policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Very good razor; could be better with more reasonable long term support.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, but it does what it is supposed to do.  This is my second Panasonic I have had in the last 8 years, and I have never been disappointed by either machine.</li>
            <li> Used less than a year and I now need to charge after two shaves!</li>
            <li> Handy shaver works well if you use EVERYDAY. As other reviews state will not cut longer whiskers or Grey hair either. I always need to finish off with a razor. But overall good wet shaver. First few shaves take it easy it will or it did burn a few places on my lower neck and it states well take about a month to get used to it. Gonna give it a try with electric shave as soon as I buy some but wet gelled shaves are good.</li>
            <li> Does a good job even with daily use. Easy to clean and maintain. Each charge good enough for five shaves.</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic wet/dry shavers for about 5 years and my new ES-RT51-S 3 gives me the best shave yet. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Time will tell the true value of the product. So far the razor has exceeded my expectation, a good&lt;br /&gt;value, for the money spent.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic ES-RT51-S I have owned, the first one I purchased almost eleven years ago...It still works fairly well, except the battery has deteriorated to the point I cannot get two complete shaves without recharging. I have never replaced the blades and I can still get a decent shave but it takes longer...My new Panasonic is excellent, I get the smoothest, cut free shave ever, better than multiple blade razors and the cut throat razor at the barbers...I recommend this product to male and female alike, my wife is now using my first Panasonic and is quite happy with it..</li>
            <li> After reading several women&#x27;s reviews of this shaver I decided to give it a whirl.  It&#x27;s quiet, does not pinch and I love the battery charge indicator.  I only gave it 4 stars as I do find I have to make more passes over areas than I did with my old shaver.  Overall, though, it does a decent job leaving legs smooth and soft and at a very good price for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Beatiful. Works great.  Nice and quiet.</li>
            <li> Great razor, very easy to use and holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> So much better  than the last electric razor I owned. Gets very close, and with significantly less irritation than the last razor I owned. The battery charge also lasts for quite a while. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This replaced a Norelco electric razor that I had used for a number of years.  After several weeks of use, I like the Panasonic better.  It appears to give a better trim, and is a little easier to control.  Overall I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Works wet or dry. Gave me the best shave next to a blade and no cuts. Best shave when used wet, but either way it will give you a great shave. Gets the hairs on neck unlike most electrics. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great buy , give your face at least 3 or 4 days of trying this razor , letting your face get used to this product and then you will , as smooth has a baby&#x27;s behind lol</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Dad. Love that it can be used wet or dry. He is older and has trouble seeing. This razor allows him to safely shave himself without all the fuss. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic wet/dry shaver for the past 10 years and love them.  Their design has not changed much, but they are very easy to use.  If you are looking for a wet/dry shaver this is the brand to get.</li>
            <li> Great shaver! this is my second one.</li>
            <li> Good charge, and shaves well with the main blades.  The only downside is I&#x27;d like the beard trimmer to be wider.  It feels too narrow and flimsy to be of any use.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor based on the strength of the reviews on here. The reviews of this razor compared more favourably than the equivalent from Philips or Braun. I can only conclude that Panasonic have sold me a razor with faulty blades or a refurbished razor with blunt blades because the performance has been very bad indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took away the foil to make sure the blades were not obstructed by anything, everything was clean and appeared to be in order. The blades were also moving as they should when the razor was fully charged when I turned on the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An electric razor rarely gets as close as a wet shave, and that&#x27;s fine. However, my facial hair grows slower than most of my friends-heck, my 14 year old cousin&#x27;s facial hair is heavier than mine and I&#x27;m 22. This razor could not even stand up to a daily shave of my moderate hair. Even the long hair trimmer could not remove a few millimetres of stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, forget this razor. The market has many choices, this particular razor is not adequate for even the most basic of needs.</li>
            <li> This is what you would expect from Panasonic. The shave is nice and close, and it&#x27;s easy to clean up. Bought as second razor for vacation. Charged it at home and it lasted 7 day&#x27;s before needing to be recharged.Protective cover seems a little weak, but I&#x27;m sure it will last.</li>
            <li> Good shave, easy to clean, great value</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic shaver I&#x27;ve owned. The first was an ES4026NC which was, and still is, quite good but it lacked the cutter between the two foils. This new shaver gives a really nice shave and has better battery life than the ES4026NC. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of electric razors (Braun, Norelco, Remington and Walgreens) and this Panasonic is probably the best value available. The foil on the older razor is still going great after about 1.5 years use every day.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping but quality of razor wasn&#x27;t very good</li>
            <li> Am on blood thinner and was told to use electric razor. This one works great - clean close shave with little hassle wet or dry. Does not cut long hair very well, but simple matter to use pop out clipper for that. Recharges fast and tells you what charge remains - 80% 60% etc. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I am a female and was in the market for an electric razor for shaving my legs. All the reviews I read on Amazon for the &amp;#34;lady&amp;#34; razors said that the motor sucked and they generally weren&#x27;t worth it and recommended this model. It&#x27;s a nice razor and all but it doesn&#x27;t really give the close shave you&#x27;d get with a real razor. I was looking for a time saver in the mornings to not have to get out my actual razor but I end up doing that most days as this doesn&#x27;t get the stuble. It does have a flip out trimmer which is helpful for my bikini line and I do like that you can use this wet or dry shaving, I just don&#x27;t like that you don&#x27;t get a close, smooth shave as with a real razor.</li>
            <li> great razor, fast, cuts closely, easy on the face, fast charging, holds the charge, excellent!</li>
            <li> great do just what they say</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite alright. Power is strong and the shaving is clean, but sometimes hurts the skin, not as smooth as the Philps I used before.</li>
            <li> No doubt, this is the best three blade shaver I have had the pleasure of owning, my third. The previous was also a Panasonic, this is what brought me back to this brand. I love the quick charges as well as the power remaining screen. I take leisurely shaves, probably longer than most without irritation. I do use Williams Lectric Shave. Great buy!</li>
            <li> this shaver simply does not work for me. i have used it few times with same poor result. each time i had to finish work using disposable plastic shaver. it is big, heavy and very uncomfortable in use.</li>
            <li> It does not perform as expected.&lt;br /&gt;Does not shave closed and you expend a lot of time trying to get a decent shave that never get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used just about every Panasonic wet/dry shaver they make. Without exception, they have all failed after approximately two years (just past the warranty period, ironically.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased this model to replace a dead 82xx model, and found that it is equal in shave quality to the very expensive Panasonic models with all the self-cleaning jazz. In fact, I don&#x27;t intend to do anything more than basic rinses any more, and occasionally clean underneath the cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, I bought the high-dollar version last time, thinking that I&#x27;d be compulsive about cleaning it, thereby causing it to last forever.  I meticulously cleaned it, replaced the foil and cutter, etc., and it still died in predictable fashion after 25 months.  I actually laughed when it stopped cutting in mid-shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The failure mode on all 5 of my Panasonics (yes, 10.5 years worth!) has been the center cutting bar mechanism. The plastic piece which extends out from the head and moves the blade back and forth eventually wears out inside the head.  Although it will still vibrate, it does not put enough force on the cutting bar and it will just remain motionless.  Replacing the blade(s) has no effect on the longevity of this part.  Adding oil to the blades doesn&#x27;t seem to make it last longer either.  It is quite obviously designed to fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried an experiment with keeping the same blade for about a year, then comparing it with a new blade (foil, cutter, etc.)  I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell the difference in closeness, however, the new foil seemed to move more smoothly over my face and maybe it had an easier time when I&#x27;d let my beard grow out a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, I have a backup rotary shaver that I keep charged.  It cuts slower and not quite as closely, but keeps me from getting to work half-shaved when I forget to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I will summarize thus:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver provides an excellent, close shave.  It requires many, many passes over the same area in different directions due to its design, but it eventually does the job. If you shave every day, it works much better. I have used it with just water, no water, and with the Total Shaving solution oil drops, and by far the oil drops are the best possible choice (for me.)  That&#x27;s different for everyone, but if you haven&#x27;t tried it, I recommend a sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my rotary shaver, the Panasonic is slightly louder in volume.  The buzzing is considerably quieter with this model than with my 82xx, and that surprised me when I first turned it on.  The rotary takes fewer passes over the same area of my face, however it doesn&#x27;t quite get as close as the Panasonic, so I&#x27;d rather take the extra two minutes and get a closer cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer is handy and effective.  My main complaint with it is that it is awkwardly located, making really accurate cuts somewhat difficult.  If you use it often you&#x27;ll get used to it.  I use it for emergency sideburn trims, but I&#x27;d probably stay away from any precise mustache work at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other comparison is with disposable razor shaving.  I rarely shave with them, but they are exceptionally close, and once the blood stops flowing, I notice the shaver cut isn&#x27;t quite a match for a good old Mach 3.  The Mach 3/4/5, whatever they are now, is tremendously faster, very messy, and tough for me to use in a shower with no mirror.  For me, since my skin never gets used to it (tried for many years), I prefer the electric overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, bottom line.  Get the cheap Panasonic, and if you want wet/dry then this is the one.  If you just need dry, then you can go even cheaper and still get the exact same shave quality.  Don&#x27;t let the gimmicks fool you, it&#x27;s the same plastic, same motor, same mechanism, same shave. You can make a difference by choosing some skin preparation oil and keeping the blade basically clean.</li>
            <li> Never again will I replace bladeson a electric shaver .new is the way to go . I also started shaving wet and it is a significant improvement. It is really  a shame that Panasonic. Does sell replacement blades at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Purchased this razor as it was advertised as a 3 blade. However it has only 2 replacable blades,and some kind of \\&quot;stationary\\&quot; thing in the middle that Panasonic calls a blade. However it does a decent job of cutting and has a nice grip.</li>
            <li> Working VERY WELL! Buy it.</li>
            <li> happy with this product!!</li>
            <li> Smoothest Shave and good battery life. easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt; i think panasonic make best shaver much better then Braun(over price) and Norelco( did not work well at all)</li>
            <li> I originally bought one for my dad when he was in hospice and had tremors in his hands and still wanted to shave himself and this worked very well for him. It made him happy to be able to do some self care with this easy to use shaver! For making him happy I give it an A+++++!&lt;br /&gt;My husband also uses one after a lifetime of throw away razors and he loves it as well. It was hard to get him to try it but he was very pleased with the ease and end result.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking of getting one for my son for Christmas now.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for gentleman that has poor hand control or is eldery and has a hard time with a traditional razor for sure.</li>
            <li> This was my fist electric shaver so I have zero experience here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this because my skin gets easily irritated from regular razor; my neck was the worst, so I figured switching to an electric razor might do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;Although I have noticed less irritation when using this shaver, especially around my mouth and neck, it was fairly difficult and time consuming to complete a shave.  I am not sure whether my hair type isn&#x27;t very compatible, but I have noticed it did a slightly better job at certain lengths. What I did for a while was use a trimmer on my face and then shave with this and even doing didn&#x27;t really give me the best results. I found myself at times still going back with a regular razor for some touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently only use this now to shave my mustache when it starts looking crusty and just let my beard be for a couple days and then use a regular razor again whenever I need to get a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend trying another product, I might try some of the higher end models and hopefully they get the job done. Since I&#x27;m only 22, I think I will wait a couple more years for that investment.</li>
            <li> this shaver is pretty good, considering i&#x27;ve been a mach 3 guy for as long as i can remember.  i&#x27;ve never had an electric razor before, because i never had a reason to switch. but ingrown hairs caused by blades have caused me to try something new, and this razor has not let me down. i&#x27;ve used it for a little over a month and am pretty happy with it. it gets really close, better than i expected, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like i thought it would. it&#x27;s a wet/dry shaver, but i&#x27;ve only used it dry so can&#x27;t comment on wet use. my only complaint, and it&#x27;s a very minor one, is that you can&#x27;t use it with the charger plugged in, but that&#x27;s probably because it&#x27;s a wet/dry, so they don&#x27;t want you to get electrocuted. understandable in my opinion. that&#x27;s why it gets 4 stars. it charges fast, shaves fast, shaves close, doesn&#x27;t hurt, and it&#x27;s cheap! win, win, win, win!</li>
            <li> Very pleased...great value on Amazon. Works great. I get a close shave. I have had good Panasonic shavers in the past and I would say that this might be the best of them all.</li>
            <li> Always had a triple head type shaver and when it died I thought I would try this \\&quot;foil\\&quot; type. I did read that it didn&#x27;t give a close shave unless you spent alot of time with it. Its true. My old triple took about a minute. This one takes several. Furthermore , all those passes leaves your face feeling raw. I don&#x27;t use the wet feature although I thought it might be cool when I bought it. But what I found out is if I am going to go wet I will just use a razor and shaving cream. Close shave and less clean up. Waited too long to return it so I will just live with it. It does appear well made however and holds a charge for what seems like a long time.</li>
            <li> In general I would have to say that this shaver does a good job providing a nice close shave, especially for the money spent on it. However, there are several negatives. First, when using dry, you do have to shave slowly to get all the hairs the first time. This is not a big deal but notable. Second, in terms of design, the pop up trimmer does not allow use with the main heads as some other shavers to grab those stubborn neck hairs. These negatives though are offset when using as a wet shaver as the unit gives a closer shave when using wet. On balance, I am happy with this shaver.</li>
            <li> I have been using this unit for several weeks now and am very happy with the results.  This unit gives me a very good shave and leaves my face feeling good.  I love the feel of it in my hands and the most shocking thing to me is the life of the charge.  I don&#x27;t charge this thing but every other week.  I have never had an electric shaver that I used every day that held a charge for two weeks, to me that is just awesome.  So as I stated this unit feels good in your hands while shaving, gives a great shave and has a killer battery.  Everything I was looking for in a new electric shaver.  I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a wet &amp; dry shaver look no further. This Panasonic shaver provides a smooth close shave. It is lightweight and fits comfortably in my hand. I like the LED battery indicator on the front of the shaver that lets me know when I need to recharge the unit. Seller shipped this product in a timely fashion. As a matter of fact, I received faster than expected. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Just got this in. I was expecting it to pivot front to back but it just picots side to side. Provides a nice, close shave. I kind of wish I ordered the style that has the three circular shaving pads for more contour and pivot action but oh well. I got what I payed for and it does the job. My boyfriend on the other hand loves it! (No, I&#x27;m not a female)</li>
            <li> mediocre product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I am trying to switch from a blade razor to an electric razor.  I purchased a Norelco from the big blue store and it was so, so.  But the Norelco seemed to be in slow motion, as far as the blade, and it grabbed a lot, along with a weird charging instruction.  So I returned it and purchased this Panasonic razor.  Well this razor beats the Norelco in that is has a higher speed and doesn&#x27;t grab, but I&#x27;m not too impressed with either one of them.  But going back to my original plan of switching from blade to electric, after four weeks I am going back to the blade.  It takes a lot longer to shave with the electric and the shave is no where near as close as a blade razor...you always feel that you need a shave.  But it&#x27;s easy to grab the Panasonic shaver and shave while watching the news, on the throne, or anywhere...even in your car.  So I&#x27;m putting the Panasonic in my travel bag and going back to the blade.</li>
            <li> love my Panasonic ES-RT51-S3 it does exactly as it is programed to do .smooth quick with ease</li>
            <li> Its ok for now. I wish I would have spent the extra money for a 5 or at the least 4 blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really coarse facial hair and go through razors fast as a young man in my 30s. The razor leaves a lot of hairs behind on the neck. You have to go over and over the area to get  a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try the 5 blade and see if the cost is worth it. I want a razor like shave from and electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works but if you can afford the extra 50 or 100 then pay it.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver of the many I&#x27;ve owned over 50+ years.  Long battery endurance (over a week), with an accurate % Charge indicator so you aren&#x27;t surprised with a drained battery when you need it most.  Comfortable, close shaves and quieter than most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, the key to longer cutter and head life for any &amp;#34;wet and dry&amp;#34; shaver is to never use it wet because even fine stainless steel corrodes more readily in the presence of water.  Just clean frequently with a soft brush and compressed air.  And, with replacement shaver heads so expensive (all brands), your best approach on one in this moderate price range is to use it as long you get satisfactory shaves then buy a new one.  That gets you a new device, under warranty, for very little more than the replacement parts.  Panasonic shavers are a great value.</li>
            <li> ItÂ´s just what I wanted. In 3 minutes you have a perfect shave. ITS JUST AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li> I found that this Panasonic is quiet and powerful. It got the job done quickly and conformed to my face well. It charged within an hour and the numerical battery indicator was a nice touch.  Using a shaving gell felt really good with this shaver. Contact was smooth and effortless.  Best of all, I did not experience the typical razor burn that has plagued me for years. I attribute this more to the Panasonic&#x27;s design and less to the wet shave. Using a razor with shaving cream has also produced razor burn, particularly under my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I am going to sound like a bit of a shill because I have only used this product recently, but I have shaved with several different brands and models of electric shavers over the years. What I have not done is used a wet electric shaver before. I think that being able to use a wet shaver compared to a dry one will produce a superior shave regardless of brand. But the Panasonic is a superior shaver compared to others in its class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8/15/12: After using this shaver for a couple of weeks I feel that I have to add to my original review. The honeymoon is over and I think that I am a bit more objective.  This shaver continues to forego any razor burn, even under the chin, which is a major positive. I have experienced some pretty bad shaver burns over the years using other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the Panasonic&#x27;s shaving acumen is about the same as the Braun while slightly less than the Norelco&#x27;s regardless of whether I shave wet or dry. This unit has more difficulty catching longer hairs, even if I miss shaving for two days, than the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still like this shaver very much. It allows me to shave with a gel and prevent razor burn which is a major plus for me. I have to shave daily in order to keep stubble length in the range that is comfortable for this unit, but I&#x27;m not sure that is such a bad thing. I have also found that the battery life is quite good and the unit is very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For tougher beards or less frequent shavers a Norelco might suit that person better. Just my opinion, but now it&#x27;s out there. An ode to the joys of male grooming.clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For tougher beards or less frequent shavers a Norelco might suit that person better. Just my opinion, but now it&#x27;s out there. An ode to the joys of male grooming.</li>
            <li> Everyone raved about this, females included- so I (a female) purchased the item, however- I&#x27;d love my money back. It does not cut as good as other reviewers claimed, I wanted it for my legs and I feel like I have to go back and forth on the same spot 100x and yet they still feel somewhat spikey.</li>
            <li> Update: 9/8/2016 -  Battery is beginning to fail when display shows 60%. I purchased this unit 33 months ago and used it regularly. Great travel and daily razor. Works well wet or dry. Cost of replacement foil and blades is almost as much as a new unit. For the last year or so, I shaved less of my face due to growing a beard, so have not purchased foil or blades. So, I purchased a new unit as a better option. Battery life is not as good as my former Panasonic referenced below that lasted over 8 years, but price is very competitive for the quality of shave.   8-9 years ago, I purchased a similar Panasonic razor from a now defunct popular catalog company in one of their retail stores.  The razor traveled the world and the US with me...always performing perfectly...wet or dry.  This model is very close to my original model and it shaves better.  The old razor simply quit while I was shaving a few weeks ago.  I was sad to let it go.  This one arrived quickly via Amazon Prime and has continued my positive experience with Panasonic wet/dry shavers. You can spend much more money on other models, but this one works very well on my thick beard.  The pop up trimmer does a reasonable job of trimming around my goatee and back of my neck.  This razor comes with a bag to put it in when traveling. I prefer the leather zip case that came with the older razor and use it instead.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my brother for Christmas.  He loves it.  It said it is the closest shave he has ever gotten.  He usually uses a razor and still feels stubbles.  He said that with this shaver it was so close that he didn&#x27;t have any razor stubble afterward.  I was going to get a Braun, but other blogs said this was even better than a Braun.  This was also cheaper than a Braun and thought I would take a chance.  Glad I did because he is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a year and a half ago, a replacement for a still-functioning Norelco, which I had used for 15 years.  I thought I would try a foil-type razor.  I am disappointed in both Panasonic and foil razors.  I have only recently gotten a decent shave, after resorting to a pre-shave lotion (Afta).  The biggest problem is battery life.  The original batteries died after a little over a year.  I found a vendor on ebay (cost-$23), and replaced them myself, which was a tricky procedure that I managed to complete successfully. The design is special, although in reality they are just AA batteries with little prongs welded on, Ironically, I pulled my old Norelco out of the drawer while waiting for the new batteries, and it performed fine.  Now, after a few months on new batteries, they died rather quickly a few days ago, so I&#x27;m suspecting another battery death is imminent. So I&#x27;m shopping Norelcos in anticipation of another failure.  My \\&quot;old reliable\\&quot; Norelco is still working on 15 year old batteries, only issue is replacement blades are getting tough to find. I might just find someone on ebay that has a bunch of blades, buy a supply and keep the old one running. But buying another Panasonic, or making further investments in this one, is definitely not an option.</li>
            <li> I am a long time Norelco user.  I got tired of them dying as soon as the warranty expires.  It is taking me to get used to this.  It is easier to hold with my difficulty with my hands.  I like it in that the on/off switch is a push type and not a button type that on the Norelco if you held it wrong you kept turning it off.  I don&#x27;t seem to get the razor burn as I did before. It has lots of power.  The head doesn&#x27;t pop open and dumps it contents all over.  The unit seems well built.  Only had it a month so will have to see how it lasts.  So far I am pleased with it.  Doesn&#x27;t have a stand so it lays on the counter and has a long cord.</li>
            <li> Great razor, great price!  Works flawlessly!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in excellent condition. Gives great shaves, love it...</li>
            <li> This razor can not compare to a Remington shaver.  I stuck it in a drawer and never use it.</li>
            <li> Works, but takes many passes on my coarse beard.</li>
            <li> This shaver is better in most ways than the Braun of similar design I replaced it with. The wet shaving and cleaning ability is great. Two complaints though: 1) It won&#x27;t run while plugged in. You have to finish charging before using it-- perhaps for safety due to the wet shaving feature. 2) the flip up trimmer is narrower and less convenient to use than Braun&#x27;s. Neither of these is a deal killer, however.</li>
            <li> My husband was thrilled and said he got the closest shave with it that any razor has given him in a long time.  He is 81 and with a weight loss recently has lots of folds in his neck area.  This razor cleanly shaved among all of them.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver.  Excellent cost to value ratio for me, and I like its ability to be used in the shower.  Probably one of the best you can get in this price range.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver But BE WARNED!  I used this shaver for 3 weeks and something broke loose inside the motor.  I sent it in for repairs or replacement to PANASONIC, following all the warranty rules as noted.  4 weeks went by and I had not received any info about the shaver at all.  I called customer service and they gave me the case# and date they had received the shaver.  I emailed the repair / replacement center in Texas 3 times.  I called them finally and they said they were going through a system renewal.  I told them that it had been 2 months since they had received my shaver and asked when I could expect my replacement.  She couldn&#x27;t answer.  Finally, I emailed AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE and told them of my predicament hoping they could intervene for me because I HAD NO RESPONSE FROM PANASONIC.  Well guess what?  AMAZON sent me a replacement shaver the very next day.&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed.  What a huge contrast in Service!  Panasonic should be ashamed of their behavior.  I still haven&#x27;t heard from them.  The shaver is swell when it works.  It is fast, smooth, ultra quiet and sharp.  It charges in a jiffy and holds it&#x27;s charge for a long time.  Just don&#x27;t expect help from Panasonic if it goes bad.  Thank goodness for AMAZON.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I have ever had! It is so quiet compared to bruan&#x27;s and a much better cut.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old ES8077, which had the Arc system.  Altough this model doesn&#x27;t, i don&#x27;t miss it at all.  This shaver shaves as close as a razor!  With my old ES8077, i needed to shave every day.  With this one, i can actually skip a day ( like a can with a twin razor).  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or a tough bread or anything, so i have no special needs from a shaver.  Currently, i&#x27;m just using it as a dry shaver.  I haven&#x27;t try it wet or with cream, yet.  But i can&#x27;t imagine having any problem with that.</li>
            <li> the razor was a gift for a special person, and he is very happy with the shaver, said never had one like it.  thank you.</li>
            <li> I had the Panasonic ES8103 and then went to this one when I needed a new one since it had good reviews and was a good price. For the price, the Panasonic ES8103 is a much better razor so pay more and get a better shave - it&#x27;s worth it. Panasonic razors are the best, but this one falls short, at least for tough beards.</li>
            <li> The razor cut well for the price.&lt;br /&gt;but&lt;br /&gt;It failed after only 8 months&lt;br /&gt;I think the units seal failed and it got wet inside, not good for a WET/DRY product&lt;br /&gt;I ordered from another brand this time</li>
            <li> Purchased 9/3/2012.  Initial charging was successful.  Second charging appeared to complete after 14 hrs, but the shaver would not work.&lt;br /&gt;Made a clicking sound</li>
            <li> I was a Braun user for many years, but the last cutter/foil I purchased gave me rough shaves.  After 3 months of use, I&#x27;m happy with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> This unit was a replacement for a more expensive Panasonic shaver (ES8075) I had for at least 6 years. This model has less perks but performs as well and costs half as much. The LCD battery life indicator is a great feature. I get about 7 shaves per charge. The shaver is fairly quiet and can be easily cleaned dry with a tooth brush or with a stream of water if you prefer.&lt;br /&gt;I think I got a good product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After 7 months of usage, the battery failed. A fully charged battery would quit working at 40%, instantly dropping to zero. So 40% was actually zero! Shaver had 2 year warranty which stated I had to ship it back to Panasonic at my expense with a week to 10 day turn around. What ended up happening: three week turn around, was given a \\&quot;rebuilt replacement\\&quot;, and a note which said my shaver now only had a 90 day warranty. So, the shaver ended up costing me $12 more plus I lost a year of the 2 year warranty!&lt;br /&gt;Its now become a \\&quot;not such a great deal\\&quot;. Lowered to 3 stars from 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2: The replacement shaver which came with only a 90 day warranty is now failing. The shaver power level reads 60% and goes completely dead. It appears to be battery issues with these units. Although it gives a great shave, I now have to recharge it twice a week and have been caught in mid-shave when it dies! This is not acceptable. Lowering rating to one star and buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I bought this product (as a female) to shave my legs and underarms.  My husband has a triple head wet/dry razor and loves it, but it tore up my underarm skin and didn&#x27;t give me a close shave on my legs.  This razor does the trick!!!  I use it on my dry legs and love the close shave.  I use it wet on my underarms and it works great too!!!  It was worth all the research.  There aren&#x27;t too many reviews by women for a man&#x27;s razor.</li>
            <li> We bought this so that our adult son, who has an intellectual disability, could learn to shave himself.  I gave this two stars only because there was indeed a razor in the box and the motor ran.  Whether we used it wet or dry, it was very hard to get anything like a real shave.  My son couldn&#x27;t do it at all, and it took me applying significant pressure to see any results.  It got so that he would ask me not to shave him because it was becoming such an unpleasant experience.  We regret that in our disappointment in this product, which we intended to be a life enhancing gift, we waited too long to return it.  We kept hoping that we would get the trick of making it work.  We went back to using an old Norelco which I had almost discarded.  It was like night and day.  The Norelco was much faster and a much closer shave, and my son is able to use it. Panasonic&#x27;s \\&quot;nanotech\\&quot; resulted in a razor with micro-utility;)  Needless to say, I can&#x27;t recommend the Panasonic ES-RT51!</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve had this shaver for a little over a year now.  It gives a great, close shave (I&#x27;m still on the same cutter), though it requires you to shave a bit more slowly than others like the Braun shavers.  But when I take my time and let the shaver do its work, it gives me the closest shave I think I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric shaver.  The \\&quot;nanocoating\\&quot; or whatever it is seems very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after about one year of daily use, getting 5 shaves per charge, the battery suddenly began to deteriorate, and now I only get 3.  The charge indicator goes by increments of 20%.  So you start with a full charge at 100%, then it drops to 80%, and so on.  When I first had this shaver, the charge level would go all the way to 0% before I&#x27;d run out of power.  Now, at 40%, if I try to turn it on, it won&#x27;t turn on, and suddenly goes to an indication of a flashing 0% (indicating a recharge is required).</li>
            <li> Not worth my money .... I only have it as an emergency back up if I forget to charge my primary or I leave my primary at home.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES-RT51-S is a replacement for my more expensive self-cleaning Panasonic shaver which lasted three years.  Replacement batteries were not available, prompting me to buy a new shaver. I was not using the self-cleaning features of the old shaver and decided to buy just the shaver. In case you are wondering, the charger, and other components are NOT interchangeable between models!&lt;br /&gt;The shaver cleans easily with a couple of drops of liquid soap and water every few days. I have a heavy beard and the RT51 performs just as well as the more expensive models on my not-so-young face. It usually takes 10 minutes for a close shave, which ends up draining the battery down to 60 or 40% (I like a very close shave). A fully charged battery is good for two long and close shaves. Recharging is very fast.&lt;br /&gt;I switched from Braun a few years ago and find that middle of the line Panasonic shavers work just as well for my beard and prices are better, considering Braun is also made is China and not Germany. If in a hurry, I use a Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razor, but need to switch to an electric shaver due to sensitivity issues.&lt;br /&gt;The ES-RT51 seems to be quieter than my old model, which makes the wife happy.</li>
            <li> The razor is head and shoulders ahead of my Braun that is not old. The only thing is that the digital readout on the handle continues to read 100% even when battery is dead.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase after never previously owning a Panasonic razor before.  The razor gives a close shave, the charge lasts exactly one week, and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.  My only complaint is that the shaving head bends side-to-side but not front to back.</li>
            <li> My husband is very happy with this razor.</li>
            <li> 100% recommended excellent product</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, it does not do a good job shaving you. Leaves a lot of stubby beard. Definitely does not provide a good shave.</li>
            <li> Pros: Close shave, no razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Low battery life, really struggles if I let my beard grow past a few days.  The trimmer is good but hard to use on my chin, so letting it grow more than 3-4 days causes problems.</li>
            <li> Purchased as one of my husband&#x27;s Christmas gifts.  He says it is the best electric shaver he has ever had, and I know we paid more for some of the others.  Glad I bought it</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my dad and he loves it. he&#x27;s never had an electric razor and has loved how smooth and easy this is to use. He had no complaints and uses it every day. I recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> For the price it is ok but I got this to replace another Panasonic shaver which it is comparable to but it just doesn&#x27;t compare to the Panasonic shaver that I got before that which was powerful, heavier and could tell it was made of better parts.  It just goes to show they don&#x27;t make stuff like they used too...  The one thing I do not enjoy about this that if it is plugged in, it will not run which can be a problem if you don&#x27;t charge frequently and don&#x27;t notice you are on low juice.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, ready to go to work, easy to clean, charges super fast and shaves me like a dream...bald head and all. Plus I just have to rinse it off. No more noisy cleaner/charger to mess around with. My wife is happy that I&#x27;m shaving often again. That&#x27;s a bonus, right? ;-)</li>
            <li> I did receive in the time promised, tried it, and found it to work , even better when I se it wet. It is wet and dry razor. for the price it is the choice I could have made. Panasonic has always been my favorite razor. Better than some other brands I had in the past!</li>
            <li> Pretty good. Great value.</li>
            <li> It stopped working in less than 1 year however I sent the shaver back to Panasonic and they replaced it in a reasonable amount of time.  I was only out the cost of shipping the shaver to Panasonic.</li>
            <li> wet n dry is a good thing, Im unsure about the cut because dont have any other electr to compare</li>
            <li> Not close enough shave,I was hoping for better performance.Will continue using this shaver and maybe will have a better&lt;br /&gt;result in the future.</li>
            <li> This razor was bought as a gift. The person it was bought for loved it. I was very pleased with my purchase of this razor.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband because he&#x27;d never had an electric razor before. He&#x27;ll only use it wet, so I can&#x27;t rate it&#x27;s performance dry, but from what I&#x27;ve seen it works well.</li>
            <li> I never had a close shave like this from an electric razor, the battery is strong. I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it with wet cream, but cuts fairly close dry. Holds it&#x27;s charge quite well. Easy to handle and use.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical (because it was so inexpensive), but my expensive Braun had gotten old and to fix it (just new blades and screen) would have cost as much as the new Panasonic) Short on funds I opted for the \\&quot;much less expensive\\&quot; wet/dry and have not been disappointed... It is every bit as close a shave.</li>
            <li> Issues with longer beards, not a huge difference between this and a Norelco as I hoped; still have to make multiple passes to get clean shaven. Main problem is the chin and neck for me; may just be age :)</li>
            <li> I had a very old dry electric shaver before this one that I used at most once a month because it was just miserable.  This one works great.  Its not quite a real shave, but light years ahead of anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Purchased for husband as his old Braun shaver would no longer hold a charge.  Lasted him years though and am hoping this Panasonic will too.  He used the wet shaving feature and said it was a very close shave.  He has been using disposable shaving blades and said it was pretty comparable to the disposables.  He has a tough beard and if he says it close, it must be.  So if the hubby is happy, me happy too!</li>
            <li> $50 does not go as far as it used to....This is a nice combination wet/dry shaver.....Does not shave the neck area well at all....need to use a razor to finish the job...Price/Value is o.k...Like the portability and attractiveness of shaver...charges very fast..so if you do a few long shaves..you can bring this back up to 100% quickly</li>
            <li> Good&lt;br /&gt;55 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5&lt;br /&gt;55555 5 5 5&lt;br /&gt;Good&lt;br /&gt;Good&lt;br /&gt;55 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5&lt;br /&gt;55555 5 5 5&lt;br /&gt;Good  5 5 5 5 555 55555 5 5 55555&lt;br /&gt;good good +</li>
            <li> es un producto que lo recomiendo y lo disfruto  no he tenido mayor inconvenientes hasta ahora lo ocupo casi todos los dia y no hay problemas</li>
            <li> For the money, this is one of the best electric razors that I have had. It keeps its&#x27; charge for a long time and recharges fast. With the use of Lectra Shave, it works great between the mundane lather shaves.</li>
            <li> (Review is a year late but I&#x27;ve encountered some things worth noting)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my fourth shaver after a bunch of cheap Remingtons with which I wasn&#x27;t careful and broke the foils and it was the same price for a new shaver vs new foils/blades. Enter this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first little thing is just the cost of the shaver versus replacement foils. I paid $55 for this shaver in February 2012 and replacement foils are about $30, meaning it&#x27;s almost more worth it just to buy a new shaver rather than replace the foils. I clean them every month or so and they&#x27;re still good; my thin facial hair obviously doesn&#x27;t cause much wear on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second problem is what&#x27;s really annoying, starting a couple months ago. It&#x27;s the battery life. It goes 100%-80%-60%-0. That is, if you&#x27;re on 60% for a while, turn it off, and it&#x27;s close to 40%, it suddenly goes to 0% and is dead. What&#x27;s weirder still is I tested it from 100%, let it run non-stop, and it went to 0% normally. I took it apart and the batteries appear to be AAs, but with proprietary ends.  I haven&#x27;t seen anything about replacement batteries for this shaver anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the shaver is great, no problems. But having to charge it every other day or two gets old quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: When it went from 60%-0%, the blades would click/move ever so slightly, making a &#x27;tik-tik-tik&#x27; sound. Instead of charging it when this happened, I let it do this for what turned out to be another two days, then it truly died. My power started going from 60%-0%, to 60-40-0, and after letting it tik-tik-tik to death again/charging, it now goes 60-40-20-0. So it seems like you just have to power cycle the battery.</li>
            <li> It simply did not cut enough of my hair. I tried different speeds, pressures, and angles of passing the razor, and was always faced with entire regions that simply would not be cut. I attempted several exceedingly long shave sessions, trying to learn how to use the product, but in the end, I never got anywhere close to a satisfactory shave, wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Great rechargeable shaver.  Leaving it plugged in all time not in use keeps battery fully charged.  Fits hand very well, comfortable to hold, screen allows close shave without skin irritation.  Would give 5 stars, but razor doesn&#x27;t run directly off of AC, only off charged DC internal battery.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I would like.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I have ever owned! And I&#x27;m old, so I&#x27;ve owned lots of different shavers. I will look at Panasonic products first for all future purchases!</li>
            <li> I only use an electric razor for a quick touch up. I shave early in the morning so if I go anywhere at night this razor is a quick alternative for the blade. I have had several Panasonics. They are all about the same which isn&#x27;t bad. For my needs a lower priced model is fine. I have had more expensive Panasonics and I don&#x27;t see any difference. They all only last so long before they burn out. Perhaps if I used the razor more often it would last longer. I still believe that any electric razor will never be as good as a blade.&lt;br /&gt;I was ready to try a different make only because Panasonic&#x27;s website was so frustrating. I waited forever for a reply to my e-mail and when I finally received it my question was still not answered. I haven&#x27;t used this razor very much but so far I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  I have a beard and shave in the shower.  It does not eat away at the top of the beard like a safety razor and leaves my cheeks and neck smooth.  The trimmer is not as good as my beard trimmer (go figure), but works in a pinch.  When I dry shave the shaver is quick and leaves me with a better shave than a blade.  Easy to clean and use - have to fight off my wife so she may get one for mothers day</li>
            <li> I bought this product to replace a mid-range rotary from ten years ago. This is my first experience with a foil shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic shaves closer than the rotary, but takes more passes to catch every hair. It&#x27;s also intolerant of hair lengths that the rotary dispatched with ease. Relative to shaving cream and a Mach 3, it takes longer and isn&#x27;t as close. But you don&#x27;t risk razor burn. Try it with gel; it&#x27;s a definite improvement over dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer on the back is very powerful, but tends to get caught on thicker hair. So if you&#x27;re, say, carving into your sideburns, you can&#x27;t just have at it. The cutting edge can only make slow progress without binding. I&#x27;ve found it more useful to trim sparse body hair short enough to be cut by the foil, though both the trimmer and the foil can draw blood in some areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t dunked the thing in water or had it long enough to see how the lithium battery holds up. At present, it&#x27;s good for at least five shaves to empty. On balance, if I wasn&#x27;t using the Mach 3 on my face, I&#x27;d probably have returned this shaver for a new rotary.</li>
            <li> Powerful and easy to use. It provide convenience for shaving in an clean and efficient approach and provide nice feeling in the same time.</li>
            <li> I generally use blade shavers but like to use an electric about once or twice a week to give my skin a break. It doesn&#x27;t shave a close or as fast as my old Braun but it cost only about a third. I like the wet-dry capability and it charges super-fast. It is also very light weight for travel.</li>
            <li> good shaves and long lasting battery&lt;br /&gt;the only problem that i have is that when using it dry the mid blade irritates me a little.</li>
            <li> The product performs poorly. It takes ten minutes and numerous repetitions and , still, the shave is not good. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have owned several Panasonic wet/dry razors over the years, and this is another reliable one.  They provide excellent service and last three to four years.  The only concern I have is when it comes time to buy replacement blades it is often almost as cheap to buy a new razor.  This shouldn&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li> Unable to get a close shave using it either wet or dry. Very comfortable when using a shaving gel but irritating when used dry. Returned it to Amazon for refund.</li>
            <li> Ever since Panasonic stopped making their shavers in Japan and went over to China the quality has become crap. I have owned 2 of this model shaver now and both of them lost their sharpness quickly and also after less than a year will only hold a charge a few days. I have used Panasonic wet dry shavers for decades and just in the last few years and last few shavers have I been disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is not wonderful but the price was great.  For the price we cannot complain.  It was received in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> The instructions with the razor states it will take a few weeks for your beard to get adjusted to the razor. That never happened. You will not get the same close shave that you get with a regular old fashion razor.It does the job for the most part but requires you to go over and over the same spot to obtain a rather close shave.Cleaning it is a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11</li>
            <li> Overall, I am satisfied with this product because I found other usages for it but I initially got it to shave. When I used it for the first time I was planning to use it to shave my beard and mustache an quickly realized that it was very ineffective at shaving. I was disappointed but then I started using it for to line up my hairline which works great for that but it is not good as a razor if you can call it that.</li>
            <li> Great Razor. This is my third razor of this same model. The reason I&#x27;m on my third is that after a couple of years the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge longer than one shave. With a price this affordable, I don&#x27;t mind replacing it every two to three years.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I have ever had.  Excellent!</li>
            <li> Went back to real blades, these razors don&#x27;t really do the job...</li>
            <li> I had a Braun for the past 10 years.  This RT-51 is lighter and so quiet it makes the Braun sound like a chain saw.  Cuts great, uses about 20% of charge per shave.  Pop-up trimmer works great.  I&#x27;m happy with it but it has one flaw, no stand.  It has to lay around the countertop.</li>
            <li> I shave with a blade; but, this is great for touch ups on days I don&#x27;t shave with a blade.</li>
            <li> it has lived up to my expectations being a long time Panasonic user....</li>
            <li> I love Panasonic stuff normally, but this isn&#x27;t about what I love.  It&#x27;s about what you, the informed consumer, should buy.  So, if I had it to do over again, I&#x27;d do more research and get a better model.  It&#x27;s decent, but just that.  My old rotary Norelcos cut better and shave smoother, and one of those sounds like it&#x27;s ready to explode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this shaver is built well.  Feels solid. This is something I&#x27;ve noticed from Panasonic for many years and one of the reasons I bought it, as they rarely make anything that isn&#x27;t good.  But when you switch it on, especially after a full charge, it basically sounds like it&#x27;s running at about a hundred thousand RPM, and gives you sort of a lackluster cut.  Multiple passes over the same area.  Really hard to get a decent shave on the neck.  The flip-out trimmer is also not a very aggressive cutter, but it&#x27;s fine inasmuch as it won&#x27;t let you get too out-of-control on your moustache.  Other reviewers have mentioned a &amp;#34;linear motor&amp;#34; available on higher-end models, so they may do a better job.  My experience so far leads me to believe rotaries cut better, or at least faster.</li>
            <li> This my second rt51-S razor. The first one lasted two years and I don&#x27;t expect much more out of this one. Panasonic definitely cut some corners on this latest version, probably because it was so popular. The weak point is the battery which isn&#x27;t readily available as a replacement. Still a good  design and doesn&#x27;t really feel as cheap as it is. For the price and function I&#x27;ll probably buy another one. For the environment I wish they made one with a complete set of replaceable parts so you could keep it going without throwing out the body and charger only to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best shaver I have ever purchased. I&#x27;m sorry I suffered through the 3 blade shavers for the past 20 years. I no longer need to shower first to soften the whiskers. If I wait 2-3 days to shave there is no more pain. The motor is very powerful yet not loud at all. It lasts all week on one charge and recharges very fast. The digital display takes the guess work out of a low battery. I can&#x27;t believe I only paid $60.</li>
            <li> Great product. First time I used an electric razor and im very pleased with this one. Will continue to use electric from now on.</li>
            <li> The razor works great.  It is bigger than it looks in the picture, but I haven&#x27;t seen another one more compact. It has a mustache trimmer, not mentioned in the product description, that I like. It also shows how much charge is left, a real convenience. The recharger is compact and easy to store at home or on a trip.</li>
            <li> After nearly 65 years, I started getting razor rash after shaving with my blade.  I had never used an electric so I wanted a product from a reputable company but not outragously priced.  After performing tons of research, I decided to o0rder the Panasonic Nanotech electric razor.  I used it immediatley after receiving it and was amazed at what a close shave I got.  I&#x27;m still in the process of \\&quot;training\\&quot; my beard, but the results have been phenomenal and NO RAZOR RASH !</li>
            <li> This was delivered in the middle of June 2014 and it&#x27;s Oct.13th today and it just died.  It won&#x27;t  turn on and overheated when trying to charge it, and it isn&#x27;t taking the charge.  Total junk!</li>
            <li> Strong, reliable, clean shave.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with panasonic</li>
            <li> I have tried several elecric shavers and found (for the money) that this is one of the best. I like the battery feature that shows the remaining battery life. The shaver is easy to use and gives you a close shave.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband.  He says it works well for everyday shaving once a close has be achieved.  Does not perform well on days of beard growth.  Likes the charging indicator and that unit holds a charge for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy replacement blades for Norelco Arcitec Electric razor, when I found they were around $40. I decided to buy a new razor. Panasonic wet/dry sounded like a good choice as the price was comparable to the replacement blades for Norelco. Panasonic shaves quite close for wet shaves but not as close for dry shaves. It is slightly better than my old Norelco shaver. I get about 13 shaves per charge. It does not come with a stand or a case for storage. There is a cloth pouch for storage not suitable for use after a wet shave.</li>
            <li> I got it, charged it, turned it on, and was worried when it had a whisper quiet motor. I was right, this is one wimpy shaver! I got to shave the same areas over and over to get the job done. It&#x27;s very frustrating that it takes so long for a shave. I can go much faster with a Mach 3 disposable. Previous shaver was a Remmington with similar design. I don&#x27;t know what I am going to try next...maybe I&#x27;ll try Remmington again, it lasted 6 years with blades replaced only once. But it died after 6 years.</li>
            <li> Love the battery indicator on the front of the shaver. Shaves clean and close. First time using this brand but would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My last razor was a Norelco with the floating heads.  The flip top broke off, making the shaver useless.  You don&#x27;t have that problem with the Panasonic.  This model shaves closely, and you can actually use shaving cream with it.  It holds a charge for a long period of time and is easily cleaned with running water.  This is an all around nice model for a medium beard.  All compliments.  Can&#x27;t find anything wrong with it.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> very pleased so far with the closeness of the shave. i kind of missed the recharging station at first but the battery holds it&#x27;s charge for quite a few shaves, so it is not really inconvenient to pull out the charging cord and let it sit on the counter till charged. Seems like a good value</li>
            <li> The razor he had before didn&#x27;t do a thorough job and after taking 10 minutes or longer to shave, his face still had stubble.&lt;br /&gt;The day after Christmas, i saw him and he had me feel his face, it was smooth as butter, and he said it only took him 2-3&lt;br /&gt;minutes, it was his favorite gift this past year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Panasonic</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know anything about shavers, but bought this for my husband for Christmas.  I&#x27;m happy to say that he likes it.</li>
            <li> This is a follow-up to the review I wrote in 2014. I rated it at 5 stars, but now just 3 stars. I like the razor and it has been reliable, but the batteries are the weak link. After 2 years I saw battery life began to dwindle away, and now I have to charge it each time I want to shave. Changing the battery proved to be difficult, so I just bought a new razor (same model). In 3-4 years I may have to do that again.</li>
            <li> was excited to get this a wet shave oh boy  I was very disappointed when it didn&#x27;t even get through my one day beard wet , dry foam ,..</li>
            <li> I generally like Panasonic products and I already have a single blade Panasonic electric shaver that is a backup to my old Remington 2 blade shaver.  The battery finally wore out on my Remington after many years so I decided to buy the Panasonic ES-RT51-S based on the description, reviews, and the price here at Amazon.  The ES-RT51-S looks nice but when I first turned it on after charging the battery to 100%, I could tell that this is a very weak shaver.  It was whisper quiet and the shaving quality was very poor.  It took about 3x the time to shave as my old Remington and longer than even my single blade Panasonic.  Also the battery seems to wear out much faster than advertised.  A few other points are that the pivoting mechanism is really useless and the blades and insides are difficult to clean with a brush as I am used to cleaning this way.  Of the dozens of items that I have purchased at Amazon over the years, this is the first and only item that I returned for a refund.  Nice looking shaver but terrible performance.</li>
            <li> las especificaciones descritas en la pagina del producto se ajusta con el fisico del mismo, por lo que este cubre las espectativas.</li>
            <li> This is my second ES-RT51, and I had the same problem others have written about... battery stopped holding a charge. I still have the old one to use as a backup, but I am very satisfied with the new one. Amazon was quick as well.</li>
            <li> I am a 67 year old retiree and have had to shave twice a day since I was in my 20&#x27;s (yup, lots of facial hair ---- and yeah, I still have a full head of hair on my head!) I&#x27;ve owned Remington and Norelco electric shavers for years. My latest Norelco just gave up the ghost a couple of weeks ago, so I have been shaving with shaving cream and a regular razor since --- and cutting the heck out of my skin (you know, the old hangy down skin under the chin!) Got my new Panasonic ES-RT51-s last night, AND BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY IT IS ALMOST AS CLOSE A SHAVE AS WITH A REGULAR RAZOR! Another thing, it has a digital readout to tell you how much of a charge is left in the battery --- which incidentally only took 1 hour to fully charge ---- and after shaving three times with this new shaver, it is still at 100% charge according to the readout. Needless to say, I am extremely pleased with this electric razor! I think I&#x27;ll buy another one to put in my shaving kit I use while traveling! BUY IT --- YOU&#x27;LL LIKE IT!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean. Water proof can take it into the shower. Probably not submerge proof, so do not take it to the bath! Simple and durable design. Low price. Battery is good for about 14 shaves but the power behind the shave starts to dwindle after the 8th use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first foil shaver and its not bad at all considering its half the price of my rotary shaver, I&#x27;m sure the more expensive foil raisers can match rotary cutters. The difference I&#x27;m experiencing is that i need to do more passes with this shaver to get the job done. Again though there&#x27;s a huge price difference between this shaver and my rotary.</li>
            <li> I have this product ever since it started and I like it so much I order this for a replacement off the onther one I have</li>
            <li> I had to buy a replacement because the battery started not holding a charge. Here it is again w/ this razor doing the same thing. Once it hits 60% remaining, it is your last shave.</li>
            <li> Good razor- worth the price - but not a great razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for 11 months.  Love the way it shaves.  But now, in just under a year, the charge only lasts for two shaves.  The indicator goes from 100% to 80 % to 0%.  No warning that it&#x27;s about to run out.</li>
            <li> This razor preformed well I like it because I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for the last 2 weeks and it is fantastic as everyone said previously. The only thing I do not like is when the device is plugged in you can use the shaver, this device must be disconnected to work so as long as the battery last you can shave hopefully a couple years would be nice lol...</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t shave as I close as I expected, but great product</li>
            <li> aextremely fast, very fine cutting (high speed)  very similar to the first electric Panasonic razor owned years ago... the best!!!!</li>
            <li> This is an ok shaver, but my old remington gets ALL the hairs. Not a bad shaver, just not quite as good as the old 3 head remington I had. I will keep it, but use it for travel mostly.</li>
            <li> Is ok, work good , the only thing that the blades are very expensive, half the price of the same item.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about a month. still on the first charge which is impressive, but it is new. My last Norelco delivered a closer shave, but I like the feel of this in my hand and it looks good.  But I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> It leaves some hair standing, doesn&#x27;t get longer hair.  I haven&#x27;t tried it with shaving cream, maybe that will be better.  I&#x27;m 84!years old and have used dozens of electric razors over the years and this is by far the worse of the bunch.</li>
            <li> Very nice cut for the price. Trimming blade could be better. Light , easy charge, wet/dry cut nice. good shaver.</li>
            <li> This is almost similar to a Panasonic shaver that I used to have about 10 years ago. I almost used it for 7 years.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Panasonic shaver. The 1st was an ES8228 purchased in 2008. Fantastic appliance; built like a watch and shaved as well as an old Remington, which is to say, perfectly. Automatic cleaning system was a bit silly, but I really enjoyed that shaver. Battery lasted until early 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second Panasonic was an ES8243 that I picked up on sale about a year ago. Same Arc IV head design as the ES8228, but that is where the similarities ended. Although still made in Japan, this razor was absolute junk. Painfully loud, head pieces keep falling off and battery mostly shot after one year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was very close to giving up on Panasonic, but have never had good results with the Braun products. Found an RT51 at a substantial discount and decided to give Panasonic one last chance. The RT51, though Chinese made, is a very good shaver. Well built, solid feel, quiet. Good batter life. This head is not a curved like an Arc IV but is straight. Shaves very well, but takes more passes than an Arc IV, at least on my face, which docked it a star. YMMV.</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic electric shaver.  Well built and reliable would be&lt;br /&gt;important characteristics to mention.  Cutting system is high quality and holds&lt;br /&gt;its edges.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  It is amazing.  Easy to use and it can be work from 240V too. I recommended it.</li>
            <li> Probably a great razor but not for everybody. Used it once and it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as it should. Thoroughly disappointed.</li>
            <li> GREAT SERVICE AND EXCELLENT PRODUCT... WILL RECOMEND..</li>
            <li> This wet/dry shave is great. Does the job when it comes to shaving! Charging this is very easy as it has a display to indicate the battery life of the shaver! Great design!</li>
            <li> It shaves like it should but you have to shave slow and it takes up a lot of time to shave</li>
            <li> good, but not as close a shave as I expected.</li>
            <li> This worked well for a while. Then it wouldn&#x27;t shave as close as it used to. And now I went to turn it on with a full charge yesterday, December 11, and it shook but didn&#x27;t turn on and the battery perecentage had dropped to 0%.  I decided it might have been a fluke so charged it again last night.  I went to use it this morning and again it wouldn&#x27;t turn on and the battery percentage dropped to 0%.  RIP OFF!</li>
            <li> Works quietly and smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;A little disapointed from the knife in the side. Forgot it&#x27;s name&lt;br /&gt;It is very weak.</li>
            <li> works well.  better then the most expensive one.</li>
            <li> I thought that by bidding on this product get a good shave my beard as it would be as shown in the publication, but it is not, is very poor when shaving leaves me lots of hair uncut. But I give this classification by the smoothness with which it does its job.</li>
            <li> personally didn&#x27;t like it.  works good</li>
            <li> Works great. My husband has used it every day since I bought it over 2 years ago and it is still going strong. Holds a charge for a long long time. Easy to take apart and clean, easy to resemble.</li>
            <li> Nothing negative can be said about it. It simply gives me the best shave with the smoothest skin ever.  My wife is grateful that I have such a good razor now.</li>
            <li> Ok shaver. The important review is that this does not shave as close as my cheap old Braun. I love the wet/dry function of the shaver which my old Braun had too.  Update: 11/12/15 I finally gave in and purchased a new Braun. Yes the Braun has a closer shave to the Panny.</li>
            <li> Have used Norelco for years. Quality of shave and blade sharpness has gotten terrible. Expensive Braun shaver I gave away within 2 weeks. Love this shaver</li>
            <li> I have been searching for an electric razor to do the job of a blade for more than 25 years - I finally found one and it did not cost me a fortune.  What a deal and it does as advertised.</li>
            <li> I had a higher end Panasonic shaver before and made the mistake to save too much.  The curved blades were far better than the flat blades in this unit.  It does shave well though.</li>
            <li> Works great!  My last panasonic razor lasted 10 years!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and recharge. Digital display lets you know when your battery is low. Great for wet &amp; dry.</li>
            <li> It Will only work on soft fuzz and it is afraid of a real beard, Not worth the money I spent.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a delight to use.  It&#x27;s small enough to handle easily and the shaving head fits your face and under the chin nicely.  It gives a good close shave. I&#x27;m a happy camper.  The battery life is also very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun for about 15 years and decided to try a different razor, this one shaves closer than the Braun so I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have had several different models of panasonic wet/dry shaves. This does not have a linear motor and runs slower that my previos shaver. I returned this and will reorder a linear motor version.</li>
            <li> Shave with a strait edge and finish up with a Panasonic. Shaves closer than any blade.  Great for date night...!!!</li>
            <li> Took care of heavy stubble beard on the first try.  Very effective.  I would recommend it to anyone with a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> The shaver gives a good shave. It is easy to clean and charges quickly. The unit holds a charge for about a week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price. I like the wet feature. However, it does not cut well. It always leaves some unless you press hard enough to the point of giving a slight irritation to your skin. Little bulky.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to.  Light and I love the battery level indicator.  Great for home as well as travel.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES-RT51-S 3-Blade Nanotech Wet/dry Rechargeable Shaver, Silver works a lot better than my Norelco. It does not leave as many razor stubs. I would recomend this product to any shaver.</li>
            <li> It shaves good. But I have problem when I want to shave those grown beard on my neck. But its insensitivity to water is awesome.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2, for both of my sons because of the ratings, unfortunately the ratings were not accurate, my sons have thick facial hair, and it really takes a long time to remove the hair,  than to just shave with a manual shaver, also its not a very close shave either, and it does leave some slight facial rash, for a day or 2. This shaver would probably be better for someone with finer facial hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it! No matter which route he takes with shaving, he always gets razor burn and this shaver has greatly reduced that issue. Smooth shave with no pulling. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is my third Panasonic in this series in 4 years. So I must be crazy right?  Maybe, but here&#x27;s my rationale.&lt;br /&gt;1. I never pay full price. Through Amazon partners they run $55 bucks. Competitive razors cost double that.&lt;br /&gt;2. They have a two year warranty that includes batteries, and Panasonic actually fixes and returns in about 4 weeks. You only pay postage outbound.&lt;br /&gt;3. They truly provide an extremely close comfortable wet shave. Best shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced. I&#x27;ve had Sunbeam, Norelco and four Brauns. Panasonic blows them all away.&lt;br /&gt;4. You don&#x27;t have to buy any funky and expensive cleaning accessories. Just squirt some antibacterial hand soap into the head run for a few seconds and flush with hot water. Shake it as dry as you can and let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;5. For the first 6-12 months you can get about 6 shaves between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has one down side. AFTER 6-12 months, you will be recharging more and more frequently until by 18 months it&#x27;ll be every day.  So, what I do is wait until about 15 months and buy a new one, then send the old one for repair. When the repaired unit comes back, I have a spare, or as I did with the first, I give it to my son.  This may still sound like poor economy, but remember that for virtually all electrics you have to replace the blades and comb after about 18 months anyway, and those replacements seem to all cost about $30 regardless of manufacturer. And no on discounts them.  So for another $25 bucks I just get a new razor.</li>
            <li> Replaced my aging Norelco with this shaver.  I do like the easy cleanup, and it works pretty well, but invariably I have a lot of missed areas although I&#x27;ve gone over and over them.  Not nearly as \\&quot;complete\\&quot; as the shave that I got with my Norelco.  The Panasonic requires a second and even a third look to scout for spots that need some rework. This is my first foil shaver.  Maybe it&#x27;s an inherent problem with such designs as compared to the rotary blade setup in the Norelco - I really don&#x27;t know. I would not buy this again.  Too much fuss to get a good, clean shave for my liking.</li>
            <li> Great gift idea. And not too expensive! Amazon of course shipped very fast! I can&#x27;t say much for the product, due to the fact it is not in my possession, but I can say that the purchase was a breeze as always with amazon!</li>
            <li> I like the product.  It is a bit cumbersome because of its size but it does a fair job of shaving; of course not equal to a safety razor but more comfortable to my face.  I am satisfied with my purchase and I really appreciate Amazon.com&#x27;s fast and efficient service.  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;William Zimmerman</li>
            <li> Good value. It is just a little bit bigger then what I expected. It&#x27;s good to have the digital screen shows the battery capacity.</li>
            <li> Great shave.&lt;br /&gt;Great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replace cutter assembly every twelve months.&lt;br /&gt;Head guard easily snaps on and off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.</li>
            <li> I will admit that the price lured me into purchasing this razor. I am pleased with its performance...although I have had better razors they were MUCH more expensive. I feel like it is well worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li> I have owned my Panasonic ES-RT51-S Wet/Dry Shaver for years. Like most men I don&#x27;t like the daily regimen of face shaving. Reasons vary, but we do it because want to be clean shaven. I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot time in the bathroom each morning. I even take a Navy shower because its faster. It follows then that my primary critique of this shaver is that the total shave takes a lot of time. That seems to be because I must do more than two or three passes over each area to get the smooth feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, this shaver is probably the lowest noise output of any shaver I&#x27;ve owned in my life. The discharge life is short -- only about 2.5 shaves per charging. But the recharge time is also short, from fully dead to fully charged in about 20 minutes. Its easy to clean, really doesn&#x27;t require cleaning often. It has a cord to recharge instead of an idiotic stand. It has a good appearance and I like the t-handle style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend. But remember you might take more than your usual time to complete the job. Can&#x27;t comment on performance as a wet shaver because I do dry only. Maybe the shave would go faster if a lotion or oil were applied first.</li>
            <li> Good value, comfortable shave, very easy to clean.  I get about a week on a charge. sideburn trimmer convenient and works well</li>
            <li> I am a lady and I bought this to replace an old lady shaver that was not all that great to begin with. I LOVE THIS! It charged up quickly, shows a digital display so you know when it&#x27;s at 100% battery. I just shaved both legs, below the knee and have 80% battery left. My legs are nice and smooth! Almost as good as expensive regular razors. This won&#x27;t get as close as razor shave, but very close! 100% better than the cheap lady electric razors!</li>
            <li> I love the razor does as great job a shaves close. I suggest to use some type of shaving gel.</li>
            <li> Great start!  Clean shave and good battery life when it was new.  The long term review, however, is quite a different story.&lt;br /&gt;The battery gauge is a joke.  It only has 20% point increments, so 5 lights would do just as well.  When new, after about 40 minutes it would go to 20%, then die.  Next to 40% and so on.  Now after 2 years, during my second my second shave on a charge it goes to 80% and promptly dies and I have to recharge after every single shave.  So much for battery life.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I even came back to this site was to look in to getting replacement blades and foil as I haven&#x27;t been getting a very close shave lately.  The price on these parts are almost as much as buying a new unit.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, but NO thanks.</li>
            <li> A very nice shaver, easy to use and it does a great job. What more can a person ask for?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s entirely too big and will hardly fit into any compact shower/travel bag. The charging cord is not curled round, but a super long, straight, 5ft, typical electronics style charging cord. This is way too long for a bathroom counter top. The actual razor is only like 1.25&amp;#34; wide while the foil head is about 2&amp;#34; wide. I don&#x27;t know why there&#x27;s so much empty space in the shaving head. The storage or travel bag is a simple cheesy cloth sack with drawstrings. I&#x27;m use to an actual zippered case. Overall it doesn&#x27;t feel as quality or well thought-out design as a Braun or Norelco.</li>
            <li> Always used a regular razor and cream. Decided to invest in this Panasonic ES-RT51 based on Amazon review and price.&lt;br /&gt;Mainly bought this (2 of them) for the convenience of my 2 sons going off to college and figured I would give it a shot after their poor reviews. Our opinions were basicly the same after trying wet and dry. Uneven, not close enough and very irritating. No problem with the battery life. I will be returning them both to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Shaver does exactly what I wanted.  Take it camping to avoid looking too grubby.  Charge lasts about a week.  Use and clean-up is easy and it recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> I have had closer shaves but for a quickie its all right, I believe I will try another style next time.</li>
            <li> Wet or dry the shave is not good or comfortable I would not buy another one nor recommend it.The battery is good.</li>
            <li> I suppose the different ratings for this product are because of different faces and shaving styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that going a bit slower and using the shaver when wet helped. This is far better than any other shaver I have used. Easy cleanup, long charge life and a good shave!</li>
            <li> The battery life is long. I use it daily for two plus weeks before recharging. The display is great and very helpful for not running out of power.</li>
            <li> Battery life is terrible.  I am on the phone with Panasonic now for warranty repair after 11 months because the charge goes to 40% and then totally dead.  I have to pay to ship it to their factory service in Texas.  Don&#x27;t buy this razor.</li>
            <li> very good, only one thing not perfect, can&#x27;t use it when charging the battery.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this shaver.  It does not get a close shave at all like I expected from a Panasonic.  I have to go over and over it, and my face ends up getting raw...and it still is not a close shave.  I won&#x27;t be ordering things like this from Amazon ever again...it was money down the drain.  Too bad I had already disposed of my old shaver...it did a better job.</li>
            <li> Wonderful razor that is great at home and on the road!</li>
            <li> Can clean up the beard, very good.</li>
            <li> Worthy replacement for the ES8077, which I think I&#x27;ve had for at least five years.</li>
            <li> Bought this electric razor with the hope that it could give me a close shave on my average,once a day beard.No close shave,back to using a Gilette disposable razor.</li>
            <li> the reason why I gave 4  stara from 5 is that you can not shave with it while charging, but everything is ok</li>
            <li> I expected a better performance in terms of results. It does look very nice and the display is ok.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  It certainly did not do the job for me!</li>
            <li> Absolute junk! Worked nicely for a whopping 3 months and is now dead. Won&#x27;t take a charge anymore, just heats up and remains at zero %. This was never dropped. I was also surprised to see it began rusting at the recharge port. Very disappointed the return policy only lasted 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next purchase will be from a company that stands behind it&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> Sent back paying shipment  first one as it does not cut, for replacement which does not cut either. Have to go over same area 5 times to finally cut. Does not make a difference wet or dry use, it just doesn&#x27;t cut. Manufacturer says need to press hard and still doesn&#x27;t cut. After 5 minutes I get frustrated and either pick up a razor or use my husbands Norelco 3 head which cuts the first time</li>
            <li> Excellent especially when wet. Little rough when dry</li>
            <li> Great shaved and good price</li>
            <li> This is a very nice razor, looks very expensive  Husband loves it, he has used quite a few razors but enjoyes this one</li>
            <li> After owning device, shaving is so fun and clean. The feeling its never had before.. So clean and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using &#x27;many brand&#x27; of shaver for more than 15years.. this is THE SHAVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price and Build quality is so fine &amp; GOOD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend who recommended this amazing shaver, told me that he has been on it for 3+years and the shaver still perform it&#x27;s duty.. Despite the accident, he has dropped the shiver and cause the broken blade; replace and good till now.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a great gift that not only my husband gets to enjoy. I love his smooth face thanks!</li>
            <li> After the first shave, I was ready to return the product... I AM SO GLAD I DID NOT DO THAT!  Once I tried this razor with a wet shave, I was hooked.  I use a Neutrogena shave lotion, some warm water, the the Panasonic performs just like a razor without the burn or cuts!  I actually enjoy shaving now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is quiet and very smooth.  Previous razors left long hairs -- it has been almost two months and I have not seen one.  It does take some time, not perfect on the first pass, however once complete my face is as smooth as a razor without any cuts, redness, or irritation.  Very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery does not last as long as previous razors, however I am easily getting 5-6 shaves out of a charge and I am sure I shave longer than most.  So you can probably expect 8-10 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And clean up takes seconds.  Pop the top, run cover under water, run razor under water while turned on (it accelerates to remove hair), dry it off and you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con:  I wish it came with a better bag/case.  But for the price, it is hard to complain.  (I am using my old Remington case)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Braun and Remington in past - always dry shaved.  This Panasonic is easily my favorite razor to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&gt;&gt;&gt; it has been seven months and the battery is going quickly.  Down to less than 5 days of shaving and originally I was at almost two weeks.  Panasonic says they will take care of, however now I have to find time to send back and continue to shave while my shaver is gone... not pleasant.  And... I just replaced the blades last month... aghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  Down graded to three stars...</li>
            <li> Anyone considering using an electric shaver after many years of using a razor and shave cream should look into trying this shaver. The price at Amazon and what you receive is well worth the investment. After reviewing a multitude of shavers and options I came to the conclusion I really didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a process (electric shave) that was very new \\&quot;to me\\&quot;. So I selected this model! So far I haven&#x27;t been disappointed with the dry shaving process. Seems to perform very well. Once I get comfortable with \\&quot;dry shaving\\&quot; I&#x27;ll attempt the \\&quot;wet shaving\\&quot; process, although that seems counter-intuitive. Time will tell but I like the results, so far, and I didn&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money. Who knows, if I like this option, I really wouldn&#x27;t mind spending more money especially around the holiday season if I can catch a good sale. I&#x27;m just looking for quality at the best possible price. If that&#x27;s considered cheap, so be it! So if your \\&quot;on the fence\\&quot; I would say \\&quot;go for it\\&quot; Amazon has the best price I could find.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I switch earlier? Really! This is so much has quieter, much smoother operation than my old R-brand that I stuck with for 10 years and several purchases. The results are much better, too. I&#x27;m still using the R-brand stick pre-shave and the combo is perfect. BTW, if anyone who reads this is an occupational therapist, I would like to recommend the Remington Pre-shave stick for those you are instructing in the use of an electric razor. Those oily pre-shave liquids are messy and, generally, for the birds. Thanks.</li>
            <li> the second panasonic razor</li>
            <li> Worked exactly as advertised. Very good razor for the price. Gives very smooth shave and stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great razor, holds up to travel very well, and usually only need to recharge it on the weekends.  Have had no issues with this product.</li>
            <li> it takes twice the time to shave with this product then it is to just use some lather and a razor. Kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> Returned to order a Braun.  Ordered by mistake. Meant to order a Braun. Web page confusing.So sorry.&lt;br /&gt; No more thoughts</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a 50 dollar razor. Good for light shaving and on the go. If you&#x27;er looking for perfection, less time consuming, and a closer shave, look elsewhere. A good second addition for the average man, but not the one you want to use before that major presentation  at the shareholders meeting. This razor looks good and feels a little heavy. Charges up fairly fast, about 45 minutes from a 20% charged battery. Sounds like a real bumble bee, but the vibration is soothing to the skin. Side-burn razor works good. Easy to clean, and store. A black pouch holds the razor, but you can force the charging unit in with the razor. Very tight and may tear the pouch,  eventually. In my opinion, a good second razor, for quick, light, on the go shaves. I used this razor (dry), may vary using the wet method. Thanks.</li>
            <li> It shaves cleanly and the rechargeable battery has a long life. Would recommend this to anyone seeking a razor that works either dry or wet.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and this works so very well, no chafing and it glides along, giving a close, clean quick shave.</li>
            <li> My son wanted a razor that had a straight across blade and found this one for his Christmas present.  His was thrilled with it and the features it has.</li>
            <li> Does a decent job of shaving. Charges fast in about an hr. With quick shaving the battery lasts a month. Compared to other shavers, quieter and almost no vibrations.</li>
            <li> FOR THE PRICE, I QUESS THIS SHAVER DOES OK.  I REPLACED THIS AS A 2YR OLD PANASONIC BATTERY DIED.  THIS UNIT IS VERY QUIET AND VERY LITTLE VIBRATION.  BUT AS WITH THE HIGH END UNITS, DOES NOT CUT LONG BEARD HAIR.</li>
            <li> Great shave in the shower</li>
            <li> For a shaver that cost  me less than $50, it works better than any shaver I&#x27;ve had before.  I love how easy it is to clean and how long the battery life lasts.</li>
            <li> After about 4 month of use the battery would show that it has 20% charge but the shaver would die. I tried fully charging and discharging it (takes a VERY long time) several times to get rid of the memory but to no avail. It looks like it will die completely within the year. It shaves OK but nothing special. I would probably have done better with a lithium battery.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic shaver is so easy to use and clean.  Hopefully it will last a long time.  Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> The main reason I am giving this product 3 stars:&lt;br /&gt;It does not give me a full shave. I ALWAYS have to go back over my face with the manual razor to finish the job. It doesn&#x27;t matter how many times I go over certain spots, it doesn&#x27;t get the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use this razor because I can run it across my face real quick after a shower, get most of the hair, then quickly finish up with a manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is great, should last at least 5 shaves per charge, depending on how long it takes you each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a pop-up trimmer on the back which I love. It works great and trims the hairs very short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy I bought it, but then again I only paid $30 for it as a daily deal on a competitors site (Shmew Shmegg)</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this razor! I might even buy another one for the future, just because its that good!</li>
            <li> Another great product from Panasonic. Solid and smooth. Shaves very well. The only drawback is the amount of time that you can shave before needing to recharge again. I have been used to Norelco products that have a longer shaving time but will no longer pay the much higher price of a Norelco.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to have it plugged all the time. Great read out on battery life. Great shave, light weight, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> gracias excelente calidad me ha salido muy buena, espero recibir boletines de sus productos y ofertas por lo menos mensuales</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this raiser but I would still like a closer shave without going over my face so many times.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaves just as close as my late Braun and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  I only gave it 4 stars because I read that you have to buy replacement rechargeable batteries from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> this razor is a great value. it shaves well, and keeps the cuttings in until yopu are ready to clean it--unlike the braun i had previously. the percent charge display is useful too.</li>
            <li> Great recharging process, good system for alerting that battery is low, feels good in the hand, gives a good, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for eight months and the battery is already giving me problems. I don&#x27;t get half as many shaves on a charge as I used to. I can start a shave with a 60% charge and have it die before I finish. Very frustrating!</li>
            <li> Normally i will wait for deals on panasonic razors that are normally around $120 that are half off.  They usually come with a cleaner/ recharger station and to be honest don&#x27;t last long.  I like buying the cheap ones since the replacement blades are a rip off and i would rather have a new razor for a few bucks more then replacing blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This weekend i went to shave and my old one was dead.  My beard is so tough that i have to use both an electric and a regular razor.  Went to amazon hoping to find a cheap razor and found this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this razor has no charging/ cleaning station, it feels way more solid that any of the other ones i have used.  Honestly this razor is a bargin and works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably will go and purchase another one to keep for when this one dies.  Really like this model and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The product was just as it was described.  I bought it for a gift.  My son says that it works well.  He had a similar shaver before.</li>
            <li> Does the job, nothing particularly remarkable.  Considering the price, it is a very good value.  Would recommend this as a buy.</li>
            <li> Nice little item. It feels good to hold and that fact this it is wet/dry is a real bonus. If it had actually left me with a smooth face I&#x27;d have felt it was a good bargain. But I couldn&#x27;t perceive any noticeable effect after using it. My face was just as stubbly after shaving as before shaving. I&#x27;m returning it and I&#x27;ll try something else.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was hoping for...this inexpensive Panasonic shaver is perfect for my husband&#x27;s needs. He&#x27;s very happy with its performance &amp; convenience.</li>
            <li> This razor has surpassed my expectations. I haven&#x27;t used an electric is quite some time, the last one i had was a Braun 360 which was fine. This one, I&#x27;m convinced, does better than my old Braun ever could have. The wet shave is definitely the way to go, a little Nivea Men&#x27;s Face Wash and some warm water and you&#x27;re all set. I can actually shave everyday again which hasn&#x27;t happened in 3 years.</li>
            <li> it just don&#x27;t cut it (literally!) for me.&lt;br /&gt;I just bought a Norelco, for less money (a rotary type shaver) which I like a whole lot...does a better job in less time and with less work (the Pany has to have shave foam in order to really get a close shave and it just takes longer to get the job done).</li>
            <li> Does a really good job for the price.</li>
            <li> Charges just as advertised-- very quickly. Does seem to be adequately waterproof, as I usually clean it under running water and have done so many times now. Does a good job retaining the shavings/whisker dust as well, so I can walk around the house or use it while reading the computer screen, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t really shave any better than other razors I&#x27;ve used, and probably not as well as my old (corded) Remington.  I wonder if, like power tools, battery-powered razors just don&#x27;t have the vigor of AC powered electronics?&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s certainly not as good as a blade, but I&#x27;ve never had a shaver that was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s a decent deal for the price, and probably a good choice for anyone needing a travel razor, or just likes the convenience of rechargeable.</li>
            <li> I sent this razor to y son as a gift. He is happy with it.</li>
            <li> I use this wet or dry so far it seems to be fine.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a nice electric razor that would provide a nice quick shave for legs and underarms.&lt;br /&gt;I attempted to use this, but found that after several minutes of use, the shaver had not removed any hair.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two tries, before wrapping it up, and placing it back in the box.  That is where it has remained.&lt;br /&gt;I realize that I should have attempted to return it; however, I have a strong adversity to the hassle of returns.</li>
            <li> The name 3blade is somewhat misleading because there are not three shaving heads.  I assume they are calling the trimmer a blade for purposes of advertising.&lt;br /&gt;If not then they sent me the wrong razor with only two heads!!!</li>
            <li> Gave this to my boyfriend as a gift.  He had one in the past, for a couple of years but it didn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long anymore so he&#x27;d wanted a replacement and told me exactly which one to buy. He said he loves it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, charges quikly after use, Easy to clean have not used it as wet shaver yet. I usr a brush to clean.</li>
            <li> This item is too expensive for me I think it should give more options&lt;br /&gt;they try to charge you for the warranty!!</li>
            <li> Nice features and charging system but does not cut my beard close by any means.  I got this because I had to go on blood thinners.  Never had one before this.  Maybe a rotary one would do a better job.</li>
            <li> w&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the shaving feature is not in use long enough to judge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hen charging the screen does not lite up</li>
            <li> It does that job! Keeps a decent charge on the battery, pretty close shave, and the benefit of shaving dry or wet is nice. The trimmer will sometimes cut you, hence the four stars instead of five.</li>
            <li> This is about as good of an electric razor as you&#x27;re going to find today. Braun &amp; Remington, who used to make the best electric razors, absolutely stink today. This is a very light razor, easy to handle and has an excellent trimmer. Although it gives a very good shave I cannot give it 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t give me that ultra smooth close shave all over my face. It didn&#x27;t shave that well on the sides of my mouth, everywhere else, it shaved rather well and did give me a very close smooth shave on most parts of my face. I reject some of the negative reviews of some people who say it missed hairs. If you let your beard grow for over a week, you may have to use the trimmer to reduce the size of some hairs that are missed after a few strokes in order to shave it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to give all of you some good advice on how to get a great electric shave. First of all, make sure you wash your face really well with a washcloth. I shave after taking a shower and use a face scrub before going into the shower to make sure my face isn&#x27;t oily at all when shaving. I&#x27;m not a fan of using an electric razor wet. If that works for you, great. I like to use an electric razor on my face when it&#x27;s clean and dry. Right before shaving I use either Johnson &amp; Johnson baby powder or the powder stick (Shave Saver from Remington). You have to prepare your face for electric shaving the same way you have to prepare your car paint before you wax your car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I really like this razor. It&#x27;s not the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used but it&#x27;s one of the best. My dad tried it and he liked it. I can&#x27;t see how anybody can give this razor 1 star. That&#x27;s not realistic. If someone had trouble with the battery, that&#x27;s one thing, but as a shaver, you&#x27;re not going to find a better shaver than this one. As I indicated above, Braun &amp; Remington have significantly reduced the quality of their razors. Today, Panasonic makes the best electric razors on the market.</li>
            <li> Liked this shaver so much I bought another one!!!!!!  I&#x27;ll only buy a Panasonic shaver from now on. Very Happy</li>
            <li> Previously I used Panasonic&#x27;s ES8109S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade model for many years until it broke down. Since I was satisfied with Panasonic&#x27;s wet linear style shavers, I had this model purchased for me which was a fraction of the cost of the other one.The result in shaving is the same so there is no need to spend hundreds on Panasonic&#x27;s other models. Previously, I also purchased the cleaning system which was unnecessary and it did not dry the shaver very well. The shave is close to the skin (despite NOT stretching my skin while I shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Do not stretch the skin while shaving. Most men do this to get a closer shave (but at the cost of in-grown hairs)&lt;br /&gt;2. Shave against the grain, then with the grain as the last step. (up, down - this ensures the hair will grow the same way and helps to prevent ingrown hairs)</li>
            <li> I have at least 10 electric shavers in boxes that I have purchase over the years hoping to find one that works good and shaves close and comfortable.  Well I think I have found one that does it all.  When I first got it I gave it a full charge and then used it for the first time.  the shave was close and my face felt smoother than it has in a long time.  Even the neck area under my chin which usually gets irritated very easy was  smooth and not all bumpy.  The  shaver is comfortable, easy to use, quiet and best of all can be used wet or dry.  And as far as the battery goes, I am still on the first charge and have 60% left after 6 shaves.  I always stayed away from shavers that cost over $50 but when I found this one on sale for just over $50 instead of close to a $100 I thought I would give it a shot and glad I did.  I just need to figure out what to do with all the other shavers that are collecting dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone looking for a great shave at an awesome price I would suggest they try this one,I do not think anyone will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The shaver does a nice job---however the corded re-charger takes up extra room in my luggage---no problem.</li>
            <li> Overall, not bad! Vibration is a little too big! There will be some strong points to use less hurt the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 of these.  I found the shave to be quite close and comfortable.  I shave in the shower and generally would get about a week out of a charge.  It would recharge quickly, and had a feature that would allow you to plug it in for a few minutes and get one more shave out of it if it was discharged.  I found the price to be reasonable.  So, generally, I was satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, both of these failed in the same way after about a year or two, where the battery indicated fully charged but when I flipped the switch it would immediately show a 0% and not turn on.  Since rechargeable batteries have a finite lifespan, I accepted this as basically the cost of wet shaving with an electric razor.  If it had just been the razor I am rating, I would have given it 3-3.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this last time I sent the unit in under warranty, since it was just under 1 year after I purchased it.  I figured I would be out a shaver for a few weeks, then get a refurb to use until that one failed.  Instead, in one week, I was shipped a brand new unit, and not the same model as I had, but their top of the line model (ES-LV61-A).  I have to rate that as supreme customer service and it garners at least an extra star.  The ES-LV61-A is even better by the way, but that will have to be a separate review.</li>
            <li> My husband says it doesn&#x27;t shave &#x27;close&#x27;</li>
            <li> I find that this device serves its intended purpose as a cordless travel razor but does not shave as close to the skin as my Philips (Norelco) triple head razor which I use when at home.  My business trips tend to be 3 to 4 days in length and it holds the charge easily for that length of time, is very compact, and is very ergonomically designed.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews, expected it to be great. My husband does not have a super heavy beard , it takes a good amount of time to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> This razor is good for angular faces, especially jaws. Much better than the rotating head type razors. I&#x27;ve tried this razor on a dry face (dry), in a shower (wet), and using shaving cream (wet). The dry face shave is fastest, and the shaving cream shave gives the closest and gentlest cut. I like to shave wet at least once a week to rinse the razor afterwards. With a dry shave, I&#x27;ve had the best results so far with a combination of rapid back and forth moves, combined with long slow moves, all against the grain of the beard.&lt;br /&gt;The battery level indicator is very handy to know when to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this razor 5 stars is the dry shave isn&#x27;t all that close. Only the shaving cream (wet) shave meets &amp;#34;standards&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver slightly less than 2 years ago and it was a good shaver while new. Close shaves after 1 month adjustment period and fast charging times. However, after 1 year, the battery life greatly diminished with the shaver dying when the indicator light still showed 60% of charge left. Finally, tired with constant charging, I send the unit back to Panasonic for service (2 year warranty is great) and bought ES8103S from Amazon to replace it while left without a shaver. Well, in two weeks I received a replacement from Panasonic and now I have two shavers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a week, and already I love it. It replaces an over-the-hill Remington MS3 1000, and is vastly better: quieter, faster, closer.  The only thing I  might ask for (and it&#x27;s turning out to be minor) is a wider trimmer.  The rinse-clean is convenient and easy.  The tip-and-tilt is irrelevant, as you would never push that hard against your skin.  Make sure the last few strokes go directly against the lie of your beard and it&#x27;s quite a close shave.    *addendum*   It&#x27;s a month later, and here&#x27;s the update.  I still love it.  The big plusses are that it gives a very close shave (especially where the beard grows sidways and flat), it&#x27;s wonderfully quiet, and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.  I travelled with it and appreciated the unobtrusive and easy-to-manage safety on the switch.  The head comes off in two different ways for a quick rinse or a more thorough one.  It&#x27;s as close a shave as I&#x27;ve ever gotten with an electric.  The weight and heft are much more comfortable and substantial than the comparably-priced new Remingtons (I tried one and returned it) which feel lightweight and cheesy. I shave around a beard every day and the charge is lasting about eight days for me, with no slow-down as the charge fades.  Definitely five stars. I feel like I got a great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using a more expensive Panasonic electric razor. Instead of buying a new foil and new blades I decided to save some money and try this razor. It works just as good as my expensive razor and to replace the foil is under $20 and uses the same blades as my more expensive Panasonic razor does.</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of buying a new foil for my old Braun 1775 shaver.  I figured that I would probably be better off with a new shaver, but I was wrong.  When I first started using the Panasonic, it shaved about as well as the Braun.  However, within about two months, the quality of the shave deteriorated badly, even though I was keeping it clean.  It was only reducing the length of my whiskers, rather than shaving them.  I gave up and went back to the Braun, which shaves much better (even with an old foil) than the two-month-old Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery indicator works very well, and I liked the fact that it shaved at full power right until the battery was drained.  However, if it won&#x27;t give a good shave, that doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> Leaves lots of uncut hairs behind. Doesn&#x27;t even resemble a clean shave. I&#x27;ve gone back to my Norelco rotary shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 75 years old and have used lather and blade up until about 9 months ago when I purchased an under thirty bucks corded Norelco for the convenience while traveling and camping.  I found I liked it and decided to upgrade to this ES-RT51.  I liked the charge display, the ergonomics, and the long charge length of this razor but I never really liked the shave it provides.  Had a chance to try my brother&#x27;s Norelco 730 and ended up buying one to replace this Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco 730 gives me a much closer shave in less time and I&#x27;m much happier with it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it! He actually doesn&#x27;t have to shave until 2 days later, awesome! Trimmer blade is a little rough when he goes too long the, pulls n burns</li>
            <li> This exceeded my expectations. Powerful motor and easy to clean. Works great in the shower with just dove soap and water. Very close shave and the digital read-out for power is great!</li>
            <li> I travel between the US and Canada each week so I was looking for an inexpensive foil razor I could leave at my apartment ....The goal being to travel luggage-free  each week.    Upsides:  * Very nice close shave.  Quite possibly better than my Braun (and I&#x27;m a loyal Braun customer)  *The razor is quiet  * Inexpensive, relatively speaking.    Downsides:  * Battery life...I only get 3 shaves on each full charge.  I realize all I need to do is plug in the razor again, but the battery should last a little longer than 3 shaves  * the \\&quot;sock\\&quot; type razor case.  I&#x27;m using the case as a sunglasses case.  It&#x27;s useless for use as a razor travel case.    I don&#x27;t use the razor for \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shaving so I can&#x27;t speak to this.    In summary, the razor does exactly as I hoped....nice close shave for a cheap price.  For how I&#x27;m using the item, I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the second purchase of this product. The reason I bought it again is it was $4 cheaper than buying a replacement blade and foil.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor since December 24th 2014 and I am glad I purchased it.  I have used Norelco rotary razors for decades and I have been displeased with the life of the cutting heads in the last few years. I switched to the Panasonic and it has performed better than any of the Norelco products that I have used over the years. I do not have a heavy or coarse beard and this gives me a close shave whether I use it dry or wet. Fully charged it gives me 8 to 10 shaves.</li>
            <li> Ive owned razor for 2 yrs now and was looking for replacement blades, so I decided to write review. It has performed great and I find it not too rough on my skin. Ive owned 2 other circular shavers in between to try them out and they actually make my face break out with bumps. Really weird. I must shave with this panasonic other wise my face swells the next day. So instead of replacing the unit im replacing the blades. About me, I shave every 2-3 days and it takes me about 10 minutes with this shaver. Battery will last up to 3 shaves and it charges up very fast. 40 min to 1 hr. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> For a 3 blade razor- I only see 2 inside. It is beautifully designed- but it takes at least 10 minutes to get a decent shave - it&#x27;s performance is marginal - and I would not buy another one- maybe a Braun would be a better way to go.</li>
            <li> This shaver gets the job done in an effective manner. I hoped to get a better battery life out of the shaver but it definitely held up well after my year of usage.</li>
            <li> Awesome shaver it sure beats any Braun razor that I have owned. I would definitely buy another one, it is great product</li>
            <li> It offers a smooth, comfortable shave and the wet use function allows me to use it in the shower, which is great.  Does not shave close like a razor but it&#x27;s much easier on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good shave for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> He is a truck driver and now he can shave anywhere at any time with or without water.  Comes with a travel pouch which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> This razor has been cheapened since the last one I bought two years ago.  Nowhere near the shaving results as before with the same model.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Battery lasts long and very smooth operation</li>
            <li> NOT EXCITED ABOUT IT.</li>
            <li> We ordered three of these for our sons as gifts. They are bigger and clunkier than I though they would be and our sons report the shave is not as close as they had hoped.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted a foil shaver that would be quieter because my wife didn&#x27;t like the sound of my previous shaver. This shaver failed in that regard. That said, it is an excellent shaver. I have found that all foil shavers take longer than 3 minutes to get a close shave so one full charge on this one gives me three shaves.  My previous razor was a Wahl. Excellent shaver but noisy. The Wahl allowed for corded use. That feature is handy if you neglect to charge it. I gave it to my son so its here for backup just in case. The Panasonic has a percentage readout so you know how much charge you have. I have shaved with it dry and wet. I was able to get a smooth shave both ways. The wet shave was more comfortable. The clean up is very easy since it is built to get wet. Time will tell how long the foil and blades stay sharp. The cost to replace those is higher than the Wahl so I hope they last longer.  I have shaved with a blade in the past and would have to say that this is just as close with less the hassle as was my Wahl shaver. It takes a little time to acclimate to a foil shave and should probably be done everyday for best results.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had an electric razor in 10 years because they never worked well. All I can say is technology has come a long ways. It works great, close shave and doesn&#x27;t leave a burn. Great product at any price.</li>
            <li> The best buy for a shaver. It&#x27;s far better than all other makes that I have purchased.  Shaves quick, close and quiet.  When the blades and head wear out, the shaver also picks up a little noise.  But, the new shaver is lower cost than the replacement blades with the head.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and we were disappointed to find that it doesn&#x27;t work at all... on any type of hair. Tried it on his face, my legs, his pubic area, my arms... nothing. I was hoping it was just user error, but apparently i just bought a razor that is absolute garbage.</li>
            <li> My husband was delighted to be able to find another Panasonic razor.  His other one died &amp; he didn&#x27;t want to pay a small fortune to replace it.  This one was so close to the last one &amp; it was about $40.00 less.</li>
            <li> Great razor when you&#x27;re in a hurry!</li>
            <li> Bought one in May last year and now it&#x27;s broken after 1 year of light use. Battery won&#x27;t charge. I used to have a Panasonic long time back when they first came out with washable shavers. That one lasted for years and now quality has dropped so much. Stay away!</li>
            <li> There is nothing like a blade for shaving. So why an electric razor? Sometimes Iâ€™m in a hurry and this little portable is very handy. You can use it dry, with gel or lather.&lt;br /&gt;You donâ€™t have to bang the thing on the sink to clean, just put in a little soap and turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;Recharge is very fast, about three times faster than phone. Impressive.</li>
            <li> Used with soap and water, this shaves as close as a razor.  the Dual-blade variety is less expensive than this, but I&#x27;m unable to get a close shave with the dual blade.  This one shaves great and also has the battery gauge.</li>
            <li> Great razor. Good price, prompt shipping.  I also have a mid-line Norelco razor.  I don&#x27;t believe that this razor shaves quite as close as the Norelco, but it is much faster, particularly if you don&#x27;t shave every day.  I am retired and often shave only every 3 or 4 days.  This razor cuts right through the 4 day stubble.  The Norelco has a lot of trouble with the long stuff, but excels at the short stuff.  I sometimes do a &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; shave with this razor, then finish up with the Norelco.</li>
            <li> I cant understand how this shaver got such good ratings.  I&#x27;ve used it for two months now and there&#x27;s little change in the way it shaves, which is BAD.  I have shaved with a blade for 40 years without complaint, other than time spent.  With this shaver, I assumed that my time would be cut, but in fact it takes 3 times longer.  I go over the same area 4 or 5 times before the whiskers are gone. My beard is light to normal, not heavy.  I&#x27;ve seen long hairs growing in areas where I might have gone over them tow or three times and they still aren&#x27;t cut. Then I have to use the sideburn cutter to get rid of them.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works great. no problems except now that it is older the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long. only get about 2 weeks on a charge what used to last 5-6 weeks. I will buy another to replace this one when it dies.</li>
            <li> Not the best shaving.</li>
            <li> good shaver and trimmer, still working 2.5 years later. Holds charge for a decent amt. of time.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get a close enough shave.  Not a bad unit though</li>
            <li> Fabulous purchase. Bought this to replace a similar Panasonic. First shave was smooth, effortless, and close. Good price, good warranty ( 2 years ).</li>
            <li> For $60, I expected a better shave. It doesn&#x27;t really do the job, despite moving it around to different angles, and I&#x27;m frequently forced to use a razor to finish up the job. I will likely not buy a Panasonic again.</li>
            <li> I had an electric razor a long time ago and didn&#x27;t like it, I just couldn&#x27;t get a decent shave without it taking forever. I finally decided to try one again and this one has been great especially for the price. While it is not as close as a blade it is very good in about the same or less time and without the mess as I haven&#x27;t had to use the wet shave feature to do it. I don&#x27;t know how much better the more expensive ones are but I don&#x27;t see the point in paying more. And replacement foils and blades are cheaper than the other brands. I also like the charge feature where you always know how much charge is left.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the shaver. I have owned other brands and they don&#x27;t cut as well or are more difficult to get a good cut. This is my second Panasonic. The first one I had for 6 years and replaced the blades once. When it was time to replace the blades again at $32, I decided to pay a little more and get this one. This Panasonic is made with high quality and does an excellent job. From here on out, I will only buy Panasonic razors. If I get 6 years out of this razor and original battery like the other one, I&#x27;ll be a happy man!</li>
            <li> A very good razor.It gives me a good shave and cleans our very easy. It is a great razor for the price.</li>
            <li> I love my new razor.  Much better then my old one.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hardly an expert of electric shavers. I know Panasonic makes models that look similar to this but cost hundreds of dollars. I have NO idea what you would get for the price difference, but their high end shavers must be pretty special because this shaver rocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a heavy beard. Shaving has always been a chore. Until I got this Panasonic, I had always used Norelco triple headed shavers. What I found with them was that there was no point in replacing the blades because by the time the blades were dull, the motor and batteries were too weak to bother with. The Norelcos worked pretty good when they were fresh, but that was all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also the first shaver I&#x27;ve bought that you can take in the shower with you, so again, I prove I am no expert and a little behind the times, but I HAVE tried a lot of ways to mow my crop, including straight razors, and I can say this razor, used with shaving cream, really gives me a smooth shave, fast. (I tried this with my regular mug, brush, and soap, but I found that canned shaving cream actually works better.) As a guy who likes to sharpen his own tools, I gotta think, theoretically, the extra lubrication SHOULD make the blades stay sharp longer and, at the same time, be easier on the motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps in six months or a year or so, I&#x27;ll come back to this review and report my long term findings, but in the meantime, great shaver at a great price. I get a straight razor shave with a tenth the hassle.</li>
            <li> The above heading should tell you that I am a proud Grandfather.  This is the second electric shaver that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I am only 70 years over the age to write this survey.</li>
            <li> I have used mine for about 2 weeks - its a replacement for my Panasonic ES3041 that died prematurely.  While it has some bells and whistles that the 3041 didn&#x27;t have, it doesn&#x27;t do the job nearly as well.  I don&#x27;t care about multiple, pivoting shaving heads, LCD charge indicators, etc. - I just want a fast, close, clean shave.  I have a tough beard, and the 3041 cut quickly and closely on the first pass, with very light pressure and no razor burn. This one requires much more pressure, several passes, and leaves a slight razor burn.  I am satisfied to the point that I won&#x27;t be returning it, but if I could find another ES3041, I&#x27;d deep-six this one in a New York minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;02/11/2014: After about a year of everyday use, I have to downgrade my rating to 2 stars.  The problem is the battery - it is deteriorating rapidly.  The shaver has an LCD display that shows the approximate charge remaining in 20% increments.  For the first few months I could run the battery down to 0% before the shaver would stop.  Then after a few more months it would shut off at 20%.  Now several more months later, it runs down to 40% and shuts off.  The shaver uses a Lithium ion battery, not the outmoded Nickel Cadmium type that most cheap-quality, battery-powered consumer products come with.  At this rate of deterioration, I&#x27;ll be back to using the old Braun I replaced with this piece of Chicom Crap when the old Panasonic ES3041 died!</li>
            <li> A gift for my son who did not feel that he got a close enough shave with it.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve owned Panasonic razors in the past and have always been happy. This one is no exception and has performed great over the past year Iâ€™ve been using it. The foil and cutter blade are very tough and long-lasting, as Iâ€™ve come to expect from Panasonic. This razor delivers a smooth cut, is quiet, and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is the battery meter â€“ it will show 60% and last enough for a full shave as long as I donâ€™t turn it off. If turned  off, the meter will drop to 0% and the razor will refuse to operate. A quick 5-min. charge and itâ€™s back in business but Iâ€™d prefer the gauge to be more accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Iâ€™m very happy with my purchase and would buy this model again.</li>
            <li> I just discovered: You can&#x27;t get a super close shave by only paying $30 for a shaver, no matter what the ads say.  ou get what you pay for</li>
            <li> This razor wouldn&#x27;t cut hot butter. Don&#x27;t bother unless you want an expensive pretend electric razor to let your kids play with when it&#x27;s not charged. A total waste of money!</li>
            <li> The units works fine but failed to work after only two charges. Batter level stayed at \\&quot;0\\&quot; after overnight charge. Sent unit back to Panasonic to repair and I need to pay the shipping!</li>
            <li> it works well to cut facial hair which is all I use it for, but the battery life seems shorter than other electrics, and I don&#x27;t like how hard it is to see what I&#x27;m cutting due to the clunkiness of these type of razors. If you are just looking for a simple clean shave, this&#x27;ll do. If you want something you can grow with and maneuver more comfortably, I&#x27;d recommend a good ol&#x27; hair trimmer, you know the kind that often come with numbered attachments, bottle of lubricant, brush, ect.</li>
            <li> I am a woman and use this to shave my legs.  It works very well for that purpose and was a great deal.  The charge lasts me about 3-4 full leg shaves, but it recharges very quickly.  You cannot use it while it is charging.  Pop-up trimmer works fine, and the long hair foil in the middle of the two main foils does seem to catch longer hairs in a few passes.  Definitely WAY better than buying the stupid underpowered pink razors they market to women.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver of one kind or another for the past 15+ years.  I use it daily and therefore wear it out eventually.  Each new shaver that I have purchased to replace the old has been better than the last.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my husband. He used it and say - what is it really like.</li>
            <li> 6 months ago, I would have given this a 5 star review. I am glad I waited. I bought this shaver on May 14 2012 and it shaved my face very well. I have very dry sensitive skin on my face and am very particular with my electric shavers. My first panasonic shaver lasted me over 2 years and then the battery died on it. The Panasonic ES-RT51-S 3-Blade Nanotech Wet/dry Rechargeable Shaver lasted me all of 7-8 months before the battery died in it. My shaver will state that it has 80% battery left, but when I turn it on, the shaver goes dead and flashes 0%. It&#x27;s a shame, because I really did like it, but I can&#x27;t recommend this to anyone because of the lack of battery life. But hey... maybe I just got a bad egg.</li>
            <li> Very nice shaver. Shaves very close, i recommend wet shave instead of dry shave just to reduce minor skin irritation.</li>
            <li> This thing is a great little razor for the price. Easy to use and clean. I can go 2 weeks before getting to 20% which is when I charge it. It&#x27;s somewhat solid and robust feeling and glides nicely across the face.</li>
            <li> I love how long the charge lasts on this shaver. When I lost mine, I bought another just like it.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because of the trimmer.  I replaced an older Panasonic wet/dry one blade unit.  The razor works as advertised and gives a close and comfortable shave.  The trimmer is about an inch wide, located on the back well below the shaver blades, and is a little hard to position accurately when using on my mustache since the position of blade is almost invisible while in use.  Overall, this is a very good razor and I&#x27;m glad I have it.</li>
            <li> It works very well. I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Great product design and the battery life is very good! This came in handy for my vacation trip abroad, one charge lasted the whole trip.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaver does everything that I expect of a shaver and I really wonder why men pay up to five times this price for any other shaver.  I have had no problems whatsoever and would recommend this model to any man needing a new shaver.  My last Panasonic I had for more than 6 years and rather than replace its battery and &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; it was cheaper to purchase this new shaver.</li>
            <li> It works well dry and wet I use mine mostly I&#x27;m the shower. I can go about 10 days on a charge.</li>
            <li> Norelco is better. Takes twice as long to get all the whiskers cut. My face was sore after shaving. This shaver was no better than one I purchased 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints with this shaver it glides effortlessly along my face and neck without an ouch. So glad I puchased it.</li>
            <li> Tried wet and dry for 3 weeks per the instructions. A dull disposable did a better job.&lt;br /&gt;I guess if you have course hair it will not work very well.</li>
            <li> Sorry but I think my old narelco was much smother and cut better without going over and over the same area.  Only thing I liked better was the cleaning.</li>
            <li> it doesnt shave as well as my 10 year old razor.  i have put it away with the other junk i have accumulated.</li>
            <li> This is the fourth or fifth Panasonic Wet/Dry I have ordered.  I use them until the battery refuses to recharge, and then buy another.  I am a fan of the design, the closeness of the shave on my tough beard and the ease of cleaning.  The design fits comfortably in my hand and the shaving head does a nice job working against the grain on my beard. This shaver charges quickly.  Initially it is holding its charge well. I am getting a week&#x27;s worth of shaves from a charge.  My shaving method is just to use hand soap to lather my face, then go at it.  In this environment, the Panasonic shavers perform well.  The issue for the shavers is battery death.  It is too early to tell how mu capacity Panasonic has engineered into this particular model.  If I can get a couple of years&#x27; of use out of it, I will consider the purchase a win.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor yet.  My first Panasonic and much better than the 2 Norelco ones before it.</li>
            <li> COMPARED TO OTHER PANASONIC LINEAR RAZORS THAT i&#x27;VE OWNED, THE MOTOR RPM ON THIS SHAVER SEEMS REALLY SLOW. SHAVER CUT GREAT FOR THE 1ST COUPLE OF WEEKS, AND NOW I FIND THAT i NEED TO GO OVER MY FACE 2-3 TIMES...THE PRICE WAS GOOD, BUT I WOULDN&#x27;T BUY ANOTHER! SPEND A FEW BUCKS MORE AND GET A PANOSONIC LINERA WITH A 10,000 RPM MOTOR.</li>
            <li> great product. Love it all aspects as an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> this is the best electric razor I have owned, although i have only tried the cheaper varieties.  It delivers a good reasonably close shave without the pulling sensation on the hairs which I have sometimes experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little anxious at first on recharging - I had to get an international adaptor plug.  the first attempt was unsuccessful, but when I  tried again, no problem. Probably my mistake first time!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as a Braun electric razor I have used. Otherwise, good feel and relatively quiet.</li>
            <li> It is a substantial improvement over what I have used for years, plus it can be used wet or dry. If I enjoyed shaving, the Panasonic would rate 5 stars for eternal love!</li>
            <li> Not happy with this shaver...i&#x27;ve always used Norelco or Remingron...it says wet / dry but i didn&#x27;t work good at all when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ty Amazon I returned it before the 30 days timeline.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric razor I have had ... and I&#x27;ve had many. I only use it &amp;#34;dry,&amp;#34; but it works great. It holds a charge for a reasonable length of time.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with it</li>
            <li> Works  very well.  I had an older version of this and I used it for years and does as good of a job as the older one.  I would have given it 5 stars if it had the self cleaning and lockable head feature as the  previous version.  However, this model has a digital meter that tells you just how much life is left in the battery between charges, which is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> Seems ok and I like it but is nothing special but good for the price</li>
            <li> I bought this razor and im a female having read other female reviews... it is nice BUT I can only use it on my legs and it some times doesn&#x27;t get everything and forget my fiancee even trying to use it for his beard it doesn&#x27;t work at all that well with shaving his course thick beard lol so this is okay I kinda wish I hadn&#x27;t have bought it because my hand held razors get closer and don&#x27;t miss so much but ehhh oh well. ^^</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for many years. Mostly bought Norelco Shavers, the last shaver I had was a Remington (it was the worst of the bunch) both the Norelcos and the Remington were the low end versions. A few days ago I got the  Panasonic ES-RT51-S wet/dry rechargeable shaver. This shaver again is at the low end, but my far the best shave I ever gotten from an electric shaver. I would consider based on the shave alone this a best buy.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my grandson of 14 yo. He has only used it once but he says &amp;#34;so far, so good&amp;#34; Thanks</li>
            <li> I have purchased several panasonics over the years and only the first two, bought back ten years ago and more, have met my standards. I have written to panasonic direct expressing how the newer models do NOT last (have owned 5 models) and only got a reply of \\&quot;we are sorry\\&quot;!  Will them one more try.</li>
            <li> Ok  there are better shavers.</li>
            <li> I like Panasonic razors and this one is a good one. Reasonably priced and does the job nicely. It is also easy to clean and stays charged a long time.</li>
            <li> High quality and performance. I love it, easy to use and clean after using it. I highly recommend it. I will buy over and over. Thanks</li>
            <li> My son really finds it quite good and it suits his purposes.  For the price, it seems to be just about right and feels good.  It has a nice reassuring heft to it as well.</li>
            <li> A VERY NICE QUALITY RAZOR FOR A REASONABLE PRICE. A+++ THANKS. I WOULD RECOMMEND TO MAKE THIS RAZOR YOUR NEXT CLOSE SHAVE!</li>
            <li> this is a awesome shaver,gets super close,i love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> It died after several several days of use.  I called Panasonic and they in formed me that it was a bad battery and that I should&lt;br /&gt;return it.. At MY EXPENSE, and they would send me a REBUILT shaver.  Probably at my expense.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I find out the procedure to return the shaver to Amazon I will return it to you.</li>
            <li> got this for my husband because he seems to get razor burn easily. he only used it a few times and went back to disposables because they worked better. it didn&#x27;t shave very close at all- almost like he always had the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. pretty displeased with it. gave me little hope for an affordable electric shaver... wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like it,thanks for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li> gave this to hubby. price was reasonable compared to many others yet gets the job done for him. nice small grip and he gets  a close shave with it.</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s light and very quiet and charges in no time. Highly recommended product for everyone. Glad I bought one. Thank</li>
            <li> I had an old Remington radial shaver that I&#x27;ve had for years and the battery started to fail.  I bought a single foil travel shaver that worked very well and decided to replace my old Remington with this foil shaver as my primary shaver because it was on sale.  It shaves very well.  The one thing that I&#x27;m most impressed with is the battery.  The box advertises 45 minutes or up to 2 weeks worth of battery life.  I&#x27;m already on day 24 of its very first charge and only now it is starting to fade.  The only complaint that I have is that the battery indicator has been indicating 0% for the last 6 days but it still kept shaving like it was fully charged.  If you&#x27;re on the fence to buy this product, just jump on it.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> this is my first shaver and i believe this fits my expectation. easy to use, no issues, battery is good and last for a period of time. anyway good deal for me.</li>
            <li> Best elect. shaver I have ever had. It cuts close and charges fast. What else could you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bobby&lt;br /&gt;Marshall Texas</li>
            <li> Was somewhat disappointed in the charging. I particularily liked the fact that it could be cleaned by rinsing with water.</li>
            <li> . For the price it is a decent value. I expected more from Panasonic. It could give a closer shave but does a decent job of shaving . However I would recommend it to a friend. I do like the wet/dry feature it has.</li>
            <li> Previously, I have owned shavers made by Braun and Norelco. This is the third Panasonic shaver I have owned, and it is absolutely the best electric shaver ever.  It shaves very close and fast, and is the quietest shaver of all the Panasonics I have had.  I would definitely recommend this product to everyone who wants to shave with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> It fits my needs, has nice feel, and is a good price! It is also can be used as wet shaver.</li>
            <li> We have gotten Panasonic wet dry shavers brand for quite a few years.  This one is a three blade and has an indicator that tells you how much is remaining on the battery.  Have used several times and still shows the battery at one hundred percent!</li>
            <li> It does the job, have to go over shaved area many times to get the desired results. I would not buy this again</li>
            <li> had to switch to electric razor after open heart surgery and was placed on blood thinners for a period of time,had always used a razor and blade,this is much safer.hope to continue to use after the med is quit.would recommend at anytime.amazon&#x27;s price was pretty good also.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut very clean and evenly. I have tried dry and wet multiple times for the last couple months. I feel like I need to make so many passes with this and then I end up cleaning on my face with a non-electric razor anyways. So I have just stopped using this thing</li>
            <li> Was pushed into purchase because Panasonic said they no longer supplied the cutters and foils for an older model. When this one arrived it has identical cutters and foil as the older one. The battery life has never been as good as the older one and is getting worse. Down to three shaves per charge, maybe.</li>
            <li> So wonderful to have this for the days I go to the gym or if I am traveling and don&#x27;t want to deal with a razor.</li>
            <li> Very nice.The only thing I find is it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as well as my old one did.</li>
            <li> I bought for my hubby and he loved it.</li>
            <li> regular razor works fine but the pop out trim razor works horrible</li>
            <li> Well, It does the job, Nothing extra ordinary about it.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well so far. It&#x27;s given me a closer shave them then my schick blades. Battery last awhile.  Doesn&#x27;t do jaw line good for me.. But I have no fat to me just skin and bones</li>
            <li> Great Shaver...and charges up very fast!</li>
            <li> Good shave for about 9 months.  Now will only shave until battery is down to 80% (indicated), and then dies and requires recharge.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. My husband loved it. Works really good!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 92 year old Dad in a nursing home.  He loves it and the staff loves it too.  He can hear it doing the job.  And super easy to clean.  Great value.</li>
            <li> The chart on Amazon&#x27;s Panasonic ES-RT51-S page shows this razor as runnig at 13000 cycles per minute and having a Li-Ion battery. I used this chart to choose my razor. The ES-RT51-S actually runs at 10000 CPM and has a NiMH battery. Big disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would return it, but adding the increased cost of a better razor to the hassle of returning and reordering, makes the return not worth it.</li>
            <li> My last Panasonic wet/dry shaver gave up the ghost last year and I was slow in getting around to purchasing this new one from Amazon. I use a razor first but follow up with the Panasonic for a really close shave that will last 2-3 days. I hate shaving so this is a boon. Solidly built. Easy to use. Recharges quickly. I take it to the gym and use it in the showers or the steam room.</li>
            <li> This shaver is awesome.  I am no Grizzly Adams--I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair but what i do have is stiff and sometimes difficult to clip.  Previously, with other products, I hated a daily shave--cuts, etc-- though now I quite enjoy it.  One perspective I have is that the razor pivots quite a bit from side to side--more than up and down--and I&#x27;ve found that by engaging this aspect it gives me an even better shave.  Easy to clean, and the battery has great life--charged it two+ weeks ago and it still reads at 40%.  Totally worth the money.  Looks cool, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Panasonic razors for ages and this one suits me the best. It&#x27;s not the latest model, but it has everything I want and the price is great. Many thanks to Panasonic and Amazon.</li>
            <li> Gives me a smooth face quickly and charge last more than two weeks.  Easy to clean and maintain. Am quite pleased with the razor.  Have had teh razor only a little over a month; if continues as at present, 5 stars are justified.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had four Panasonic electric shavers over the past 25 odd years, and all of them have been excellent performers for me. This unit is particularly quiet in comparison with others I&#x27;ve had.  I always shave wet, and get a very close shave every time. My only minimally non-positive comment on this unit is that I do notice a difference between the previous unit&#x27;s 13k rpm motor and this unit&#x27;s 10k rpm motor, in regards to catching some errant hairs along my jaw line.  An extra rotation or two takes care of it, so not a deal breaker at all.</li>
            <li> Bought for my boyfriend who has to shave every day. He loves it. It works great. He has very course hair so it sometimes doesn&#x27;t grab the hard to reach stuff but overall it gives a clean close shave.</li>
            <li> This one is a keeper. Didn&#x27;t take but a few shaves to get used to it and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Been using regular razors for years, but decided to get this and see how good it worked. It works fantastic and my shaves are as close as with most razors. Having the digital readout was worth the slight extra $5.</li>
            <li> I had an older version of this shaver but i forgot what it was called, i fell in love with that one and now ive fallen in love with this one, close shave, doesnt jam up, rechargable, what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> Received this shaver as a gift for Christmas. Been very pleased with it. Very easy to use and gets a very good charge in a reasonable amount of time. Also very easy to keep clean and gets a very good shave. If you are looking for a shaver or know someone who is looking for one as a gift I definitely recommend this shaver you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have owned 2 Panasonic and 3 Norelco shavers over the past 43 years.  This shaver gives a closer and more comfortable shave than any of the others I&#x27;ve owned,by far.  Shaving can be completed by me in 4-5 minutes,compared with 7-8 minutes it took on my last shaver,a Norelco. (That shaver cost $20 more than this one).  The shaver looks and feels well made,which I could not say for my last 2 Norelcos.  Norelco has cheapened their products terribly over time.&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic has the feel of my first Norelco of 1969 vintage.&lt;br /&gt;In my view there is absolutely no need to spend any more on an electric shaver than this one.  Look no farther for a quality product that does an excellent job of giving you a good,close,comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I bought for my boyfriend who has sensitive skin. He loves it!!!</li>
            <li> I had a more expensive Panasonic model for five years.  The display went on the fritz and the battery finally gave up.  I replaced the heads and screen every year and the shaves were excellent.  So instead of replacing the battery I bought a new unit just one model less gadgets.  The display is in 20% increments of full charge.  This shaver runs quieter than the other model and ever bit as smooth a shave.  I really like it.  I was in Arizona  a few weeks ago and my friend bought the same model recently - he claims it gives him a  better shave than the Braun models he used for decades.  Good value too.</li>
            <li> It is a nice shaver. It comfortable to hold and using, and the battery life is good. but it is not very quite.</li>
            <li> I just can not get a close shave with an electric razor. The product is easy to handle and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an adequate shaver. I bought it because I got a good deal on it. It can handle two-days growth of beard. Eventually.</li>
            <li> I am a wet shave, regular razor, guy.  However I like to have a electric back-up for quick shaves when needed.&lt;br /&gt;After trying a few electrics over past years I have generally not been satisfied.  However, this Panasonic does a nice job, and I like having the built-in trimmer.</li>
            <li> I had an early model of Panasonic razor, with identical parts. The old razor served me well for the past 6 yr. The only problem is that the battery is getting discharged quickly. I hope ES-RT51-S will serve me well for a long time as well. The only issue is that the product description says the razor has Li-Ion battery, but it actually has NMH battery instead like the old one does.</li>
            <li> Works great all over my face - no razor burn.  Easy to clean.  Big improvement over rotary blade shavers.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a very adequate shaver.  It has all the features one needs and no more, at a reasonable price.  I usually shave with a disposable razor in the shower, and using gel shaving foam this comes very near to equaling the closeness of the shave when I want to shave another way.</li>
