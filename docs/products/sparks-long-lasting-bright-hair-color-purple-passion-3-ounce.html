    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Awesome color.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I found that mixing the colour with conditioner (1 part colour, 4 parts conditioner) and using it in the shower prevented fading perfectly.</li>
            <li>The color Is so wonderful I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been three weeks since I applied it, and though it has faded some, it still is beautiful.</li>
            <li>This purple is amazing!</li>
            <li>found that anything with salicylic acid cleans it up best though, if you do make any mistakes :)</li>
            <li>I loved the great purple  </li>
            <li>Came out bright.</li>
            <li>Good for doing an ombré effect.</li>
            <li>Love this color!</li>
            <li>Of course, when I first washed out the colour, it was a great purple!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Just make sure to scrub it out ASAP!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS Hair color!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li>I love this brand!</li>
            <li>IT WORKS AMAZING</li>
            <li>I have had my hair done many fun colors over the years, but never have I encountered a dye that is so marvelous at dying everything you don&#x27;t want dyed.  </li>
            <li>Also keep some clorox bathroom cleaner handy as you will need it to remove the stains from your tub or sink.  </li>
            <li>Color is great, pretty bright purple.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect this to be a one-and-done deal!&lt;br /&gt;One more positive note though--it smelled good!</li>
            <li>I was so pleased.</li>
            <li>Ive been using it for about 3 months now, and its better than any purple ive used.</li>
            <li>Spark is longer lasting &amp; the results are awesome!</li>
            <li>I know for sure I won&#x27;t be using again</li>
            <li>It gives a gorgeous, very vibrant violet color that lasts.</li>
            <li>If this does happen, however, Comet with Bleach lifts the stains out quite easily if you let it sit for a bit.</li>
            <li>The ends were fine, so I touched up my roots after a month.</li>
            <li>Just the roots, I didn&#x27;t do anything to the ends, since they were fine.</li>
            <li>I love my funky hair colors &amp; everything else rinses out quickly.</li>
            <li>Color last strong for a good two weeks, longer than most products out there.</li>
            <li>This is important, as you don&#x27;t want to be purple, nor do you want your hands to be purple, and trust me...</li>
            <li>But you might not like the clean up.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a LOT easier to get out than the special effects dye.</li>
            <li>yes, the colour is beautiful, it left my hair very silky</li>
            <li>So far I have been able to get it out of the counter (oops), sink, tub, and off my hands really easy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Third, while the dye had no problem washing out of my roots really quickly, it won&#x27;t leave the ends.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li>I tried diluting the purple passion dye with conditioner (this works fine with manic panic, special effects, etc) on my first try, but when I washed off the dye after, apparently the color didn&#x27;t stick to all my hair -</li>
            <li>My fingertips were stained for four days after I did my hair the first time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried MANY different brands, but nothing compares to Sparks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it will stain you purple for the first time rinsing it out.  </li>
            <li>I found it &amp; first tried it at a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>The raspberry color was very well-behaved, gave my hair a deep berry color, didn&#x27;t stain anything, and faded into a very nice pastel pink and then to a nicely pink-toned blonde.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to finally find a permanent purple hair colour, so after going to the brand website to check them out, I ordered it right away!</li>
            <li>/&gt;About 6 months ago, after having bright red hair for several years, I decided to try purple.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a permanent colour because I personally don&#x27;t like having to spend so much time re-doing a colour, processing more chemicals on my hair, just because it faded a week later.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>as much - mine was only at a light orange shade and it turned out fine&lt;</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;re gonna have to be ready to re-apply it as needed.</li>
            <li>Be very careful!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The fuchsia faded really really fast</li>
            <li>I want to dye my hair another color, I&#x27;d really like to get the purple out</li>
            <li>It has that nice quality that is hard to find which allows it to fade in a pretty way.</li>
            <li>It does last MUCH longer than Manic Panic, but it also requires a little more clean up afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit less vibrant, but the &#x27;new&#x27; shade that is revealed during the fading process is still quite lovely.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it because the color is VERY vibrant and stays for a long time.  </li>
            <li>After washing out the dye the first time, and every time I washed my hair (or even got it wet) for the first two to three weeks, I had to bleach my bathtub.</li>
            <li>I have washed my hair four times and the dye still runs out of it like the first time - repeatedly dying my entire body purple.  </li>
            <li>And is extremely affordable, compared to manic panic and special effects which are between 12 and 15 dollars.</li>
            <li>Not the biggest complaint in the world, most dyes stain to an extent, but this one was ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worked exactly how expected and came way faster than said date.</li>
            <li>I had to bleach my dyed-black (naturally dark-blonde) hair to yellow like instructed, and let this sit for a good 40 minutes (it says only 20 minutes, but I was too skeptical for that).</li>
            <li>recommend this color to someone who was really super sure that they wanted to have purple hair for the next 4-6 months, but as someone who likes changing my hair around a lot, Sparks Purple Passion has been really inconvenient.</li>
            <li>THIS color, however, has given me nothing but trouble (aside from the color itself, which is a nice deep bluish-purple that reddens up a little after a couple of washes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s vibrant and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>They actually have a specific tube (crystal clear) that they indicate is for diluting colors to pastel-like shades</li>
            <li>and I have pink and blonde and very faded purple</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Every other brand I tried couldn&#x27;t mask the red, but finally Sparks made my hair PURPLE.</li>
            <li> Even after not touching up my hair for a month,  I still receive compliments on how vibrant the color</li>
            <li> do not expect this brand to cover grey even with the grey coverage additive&lt;</li>
            <li> br /&gt;i have to bleach my grey for it to work</li>
            <li> The color this fades to is a brief bland greyish-purple, then it washes out entirely after a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Stained hands for a few days isn&#x27;t really a bad trade off for gorgeous hair for months.</li>
            <li> Even on my son hair which is dark blonde.</li>
            <li> Be careful about staining your tub/sink during application and rinsing.</li>
            <li> the color likes to rub off on clothes a lot which I expected for about a week or so not 3 weeks&lt;</li>
            <li> other thing I need to add...</li>
            <li> I saw other people post on here &amp;quot;don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Thank God I only did the front of my hair and a few end tips!</li>
            <li> It doesnt fade into pink at all, just to a pale purple (i bleach</li>
            <li> I showered, looked down at my hands</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does make a mess, but nothing a little bleach can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> nothing a little bleach won&#x27;t remove though.</li>
            <li> nearly killed himself laughing when I answered the door.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is like trying to remove glitter nail polish (aka the herpes of the craft world) - pretty much impossible.  </li>
            <li> But if I failed to remember to use the colour/conditioner mix, it definitely showed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> SO I learned the hard way.  </li>
            <li> in my opinion it kinda sucks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like a faint grape jelly</li>
            <li> This stains like crazy for days after dyeing your hair</li>
            <li> It fades bad.</li>
            <li> shower, just rinse, it stains&amp;quot;, I thought it can&#x27;t be that bad,</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this color! Color last strong for a good two weeks, longer than most products out there.</li>
            <li> Worked as well as i anticipated!</li>
            <li> Awesome color. WASHES OUT OF BATHTUB!!! That was a big deal. Good for doing an ombré effect.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was hoping for! Worked exactly how expected and came way faster than said date.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to finally find a permanent purple hair colour, so after going to the brand website to check them out, I ordered it right away! I was looking for a permanent colour because I personally don&#x27;t like having to spend so much time re-doing a colour, processing more chemicals on my hair, just because it faded a week later.&lt;br /&gt;Well let me tell you...&lt;br /&gt;This does fade. It fades bad. Dare I say, they might as well call it demi-permanent.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type, but this colour just did not want to stay!! I had to bleach my dyed-black (naturally dark-blonde) hair to yellow like instructed, and let this sit for a good 40 minutes (it says only 20 minutes, but I was too skeptical for that). Of course, when I first washed out the colour, it was a great purple! Just as it shows on the picture! I was so pleased. After three washes, it faded to a muddy magenta colour...&lt;br /&gt;I found that mixing the colour with conditioner (1 part colour, 4 parts conditioner) and using it in the shower prevented fading perfectly. But if I failed to remember to use the colour/conditioner mix, it definitely showed.&lt;br /&gt;So yes, the colour is beautiful, it left my hair very silky and it didn&#x27;t damage it at all, but you&#x27;re gonna have to be ready to re-apply it as needed. Don&#x27;t expect this to be a one-and-done deal!&lt;br /&gt;One more positive note though--it smelled good! It doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals at all. It&#x27;s almost like a faint grape jelly smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I need to add...IT WILL STAIN ANYTHING IT TOUCHES. My fingertips were stained for four days after I did my hair the first time. I got one drop on the counter, I wiped it within two seconds, and there is still a purple mark there...months later. Be very careful!&lt;br /&gt;I found that anything with salicylic acid cleans it up best though, if you do make any mistakes :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair obnoxious colors for about ten years. I&#x27;ve tried MANY different brands, but nothing compares to Sparks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 6 months ago, after having bright red hair for several years, I decided to try purple. Every other brand I tried couldn&#x27;t mask the red, but finally Sparks made my hair PURPLE. Even after not touching up my hair for a month,  I still receive compliments on how vibrant the color is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does make a mess, but nothing a little bleach can&#x27;t fix. Stained hands for a few days isn&#x27;t really a bad trade off for gorgeous hair for months.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS AMAZING I GET COMPLEMENTS EVERY WHERE I GO</li>
            <li> Love it! Came out bright. Even on my son hair which is dark blonde.</li>
            <li> This purple is amazing! Its really long lasting, even when its thinned with conditioner. Ive been using it for about 3 months now, and its better than any purple ive used. It doesnt fade into pink at all, just to a pale purple (i bleach and then tone my hair so its white, so theres no chance of the yellowness of the bleach skewing the color after applied). And is extremely affordable, compared to manic panic and special effects which are between 12 and 15 dollars. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have had my hair done many fun colors over the years, but never have I encountered a dye that is so marvelous at dying everything you don&#x27;t want dyed.  My tub is purple.  My skin is purple.  My hair is. . .blue?  This stuff is like trying to remove glitter nail polish (aka the herpes of the craft world) - pretty much impossible.  I have washed my hair four times and the dye still runs out of it like the first time - repeatedly dying my entire body purple.  Just when I think that my husband has washed me with bleach for the last time, my hair will get damp or simply shed color in its dry form all over my body.  I can&#x27;t leave the house and the Fedex guy nearly killed himself laughing when I answered the door.  I have a correctional color booked for this coming weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t do it.  Just say no.</li>
            <li> This is basically the same formula as the pricier Pravana brand. It gives a gorgeous, very vibrant violet color that lasts. It&#x27;s been three weeks since I applied it, and though it has faded some, it still is beautiful. It has that nice quality that is hard to find which allows it to fade in a pretty way. It&#x27;s a bit less vibrant, but the &#x27;new&#x27; shade that is revealed during the fading process is still quite lovely. Be careful about staining your tub/sink during application and rinsing. If this does happen, however, Comet with Bleach lifts the stains out quite easily if you let it sit for a bit.</li>
            <li> For my last DIY dye, I used a mix of Sparks Purple Passion, Electric Blue and Manic Panic Fuchsia Shock. The fuchsia faded really really fast but the sparks colors stayed put!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;- I tried diluting the purple passion dye with conditioner (this works fine with manic panic, special effects, etc) on my first try, but when I washed off the dye after, apparently the color didn&#x27;t stick to all my hair - maybe the formulation is different? They actually have a specific tube (crystal clear) that they indicate is for diluting colors to pastel-like shades so maybe I should try that next time&lt;br /&gt;- Since this is a really deep purple, you don&#x27;t need to bleach your hair as much - mine was only at a light orange shade and it turned out fine&lt;br /&gt;- This stains like crazy for days after dyeing your hair but it&#x27;s a LOT easier to get out than the special effects dye. Just make sure to scrub it out ASAP!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS Hair color!  it&#x27;s vibrant and long lasting.  But there is something you need to know, if you are applying it yourself, don&#x27;t shower to rinse, just dip your head over the sink or tub to rinse it out and wear gloves to rinse.  This is important, as you don&#x27;t want to be purple, nor do you want your hands to be purple, and trust me... it will stain you purple for the first time rinsing it out.  I saw other people post on here &amp;quot;don&#x27;t shower, just rinse, it stains&amp;quot;, I thought it can&#x27;t be that bad, OH IT IS!!  I showered, looked down at my hands and they were purple, I panicked.  SO I learned the hard way.  Also keep some clorox bathroom cleaner handy as you will need it to remove the stains from your tub or sink.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  It does last MUCH longer than Manic Panic, but it also requires a little more clean up afterwards.  I my opinion it&#x27;s worth it because the color is VERY vibrant and stays for a long time.  But you might not like the clean up.  So far I have been able to get it out of the counter (oops), sink, tub, and off my hands really easy.  I&#x27;ve used it 4 times now, and I will keep using this color.</li>
            <li> The color Is so wonderful I absolutely love it!! The issue is it has stained everything. If I scratch my head my finger is purple. My ears and the back of my neck stay purple. My pillow case is purple. This is after I shampooed my hair. I&#x27;m hoping the next shampoo will help with that. I have used several colors from this brand and the purple is the only one that has done this</li>
            <li> I love this brand! I found it &amp; first tried it at a beauty supply store. I love my funky hair colors &amp; everything else rinses out quickly. Spark is longer lasting &amp; the results are awesome!</li>
            <li> Color is great, pretty bright purple. Does stain skin &amp; bathtub as well as anywhere else it lands so beware, nothing a little bleach won&#x27;t remove though.</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair about two months ago using this dye, as well as Sparks Rad Raspberry. The raspberry color was very well-behaved, gave my hair a deep berry color, didn&#x27;t stain anything, and faded into a very nice pastel pink and then to a nicely pink-toned blonde. THIS color, however, has given me nothing but trouble (aside from the color itself, which is a nice deep bluish-purple that reddens up a little after a couple of washes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this dye stains EVERYTHING. After washing out the dye the first time, and every time I washed my hair (or even got it wet) for the first two to three weeks, I had to bleach my bathtub. Not the biggest complaint in the world, most dyes stain to an extent, but this one was ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, after just one wash, my roots started fading. The color this fades to is a brief bland greyish-purple, then it washes out entirely after a couple weeks. On my roots only. The ends were fine, so I touched up my roots after a month. Just the roots, I didn&#x27;t do anything to the ends, since they were fine. Another two weeks and my roots were blonde again. And the ends were STILL just as purple as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, while the dye had no problem washing out of my roots really quickly, it won&#x27;t leave the ends. Like I said, it&#x27;s been two months since I dyed my hair, and the color STILL WILL NOT COME OUT from my ends. I want to dye my hair another color, I&#x27;d really like to get the purple out, I&#x27;ve tried everything short of bleaching, and still this color has stayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this color to someone who was really super sure that they wanted to have purple hair for the next 4-6 months, but as someone who likes changing my hair around a lot, Sparks Purple Passion has been really inconvenient.</li>
            <li> I loved the great purple  it gave but I dyed my hair a month ago and I have pink and blonde and very faded purple and I have to re dye my hair again but I do NOT want to use this brand again because everytime I washed my hair or did my hair my hands turned purple that stopped about 2 1/2 weeks ago and I stained the tub and towels the color likes to rub off on clothes a lot which I expected for about a week or so not 3 weeks&lt;br /&gt;So in my opinion it kinda sucks I know for sure I won&#x27;t be using again</li>
            <li> do not expect this brand to cover grey even with the grey coverage additive&lt;br /&gt;i have to bleach my grey for it to work&lt;br /&gt;and be warned the purple is V E R Y purple</li>
            <li> I bought this dye for my birthday back in Sept. I finally got around to using it last month. It&#x27;s been 4 weeks and it&#x27;s STILL running out of my hair with every shower! I can&#x27;t scratch my head without getting purple under my nails and my pillow case is now purple from my hair. Plus, 2 days after dying my hair my roots had already lost color. Thank God I only did the front of my hair and a few end tips! 0/10 would not buy again or recommend.</li>
