            <li>This is a great hair iron</li>
            <li>After using this on my own for about a month, and having the production hair people look at it ( they were impressed )</li>
            <li>--LOL).  </li>

            <li>The ease of use is wonderful, the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>Definitely a great product for the price.</li>
            <li>The iron itself felt great over my hair; no snagging or pulling.</li>
            <li>The Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply version, Arguan Oil is great too, about $5-$10 a bottle.</li>
            <li>this is a great option to try.  </li>
            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great.</li>

            <li>I used to have a CHI which I thought was great at the time</li>
            <li>but it turns out it&#x27;s not as great as this one.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still as great as it was when I got it.</li>
            <li>Anyone who cooks knows the joy of a non-stick surface.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this one!!</li>
            <li>and it is very nice</li>
            <li>And it works amazing!  </li>
            <li>Well, after two (almost three) kids, I just do not have that kind of time to self-indulge anymore!</li>
            <li>I remain impressed with the ease of use, and outstanding results.  </li>
            <li>It took an adjustment on my grip and I&#x27;ve been able to avoid from happening again, but it&#x27;s not the greatest control placement.    </li>
            <li>is perfect 100% recommended I love</li>
            <li>Its totally a good buy.</li>
            <li>its too good , with the highest setting for 410 F ..</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m writing this review after 18 months of good use.</li>
            <li>product is good quality</li>
            <li>loved it,dont think twice it makes my hair looks lovely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>all in all, this product performs well, and it&#x27;s a very good buy because it&#x27;s cheap--</li>
            <li>Its also lighter than some ceramic straighteners I&#x27;ve used so very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>My hair comes out so great, WAY better than the Chi ever did for me.</li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>I love my hair!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this straightener!</li>
            <li>I have never been able to style my hair the way my stylist does it at the salon, but this straightener does the job!  </li>
            <li>I tried this product for the first time tonight and am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this!</li>
            <li>More goods news!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this straightener!</li>
            <li>The teflon plates are amazing.  </li>
            <li>Teflon Fiber is great, it straightens smoothly, you don&#x27;t feel it pulling your hair.</li>
            <li>so I am kind of out of practice.</li>
            <li>Then, to add insult, because of the texture, it kind of drags your hair across the surface, snagging it up and holding it to the heat even longer.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re just as effective.  </li>
            <li>That is where a straightener comes in, as it is nice to have that shine you get from straighteners.     </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own problem.  </li>
            <li>I bought this straightener for 29.99 from Amazon, and am thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>nice look, shape, and display  </li>
            <li>-swivel cord is really nice  </li>
            <li>I had some kind of shock.</li>
            <li>Its nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to accidentally press buttons when in use.  </li>
            <li>So when I saw this product I read many reviews and liked how it had a teflon fiber on the plates to help hair glide through.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to use!</li>
            <li>The good things about this straightener is that it looks nice, it&#x27;s fairly easy to use, the teflon coating was fine, and your hair will not snag.</li>
            <li>The various temperature settings are great -- I&#x27;ve used mine at 360 degrees and that seems to work great, so I haven&#x27;t played with it.  </li>
            <li>and I am pretty happy with its performance.</li>
            <li>At first, it was great</li>
            <li>The numbers are easy to read to get the temperature you want and the fit is good in your hand.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this iron is that it is very light in which helps me style my hair faster.</li>
            <li>I have used many straighteners over the years.</li>
            <li>I am constantly touching them when using it.</li>
            <li>It did an okay job</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this straightener.  </li>
            <li>I love the Teflon fibers instead of a ceramic plate.</li>
            <li>This one works great and leaves my hair silky straight.</li>
            <li>Fabric plate provides more \\&quot;traction\\&quot;</li>
            <li>* Fabric plate provides more \\&quot;traction\\&quot;</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it..</li>
            <li>The 3 straighteners that I tried were all more expensive-and they could not compare.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for more than a month</li>
            <li>Ask them if they can help out on a better one.</li>
            <li>I have used many straighteners and this one takes the cake.</li>
            <li>product is ok when working.</li>
            <li>Overall I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the product and it was another great steal from Amazon!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>She loves hers as much as I love mine.</li>
            <li>Nothing goes from fro to smooth like this baby!</li>
            <li>It catches my hair and pulls out too many strands.</li>
            <li>and you need more heat.     </li>
            <li>Also, because the bottons take most of the handle, I kept pushing the bottons and had to keep looking at what I pushed and returned it to the setting i wanted.  </li>
            <li>This product is better for your hair.  </li>
            <li>For that reason, it has become the favorite.</li>
            <li>Most of straighteners use either metal or ceramic plates for contact with your hair.</li>
            <li>item is OK, I like it</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I bought it about 3 months ago and absolutly love it.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s What I Love About It:  </li>
            <li>and i can work with my work hat on while sweating, then sweat some more at the gym, go home,</li>
            <li>I have a tendency use a straightener more often than I should.  </li>
            <li>Most Remington straighteners have that problem.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Remington&#x27;s S2044 Ceramic Hair Straightener is top of the line.  </li>
            <li>Mostly out of fear my smoke alarm might go off.</li>
            <li>i like the ols one much better.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have used a number of brands of flat irons, and I tend to like two brands best, at both high-ish and low-ish price points - CHI and Remington.    </li>
            <li>For a woman who has bougth all kinds of flat irons, this is just simply great!</li>
            <li>But when I did, this was an awesome flat iron.</li>
            <li>The plates have some kind of special fabric covering to minimize damage.  </li>
            <li>I was extremely happy with this straightener until I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t working as well as it normally does.</li>
            <li>had I used a coupon), and for that price it works just as good as chi or babyliss; and it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair as much!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works wonderfully well on my moderately waves hair and would probably do a fine job straightening curly hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was so excited!</li>
            <li>Turn dials can be moved more easily when styling so</li>
            <li>liked the LCD indicator display with temperature choices (300-430-degree heat range), though I only needed it on the minimum temp for great results.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a fine line- style and damage hair or have unruly healthy hair.  </li>
            <li>Many have mentioned in their reviews that the straightener doesn&#x27;t clamp onto your hair well, requiring you to pinch the top of the straightener, and it&#x27;s absolutely true.</li>
            <li>and I really liked this one better as it stayed hot.</li>
            <li>I think this is a good product if you don&#x27;t want to spend too much money.</li>
            <li>My hair slides through much more easily than it did with the cheap Revlon</li>
            <li>The product seemed to be too light, or the amount of pressure that I was able to apply to the hair strands was too light.  </li>
            <li>The one inch size is easy to control, and the fabric is tourmaline, which adds to shine.    </li>
            <li>This an easy way to change your look in a flash, and reduce hair damage concerns</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other reviewers have mentioned that the temperature buttons are too easy to push mistakenly while in use.</li>
            <li>Designed for people who may have damaged or easily damaged hair</li>
            <li>-Locks for easy travel.  </li>
            <li>buttons on mine arent too easy to press like some reviewers have said.</li>
            <li>This unit was easy to use and did what was advertised: straightened my hair.</li>
            <li>The cord swivel made it easy to use without the cord getting in the way.</li>
            <li>The Remington heats up quickly, and is ready in no time, which is perfect for when I am getting ready for work.  </li>
            <li>Temp controls come in handy because at the highest setting this iron becomes dangerously hot.</li>
            <li>Works great heats fast easy to travel with since it has the lock on the side flaws tips get extremely hot</li>
            <li>This iron did a great job of straightening, smoothing and giving incredible shine to my hair - it looks better than it has in a long, long time!  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t pull out my hair and, more importantly, they help the straightener just glide over hair quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair with some curl that tends to be frizzy if I don&#x27;t blow-dry it</li>
            <li>I thought I was bound to have to go under the hood dryer forever with my fine grained African-American relaxed hair.     </li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy, frizzy hair</li>
            <li>I would be happy to give this product 5 stars except for the fact that when holding the hot iron, one wants to keep fingers away from the hottest part.  </li>
            <li>I love the locking feature and not to mention how quickly it heats up...</li>
            <li>and I FELL IN LOVE AFTER FIRST TRY!    </li>
            <li>This is the best product and i am wearing a close cut now..have been using it on my little sisters&#x27; hairs (11 and 12) and it maintains in between their jeratin treatments.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you are looking for a new straightener at a very good price.</li>
            <li>My hair is still smooth and silky this morning after.</li>
            <li>This one with the cloth like covered plates is smooth and the heat stays even.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few weeks now and its awesome.</li>
            <li>It did not straightened the hair as straight as I would liked it to have.  </li>
            <li>but this straightener doesnt leave my hair as smooth or shiny as i would like.</li>
            <li>, teflon is such a great product, toally made sense to me.</li>
            <li>Overall GREAT product.</li>
            <li>it is not as smooth when straightening your hair.</li>
            <li>It does offer some nice features, and could be very helpful for someone who is trying to minimize the damage to their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>-Leaves your hair feeling smooth,shiny and frizz free</li>
            <li>-fast warm up.</li>
            <li>the iron is now with my sister, so i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s easy to clean, or if gels, mousses, etc., will build up in the plates...</li>
            <li>I have had this one now for a few years and it still works great!</li>
            <li>of course i didn&#x27;t mind and it was a no-brainer considering Amazon&#x27;s shipping is free for anything over $25..</li>
            <li>The straightener has all the features you would look for in a good tool -- high heat - up to 430 degrees, quick heat up, swivel cord, temperature control and lock.  </li>
            <li>It gets it super straight and it feels incredibly healthy when I am done!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Final Verdict - Not a bad straight iron - although it may not be effective for people with curly hair.</li>
            <li>-lock&#x27;s shut for easy storage/packing  -one slow motion through a section of my hair will straighten it awesomely  </li>
            <li>There is a feature to \\&quot;lock\\&quot; the buttons, but it seems like it should&#x27;ve been better designed in the first place.  </li>
            <li>It glides over the hair, makes it unbelievably shiny and best of all, it doesn&#x27;t rip our hair out!    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with it</li>
            <li>However, this iron has not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Worth every cent!</li>
            <li>I did so much research for a good hair straightener, and due to the good reviews, I decided to go with this Remington instead of a Babyliss.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is very long as well, and this works great for both of us.</li>
            <li>This lil sleek flat iron is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I hold a brush in front of the plates while straightening bcz certain parts of my hair are frizzy, but my daughter doesn&#x27;t; either way it performs outstanding.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used better and my hair wasn&#x27;t as straight as it could have been.</li>
            <li>You can dial the temperature you want - really a sweet product.</li>
            <li>This flatiron is worth the purchase price if its primary use is to get rid of frizz.</li>
            <li>Said, ok, maybe too much protien, quit using split-end mender.</li>
            <li>And now it&#x27;s so much cheaper and better.  </li>
            <li>I have to go over my hair so many times until it looks straight.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY like the feel of the teflon over a ceramic or metal surface it does seem to hug the hair better.  </li>
            <li>This really does seem to be better for hair.</li>
            <li>(especially with some product in my hair)  -you wont find one this good at a cheaper price    </li>
            <li>the other hand, if you are looking for something you&#x27;re going to use once a week or more, this might wear out its welcome fast.</li>
            <li>looks like Remington has a Style Therapy Series available right now ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>my first purchase of a flat iron and it was a great choice.</li>
            <li>It gets hot very quickly and smooths over my hair like a $100 straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked that it had a fast heat up time and the digital temp gauge was a welcome change to the turn dial of my old straightener.</li>
            <li>Other than that it works great with my hair</li>
            <li>I just need to practice a little more with it to get as good as my hairstylist.</li>
            <li>I had trimmed my daughter&#x27;s hair before using this to really get a good idea how this works and her hair really looks very healthy, no new split ends.  </li>
            <li>I like the variable temperature, that it heats up quickly, and seems to have even heat.  </li>
            <li>But overall the teflon coating makes this a better hair straightener than most.</li>
            <li>* Unit heats up quickly   </li>
            <li>This product heats up quickly, but the temperature buttons are set up to when you are styling your hair-you hit the buttons.</li>
            <li>It gets hot QUICK!</li>
            <li>I thought that the fibers would cause more breakage to my coarse hair (I am african american), but it straightened perfectly :)</li>
            <li>Cons:  - doesn&#x27;t work AS well or as quickly as straighteners</li>
            <li>br /&gt;- Heats up quickly</li>
            <li>Este producto se lo regale a mi esposa desde ese momento esta super contenta y me dijo que</li>
            <li>no va al salón mas, porque la maquina esta super buena.</li>
            <li>This iron gets my hair smooth with one pass (if I don&#x27;t get a big chunk of hair) and it feels really nice and looks shiny as well.</li>
            <li>Luckily, Amazon had it.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and the teflon plates feel like it is not damaging my hair.</li>
            <li>This newer version gets the job done and does it well, but it will just never be able to completely live up to the original (although the new version is probably better on my hair...).  </li>
            <li>I am overall very satisfied with purchasing this hair straightener.</li>
            <li>plenty hot (unless you&#x27;re trying to bake a Christmas ham on it, I suppose) and is just all around fabulous.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing it is better for thinner, finer hair, not thick hair</li>
            <li>I have been using this one for several weeks now and am very satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>Very gentle!</li>
            <li>but otherwise it makes my hair sleek and soft and straight :) for days to come :)</li>
            <li>Also I think it is smokes more with the more products you put in your hair (I use and anti-breakage cream and a polisher to flat iron).</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as hot or as effective as a more traditional straightener - and may not be effective enough for people with curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It keeps my medium length hair straight for up to three days and is quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I got a great iron for less than 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li>I have been using straightening irons for several years, so I have had the opportunity to try many!</li>
            <li>buttons are easily pressed when gripping the iron - I have changed the temperature and turned it off numerous times.&lt;br /&gt;However, just to be fair, I have had this problem with every single iron I have</li>
            <li>I have chin-length fine, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast and straightens really quickly, too!  </li>
            <li>Both small issues, though, and this iron is great -- definitely worth it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it!    </li>
            <li>However, it straightens nicely and seems to make my hair a little more shiny.   </li>
            <li>This straightener makes my hair really straight and smooth.</li>
            <li>my sister has a similar one that she got from Target that works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>I just bought this iron last week and it is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Agian, if your looking for a cheap, high quality iron, this is the one!</li>
            <li>After my hair was blow dried a bit, and used this iron, must say results are great.</li>
            <li>I read the directions carefully, and it actually says that it heats up in 30 seconds - which is awesome for someone already time-crunched.</li>
            <li>I also really love that my sink isn&#x27;t covered in stray hairs like it was from my old straightener.</li>
            <li>I bought this iron 1 week ago thinking \\&quot;What the hey, might be worth a try.\\</li>
            <li>This product returns to the age old debate: healthy hair vs killer style.  </li>
            <li>Got it, used it, liked it well enough.</li>
            <li>I also liked the fact that it has double voltage.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to not worry about the cord getting tangled, especially if you&#x27;re curling.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it had the memory to come on where you last used it.  </li>
            <li>and I think that&#x27;s useful for pulling my hair taut.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this iron and gave it only 4 stars because the controls aren&#x27;t quite perfect (both lack of memory and position).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Probably most important: it has an auto-shutoff for those times when you might be in a hurry and potentially leave</li>
            <li>definitely worth your money.</li>
            <li>Poor design for a great iron!</li>
            <li>All in all, a nice little flat iron at a great price.</li>
            <li>it has a four year warranty, it gets as hot as i want, the plates are an odd sight (because you think it wont straighten a jacket lol) yet gives a silky finish afterwards without seeing any plates burning or cinching my hair.</li>
            <li>If you wash with Matrix sleek look (orange bottle) and put their styling conditioner in it...then blowdry it to damp..then straighten with this flat iron, you will have AMAZING results.</li>
            <li>Just put some in palm and massage through hair and flat ironing experience with this Remington straightner will be amazing.</li>
            <li>very hot - heat setting was at 10 and hot.</li>
            <li>One thing I don&#x27;t like is the fact that the on/off switch is right where you place your thumb as you comb.</li>
            <li>I tried it right away and let me tell u...</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>Controls are in just the right spot too, they don&#x27;t get in the way at all.  </li>
            <li>I am all too familiar with the damage most flat irons cause to hair structure.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and the temperature can go up pretty high.  </li>
            <li>if you have should see any smoke or hear a &amp;#34;frying&amp;#34; sound, you have it waaay to high (up to 410 degrees) and its reacting to any chemicals you have put in your hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am happy with this straightening iron, and like it much better than the last few I have purchased.</li>
            <li>The unit is fantastic, and every bit as good as it&#x27;s more expensive \\&quot;siblings\\&quot;.   </li>
            <li>the teflon fabric on the plates provide a softer surface for hair to slide through, and it just makes sense that not cruching strands of hair between two bare metal plates is better for your hair.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat fine, and naturally straight hair, but my hair is not pin straight and can get frizzy on occasion.</li>
            <li>As an added bonus, my hair feels more soft and healthy using this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Not only was this flat iron dual voltage and full size, it&#x27;s also amazing!</li>
            <li>First off the control panel is right where you hold it, so I kept turning it off every time I lifted it up to straighten a piece of hair.  </li>
            <li>By the end, my hair was super straight and sooo silky.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and smooths hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>Withing three days,its display light gone and while using this product,it heat up a lot,due to too much heat on handle its very diffcult to hold</li>
            <li>I liked this flat iron as I find that most do not stay hot enough after running it through my long hair repeatedly, most seem to cool off quite a bit.</li>
            <li>Its great!!I had been hesitant to purchase a straightener for some time, mostly because I have baby fine hair that is delicate and break easily.</li>
            <li>I was considering buying a much more expensive iron, but I&#x27;m so glad I got this one and gave it a try - saved myself a boatload of money and got exactly what I was looking for! :-)</li>
            <li>It does such an amazing job that my hair stays straight even when it&#x27;s pretty humid out</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s supposed to be very straight</li>
            <li>As I re-purpose such things, I can assure you that this unit performed well as a way to give a light press to your pants, and make the sleaves of a shirt look fresh!  </li>
            <li>My recommendation is if you value your hair to stay clear of this and invest in a good flat iron.</li>
            <li>For casual, once-in-a-while usage, this is probably a good choice, but if you want something more comfortable to use more often, and for long periods of time, consider another product.</li>
            <li>My hair comes out shiny and healthy looking (not flat and</li>
            <li>I own the older version also, which is not digital.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use, heats up quickly, and simply glides through your hair.</li>
            <li>and the ends are pretty damaged, and lots of layers, etc.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it works so much better than the $10 one I had before!</li>
            <li>I tried this straightener and I found with my first use that it is not for me.  </li>
            <li>I know a flatiron is supposed to get hot but this gets so hot that it burned my hair.  </li>
            <li>At first, I figured it was just because I had not had hair cut in awhile</li>
            <li>Cool, got it, expected better results.</li>
            <li>She said when this type of ceramic hair device first came out, they were in the hundreds.  </li>
            <li>Then I sectioned it off, working on the lower part first.</li>
            <li>From the first section, I was floored.</li>
            <li>the Remington S2044 Damage Therapy Ceramic Hair Straightener with Teflon Fiber Plates is most DEFINITELY the one to get.</li>
            <li>it got hot and everything</li>
            <li>iron gets really hot</li>
            <li>Smokes a lot; at first I thought it was my hair, but then I realized it&#x27;s just the iron itself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not getting hot.</li>
            <li>and my hair is STRAIGHT!  </li>
            <li>First let me say I have hideous hair.  </li>
            <li>I think another reviewer mentioned running her hands through her hair more often - I find I&#x27;m doing the same thing...</li>
            <li>Love that it has different temperature settings to pick from and that it protects your hair while getting the style you want!</li>
            <li>It is comparable to a CHI with how straight and shiny my hair will stay for days!</li>
            <li>It gets really hot</li>
            <li>this is my 2nd straightener, and i love it.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my personal use, I like the size, color, and elegant design</li>
            <li>the digital gauge with buttons worked out better for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 68, have medium length &amp; medium texture hair which is currently brown with the help of L&#x27;Oreal :)</li>
            <li>It still gets hot but maybe not as even.</li>
            <li>My first time using it.</li>
            <li>First Pass</li>
            <li>When I get the updated model I will edit this review further to include my comparison to the Sedu :)</li>
            <li>it was $1 higher than I paid at Wal-Mart, yet</li>
            <li>It glides right over my hair....gets very hot....and leaves my hair very straight and shiny.   </li>
            <li>However, the slight texture of the plates and perhaps smaller width of the iron seem to work great to still get my straight and smooth.  </li>
            <li>feels soft and smooth and comfortable unlike bare ceramic blades.</li>
            <li>I have used many straighteners and the flat ceramic plates</li>
            <li>I am so pleased after having to return two of the Remington S10-51 flat irons because they did not heat up beyond 375, althought they were supposed to go up to 430.</li>
            <li>and i love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna test out the \\&quot;damage therapy\\&quot; properties this flat iron claims :)</li>
            <li>Ceramic Fiber creates more styling surface than flat, slim plates.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I had one of these and gave it to my daughter because she was using the other kind.</li>
            <li>This is a good flat iron- it heats up quickly, gets really hot, has a long swivel cord, and the teflon seems to work really well.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>We both tried this new style with the Ceramic Fabric-wrapped plates hoping for a smooth, straight result on our very wavy hair without the frizzy damage...</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like this straightener because the Teflon Fiber Plates were strange to me.</li>
            <li>I have to pass the straihtener through each hair portion more than 3 times in order to get it straight enough.</li>
            <li>This Remington flat iron seems to straighten it pretty well - I am able to make it fairly straight, flip it under, or flip it out with ease.  </li>
            <li>It heats up very fast (even before I&#x27;m ready to use it), and I like that</li>
            <li>It gives more \\&quot;traction\\&quot; and so hair, at least fine, straight hair, doesn&#x27;t slide through as quickly.  </li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing, except make my hair frizzy, and hot.</li>
            <li>I get compliments pretty much every day.</li>
            <li>It heats up pretty fast and it has a hinge lock so you can lock it when you&#x27;re not using it</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally pretty straight</li>
            <li>I had the older version of this straightener and when its fiber plates finally ripped after many years of use</li>
            <li>Definitely a suggestion if your looking for really good flat iron but not trying to spend too much.</li>
            <li>This one is sooo much smaller and easy to handle than its predecessor.  </li>
            <li>not a big deal for me, but im a guy and have strong hands  -for</li>
            <li>but I suppose a few flyaways are better than split ends and breakage!</li>
            <li>and so far I haven&#x27;t seen or felt any damaging effects and my hair actually feels pretty good as far as texture, soft and managable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have also seen less breakage of my ends and overall more healthy hair.</li>
            <li>If, like me, you&#x27;re not a die-hard hair flattener and only do it for certain occasions or funsies, then this is a great little product for the price.</li>
            <li>OMG - why pay the price for a Chi when you have this amazing little guy.  </li>
            <li>The teflon fiber idea is brilliant, because the problem with regular hair straighteners, at least for me, is how the metal will just rip out ends that are frayed.</li>
            <li>so I had to press them together the whole time that I was working with my hair.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast, it straightens well</li>
            <li>I am constantly getting comments on how smooth and shiny my hair looks.</li>
            <li>Fast heat up, sleek design,</li>
            <li>but I very serously doubt anyone can find fault with this thing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This straightener is an absolute steal at $35.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give much of hair burning sensation either.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t like this straightener, I can believe I made so much research and for nothing.</li>
            <li>like:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;Has a comfortable grip.&lt;br /&gt;There is a digital temperature gauge, with a choice of 3 settings.&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li>Do people really fiddle with the temperature that much?  </li>
            <li>Do people really fiddle with the temperature that much?  </li>
            <li>This iron makes my hair roots STRAIGHT</li>
            <li>but still...I would recommend this for the person that really knows how to operate one and not burn your hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>What I really like about it</li>
            <li>I really do not know how anyone cannot love this straightener.</li>
            <li>I confirmed with different stylist at another salon.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and the hair conforms to the shape you put it to, even for stubbon hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight enough it will not strain your arm or wrist when using it.  </li>
            <li>this would probaly work on some one who have realitivly strait hair and for someone who just wants to soften it maybe.</li>
            <li>i only recommend it for some one who has stait hair and is looking to just smooth it.</li>
            <li>and that is way too much for my hair.</li>
            <li>well  - plates are gentle- my hair is never pulled by getting stuck in seams  - damage control function    </li>
            <li>It defrizzes really well, too.  </li>
            <li>The fabric is much softer on your hair than metal plates, and I could tell a difference in the shine/softness of my hair.    </li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>and I am very disaapointed with this product.  </li>
            <li>I really like this straightener.  </li>
            <li>This one performs very close to my Chi.  </li>
            <li>So I bought this one hoping it wouldn&#x27;t damage my hair that much because it had the teflon fibers and what not.</li>
            <li>I have mostly straight hair</li>
            <li>The auto shut-off is very convenient as well because I tend to forget about turning things off</li>
            <li>so this is a safety feature that I can really appreciate</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>-Really</li>
            <li>and it is still straight.</li>
            <li>it beeps when it&#x27;s ready.  </li>
            <li>I have mostly straight hair with a flip/wave to it in the front, so that&#x27;s what I focus on straightening every day.  </li>
            <li>-really</li>
            <li>beeps and flashes when ready.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>so much that I bought another one.</li>
            <li>I have the Remington Shine Therapy straightener and it works very well, so</li>
            <li>Well, it doesn&#x27;t straighten hair very well, so</li>
            <li>and I really do see a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>That said, this straightener with the teflon fabric plates really does help.  </li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>And I have really, really curly hair.</li>
            <li>The whole teflon thing made sense to me.</li>
            <li>Then I asked myself how much i paid for this thing??</li>
            <li>Also, I can leave this iron at a 5 and my hair is pin straight...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think it helped my damage hair at all.</li>
            <li>it gives hair straight but frizzy.</li>
            <li>Granted, I probably don&#x27;t need to turn it on that early since it only take a minute to heat up, but sometimes I forget :)</li>
            <li>The only reason why I liked this product was because the temperature level was digital.</li>
            <li>This is a fine flat iron.  </li>
            <li>After I used it it left my hair flat, smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li>However, it turns out that fine, straight hair is actually acceptable as long as it is smooth.  </li>
            <li>They send you a new one first</li>
            <li>I wind up having to buy myself a new straightener every 10 - 12 months because although it still feels just as hot, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to style my hair as well as it used to.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this straightener as my old one (FHI) was 4 years old, and I wanted one that I could control the temperature.  </li>
            <li>So just recently used it for the first time yesterday and my hair has never been so straight besides going to the hair salon!!</li>
            <li>You want a flat iron to have plates that are TOTALLY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t my first High Straightener, I have had more pricy ones, and less pricy ones.  </li>
            <li>Also, although the straightener gets nice and hot, it had problems with my thick and wavy hair.    </li>
            <li>Maybe if you only use cheap flat irons this would be a good product and cause less</li>
            <li>It does a much better job than my previous straightener (which was a revlong blow and straight, but the straightener part always fell off</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t noticed any issues with static, but we haven&#x27;t hit the really dry weather around here</li>
            <li>The packaging of the product is cool - the box offers a VERY 1970&#x27;s look with a swirl of orange, yellow ( to complement the brown fabric, which they nicely offer a \\&quot;touch-me\\&quot; sample, on the front) and olive green.  </li>
            <li>so I was pretty surprised by this.  </li>
            <li>The teflon fiber plates have a different feel than the more standard ceramic plates on other straighteners-- more like fabric than metal--</li>
            <li>The Remington S2044 uses ceramic plates that have a fiber cover which keeps your hair from making direct contact with hot heating elements.</li>
            <li>my hair is natural and when i first used it i had a baby afro</li>
            <li>Overall the product is not bad per se.  </li>
            <li>The swivel cord is nice and, so far, hasn&#x27;t kinked, but I also haven&#x27;t traveled with it or wrapped it up tight in my vanity drawer.    </li>
            <li>The temperature range is so big, so its good when you just need a little heat or when it is time for a relaxer</li>
            <li>The hightest heat setting did not get hot enough to straighten my daughter&#x27;s coarse hair but did smooth my hair which is already straight but frizzy.</li>
            <li>Most, or should I say all flat irons gets real hot on the back of the heat plates that you sometimes (quite often, actually) burn your forehead or neck in the process of trying to straighten your hair...    </li>
            <li>This flat iron heats up quickly and works really well according to my wife.</li>
            <li>This will not take those away but it really does minimize the look of them and seems to prevent new ones.  </li>
            <li>hair is dry and dameged it makes it shine and smooth</li>
            <li>heats up quickly, and has a low sound-alert feature to notify you when it reaches temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly to my delight, and the next morning I plugged it in, and the screen began to flash.</li>
            <li>There IS a burning smell, but I wasn&#x27;t particularly bothered by that either.</li>
            <li>like this particular hair straightener</li>
            <li>For the price, this seems like a decent purchase.  </li>
            <li>Both of us found that our hair straightened with only a couple of passes, looked smooth and soft, and it lasted all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>particular iron has a sturdy fabric (my words) covering the plates.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for quite a while, use it at least once a day and still love it!</li>
            <li>This flat iron heats up in about 20 seconds to full heat (430).  </li>
            <li>In fact, your hair goes through so loosely and so smoothly, that it&#x27;s part of the reason it doesn&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>If you need something like this, it is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I like the high temp of this iron.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would be scared to put this thing on high.</li>
            <li>One drawback: The on/off/temp buttons are somewhat easily altered (albeit accidentally) due to their positioning.</li>
            <li>I had been blow-drying straight my naturally curly hair since the 7th grade.</li>
            <li>I used this product for 5-6 months, normal usage</li>
            <li>I pulled out the instructions, and it stated that was normal, as it flashed as it was heating up.</li>
            <li>iron has a cloth covered plates where hair gets more surface coverage but doesn&#x27;t rub hairs against each other, which is one of the major reasons hair gets so brIttle and damaged.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for three weeks</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak of the other two products, but I&#x27;m happy to own the Damage Therapy Ceramic Hair Straightener with Teflon Fiber Plates and feel that, of all the straightening irons I&#x27;ve used in the past, it is the least damaging on my hair.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have is that the placement of the on/off and temperature control buttons are right where I hold it</li>
            <li>This makes it hard to grip for long periods, unless you hold it at the very bottom, which does not give you a good grip for straightening.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>You may want to watch the video, but due since your hair is not making contact with a smooth surface</li>
            <li>but my Solia Flat Iron never caused the amount of damage this does in a month&#x27;s worth of use.</li>
            <li>It does a great job, my only complaint is that the buttons to turn it on/off, and to change the temp are right where I put my hands to hold the iron closed.</li>
            <li>However, I contacted Reminton&#x27;s warranty department and they graciously sent out a new unit.</li>
            <li>Go to new stylist.</li>
            <li>you are in the market for a new curling iron (or a new head of hair)</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t make you send the iron to them and then have to wait for them to send you a new one.</li>
            <li>i live by the beach</li>
            <li>Just be sure your hair is thoroughly dry before you start, so that your natural curl doesn&#x27;t fight its way back into the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a not super strong smell but it can be unnerving.</li>
            <li>All good hair irons have a life span of about this much time and sadly its now time to replace it with a twin.</li>
            <li>It seems less smooth than other plates, but it glides over my hair just fine.  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time last night and I am SOLD!</li>
            <li>MUCH better results than blow-drying + round brush + brush rollers!</li>
            <li>My hair has never snagged on the plates, its hot enough to straighten yet not damage.</li>
            <li>Already the owner of several higher-end (&#x3D;higher priced) styling tools, I decided to go with this one.</li>
            <li>The hightest heat setting did not get hot enough to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>First of all heat is not recommended for daily use on hair but because Remington claimed that \\&quot;The Remington Style Therapy:</li>
            <li>Over the years I have tried different hair styling irons and I would say that this one works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Straightened hair does not feel dry--it feels soft!  </li>
            <li>I have no idea how anyone could say it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough?!</li>
            <li>There is no reason anyone should need to put 410 degrees on their hair and then to say it didn&#x27;t get hot enough...    </li>
            <li>Add thermal protectant, and it starts to stick, as you can&#x27;t really get it out of the crevices of fabric even if you do clean everyday.</li>
            <li>It is so smooth and just glides down my hair.</li>
            <li>I have pretty easy hair to tame, but my sister who has big curly hair also loves this thing and uses it whenever she comes over.</li>
            <li>It heats pretty quickly and has a quiet beep to let me know it has reached the set temperature, BUT you will always be re-setting your temperature due to where the button for that is placed.  </li>
            <li>but it tends to get VERY frizzy especially in the summertime in Florida where I live.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron, I had the previous model for about 4 years, it still worked but the plastic body around the plates was cracking and my hair would get stuck in it, so I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The flat iron does heat up pretty fast but did not straighten my daughters hair, so she was constantly trying to redo portions of her hair.</li>
            <li>ONLY complaint is that if I turn it on more than 5-10 minutes before I need it, the outside can get very hot.</li>
            <li>moZ7XR91CSDVQ2]]The Remington S2044 is a unique perspective on the typical hair straightener.</li>
            <li>She has very long thick curly hair and it straightens it easily!!</li>
            <li>I have previously had Andiis and Conair flat irons and nothing comes close to this one. :)</li>
            <li>but it caused more damage to my hair than my previous flat iron.</li>
            <li>So - I&#x27;ve been wearing my hair natural for a while.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy/curly hair too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxed to natural at the moment</li>
            <li>Once I made myself conscious of this and held it without pressing the buttons, I found that the plates were so slippery that it flew through my hair.  </li>
            <li>I also kinda hoped they&#x27;d fixed the button problem.  </li>
            <li>my old straightener, the \\&quot;temperature up\\&quot; and \\&quot;temperature down\\</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>You will be surprised at the ability to adjust prices just by asking.</li>
            <li>Review from a professional stylist, my wife.  </li>
            <li>My hair was still frizzy, but it seemed to work with the soft curls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hispanic woman with naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>Want it to be fixed or replaced.</li>
            <li>This one is different and I really like the teflon fiber plates.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really surprised at all the glowing 5 star ratings</li>
            <li>-The iron is not heavy</li>
            <li>I have had a couple of straighteners and nothing compares to this so far.</li>
            <li>Its been a week so far</li>
            <li>and we were happily surprised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely recommended, especially considering the reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I will just stick to my old straightener.</li>
            <li>and I also need to do a fast daily touch-up after sleeping on my hair.  </li>
            <li>i missed my old one which  is 1 and 1/2\\</li>
            <li>I do not straighten my hair daily - but I am glad that when I do - I am being gentle to my delicate hair.</li>
            <li>so my hair is kind of thin and wavy.</li>
            <li>After using this flat iron, my dead lifeless hair turned into smooth, sleek, straight hair.</li>
            <li>I have another iron of better qualify in which I prefer to use, but in all fairness, my other iron is more expensive.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my very long life, I like my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s obvious from the reviews that it may give different results based on your hair type, but it certainly works for me!  </li>
            <li>I have thick, long and lots of hair and this straightener works amazingly on my hair.  </li>
            <li>whatever I want it to do, it usually does the opposite :)  </li>
            <li>Because it heats up very fast, you have to be careful not to burn yourself.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and turns my hair lovely and sleek and smooth, although since I have VERY thick, long, wavy hair, I do have to do it in very small segments</li>
            <li>Most of the dual voltage or &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; flat irons are really small and I have a lot of hair</li>
            <li>i have natural thick curly hair and this flat iron works like magic</li>
            <li>She always came back to borrow mine, so I ended up giving her mine with the intention of buying a new straightening iron for me.</li>
            <li>no need to send it back, Remington CS sent me a new one.</li>
            <li>I have very long, very curly hair.</li>
            <li>First of all it takes too long to straightened my hair and my hair is only wavy not curly.</li>
            <li>As things stand, I&#x27;m going back to the old, non-beeping unit in hopes that this dream machine will surface!</li>
            <li>The other reviewers are correct, this thing gets HOT.</li>
            <li>I had to buy a new straightener when the attachment kept falling off and had bought the smooth and satin one, which still frizzed my hair pretty bad and fried it if I missed a wet spot, which this does not do as it has the teflon plates, so worth it!  </li>
            <li>This one works well too, but it seems to not get as hot (and therefore not get hair as straight) as other similarly priced flat irons.</li>
            <li>As things stand, I&#x27;m going back to the old, non-beeping unit in hopes that this dream machine will surface!Pro   </li>
            <li>and then you send the old one back.</li>
            <li>I have no regrets.</li>
            <li>I am an occasional straightener and my daughter straightens her hair frequently.</li>
            <li>that one pass left my hair sooo soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Oh and I recently tried my old one after using the Sedu for awhile.</li>
            <li>I also created slight curls at the ends and its absolutely stunning!...BUY IT!...</li>
            <li>at first i turned it up about half way.</li>
            <li>Actual outside of plates get hot as well so be careful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned one of the most expensive brand straighteners before and it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this one.</li>
            <li>My hair is actually not dry.</li>
            <li>I would have loved a 2\\&quot; or at least a 1.5\\&quot; inch because of my thick hair</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair and my old straightener was starting to give me split ends and breakage.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would be so hard to find one that was also full size.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any significant change.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really hard to hold it properly because of the placement of the temperature buttons.</li>
            <li>This iron is gentle on the hair and doesn&#x27;t break it as you pass down.  </li>
            <li>My mother, rest her soul, must be laughing loud and long at the idea of moi, who only ever wanted curly hair, using a straightener.  </li>
            <li>The plates do not get hot enough and the control buttons are badly misplaced, I&#x27;m always pressing them by accident.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a few features that I feel could have been improved:&lt;br /&gt;Almost the entire iron gets extremely hot to the touch.</li>
            <li>Pros:  - heats up quickly  - handles thick hair</li>
            <li>I do not flat iron my hair anymore.</li>
            <li>the straightener is enough really) as it is supposed to be 50% less damaging.</li>
            <li>it gives it a professional solid feel, but if you are rushing and using quick strokes, your hand will get tired.</li>
            <li>With the blow dry and straightener it took under an hour, usually for it me it takes about an hour and a half or more.</li>
            <li>I tend not to use a flat iron much as it makes it look like I have less hair than</li>

            <li> This is a great hair iron</li>
            <li> After using this on my own for about a month, and having the production hair people look at it ( they were impressed )</li>
            <li> --LOL).  </li>

            <li> I remain impressed with the ease of use, and outstanding results.  </li>
            <li> It took an adjustment on my grip and I&#x27;ve been able to avoid from happening again, but it&#x27;s not the greatest control placement.    </li>
            <li> is perfect 100% recommended I love</li>
            <li> Its totally a good buy.</li>
            <li> its too good , with the highest setting for 410 F ..</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m writing this review after 18 months of good use.</li>
            <li> product is good quality</li>
            <li> loved it,dont think twice it makes my hair looks lovely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> all in all, this product performs well, and it&#x27;s a very good buy because it&#x27;s cheap--</li>
            <li> Its also lighter than some ceramic straighteners I&#x27;ve used so very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> My hair comes out so great, WAY better than the Chi ever did for me.</li>
            <li> I love this thing!</li>
            <li> I love my hair!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this straightener!</li>
            <li> I have never been able to style my hair the way my stylist does it at the salon, but this straightener does the job!  </li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time tonight and am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> More goods news!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this straightener!</li>
            <li> The teflon plates are amazing.  </li>
            <li> Teflon Fiber is great, it straightens smoothly, you don&#x27;t feel it pulling your hair.</li>
            <li> so I am kind of out of practice.</li>
            <li> Then, to add insult, because of the texture, it kind of drags your hair across the surface, snagging it up and holding it to the heat even longer.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re just as effective.  </li>
            <li> That is where a straightener comes in, as it is nice to have that shine you get from straighteners.     </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own problem.  </li>
            <li> I bought this straightener for 29.99 from Amazon, and am thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> nice look, shape, and display  </li>
            <li> -swivel cord is really nice  </li>
            <li> I had some kind of shock.</li>
            <li> Its nice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to accidentally press buttons when in use.  </li>
            <li> So when I saw this product I read many reviews and liked how it had a teflon fiber on the plates to help hair glide through.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use!</li>
            <li> The good things about this straightener is that it looks nice, it&#x27;s fairly easy to use, the teflon coating was fine, and your hair will not snag.</li>
            <li> The various temperature settings are great -- I&#x27;ve used mine at 360 degrees and that seems to work great, so I haven&#x27;t played with it.  </li>
            <li> and I am pretty happy with its performance.</li>
            <li> At first, it was great</li>
            <li> The numbers are easy to read to get the temperature you want and the fit is good in your hand.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this iron is that it is very light in which helps me style my hair faster.</li>
            <li> I have used many straighteners over the years.</li>
            <li> I am constantly touching them when using it.</li>
            <li> It did an okay job</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener.  </li>
            <li> I love the Teflon fibers instead of a ceramic plate.</li>
            <li> This one works great and leaves my hair silky straight.</li>
            <li> Fabric plate provides more \\&quot;traction\\&quot;</li>
            <li> * Fabric plate provides more \\&quot;traction\\&quot;</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it..</li>
            <li> The 3 straighteners that I tried were all more expensive-and they could not compare.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for more than a month</li>
            <li> Ask them if they can help out on a better one.</li>
            <li> I have used many straighteners and this one takes the cake.</li>
            <li> product is ok when working.</li>
            <li> Overall I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the product and it was another great steal from Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> She loves hers as much as I love mine.</li>
            <li> Nothing goes from fro to smooth like this baby!</li>
            <li> It catches my hair and pulls out too many strands.</li>
            <li> and you need more heat.     </li>
            <li> Also, because the bottons take most of the handle, I kept pushing the bottons and had to keep looking at what I pushed and returned it to the setting i wanted.  </li>
            <li> This product is better for your hair.  </li>
            <li> For that reason, it has become the favorite.</li>
            <li> Most of straighteners use either metal or ceramic plates for contact with your hair.</li>
            <li> item is OK, I like it</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought it about 3 months ago and absolutly love it.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s What I Love About It:  </li>
            <li> and i can work with my work hat on while sweating, then sweat some more at the gym, go home,</li>
            <li> I have a tendency use a straightener more often than I should.  </li>
            <li> Most Remington straighteners have that problem.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Remington&#x27;s S2044 Ceramic Hair Straightener is top of the line.  </li>
            <li> Mostly out of fear my smoke alarm might go off.</li>
            <li> i like the ols one much better.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have used a number of brands of flat irons, and I tend to like two brands best, at both high-ish and low-ish price points - CHI and Remington.    </li>
            <li> For a woman who has bougth all kinds of flat irons, this is just simply great!</li>
            <li> But when I did, this was an awesome flat iron.</li>
            <li> The plates have some kind of special fabric covering to minimize damage.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely happy with this straightener until I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t working as well as it normally does.</li>
            <li> had I used a coupon), and for that price it works just as good as chi or babyliss; and it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair as much!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works wonderfully well on my moderately waves hair and would probably do a fine job straightening curly hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so excited!</li>
            <li> Turn dials can be moved more easily when styling so</li>
            <li> liked the LCD indicator display with temperature choices (300-430-degree heat range), though I only needed it on the minimum temp for great results.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a fine line- style and damage hair or have unruly healthy hair.  </li>
            <li> Many have mentioned in their reviews that the straightener doesn&#x27;t clamp onto your hair well, requiring you to pinch the top of the straightener, and it&#x27;s absolutely true.</li>
            <li> and I really liked this one better as it stayed hot.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product if you don&#x27;t want to spend too much money.</li>
            <li> My hair slides through much more easily than it did with the cheap Revlon</li>
            <li> The product seemed to be too light, or the amount of pressure that I was able to apply to the hair strands was too light.  </li>
            <li> The one inch size is easy to control, and the fabric is tourmaline, which adds to shine.    </li>
            <li> This an easy way to change your look in a flash, and reduce hair damage concerns</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other reviewers have mentioned that the temperature buttons are too easy to push mistakenly while in use.</li>
            <li> Designed for people who may have damaged or easily damaged hair</li>
            <li> -Locks for easy travel.  </li>
            <li> buttons on mine arent too easy to press like some reviewers have said.</li>
            <li> This unit was easy to use and did what was advertised: straightened my hair.</li>
            <li> The cord swivel made it easy to use without the cord getting in the way.</li>
            <li> The Remington heats up quickly, and is ready in no time, which is perfect for when I am getting ready for work.  </li>
            <li> Temp controls come in handy because at the highest setting this iron becomes dangerously hot.</li>
            <li> Works great heats fast easy to travel with since it has the lock on the side flaws tips get extremely hot</li>
            <li> This iron did a great job of straightening, smoothing and giving incredible shine to my hair - it looks better than it has in a long, long time!  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t pull out my hair and, more importantly, they help the straightener just glide over hair quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair with some curl that tends to be frizzy if I don&#x27;t blow-dry it</li>
            <li> I thought I was bound to have to go under the hood dryer forever with my fine grained African-American relaxed hair.     </li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy, frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I would be happy to give this product 5 stars except for the fact that when holding the hot iron, one wants to keep fingers away from the hottest part.  </li>
            <li> I love the locking feature and not to mention how quickly it heats up...</li>
            <li> and I FELL IN LOVE AFTER FIRST TRY!    </li>
            <li> This is the best product and i am wearing a close cut now..have been using it on my little sisters&#x27; hairs (11 and 12) and it maintains in between their jeratin treatments.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you are looking for a new straightener at a very good price.</li>
            <li> My hair is still smooth and silky this morning after.</li>
            <li> This one with the cloth like covered plates is smooth and the heat stays even.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and its awesome.</li>
            <li> It did not straightened the hair as straight as I would liked it to have.  </li>
            <li> but this straightener doesnt leave my hair as smooth or shiny as i would like.</li>
            <li> , teflon is such a great product, toally made sense to me.</li>
            <li> Overall GREAT product.</li>
            <li> it is not as smooth when straightening your hair.</li>
            <li> It does offer some nice features, and could be very helpful for someone who is trying to minimize the damage to their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> -Leaves your hair feeling smooth,shiny and frizz free</li>
            <li> -fast warm up.</li>
            <li> the iron is now with my sister, so i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s easy to clean, or if gels, mousses, etc., will build up in the plates...</li>
            <li> I have had this one now for a few years and it still works great!</li>
            <li> of course i didn&#x27;t mind and it was a no-brainer considering Amazon&#x27;s shipping is free for anything over $25..</li>
            <li> The straightener has all the features you would look for in a good tool -- high heat - up to 430 degrees, quick heat up, swivel cord, temperature control and lock.  </li>
            <li> It gets it super straight and it feels incredibly healthy when I am done!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Final Verdict - Not a bad straight iron - although it may not be effective for people with curly hair.</li>
            <li> -lock&#x27;s shut for easy storage/packing  -one slow motion through a section of my hair will straighten it awesomely  </li>
            <li> There is a feature to \\&quot;lock\\&quot; the buttons, but it seems like it should&#x27;ve been better designed in the first place.  </li>
            <li> It glides over the hair, makes it unbelievably shiny and best of all, it doesn&#x27;t rip our hair out!    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with it</li>
            <li> However, this iron has not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worth every cent!</li>
            <li> I did so much research for a good hair straightener, and due to the good reviews, I decided to go with this Remington instead of a Babyliss.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is very long as well, and this works great for both of us.</li>
            <li> This lil sleek flat iron is amazing!  </li>
            <li> I hold a brush in front of the plates while straightening bcz certain parts of my hair are frizzy, but my daughter doesn&#x27;t; either way it performs outstanding.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used better and my hair wasn&#x27;t as straight as it could have been.</li>
            <li> You can dial the temperature you want - really a sweet product.</li>
            <li> This flatiron is worth the purchase price if its primary use is to get rid of frizz.</li>
            <li> Said, ok, maybe too much protien, quit using split-end mender.</li>
            <li> And now it&#x27;s so much cheaper and better.  </li>
            <li> I have to go over my hair so many times until it looks straight.  </li>
            <li> I REALLY like the feel of the teflon over a ceramic or metal surface it does seem to hug the hair better.  </li>
            <li> This really does seem to be better for hair.</li>
            <li> (especially with some product in my hair)  -you wont find one this good at a cheaper price    </li>
            <li> the other hand, if you are looking for something you&#x27;re going to use once a week or more, this might wear out its welcome fast.</li>
            <li> looks like Remington has a Style Therapy Series available right now ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> my first purchase of a flat iron and it was a great choice.</li>
            <li> It gets hot very quickly and smooths over my hair like a $100 straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked that it had a fast heat up time and the digital temp gauge was a welcome change to the turn dial of my old straightener.</li>
            <li> Other than that it works great with my hair</li>
            <li> I just need to practice a little more with it to get as good as my hairstylist.</li>
            <li> I had trimmed my daughter&#x27;s hair before using this to really get a good idea how this works and her hair really looks very healthy, no new split ends.  </li>
            <li> I like the variable temperature, that it heats up quickly, and seems to have even heat.  </li>
            <li> But overall the teflon coating makes this a better hair straightener than most.</li>
            <li> * Unit heats up quickly   </li>
            <li> This product heats up quickly, but the temperature buttons are set up to when you are styling your hair-you hit the buttons.</li>
            <li> It gets hot QUICK!</li>
            <li> I thought that the fibers would cause more breakage to my coarse hair (I am african american), but it straightened perfectly :)</li>
            <li> Cons:  - doesn&#x27;t work AS well or as quickly as straighteners</li>
            <li> br /&gt;- Heats up quickly</li>
            <li> Este producto se lo regale a mi esposa desde ese momento esta super contenta y me dijo que</li>
            <li> no va al salón mas, porque la maquina esta super buena.</li>
            <li> This iron gets my hair smooth with one pass (if I don&#x27;t get a big chunk of hair) and it feels really nice and looks shiny as well.</li>
            <li> Luckily, Amazon had it.  </li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and the teflon plates feel like it is not damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> This newer version gets the job done and does it well, but it will just never be able to completely live up to the original (although the new version is probably better on my hair...).  </li>
            <li> I am overall very satisfied with purchasing this hair straightener.</li>
            <li> plenty hot (unless you&#x27;re trying to bake a Christmas ham on it, I suppose) and is just all around fabulous.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing it is better for thinner, finer hair, not thick hair</li>
            <li> I have been using this one for several weeks now and am very satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> Very gentle!</li>
            <li> but otherwise it makes my hair sleek and soft and straight :) for days to come :)</li>
            <li> Also I think it is smokes more with the more products you put in your hair (I use and anti-breakage cream and a polisher to flat iron).</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as hot or as effective as a more traditional straightener - and may not be effective enough for people with curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It keeps my medium length hair straight for up to three days and is quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I got a great iron for less than 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using straightening irons for several years, so I have had the opportunity to try many!</li>
            <li> buttons are easily pressed when gripping the iron - I have changed the temperature and turned it off numerous times.&lt;br /&gt;However, just to be fair, I have had this problem with every single iron I have</li>
            <li> I have chin-length fine, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Heats up fast and straightens really quickly, too!  </li>
            <li> Both small issues, though, and this iron is great -- definitely worth it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it!    </li>
            <li> However, it straightens nicely and seems to make my hair a little more shiny.   </li>
            <li> This straightener makes my hair really straight and smooth.</li>
            <li> my sister has a similar one that she got from Target that works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> I just bought this iron last week and it is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> Agian, if your looking for a cheap, high quality iron, this is the one!</li>
            <li> After my hair was blow dried a bit, and used this iron, must say results are great.</li>
            <li> I read the directions carefully, and it actually says that it heats up in 30 seconds - which is awesome for someone already time-crunched.</li>
            <li> I also really love that my sink isn&#x27;t covered in stray hairs like it was from my old straightener.</li>
            <li> I bought this iron 1 week ago thinking \\&quot;What the hey, might be worth a try.\\</li>
            <li> This product returns to the age old debate: healthy hair vs killer style.  </li>
            <li> Got it, used it, liked it well enough.</li>
            <li> I also liked the fact that it has double voltage.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice to not worry about the cord getting tangled, especially if you&#x27;re curling.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it had the memory to come on where you last used it.  </li>
            <li> and I think that&#x27;s useful for pulling my hair taut.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this iron and gave it only 4 stars because the controls aren&#x27;t quite perfect (both lack of memory and position).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Probably most important: it has an auto-shutoff for those times when you might be in a hurry and potentially leave</li>
            <li> definitely worth your money.</li>
            <li> Poor design for a great iron!</li>
            <li> All in all, a nice little flat iron at a great price.</li>
            <li> it has a four year warranty, it gets as hot as i want, the plates are an odd sight (because you think it wont straighten a jacket lol) yet gives a silky finish afterwards without seeing any plates burning or cinching my hair.</li>
            <li> If you wash with Matrix sleek look (orange bottle) and put their styling conditioner in it...then blowdry it to damp..then straighten with this flat iron, you will have AMAZING results.</li>
            <li> Just put some in palm and massage through hair and flat ironing experience with this Remington straightner will be amazing.</li>
            <li> very hot - heat setting was at 10 and hot.</li>
            <li> One thing I don&#x27;t like is the fact that the on/off switch is right where you place your thumb as you comb.</li>
            <li> I tried it right away and let me tell u...</li>
            <li> just right.  </li>
            <li> Controls are in just the right spot too, they don&#x27;t get in the way at all.  </li>
            <li> I am all too familiar with the damage most flat irons cause to hair structure.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and the temperature can go up pretty high.  </li>
            <li> if you have should see any smoke or hear a &amp;#34;frying&amp;#34; sound, you have it waaay to high (up to 410 degrees) and its reacting to any chemicals you have put in your hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am happy with this straightening iron, and like it much better than the last few I have purchased.</li>
            <li> The unit is fantastic, and every bit as good as it&#x27;s more expensive \\&quot;siblings\\&quot;.   </li>
            <li> the teflon fabric on the plates provide a softer surface for hair to slide through, and it just makes sense that not cruching strands of hair between two bare metal plates is better for your hair.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat fine, and naturally straight hair, but my hair is not pin straight and can get frizzy on occasion.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, my hair feels more soft and healthy using this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Not only was this flat iron dual voltage and full size, it&#x27;s also amazing!</li>
            <li> First off the control panel is right where you hold it, so I kept turning it off every time I lifted it up to straighten a piece of hair.  </li>
            <li> By the end, my hair was super straight and sooo silky.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and smooths hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> Withing three days,its display light gone and while using this product,it heat up a lot,due to too much heat on handle its very diffcult to hold</li>
            <li> I liked this flat iron as I find that most do not stay hot enough after running it through my long hair repeatedly, most seem to cool off quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Its great!!I had been hesitant to purchase a straightener for some time, mostly because I have baby fine hair that is delicate and break easily.</li>
            <li> I was considering buying a much more expensive iron, but I&#x27;m so glad I got this one and gave it a try - saved myself a boatload of money and got exactly what I was looking for! :-)</li>
            <li> It does such an amazing job that my hair stays straight even when it&#x27;s pretty humid out</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s supposed to be very straight</li>
            <li> As I re-purpose such things, I can assure you that this unit performed well as a way to give a light press to your pants, and make the sleaves of a shirt look fresh!  </li>
            <li> My recommendation is if you value your hair to stay clear of this and invest in a good flat iron.</li>
            <li> For casual, once-in-a-while usage, this is probably a good choice, but if you want something more comfortable to use more often, and for long periods of time, consider another product.</li>
            <li> My hair comes out shiny and healthy looking (not flat and</li>
            <li> I own the older version also, which is not digital.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, heats up quickly, and simply glides through your hair.</li>
            <li> and the ends are pretty damaged, and lots of layers, etc.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it works so much better than the $10 one I had before!</li>
            <li> I tried this straightener and I found with my first use that it is not for me.  </li>
            <li> I know a flatiron is supposed to get hot but this gets so hot that it burned my hair.  </li>
            <li> At first, I figured it was just because I had not had hair cut in awhile</li>
            <li> Cool, got it, expected better results.</li>
            <li> She said when this type of ceramic hair device first came out, they were in the hundreds.  </li>
            <li> Then I sectioned it off, working on the lower part first.</li>
            <li> From the first section, I was floored.</li>
            <li> the Remington S2044 Damage Therapy Ceramic Hair Straightener with Teflon Fiber Plates is most DEFINITELY the one to get.</li>
            <li> it got hot and everything</li>
            <li> iron gets really hot</li>
            <li> Smokes a lot; at first I thought it was my hair, but then I realized it&#x27;s just the iron itself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not getting hot.</li>
            <li> and my hair is STRAIGHT!  </li>
            <li> First let me say I have hideous hair.  </li>
            <li> I think another reviewer mentioned running her hands through her hair more often - I find I&#x27;m doing the same thing...</li>
            <li> Love that it has different temperature settings to pick from and that it protects your hair while getting the style you want!</li>
            <li> It is comparable to a CHI with how straight and shiny my hair will stay for days!</li>
            <li> It gets really hot</li>
            <li> this is my 2nd straightener, and i love it.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my personal use, I like the size, color, and elegant design</li>
            <li> the digital gauge with buttons worked out better for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 68, have medium length &amp; medium texture hair which is currently brown with the help of L&#x27;Oreal :)</li>
            <li> It still gets hot but maybe not as even.</li>
            <li> My first time using it.</li>
            <li> First Pass</li>
            <li> When I get the updated model I will edit this review further to include my comparison to the Sedu :)</li>
            <li> it was $1 higher than I paid at Wal-Mart, yet</li>
            <li> It glides right over my hair....gets very hot....and leaves my hair very straight and shiny.   </li>
            <li> However, the slight texture of the plates and perhaps smaller width of the iron seem to work great to still get my straight and smooth.  </li>
            <li> feels soft and smooth and comfortable unlike bare ceramic blades.</li>
            <li> I have used many straighteners and the flat ceramic plates</li>
            <li> I am so pleased after having to return two of the Remington S10-51 flat irons because they did not heat up beyond 375, althought they were supposed to go up to 430.</li>
            <li> and i love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna test out the \\&quot;damage therapy\\&quot; properties this flat iron claims :)</li>
            <li> Ceramic Fiber creates more styling surface than flat, slim plates.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I had one of these and gave it to my daughter because she was using the other kind.</li>
            <li> This is a good flat iron- it heats up quickly, gets really hot, has a long swivel cord, and the teflon seems to work really well.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> We both tried this new style with the Ceramic Fabric-wrapped plates hoping for a smooth, straight result on our very wavy hair without the frizzy damage...</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like this straightener because the Teflon Fiber Plates were strange to me.</li>
            <li> I have to pass the straihtener through each hair portion more than 3 times in order to get it straight enough.</li>
            <li> This Remington flat iron seems to straighten it pretty well - I am able to make it fairly straight, flip it under, or flip it out with ease.  </li>
            <li> It heats up very fast (even before I&#x27;m ready to use it), and I like that</li>
            <li> It gives more \\&quot;traction\\&quot; and so hair, at least fine, straight hair, doesn&#x27;t slide through as quickly.  </li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing, except make my hair frizzy, and hot.</li>
            <li> I get compliments pretty much every day.</li>
            <li> It heats up pretty fast and it has a hinge lock so you can lock it when you&#x27;re not using it</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally pretty straight</li>
            <li> I had the older version of this straightener and when its fiber plates finally ripped after many years of use</li>
            <li> Definitely a suggestion if your looking for really good flat iron but not trying to spend too much.</li>
            <li> This one is sooo much smaller and easy to handle than its predecessor.  </li>
            <li> not a big deal for me, but im a guy and have strong hands  -for</li>
            <li> but I suppose a few flyaways are better than split ends and breakage!</li>
            <li> and so far I haven&#x27;t seen or felt any damaging effects and my hair actually feels pretty good as far as texture, soft and managable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have also seen less breakage of my ends and overall more healthy hair.</li>
            <li> If, like me, you&#x27;re not a die-hard hair flattener and only do it for certain occasions or funsies, then this is a great little product for the price.</li>
            <li> OMG - why pay the price for a Chi when you have this amazing little guy.  </li>
            <li> The teflon fiber idea is brilliant, because the problem with regular hair straighteners, at least for me, is how the metal will just rip out ends that are frayed.</li>
            <li> so I had to press them together the whole time that I was working with my hair.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast, it straightens well</li>
            <li> I am constantly getting comments on how smooth and shiny my hair looks.</li>
            <li> Fast heat up, sleek design,</li>
            <li> but I very serously doubt anyone can find fault with this thing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This straightener is an absolute steal at $35.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give much of hair burning sensation either.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like this straightener, I can believe I made so much research and for nothing.</li>
            <li> like:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;Has a comfortable grip.&lt;br /&gt;There is a digital temperature gauge, with a choice of 3 settings.&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li> Do people really fiddle with the temperature that much?  </li>
            <li> Do people really fiddle with the temperature that much?  </li>
            <li> This iron makes my hair roots STRAIGHT</li>
            <li> but still...I would recommend this for the person that really knows how to operate one and not burn your hair.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> What I really like about it</li>
            <li> I really do not know how anyone cannot love this straightener.</li>
            <li> I confirmed with different stylist at another salon.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and the hair conforms to the shape you put it to, even for stubbon hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight enough it will not strain your arm or wrist when using it.  </li>
            <li> this would probaly work on some one who have realitivly strait hair and for someone who just wants to soften it maybe.</li>
            <li> i only recommend it for some one who has stait hair and is looking to just smooth it.</li>
            <li> and that is way too much for my hair.</li>
            <li> well  - plates are gentle- my hair is never pulled by getting stuck in seams  - damage control function    </li>
            <li> It defrizzes really well, too.  </li>
            <li> The fabric is much softer on your hair than metal plates, and I could tell a difference in the shine/softness of my hair.    </li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> and I am very disaapointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I really like this straightener.  </li>
            <li> This one performs very close to my Chi.  </li>
            <li> So I bought this one hoping it wouldn&#x27;t damage my hair that much because it had the teflon fibers and what not.</li>
            <li> I have mostly straight hair</li>
            <li> The auto shut-off is very convenient as well because I tend to forget about turning things off</li>
            <li> so this is a safety feature that I can really appreciate</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> -Really</li>
            <li> and it is still straight.</li>
            <li> it beeps when it&#x27;s ready.  </li>
            <li> I have mostly straight hair with a flip/wave to it in the front, so that&#x27;s what I focus on straightening every day.  </li>
            <li> -really</li>
            <li> beeps and flashes when ready.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> so much that I bought another one.</li>
            <li> I have the Remington Shine Therapy straightener and it works very well, so</li>
            <li> Well, it doesn&#x27;t straighten hair very well, so</li>
            <li> and I really do see a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> That said, this straightener with the teflon fabric plates really does help.  </li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> And I have really, really curly hair.</li>
            <li> The whole teflon thing made sense to me.</li>
            <li> Then I asked myself how much i paid for this thing??</li>
            <li> Also, I can leave this iron at a 5 and my hair is pin straight...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think it helped my damage hair at all.</li>
            <li> it gives hair straight but frizzy.</li>
            <li> Granted, I probably don&#x27;t need to turn it on that early since it only take a minute to heat up, but sometimes I forget :)</li>
            <li> The only reason why I liked this product was because the temperature level was digital.</li>
            <li> This is a fine flat iron.  </li>
            <li> After I used it it left my hair flat, smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li> However, it turns out that fine, straight hair is actually acceptable as long as it is smooth.  </li>
            <li> They send you a new one first</li>
            <li> I wind up having to buy myself a new straightener every 10 - 12 months because although it still feels just as hot, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to style my hair as well as it used to.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this straightener as my old one (FHI) was 4 years old, and I wanted one that I could control the temperature.  </li>
            <li> So just recently used it for the first time yesterday and my hair has never been so straight besides going to the hair salon!!</li>
            <li> You want a flat iron to have plates that are TOTALLY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my first High Straightener, I have had more pricy ones, and less pricy ones.  </li>
            <li> Also, although the straightener gets nice and hot, it had problems with my thick and wavy hair.    </li>
            <li> Maybe if you only use cheap flat irons this would be a good product and cause less</li>
            <li> It does a much better job than my previous straightener (which was a revlong blow and straight, but the straightener part always fell off</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t noticed any issues with static, but we haven&#x27;t hit the really dry weather around here</li>
            <li> The packaging of the product is cool - the box offers a VERY 1970&#x27;s look with a swirl of orange, yellow ( to complement the brown fabric, which they nicely offer a \\&quot;touch-me\\&quot; sample, on the front) and olive green.  </li>
            <li> so I was pretty surprised by this.  </li>
            <li> The teflon fiber plates have a different feel than the more standard ceramic plates on other straighteners-- more like fabric than metal--</li>
            <li> The Remington S2044 uses ceramic plates that have a fiber cover which keeps your hair from making direct contact with hot heating elements.</li>
            <li> my hair is natural and when i first used it i had a baby afro</li>
            <li> Overall the product is not bad per se.  </li>
            <li> The swivel cord is nice and, so far, hasn&#x27;t kinked, but I also haven&#x27;t traveled with it or wrapped it up tight in my vanity drawer.    </li>
            <li> The temperature range is so big, so its good when you just need a little heat or when it is time for a relaxer</li>
            <li> The hightest heat setting did not get hot enough to straighten my daughter&#x27;s coarse hair but did smooth my hair which is already straight but frizzy.</li>
            <li> Most, or should I say all flat irons gets real hot on the back of the heat plates that you sometimes (quite often, actually) burn your forehead or neck in the process of trying to straighten your hair...    </li>
            <li> This flat iron heats up quickly and works really well according to my wife.</li>
            <li> This will not take those away but it really does minimize the look of them and seems to prevent new ones.  </li>
            <li> hair is dry and dameged it makes it shine and smooth</li>
            <li> heats up quickly, and has a low sound-alert feature to notify you when it reaches temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly to my delight, and the next morning I plugged it in, and the screen began to flash.</li>
            <li> There IS a burning smell, but I wasn&#x27;t particularly bothered by that either.</li>
            <li> like this particular hair straightener</li>
            <li> For the price, this seems like a decent purchase.  </li>
            <li> Both of us found that our hair straightened with only a couple of passes, looked smooth and soft, and it lasted all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> particular iron has a sturdy fabric (my words) covering the plates.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for quite a while, use it at least once a day and still love it!</li>
            <li> This flat iron heats up in about 20 seconds to full heat (430).  </li>
            <li> In fact, your hair goes through so loosely and so smoothly, that it&#x27;s part of the reason it doesn&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If you need something like this, it is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I like the high temp of this iron.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would be scared to put this thing on high.</li>
            <li> One drawback: The on/off/temp buttons are somewhat easily altered (albeit accidentally) due to their positioning.</li>
            <li> I had been blow-drying straight my naturally curly hair since the 7th grade.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 5-6 months, normal usage</li>
            <li> I pulled out the instructions, and it stated that was normal, as it flashed as it was heating up.</li>
            <li> iron has a cloth covered plates where hair gets more surface coverage but doesn&#x27;t rub hairs against each other, which is one of the major reasons hair gets so brIttle and damaged.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for three weeks</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak of the other two products, but I&#x27;m happy to own the Damage Therapy Ceramic Hair Straightener with Teflon Fiber Plates and feel that, of all the straightening irons I&#x27;ve used in the past, it is the least damaging on my hair.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that the placement of the on/off and temperature control buttons are right where I hold it</li>
            <li> This makes it hard to grip for long periods, unless you hold it at the very bottom, which does not give you a good grip for straightening.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> You may want to watch the video, but due since your hair is not making contact with a smooth surface</li>
            <li> but my Solia Flat Iron never caused the amount of damage this does in a month&#x27;s worth of use.</li>
            <li> It does a great job, my only complaint is that the buttons to turn it on/off, and to change the temp are right where I put my hands to hold the iron closed.</li>
            <li> However, I contacted Reminton&#x27;s warranty department and they graciously sent out a new unit.</li>
            <li> Go to new stylist.</li>
            <li> you are in the market for a new curling iron (or a new head of hair)</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t make you send the iron to them and then have to wait for them to send you a new one.</li>
            <li> i live by the beach</li>
            <li> Just be sure your hair is thoroughly dry before you start, so that your natural curl doesn&#x27;t fight its way back into the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a not super strong smell but it can be unnerving.</li>
            <li> All good hair irons have a life span of about this much time and sadly its now time to replace it with a twin.</li>
            <li> It seems less smooth than other plates, but it glides over my hair just fine.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time last night and I am SOLD!</li>
            <li> MUCH better results than blow-drying + round brush + brush rollers!</li>
            <li> My hair has never snagged on the plates, its hot enough to straighten yet not damage.</li>
            <li> Already the owner of several higher-end (&#x3D;higher priced) styling tools, I decided to go with this one.</li>
            <li> The hightest heat setting did not get hot enough to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> First of all heat is not recommended for daily use on hair but because Remington claimed that \\&quot;The Remington Style Therapy:</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried different hair styling irons and I would say that this one works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Straightened hair does not feel dry--it feels soft!  </li>
            <li> I have no idea how anyone could say it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough?!</li>
            <li> There is no reason anyone should need to put 410 degrees on their hair and then to say it didn&#x27;t get hot enough...    </li>
            <li> Add thermal protectant, and it starts to stick, as you can&#x27;t really get it out of the crevices of fabric even if you do clean everyday.</li>
            <li> It is so smooth and just glides down my hair.</li>
            <li> I have pretty easy hair to tame, but my sister who has big curly hair also loves this thing and uses it whenever she comes over.</li>
            <li> It heats pretty quickly and has a quiet beep to let me know it has reached the set temperature, BUT you will always be re-setting your temperature due to where the button for that is placed.  </li>
            <li> but it tends to get VERY frizzy especially in the summertime in Florida where I live.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron, I had the previous model for about 4 years, it still worked but the plastic body around the plates was cracking and my hair would get stuck in it, so I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The flat iron does heat up pretty fast but did not straighten my daughters hair, so she was constantly trying to redo portions of her hair.</li>
            <li> ONLY complaint is that if I turn it on more than 5-10 minutes before I need it, the outside can get very hot.</li>
            <li> moZ7XR91CSDVQ2]]The Remington S2044 is a unique perspective on the typical hair straightener.</li>
            <li> She has very long thick curly hair and it straightens it easily!!</li>
            <li> I have previously had Andiis and Conair flat irons and nothing comes close to this one. :)</li>
            <li> but it caused more damage to my hair than my previous flat iron.</li>
            <li> So - I&#x27;ve been wearing my hair natural for a while.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy/curly hair too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxed to natural at the moment</li>
            <li> Once I made myself conscious of this and held it without pressing the buttons, I found that the plates were so slippery that it flew through my hair.  </li>
            <li> I also kinda hoped they&#x27;d fixed the button problem.  </li>
            <li> my old straightener, the \\&quot;temperature up\\&quot; and \\&quot;temperature down\\</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> You will be surprised at the ability to adjust prices just by asking.</li>
            <li> Review from a professional stylist, my wife.  </li>
            <li> My hair was still frizzy, but it seemed to work with the soft curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hispanic woman with naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Want it to be fixed or replaced.</li>
            <li> This one is different and I really like the teflon fiber plates.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really surprised at all the glowing 5 star ratings</li>
            <li> -The iron is not heavy</li>
            <li> I have had a couple of straighteners and nothing compares to this so far.</li>
            <li> Its been a week so far</li>
            <li> and we were happily surprised.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely recommended, especially considering the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I will just stick to my old straightener.</li>
            <li> and I also need to do a fast daily touch-up after sleeping on my hair.  </li>
            <li> i missed my old one which  is 1 and 1/2\\</li>
            <li> I do not straighten my hair daily - but I am glad that when I do - I am being gentle to my delicate hair.</li>
            <li> so my hair is kind of thin and wavy.</li>
            <li> After using this flat iron, my dead lifeless hair turned into smooth, sleek, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have another iron of better qualify in which I prefer to use, but in all fairness, my other iron is more expensive.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my very long life, I like my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obvious from the reviews that it may give different results based on your hair type, but it certainly works for me!  </li>
            <li> I have thick, long and lots of hair and this straightener works amazingly on my hair.  </li>
            <li> whatever I want it to do, it usually does the opposite :)  </li>
            <li> Because it heats up very fast, you have to be careful not to burn yourself.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and turns my hair lovely and sleek and smooth, although since I have VERY thick, long, wavy hair, I do have to do it in very small segments</li>
            <li> Most of the dual voltage or &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; flat irons are really small and I have a lot of hair</li>
            <li> i have natural thick curly hair and this flat iron works like magic</li>
            <li> She always came back to borrow mine, so I ended up giving her mine with the intention of buying a new straightening iron for me.</li>
            <li> no need to send it back, Remington CS sent me a new one.</li>
            <li> I have very long, very curly hair.</li>
            <li> First of all it takes too long to straightened my hair and my hair is only wavy not curly.</li>
            <li> As things stand, I&#x27;m going back to the old, non-beeping unit in hopes that this dream machine will surface!</li>
            <li> The other reviewers are correct, this thing gets HOT.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a new straightener when the attachment kept falling off and had bought the smooth and satin one, which still frizzed my hair pretty bad and fried it if I missed a wet spot, which this does not do as it has the teflon plates, so worth it!  </li>
            <li> This one works well too, but it seems to not get as hot (and therefore not get hair as straight) as other similarly priced flat irons.</li>
            <li> As things stand, I&#x27;m going back to the old, non-beeping unit in hopes that this dream machine will surface!Pro   </li>
            <li> and then you send the old one back.</li>
            <li> I have no regrets.</li>
            <li> I am an occasional straightener and my daughter straightens her hair frequently.</li>
            <li> that one pass left my hair sooo soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Oh and I recently tried my old one after using the Sedu for awhile.</li>
            <li> I also created slight curls at the ends and its absolutely stunning!...BUY IT!...</li>
            <li> at first i turned it up about half way.</li>
            <li> Actual outside of plates get hot as well so be careful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned one of the most expensive brand straighteners before and it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this one.</li>
            <li> My hair is actually not dry.</li>
            <li> I would have loved a 2\\&quot; or at least a 1.5\\&quot; inch because of my thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and my old straightener was starting to give me split ends and breakage.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would be so hard to find one that was also full size.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any significant change.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really hard to hold it properly because of the placement of the temperature buttons.</li>
            <li> This iron is gentle on the hair and doesn&#x27;t break it as you pass down.  </li>
            <li> My mother, rest her soul, must be laughing loud and long at the idea of moi, who only ever wanted curly hair, using a straightener.  </li>
            <li> The plates do not get hot enough and the control buttons are badly misplaced, I&#x27;m always pressing them by accident.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few features that I feel could have been improved:&lt;br /&gt;Almost the entire iron gets extremely hot to the touch.</li>
            <li> Pros:  - heats up quickly  - handles thick hair</li>
            <li> I do not flat iron my hair anymore.</li>
            <li> the straightener is enough really) as it is supposed to be 50% less damaging.</li>
            <li> it gives it a professional solid feel, but if you are rushing and using quick strokes, your hand will get tired.</li>
            <li> With the blow dry and straightener it took under an hour, usually for it me it takes about an hour and a half or more.</li>
            <li> I tend not to use a flat iron much as it makes it look like I have less hair than</li>
            <li> This same flat iron goes for about $50 (suggested retail) and i never see it in the stores.</li>
            <li> She loves this one and paid a fraction of the price her prior flat iron cost.</li>
            <li> I ordered this only because I was headed to the UK and needed a dual voltage flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find an iron that gets hot enough to straighten thick, curly hair and finally I found it.     </li>
            <li> Some of the positive features are temeperature control, you can set the temperature from 300F for thin fine hair to a maximum of 430F for thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> yet when static normally rears its ugly head.    </li>
            <li> it left my hair so shiney...unlike my babyliss flat iron which left it dry.</li>
            <li> My old straightener could handle an average amount of hair, and it made my life easier.     </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long it will last!</li>
            <li> even the curliest hair  can be straightened with this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I always use protective products when I use a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Just received the Remington flat iron this morning.....</li>
            <li> (also, I use thermal protectant whenever I flat iron) Stylist thought that was probably the issue, but recommended that I get some split-end mender and start using.</li>
            <li> This is the farthest thing from flat</li>
            <li> This is definitely an A+ flat iron.</li>
            <li> One day I was visiting my sister and used her flat irom (remingston teflon)</li>
            <li> B002LIXTFC Remington S9951 Shine Therapy Frizz Control, Humidity Resistant Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron, 1</li>
            <li> I had another Jilbere flat iron as a back-up but after buying this, I&#x27;ve already ditched it.</li>
            <li> B002LIXTFC Remington S-8510 Shine Therapy Frizz Control, Humidity Resistant Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron, 1 Inch]],</li>
            <li> However, unlike the CHI this flat iron just glides over your hair.</li>
            <li> My Chi flat iron burnt out</li>
            <li> This flat iron did not burn our hair while straightening.</li>
            <li> This flat iron has a swivel cord, on/off button with temperature controls.</li>
            <li> I have not had a flat iron that works the way this iron does.  </li>
            <li> I was living overseas when I bought this flat iron</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have used a Solia Flat Iron for 5 years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s minor, and I would still buy it, because it seems like every flat iron or curling iron put their on/off buttons in the same place.</li>
            <li> I wash and fully straighten my hair about every 3rd day (bleached blonde &#x3D; dry hair!)</li>
            <li> I also really appreciate that it comes with a lock - to keep out curious little fingers.</li>
            <li> recently gave the iron to my caucasian friend (straight, fine hair) who needed one and she had the same complaint: it straightens well, but produces a weird smell.</li>
            <li> I put products in my hair, and even when I run the flat iron through, it leaves the scent of whatever my hair product way!</li>
            <li> I purchased this Remington after my Revlon flat iron literally blew up in my hand!</li>
            <li> This added surface helps prevent hairs from rubbing against each other, thereby reducing a major cause of splitting and damage\\</li>
            <li> Because of all the constant retouching it takes a very long time to get her hair done as well.</li>
            <li> The unit itself is unisex, and professional looking - silver and black, and the fabric is dark-ish brown.    </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t want it completely dry either, so that the straightener has something left to work with.  </li>
            <li> or it gets a tiny bit wet, like if I get caught outside and it starts drizzling out.</li>
            <li> I have used the    - Andis black flat iron (not good enough)  - the conair with the yellow (doesn&#x27;t get hot enough)  - The Instyler (doesn&#x27;t get close to roots and it stopped working after 30 days, it short circuited)   -</li>
            <li> I normally dry my naturally curly hair into a straight style, but am never happy with the end result.  </li>
            <li> But when I used this my hair got straight but got all frizzy and dull too,and I have medium hair thickness.</li>
            <li> (You can lock the temp/on off button by holding down the &#x27;-&#x27; button for a few seconds)I certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is from this flat iron!!!  </li>
            <li> The Teflon plates definitely seem to keep my hair safer from damage than other flat irons.</li>
            <li> - Various other ceramic flat irons    </li>
            <li> If your hair is damaged, it won&#x27;t stay on it for long, so</li>
            <li> My 15-yr old daughter began straigtening her hair a few months ago, so I purchased another brand for her.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, curly, wavy, stubborn and color treated.</li>
            <li> Plus now it takes me 2x as long to straighten my hair</li>
            <li> They suggest that you pull your hair through slowly and if you do, it really does straighten your hair in one pass.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, naturally curly hair, and it normally takes a long time to blow dry and straighten it.  </li>
            <li> Also the digital display seems to be acting up a little.</li>
            <li> I was nervous that there isn&#x27;t a built-in comb (the other, larger iron I have has the comb</li>
            <li> My hair is a little below my mid back</li>
            <li> Also, I live in Florida and always hated the way blow-drying would make me hot and sweaty first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have course, dry, wavy, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It was dry dry...</li>
            <li> After years of looking for a flat iron that wasn&#x27;t too hot, too damaging, and too expensive I finally stumbled upon this miracle.</li>
            <li> In fact after cutting off most of the split ends and frazzled hair, I promised myself I&#x27;d cut the use of a flat iron down to a minimum.</li>
            <li> -i noticed a few days after using it that when you squeeze it closed there is a little too much resistance.</li>
            <li> It was also crazy bc products that perform worse costs more!!</li>
            <li> I have thin, wavy hair on the top of my head and thin, 1\\&quot; corkscrews on the back of my head.</li>
            <li> On this model, they are smaller and on the open side of the display and basically, at least for me, act as grippy little divots into which my fingers naturally fall as I style.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought this flat iron to help my thick coarse hair which is prone to heat damage.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener about 2 weeks ago and so far I am pretty crazy about it.</li>
            <li> Less passes over hair for smoothness; i only had to pass it over my hair once to get it</li>
            <li> I also owned the previous model and was bummed when it finally died.  </li>
            <li> Blue backlight on display is impossible to see in the type of decent lighting one hopes for when styling one&#x27;s hair (backlight flashes while unit is heating, stays steady when temperature is reached and you can see those things happen if you darken the room and wait for them)&lt;br /</li>
            <li> * Blue backlight on display is impossible to see in the type of decent lighting one hopes for when styling one&#x27;s hair (backlight flashes while unit is heating, stays steady when temperature is reached and you can see those things happen if you darken the room and wait for them)   </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this has helped cut down on the time it takes me to straighten my hair just because my hair wants to be wavy and is so thick.</li>
            <li> Hi I am a african american girl with long thick hair</li>
            <li> It actually gives a slight bit of drag making it easier to pull the hair through the clamp.</li>
            <li> The plates are rounded, so I do a little flip on the ends at the same time I straighten the rest.</li>
            <li> The placement of the very sensitive buttons on the handle means you&#x27;re constantly accidentally hitting them with your fingers while you&#x27;re trying to get a secure grip on it as you use it, and as a result, it&#x27;s extremely awkward and frustrating to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like Teflon cloth over the plates..not ur typical flat iron..</li>
            <li> Flat Iron features plates covered with ceramic fabric for 50 percent less hair splitting and damage.</li>
            <li> i love these bad boys.</li>
            <li> Getting more than frustrated.</li>
            <li> I have no real complaints.</li>
            <li> bought the iron in 2010/2011, and stopped using it a few months later because of the smell it gave my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but it turns off after only a few seconds now.</li>
            <li> The plates are rough to the touch.</li>
            <li> some reason it smokes whenever you squeeze it closed; even without using it on your hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t straighten it everyday, only about every two or three.</li>
            <li> Obviously I&#x27;m spending the same time blowing it out before I get to this straightener, but this takes time off of my previous one and less frizz and way smoother, too, for a lot less $!  </li>
            <li> I think it will be some time before any evaluation of &#x27;less damage&#x27; can be made, although damage wasn&#x27;t a big problem with my previous straightener.  </li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron a few weeks ago, and it has already quit working.  </li>
            <li> and although I don&#x27;t use a flat iron everyday, I have 4 of them.</li>
            <li> you have a four or five year warrenty, so if anything goes wrong Remington will take it back and send you a new one.</li>
            <li> This iron is lighter weight than other</li>
            <li> -- my only quibble has been that I have occasionally accidentally turned it off while styling, and have occasionally been unable to turn it off using the \\&quot;on/off\\&quot; button and had to unplug it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The max heat is 430* and heats up within 20 sec!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the different results are because I bought the one with the teflon plates...?.</li>
            <li> The infamous Chi- (too hot</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t recognize the weight of the other one until we got this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But other than that, it&#x27;s performed admirably well.  </li>
            <li> THEN I went on a trip in the U.S. and threw one of my other irons in the bag.</li>
            <li> No more fumbling around with the cord as you work at different angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener solely because it was \\&quot;different\\&quot; than the other ones - the Teflon coating seemed like it would make sense, and for the price, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using small sections of hair or you will have to go over the same spots again and again (leading to damage).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Remington hair straighteners with conditioners, etc., which resulted in fried ends.  </li>
            <li> There is in fact a temperature lock feature, just hold down the minus button and the temperature is locked in.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I received it in the mail today, and tried it immediately--only to be greatly disappointed.</li>
            <li> with this flat iron, I usually don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dyed too often, it&#x27;s bombarded with heat damage daily and usually I&#x27;m just a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> As a guy, with reasonably short hair, care MUST be use with flat irons, as improper use can result in an undesireable \\&quot;troll doll\\&quot; look, or worse yet, hair breakage.   </li>
            <li> As said, the smoke coming off of it was a little weird at first, but you get accustomed to it.</li>
            <li> The Teflon is a little weird at first because I was so used to my hair snagging, but I can see a difference in the amount of breakage I get when I straighten my hair</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that sometimes, even at a lower heat it can smell like you are burning fabric.</li>
            <li> Remington is very aggressive in this market - the ceramic fabric used in this one is very similar to one used in the production of a motion picture I worked on- a pro model, and very (very) expensive.  </li>
            <li> It was perfect...straightened my hair without pulling or tugging thanks to the weird Teflon fibers...</li>
            <li> So not worth the time and effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, after straightening turned out with pathetic results, I decided to curl with the straightener, and it curls surprisingly well for a straightener.</li>
            <li> Although the instructions don&#x27;t tell you, you can lock in the heat setting by holding down the - button for a couple of seconds so that you don&#x27;t accidentally change it while using the iron.</li>
            <li> and sometimes I am switching it up or down or off when using it.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t flow down your hair as well as the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> In reality, you hold BOTH buttons down to both lock and unlock.)  </li>
            <li> But three clicks down is something I can deal with.    </li>
            <li> so i turned it down.</li>
            <li> (Causing the temperature to change-or shutoff)  It&#x27;s not comfortable due to the button placement.  </li>
            <li> No damage, just a little weird to get accustomed to.&lt;br /&gt;- Hair doesn&#x27;t have as much bounce and movement as compared to my tourmaline iron.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> As I mentioned before the other way a two-in-one blow and straighten, too gimmicky</li>
            <li> On the plus side - I have noticed that my hair is having less breakage and split ends</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was eager to try this straightener because of the \\&quot;50% less damage\\&quot;-causing teflon fiber plates.  </li>
            <li> the fiber plate is a bit odd.  </li>
            <li> which may be a benefit to some and may cause less damage</li>
            <li> which may be a benefit to some and may cause less damage    </li>
            <li> I got it at Bed Bath and Beyond for $44.99 (probably even less</li>
            <li> I thought the plates would create less damage</li>
            <li> a bit less frizzy</li>
            <li> The theory is that this makes it less damaging to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I been using hair straighteners on my hair for over nine years now, I&#x27;m always looking for ones that will do LESS damage on my hair.  </li>
            <li> it also resumes at the temp you previously had it on, unless you unplug it.  </li>
            <li> IN theory hair gliding with less friction/strain would have less breakage.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, applying extreme heat to your hair - no matter what product you use - is doing damage, but that&#x27;s price to pay if I want to tame my unruly waves...</li>
            <li> The negative features are the iron is a little heavy and the the cord is a little stiff, but these last two features are comparable to other irons in this price range.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty disappointing</li>
            <li> and I realized how crazy hot it was</li>
            <li> I have long thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I had purchased (and returned) 3 others, but they all pinched my fried &amp; frizzy(from coloring), thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> So I did a little research to find an affordable flat-iron and decided on this one.</li>
            <li> My previous straightener is also a Remington, with plain ceramic plates.  </li>
            <li> I was getting sick of my chi flat iron and decided to try a different flat iron for a cheaper cost instead.</li>
            <li> I had the little Revlon ceramic straightener that was $25, and that is not smooth at all compared to my Solia straightener from folica.com which I got for $88.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair (Italian)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s equal to any of those expensive irons minus the damage.</li>
            <li> I agree that the buttons are not thoughtfully placed.</li>
            <li> You know when all the dead ends are cut off.</li>

            <li> My hair is so thick even if I spend 20 minutes blowdrying, I always miss a spot of wet hair, so I need the teflon and damage therapy for my hair, so it doesn&#x27;t fry when I get to straightening.  </li>
            <li> Because of the narrow size, it does take a while to straighten all of my hair</li>
            <li> It was lightweight enough to use without getting yoru arm tired halfway through.</li>
            <li> Did you let it heat up for a few minutes?</li>
            <li> auto shut off after an hour (although im always done in a few minutes so an hour seems excessive)  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about the damage therapy straightener really making a difference</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, but this straightener handles it well, and it doesn&#x27;t take me very long to finish straightening in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse, colored hair and have had a hard time in the past finding a straightener that 1)</li>
            <li> I still have the same complaint about the buttons being poorly placed.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend has owned an expensive flat iron in the past that she left behind in Las Vegas.  </li>
            <li> I beleive I will have this for years to come with very little or no heat damage.</li>
            <li> The teflon lets you just glide past them, and you don&#x27;t go</li>
            <li> I usually stick to 390 and it does the trick.  </li>
            <li> and I bought flat iron because my other one wasnt cutting it.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li> One took some serious sympathy for me, and sold me a Paul Mitchell one for half price.</li>
            <li> I have had straighteners in the past MELT/</li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s one of the reasons my hair turned out frizzy, and was not able to stay in the straightener.     </li>
            <li> and I usually have to iron twice to get my desired effect, but this iron is so efficient</li>
            <li> I bought this hair straightener because My vidal sasooon was too small and pulled my hair out.</li>
            <li> I also used this to try out curls on my hair and won&#x27;t be using it again to do that, as the curls were to small for my taste.</li>
            <li> There are few pros to this straightener, but the bottom line is that it doesn&#x27;t straighten, which is a serious problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other irons produce a weird smell before, but that was after I had had it for a few years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> let my hair dry naturally -- usually a frightening sight.</li>
            <li> The on/off button would be on the hinge side of the display and so would be hard to press while styling, and the display would change to something like \\&quot;READY\\&quot; when temperature is reached.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m forced to put my hands over the buttons, therefore pushing the buttons and chaning the setting.  </li>
            <li> Of all the flat irons I&#x27;ve ever tried, this one by far is the worst.  </li>
            <li> Keep it away from small children!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this device advertises itself as a straightener, not a curler (and it would make a poor excuse for a curler, regardless).     </li>
            <li> One weird thing is that the instructions are wrong (they said to hold the + button down to lock the temp, and the - button down to unlock the temp.  </li>

            <li> Not a good design.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, you should use caution around small people with this, even if they just touch the outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I had been blow-drying straight my naturally curly hair since the 7th grade. Well, after two (almost three) kids, I just do not have that kind of time to self-indulge anymore! Also, I live in Florida and always hated the way blow-drying would make me hot and sweaty first thing in the morning. So - I&#x27;ve been wearing my hair natural for a while. And, quite frankly, was getting a little tired of it. So I did a little research to find an affordable flat-iron and decided on this one. I also like that the teflon plates are supposed to be less-damaging - since I still want to wear my hair curly sometimes. I used it for the first time last night and I am SOLD! I read the directions carefully, and it actually says that it heats up in 30 seconds - which is awesome for someone already time-crunched. I have thin, wavy hair on the top of my head and thin, 1\\&quot; corkscrews on the back of my head. This iron glided through on the 12 setting and straightened my entire head in about 10 minutes. MUCH better results than blow-drying + round brush + brush rollers! And no sweatiness. I also really appreciate that it comes with a lock - to keep out curious little fingers. My hair is still smooth and silky this morning after. I love this thing!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair (Italian) but I have an emoish haircut so it&#x27;s supposed to be very straight and the ends are pretty damaged, and lots of layers, etc. My friend had this straightener and as I was having a bad hair day at the time, I just used it.....within 10 minutes you would&#x27;ve heard me running down the stairs \\&quot;KATIE!!!! WHERE THE CRAP DID YOU GET THIS?!?!?!?!?!\\&quot;. The teflon fiber idea is brilliant, because the problem with regular hair straighteners, at least for me, is how the metal will just rip out ends that are frayed. The teflon lets you just glide past them, and you don&#x27;t go \\&quot;ow...ow...\\&quot; from the straightener plucking out hairs. By the end, my hair was super straight and sooo silky. If you wash with Matrix sleek look (orange bottle) and put their styling conditioner in it...then blowdry it to damp..then straighten with this flat iron, you will have AMAZING results.</li>
            <li> I am overall very satisfied with purchasing this hair straightener. I have thick wavy hair that I often get colored. I have used many straighteners over the years. I have even paid $500 to have it chemically straightened but that was years ago.   At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like this straightener because the Teflon Fiber Plates were strange to me. It felt weird.   But now that I have been using this straightener for several months I am used to them and I do believe they protect from damaging my hair.   I wouldn&#x27;t say this has helped cut down on the time it takes me to straighten my hair just because my hair wants to be wavy and is so thick. However, it straightens nicely and seems to make my hair a little more shiny.   Cons- I have to say the buttons are placed in a bad spot. I am constantly touching them when using it. Also the digital display seems to be acting up a little. We&#x27;ll see how long it will last!</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use! The numbers are easy to read to get the temperature you want and the fit is good in your hand. Its also lighter than some ceramic straighteners I&#x27;ve used so very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron, I had the previous model for about 4 years, it still worked but the plastic body around the plates was cracking and my hair would get stuck in it, so I needed a new one.  I have used many straighteners and the flat ceramic plates always seem to pull my hair. This one with the cloth like covered plates is smooth and the heat stays even. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a fine flat iron.  The plates have some kind of special fabric covering to minimize damage.  It seems less smooth than other plates, but it glides over my hair just fine.  This iron is lighter weight than other I&#x27;ve tried.  I like the variable temperature, that it heats up quickly, and seems to have even heat.  I don&#x27;t like the button placement.  It&#x27;s very easy to accidentally press buttons when in use.  There is a feature to \\&quot;lock\\&quot; the buttons, but it seems like it should&#x27;ve been better designed in the first place.  All in all, a nice little flat iron at a great price.</li>
            <li> I got this to straighten my daughter&#x27;s hair and it works great. I especially like the coating on the heating elements. It actually gives a slight bit of drag making it easier to pull the hair through the clamp. One thing I don&#x27;t like is the fact that the on/off switch is right where you place your thumb as you comb. Not a good design. But overall the teflon coating makes this a better hair straightener than most.</li>
            <li> This flat iron heats up quickly and works really well according to my wife. She has a CHI and says this one works just as well. As for the Damaged hair repair claim, who knows.. but as a low price straightener, this works well.</li>
            <li> It does heat up quickly enough.  However, the two sections don&#x27;t quite meet so I had to press them together the whole time that I was working with my hair.  I have really thick hair so I was pretty surprised by this.  It did an okay job but I&#x27;ve used better and my hair wasn&#x27;t as straight as it could have been.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener about 2 weeks ago and so far I am pretty crazy about it. It heats up fast, it straightens well and it curls great too. My only complaint is that sometimes, even at a lower heat it can smell like you are burning fabric. It is a not super strong smell but it can be unnerving. I have long thick curly hair and I straighten it about 6 days a week. I am constantly getting comments on how smooth and shiny my hair looks. I also really love that my sink isn&#x27;t covered in stray hairs like it was from my old straightener. Its totally a good buy.</li>
            <li> its too good , with the highest setting for 410 F .. even the curliest hair  can be straightened with this flat iron.  I love it.And its dual voltage gr8 for worldwide travel.</li>
            <li> This flat iron heats up in about 20 seconds to full heat (430).  The teflon plates are great &amp; leave my hair straight,smooth and shiny.  Although the instructions don&#x27;t tell you, you can lock in the heat setting by holding down the - button for a couple of seconds so that you don&#x27;t accidentally change it while using the iron. I am so pleased after having to return two of the Remington S10-51 flat irons because they did not heat up beyond 375, althought they were supposed to go up to 430.</li>
            <li> I had the little Revlon ceramic straightener that was $25, and that is not smooth at all compared to my Solia straightener from folica.com which I got for $88.  I didnt think there was any way that this one could compare, but it works great!  Comparable to my straightener that&#x27;s double the price.</li>
            <li> If you need a straightener, chances are you&#x27;ve done some research. Stop looking!!    I have horrible hair. It&#x27;s dyed too often, it&#x27;s bombarded with heat damage daily and usually I&#x27;m just a frizzy mess. I bought this iron 1 week ago thinking \\&quot;What the hey, might be worth a try.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve been using a CHI iron for about a year now and all it does is burn my hair and snag the heck out of it.    My CHI went to the big Goodwill in the sky today because never again will I spend $100+ on a piece of junk! For $34.99 at Target I got a great iron for less than 1/2 the price. It glides over the hair, makes it unbelievably shiny and best of all, it doesn&#x27;t rip our hair out!    Fast heat up, sleek design, plenty hot (unless you&#x27;re trying to bake a Christmas ham on it, I suppose) and is just all around fabulous.    If it sucks for your hair, worst case scenario you&#x27;re out a few bucks but I very serously doubt anyone can find fault with this thing.</li>
            <li> Its great!!I had been hesitant to purchase a straightener for some time, mostly because I have baby fine hair that is delicate and break easily. I have naturally wavy/curly hair too. So when I saw this product I read many reviews and liked how it had a teflon fiber on the plates to help hair glide through. I have been using this for a few weeks now and its awesome. My hair has never snagged on the plates, its hot enough to straighten yet not damage. I do not straighten my hair daily - but I am glad that when I do - I am being gentle to my delicate hair. Definately would recommend this if you are worried about breakage.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener.  It glides right over my hair....gets very hot....and leaves my hair very straight and shiny.   Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This straightener is an absolute steal at $35.  It heats up very quickly and the temperature can go up pretty high.  I usually stick to 390 and it does the trick.  The teflon plates are amazing.  They don&#x27;t pull out my hair and, more importantly, they help the straightener just glide over hair quickly and easily.  I have pretty easy hair to tame, but my sister who has big curly hair also loves this thing and uses it whenever she comes over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxed to natural at the moment and I bought flat iron because my other one wasnt cutting it. So just recently used it for the first time yesterday and my hair has never been so straight besides going to the hair salon!! Now I&#x27;ve been telling everyone about this.</li>
            <li> This straightener makes my hair really straight and smooth. It doesn&#x27;t give much of hair burning sensation either. This is one of the nicest hair irons I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like this straightener, I can believe I made so much research and for nothing. First of all it takes too long to straightened my hair and my hair is only wavy not curly. Before it would take me about 10 minutes, now it&#x27;s taking me 20-25. I have to pass the straihtener through each hair portion more than 3 times in order to get it straight enough. The plates do not get hot enough and the control buttons are badly misplaced, I&#x27;m always pressing them by accident.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, curly wavy, frizzy hair. I tend not to use a flat iron much as it makes it look like I have less hair than I do- but sometimes on bad hair days there is nothing left to do but straighten the frizzy ball of hair that is sitting on my head. This is a good flat iron- it heats up quickly, gets really hot, has a long swivel cord, and the teflon seems to work really well. After I used it it left my hair flat, smooth and frizz free. It did take me some time to do the straightening but then, I don&#x27;t do it often so I am kind of out of practice. The results lasted perfectly until I washed my hair again (a day or two). I have no real complaints.</li>
            <li> I am all too familiar with the damage most flat irons cause to hair structure. In fact after cutting off most of the split ends and frazzled hair, I promised myself I&#x27;d cut the use of a flat iron down to a minimum. I always use protective products when I use a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;This iron has a cloth covered plates where hair gets more surface coverage but doesn&#x27;t rub hairs against each other, which is one of the major reasons hair gets so brIttle and damaged.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for three weeks and so far I haven&#x27;t seen or felt any damaging effects and my hair actually feels pretty good as far as texture, soft and managable.&lt;br /&gt;I have not encountered any problems when using this device and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with this product.  It did not straightened the hair as straight as I would liked it to have.  The product seemed to be too light, or the amount of pressure that I was able to apply to the hair strands was too light.  Did not give me the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great straightener, buy this one. I have had mine since 2006 and it was still going great until my dog chewed it up. I chose this straightener over my Chi. I love the Teflon fibers instead of a ceramic plate. I think the fibers make your hair shine and a lot smoother than a ceramic plate would.</li>
            <li> I bought this bc my sister has a similar one that she got from Target that works amazingly well. This one works well too, but it seems to not get as hot (and therefore not get hair as straight) as other similarly priced flat irons. On the other hand, it works so much better than the $10 one I had before! The Teflon plates definitely seem to keep my hair safer from damage than other flat irons.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and my old straightener was starting to give me split ends and breakage. I saw the rave reviews for this iron and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. On the plus side - I have noticed that my hair is having less breakage and split ends but this straightener doesnt leave my hair as smooth or shiny as i would like. Even after going over the same spots a couple times it still has flyaways. It is pretty disappointing but I suppose a few flyaways are better than split ends and breakage!</li>
            <li> Hi I am a african american girl with long thick hair and i love this flat iron. I was getting sick of my chi flat iron and decided to try a different flat iron for a cheaper cost instead. This one works great and leaves my hair silky straight. Definitely a suggestion if your looking for really good flat iron but not trying to spend too much. This same flat iron goes for about $50 (suggested retail) and i never see it in the stores.</li>
            <li> I tried this straightener and I found with my first use that it is not for me.  First off the control panel is right where you hold it, so I kept turning it off every time I lifted it up to straighten a piece of hair.  So I&#x27;d turn it back on again, go to straighten another piece and off it went again.  Once I made myself conscious of this and held it without pressing the buttons, I found that the plates were so slippery that it flew through my hair.  I&#x27;m guessing it is better for thinner, finer hair, not thick hair like I have and that is why it is so slippery.  If your hair is damaged, it won&#x27;t stay on it for long, so I guess that is why it was made for damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using straightening irons for several years, so I have had the opportunity to try many! I have been using this one for several weeks now and am very satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Here are the features I like:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;Has a comfortable grip.&lt;br /&gt;There is a digital temperature gauge, with a choice of 3 settings.&lt;br /&gt;Has an auto-off feature.&lt;br /&gt;Does a great job straightening hair.&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t any burning smell or other odors (a lot of others give off an unpleasant odor).&lt;br /&gt;It heats up quickly, and has a low sound-alert feature to notify you when it reaches temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few features that I feel could have been improved:&lt;br /&gt;Almost the entire iron gets extremely hot to the touch. This makes it hard to grip for long periods, unless you hold it at the very bottom, which does not give you a good grip for straightening.&lt;br /&gt;The buttons are easily pressed when gripping the iron - I have changed the temperature and turned it off numerous times.&lt;br /&gt;However, just to be fair, I have had this problem with every single iron I have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy with this straightening iron, and like it much better than the last few I have purchased.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair iron and I&#x27;m writing this review after 18 months of good use. All good hair irons have a life span of about this much time and sadly its now time to replace it with a twin.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have used a number of brands of flat irons, and I tend to like two brands best, at both high-ish and low-ish price points - CHI and Remington.    Remington is very aggressive in this market - the ceramic fabric used in this one is very similar to one used in the production of a motion picture I worked on- a pro model, and very (very) expensive.  The fabric is said to reduce hair damage, and that has been my experience.  As a guy, with reasonably short hair, care MUST be use with flat irons, as improper use can result in an undesireable \\&quot;troll doll\\&quot; look, or worse yet, hair breakage.   After using this on my own for about a month, and having the production hair people look at it ( they were impressed ) I remain impressed with the ease of use, and outstanding results.  The one inch size is easy to control, and the fabric is tourmaline, which adds to shine.    As I re-purpose such things, I can assure you that this unit performed well as a way to give a light press to your pants, and make the sleaves of a shirt look fresh!  ( It also passed  the \\&quot;mom test\\&quot; when I used it on napkins for Thanksgiving dinner--LOL).  The unit itself is unisex, and professional looking - silver and black, and the fabric is dark-ish brown.    The packaging of the product is cool - the box offers a VERY 1970&#x27;s look with a swirl of orange, yellow ( to complement the brown fabric, which they nicely offer a \\&quot;touch-me\\&quot; sample, on the front) and olive green.  WELL DONE! I am feeling 1977-1979 design here, and I LIKE it!   I would not hesitate on this one, for yourself, or as a studio-quality gift.  Sometimes people get hung up on brand names, and will not consider some of the value priced units.  That is a mistake, in this case. The unit is fantastic, and every bit as good as it&#x27;s more expensive \\&quot;siblings\\&quot;.   This an easy way to change your look in a flash, and reduce hair damage concerns - this is a good one!</li>
            <li> I have chin-length fine, straight hair.  My mother, rest her soul, must be laughing loud and long at the idea of moi, who only ever wanted curly hair, using a straightener.  However, it turns out that fine, straight hair is actually acceptable as long as it is smooth.  Who knew?  So I&#x27;ve been using a straightener for about a year now.  My previous straightener is also a Remington, with plain ceramic plates.  I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with it -- my only quibble has been that I have occasionally accidentally turned it off while styling, and have occasionally been unable to turn it off using the \\&quot;on/off\\&quot; button and had to unplug it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was eager to try this straightener because of the \\&quot;50% less damage\\&quot;-causing teflon fiber plates.  I also kinda hoped they&#x27;d fixed the button problem.  Bottom line -- the fiber plate is a bit odd.  It gives more \\&quot;traction\\&quot; and so hair, at least fine, straight hair, doesn&#x27;t slide through as quickly.  I think it will be some time before any evaluation of &#x27;less damage&#x27; can be made, although damage wasn&#x27;t a big problem with my previous straightener.  And the buttons are a disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my old straightener, the \\&quot;temperature up\\&quot; and \\&quot;temperature down\\&quot; buttons were on the hinge side of the display.  On this model, they are smaller and on the open side of the display and basically, at least for me, act as grippy little divots into which my fingers naturally fall as I style.  And this causes the unit to change temperature, which I could stand, if it didn&#x27;t beep.  But it beeps when the temperature changes.  Having to fix one&#x27;s hair in the morning is bad enough without the stress of knowing you are randomly changing the temperature of your straightening iron, and it is beeping at you about it. Aaaagggghhhhh!  It is possible to lock the temperature (although one does so by pressing and holding the \\&quot;minus\\&quot; key, not by the method given in the printed directions), but you then have to unlock it to turn the appliance off.  Aaaaaggghhhhh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary:&lt;br /&gt;Pro&lt;br /&gt; * Fabric plate provides more \\&quot;traction\\&quot; which may be a benefit to some and may cause less damage&lt;br /&gt; * Unit heats up quickly&lt;br /&gt; * There is a hinge lock so unit is easier to transport&lt;br /&gt; * Dual voltage for international travel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt; * Temperature set buttons are impossible to avoid while styling&lt;br /&gt; * Locking the buttons is a time-consuming on and off process that has to be done each time you use the straightener&lt;br /&gt; * Blue backlight on display is impossible to see in the type of decent lighting one hopes for when styling one&#x27;s hair (backlight flashes while unit is heating, stays steady when temperature is reached and you can see those things happen if you darken the room and wait for them)&lt;br /&gt; * Unit communicates with annoying beeps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, what would make sense, is a straightener whose temperature I can set once and then lock and each time I turn the thing on, it goes to that temperature.  Do people really fiddle with the temperature that much?  The on/off button would be on the hinge side of the display and so would be hard to press while styling, and the display would change to something like \\&quot;READY\\&quot; when temperature is reached.  As things stand, I&#x27;m going back to the old, non-beeping unit in hopes that this dream machine will surface!Pro   * Fabric plate provides more \\&quot;traction\\&quot; which may be a benefit to some and may cause less damage    * Unit heats up quickly   * There is a hinge lock so unit is easier to transport   * Dual voltage for international travel  Con   * Temperature set buttons are impossible to avoid while styling   * Locking the buttons is a time-consuming on and off process that has to be done each time you use the straightener   * Blue backlight on display is impossible to see in the type of decent lighting one hopes for when styling one&#x27;s hair (backlight flashes while unit is heating, stays steady when temperature is reached and you can see those things happen if you darken the room and wait for them)   * Unit communicates with annoying beeps  To me, what would make sense, is a straightener whose temperature I can set once and then lock and each time I turn the thing on, it goes to that temperature.

            <li> This iron makes my hair roots STRAIGHT and it lasts all week! I have relaxed hair which I have been trying to stretch to 10-11 weeks instead of 6 week processing. This iron definitely helps getting me through the weeks. I have also seen less breakage of my ends and overall more healthy hair. I would recommend to anyone! I have previously had Andiis and Conair flat irons and nothing comes close to this one. :)</li>
            <li> I know a flatiron is supposed to get hot but this gets so hot that it burned my hair.  So maybe it wasn&#x27;t all the fault of the flatiron and that&#x27;s why I have a regular beauty shop appointment but still...I would recommend this for the person that really knows how to operate one and not burn your hair.  Thinking about donating this to the local beauty college or maybe one of the students.</li>
            <li> This lil sleek flat iron is amazing!  My purpose of buying this straightener is because of its \\&quot;damage control.\\&quot;  I love my hair!  It&#x27;s all natural and I don&#x27;t want to ever damage it anymore by always straightening and curling.  This iron is gentle on the hair and doesn&#x27;t break it as you pass down.  I also bought this because I wanted to avoid that \\&quot;burning\\&quot; smell on your hair.  This one is covered with teflon fiber.  Now, I have never used such a thing, but I figured, what do I have to lose.  And it works amazing!  I put products in my hair, and even when I run the flat iron through, it leaves the scent of whatever my hair product way! It also has tourmaline which reduces the fly-aways!  The max heat is 430* and heats up within 20 sec! I got it at Bed Bath and Beyond for $44.99 (probably even less had I used a coupon), and for that price it works just as good as chi or babyliss; and it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair as much!</li>
            <li> I was extremely happy with this straightener until I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t working as well as it normally does. One side of the iron no longer heats up. Becasue this happened 5 months after I purchased the iron, I could no longer return it via Amazon. However, I contacted Reminton&#x27;s warranty department and they graciously sent out a new unit. Now this is a company that backs up their products. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product heats up quickly, but the temperature buttons are set up to when you are styling your hair-you hit the buttons. (Causing the temperature to change-or shutoff)  It&#x27;s not comfortable due to the button placement.  I needed a straightener and will settle for this one.  But, will not recommend it for others.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. However, my hair stylist has a smiliar one without the teflon plates. I just need to practice a little more with it to get as good as my hairstylist. I&#x27;m not sure if the different results are because I bought the one with the teflon plates...?. What I really like about it that it really only takes about 30 seconds to heat up. You can dial the temperature you want - really a sweet product.</li>
            <li> Just received the Remington flat iron this morning.....I tried it right away and let me tell u...this is amazing!!...When I fist saw the plates...I was lik WTF?....It&#x27;s like Teflon cloth over the plates..not ur typical flat iron..I had my doubts about this product...but boy was I wrong!...The Teflon fibers on the plates actually help a lot. My hair is thick...and wavy...not curly...but its thick as hell and hard to straighten. I had the setting to 410 deg (highest setting 430). It was perfect...straightened my hair without pulling or tugging thanks to the weird Teflon fibers...it left my hair so shiney...unlike my babyliss flat iron which left it dry. I had shape and bounce to my hair...I also created slight curls at the ends and its absolutely stunning!...BUY IT!...You&#x27;ll love it..I&#x27;ll write an update late on...I&#x27;m gonna test out the \\&quot;damage therapy\\&quot; properties this flat iron claims :)</li>
            <li> I own the older version also, which is not digital. I bought the S-2004 about 5 years ago and it it works as great now as it did then. My 15-yr old daughter began straigtening her hair a few months ago, so I purchased another brand for her. She always came back to borrow mine, so I ended up giving her mine with the intention of buying a new straightening iron for me. I had purchased (and returned) 3 others, but they all pinched my fried &amp; frizzy(from coloring), thick, long hair. My daughter&#x27;s hair is very long as well, and this works great for both of us. So I had to go and buy this one. The other reviewers are correct, this thing gets HOT. I set it to 360(only the 2nd or 3rd setting). There is no way anybody would want it hotter than that. I LOVE this straightener! It never pinches my hair, my hair simply glides through the plates. I hold a brush in front of the plates while straightening bcz certain parts of my hair are frizzy, but my daughter doesn&#x27;t; either way it performs outstanding. The plates are rounded, so I do a little flip on the ends at the same time I straighten the rest. I really do not know how anyone cannot love this straightener. The 3 straighteners that I tried were all more expensive-and they could not compare. All straighteners should have woven teflon on the plates. I agree that the buttons are not thoughtfully placed. However, for those ppl who have problems with the buttons: Hold the decrease temperature button (-) for appx 3 seconds to lock the temperature. Hold the power button for 3 seconds to shut  the unit off.</li>
            <li> This flatiron is worth the purchase price if its primary use is to get rid of frizz. The hightest heat setting did not get hot enough to straighten my daughter&#x27;s coarse hair but did smooth my hair which is already straight but frizzy.</li>
            <li> After using this product for over a month I defintely would not recommend it. I thought the plates would create less damage but it caused more damage to my hair than my previous flat iron. Maybe if you only use cheap flat irons this would be a good product and cause less but my Solia Flat Iron never caused the amount of damage this does in a month&#x27;s worth of use. My recommendation is if you value your hair to stay clear of this and invest in a good flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for more than a month and I am pretty happy with its performance. The only problem is it smells like something is burning while it is warming up. Other than that it works great with my hair and I did not notice any damage on my hair.</li>
            <li> Horrible for your hair, read why!!! Serious design flaw with the fabric, you can just jump to bottom paragraph to see basics!  Thought this would be great for my hair, teflon is such a great product, toally made sense to me. Then, started to see my hair breaking at ends. At first, I figured it was just because I had not had hair cut in awhile so I went and got ends trimmed. (also, I use thermal protectant whenever I flat iron) Stylist thought that was probably the issue, but recommended that I get some split-end mender and start using. Cool, got it, expected better results. Within a week, hair doing it again. Went back to appt 4 weeks later, stylist could not believe. Said, ok, maybe too much protien, quit using split-end mender. Still use thermal protectant. She cut my hair another inch to get above end issue. Of course my hair grows very slowly, been trying to grow out, and now losing everything! Forward another month. Same issue. Getting more than frustrated. Go to new stylist. Here is the verdict:  My hair is actually not dry. It is not oily. It is not my hair at all! It is from this flat iron!!!  You want a flat iron to have plates that are TOTALLY SMOOTH. if there is texture to surface of plates at all, it messes with the heat distribution. I started thinking, are you kidding me???This thing has fiber all across the surface. This is the farthest thing from flat I have ever seen. Then, to add insult, because of the texture, it kind of drags your hair across the surface, snagging it up and holding it to the heat even longer. Add thermal protectant, and it starts to stick, as you can&#x27;t really get it out of the crevices of fabric even if you do clean everyday. I confirmed with different stylist at another salon. Talk to your hairstylist, of course I always thought it was just because they wanted to sell their expensive brands. One took some serious sympathy for me, and sold me a Paul Mitchell one for half price. $67 is quite a bit of money, but, at the same time,I am sick of my hair breaking!!! Ask them if they can help out on a better one. You will be surprised at the ability to adjust prices just by asking.</li>
            <li> Review from a professional stylist, my wife.  It heats up fast and the hair conforms to the shape you put it to, even for stubbon hair.  Because it heats up very fast, you have to be careful not to burn yourself.  It&#x27;s light weight enough it will not strain your arm or wrist when using it.  For the price, it&#x27;s a bargain.  She said when this type of ceramic hair device first came out, they were in the hundreds.  And now it&#x27;s so much cheaper and better.  If you need something like this, it is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have used many straighteners and this one takes the cake. I have course, dry, wavy, frizzy hair. After using this flat iron, my dead lifeless hair turned into smooth, sleek, straight hair. It gave my hair that \\&quot;Just got a haircut look\\&quot;. You know when all the dead ends are cut off. I am so glad I bought this one!!</li>
            <li> I have owned this product for years.. And I am also a student at beauty college. I recommend this product because 1. I have never had an issue with this peticular straightener 2. I LOVE IT!!! 3. It doesn&#x27;t pull hair 4. It gets hot QUICK! (430 degrees Fahrenheit)&lt;br /&gt;Like I said. No issues what-so-ever. I have had straighteners in the past MELT/BURN my hair off because of faulty heating elements and getting to hot.&lt;br /&gt;I have curly frizzy hair, and with regular straighteners, I have TONS of fly-aways. This one has helped my hair and I will NEVER go back!!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these in a store. I can&#x27;t find it anymore so when I found it online I was so excited! I ordered two immediately!! So great on hair. Very gentle!</li>
            <li> My hair is long, curly, wavy, stubborn and color treated. Unless I am in the mood to suffer, I opt for a pony tail, and that&#x27;s the end of it. Over the years, I have had a number of curling irons in different sizes and finishes. I&#x27;ll just tell you that this one is very, very good. I&#x27;ve only just gotten the Remington Damage Therapy iron, but I&#x27;ll tell you that if anything ever happens to it, I will replace it at once with the very same iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let my hair dry naturally -- usually a frightening sight. Then I sectioned it off, working on the lower part first. From the first section, I was floored. After doing all my hair, I could only wonder whose hair was now on my head? The ease of use is wonderful, the results are amazing. Just be sure your hair is thoroughly dry before you start, so that your natural curl doesn&#x27;t fight its way back into the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the market for a new curling iron (or a new head of hair) the Remington S2044 Damage Therapy Ceramic Hair Straightener with Teflon Fiber Plates is most DEFINITELY the one to get. The teflon finish is just wonderful, guaranteed.</li>
            <li> i tired this straightner and it didnt work for me. im hispanic so my hair is kind of thin and wavy. at first i turned it up about half way. and basicly nothing. it got hot and everything but the heat didnt straighten it. so i turned it up all the way and still nothing. all it did was flaten it. the waves were still there. a bit less frizzy but you can noticeably tell excatly where i have waves in my hair. it also gave me a lot of flyaway hair and staticy. this would probaly work on some one who have realitivly strait hair and for someone who just wants to soften it maybe. but it did not work on my hair. i only recommend it for some one who has stait hair and is looking to just smooth it.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 5-6 months, normal usage and it died.   I will send it to the producer (additional costs of course) for the warranty. I will update later with this info.  Update: no need to send it back, Remington CS sent me a new one. product is ok when working. i will give 5* for how Remington handled the situation.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron a few weeks ago, and it has already quit working.  It will turn on and heat up, and then shut off.  I plan to return it to the store that I bought it from and purchase a different brand.</li>
            <li> I just bought this straightener yesterday after seeing it in a store and then doing some research online.  It is AWESOME!  I have never been able to style my hair the way my stylist does it at the salon, but this straightener does the job!  I have fine hair with some curl that tends to be frizzy if I don&#x27;t blow-dry it just right.  This iron did a great job of straightening, smoothing and giving incredible shine to my hair - it looks better than it has in a long, long time!  It&#x27;s obvious from the reviews that it may give different results based on your hair type, but it certainly works for me!  I was considering buying a much more expensive iron, but I&#x27;m so glad I got this one and gave it a try - saved myself a boatload of money and got exactly what I was looking for! :-)</li>
            <li> I just bought this iron at a local retailer.  The model number on the one I purchased is S-2004. I normally dry my naturally curly hair into a straight style, but am never happy with the end result.  I tried this product for the first time tonight and am very happy with it.  Definitely a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I thought that the fibers would cause more breakage to my coarse hair (I am african american), but it straightened perfectly :)&lt;br /&gt;The iron gets really hot and I like the digital screen and buttons.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the iron in 2010/2011, and stopped using it a few months later because of the smell it gave my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the iron, the way the material reacts with my hair/products, or what but it was not pleasant! I&#x27;ve had other irons produce a weird smell before, but that was after I had had it for a few years.&lt;br /&gt;I recently gave the iron to my caucasian friend (straight, fine hair) who needed one and she had the same complaint: it straightens well, but produces a weird smell.</li>
            <li> I am only giving 4 stars because somehow I can&#x27;t lock this product into desired temperature. it always locks up to 430 degrees and that is way too much for my hair. but otherwise it makes my hair sleek and soft and straight :) for days to come :)</li>
            <li> I had the older version of this straightener and when its fiber plates finally ripped after many years of use I knew I wanted to replace it with a very similar product.  This newer version gets the job done and does it well, but it will just never be able to completely live up to the original (although the new version is probably better on my hair...).  Overall I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the product and it was another great steal from Amazon!</li>
            <li> After my expensive salon quality straightener died prematurely, I decided to go for a less expensive straightener.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it!    I have very thick hair, but this straightener handles it well, and it doesn&#x27;t take me very long to finish straightening in the morning.  The teflon fiber plates have a different feel than the more standard ceramic plates on other straighteners-- more like fabric than metal-- but they&#x27;re just as effective.  (I can&#x27;t tell whether or not they&#x27;re actually easier on my hair)    Pros:  - heats up quickly  - handles thick hair well  - plates are gentle- my hair is never pulled by getting stuck in seams  - damage control function    Cons:  - doesn&#x27;t work AS well or as quickly as straighteners 2-3x the price  (but for $35 it&#x27;s great!)</li>
            <li> I love this product. It keeps my medium length hair straight for up to three days and is quick and easy to use. I bought one for myself and one for my daughter. She loves hers as much as I love mine. She has very long thick curly hair and it straightens it easily!! This is definitely an A+ flat iron. One drawback: The on/off/temp buttons are somewhat easily altered (albeit accidentally) due to their positioning. (You can lock the temp/on off button by holding down the &#x27;-&#x27; button for a few seconds)I certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have chemically relaxed and coloured hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Heats up quickly&lt;br /&gt;- Temperature lock for desired setting&lt;br /&gt;- Glides over hair&lt;br /&gt;- Less passes over hair for smoothness; i only had to pass it over my hair once to get it straight.&lt;br /&gt;- Works well with hair products (creams, polishers, shine)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- Smokes a lot; at first I thought it was my hair, but then I realized it&#x27;s just the iron itself. No damage, just a little weird to get accustomed to.&lt;br /&gt;- Hair doesn&#x27;t have as much bounce and movement as compared to my tourmaline iron.&lt;br /&gt;- Actual outside of plates get hot as well so be careful. I guess this helps if you are using the iron to style (flips and curls).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a replacement for my tourmaline iron. The iron itself felt great over my hair; no snagging or pulling. As said, the smoke coming off of it was a little weird at first, but you get accustomed to it. Also I think it is smokes more with the more products you put in your hair (I use and anti-breakage cream and a polisher to flat iron). Overall GREAT product.</li>
            <li> I wavered back and forth as to which straightener to buy.  I have very thick, coarse, colored hair and have had a hard time in the past finding a straightener that 1) did the job, and 2)didn&#x27;t make my hair look dried out.  This one did the trick.  I definitely like it.  The only problem I have is that the placement of the on/off and temperature control buttons are right where I hold it and sometimes I am switching it up or down or off when using it.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this straightener as my old one (FHI) was 4 years old, and I wanted one that I could control the temperature.  It arrived quickly to my delight, and the next morning I plugged it in, and the screen began to flash. I pulled out the instructions, and it stated that was normal, as it flashed as it was heating up. 5 minutes later, it was cold, and still flashing. I tried a different outlet and still the same outcome.   I didn&#x27;t even want to exchange because of that.</li>
            <li> Este producto se lo regale a mi esposa desde ese momento esta super contenta y me dijo que ya no va al salón mas, porque la maquina esta super buena.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but it turns off after only a few seconds now. At first, it was great but now it turns itself off after it heats up.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and straightens really quickly, too!  It does a much better job than my previous straightener (which was a revlong blow and straight, but the straightener part always fell off and I paid over $50 for that).  It defrizzes really well, too.  I have very thick, naturally curly hair, and it normally takes a long time to blow dry and straighten it.  Obviously I&#x27;m spending the same time blowing it out before I get to this straightener, but this takes time off of my previous one and less frizz and way smoother, too, for a lot less $!  As I mentioned before the other way a two-in-one blow and straighten, too gimmicky and now I just use it as a blowdryer.  I had to buy a new straightener when the attachment kept falling off and had bought the smooth and satin one, which still frizzed my hair pretty bad and fried it if I missed a wet spot, which this does not do as it has the teflon plates, so worth it!  My hair is so thick even if I spend 20 minutes blowdrying, I always miss a spot of wet hair, so I need the teflon and damage therapy for my hair, so it doesn&#x27;t fry when I get to straightening.  And I don&#x27;t want it completely dry either, so that the straightener has something left to work with.  I highly recommend this one, I have used a lot in my time and have the crazy Darlene (Roseanne) hair to prove it!  Nothing goes from fro to smooth like this baby!</li>
            <li> I did so much research for a good hair straightener, and due to the good reviews, I decided to go with this Remington instead of a Babyliss. I was very excited when I received it in the mail today, and tried it immediately--only to be greatly disappointed. This \\&quot;straightener\\&quot; does not straighten at all. I have somewhat fine, and naturally straight hair, but my hair is not pin straight and can get frizzy on occasion. That is where a straightener comes in, as it is nice to have that shine you get from straighteners.     Not only does this Remington not straighten, it doesn&#x27;t shine at all either. It did absolutely nothing, except make my hair frizzy, and hot. Thank you, Remington. However, after straightening turned out with pathetic results, I decided to curl with the straightener, and it curls surprisingly well for a straightener. My hair was still frizzy, but it seemed to work with the soft curls. Unfortunately, this device advertises itself as a straightener, not a curler (and it would make a poor excuse for a curler, regardless).     The good things about this straightener is that it looks nice, it&#x27;s fairly easy to use, the teflon coating was fine, and your hair will not snag. In fact, your hair goes through so loosely and so smoothly, that it&#x27;s part of the reason it doesn&#x27;t get the job done. Many have mentioned in their reviews that the straightener doesn&#x27;t clamp onto your hair well, requiring you to pinch the top of the straightener, and it&#x27;s absolutely true. Let&#x27;s face it, many of us do not have time to sit there and section small, small portions of our hair to pull leisurely through a straightener. My old straightener could handle an average amount of hair, and it made my life easier.     I did not find the teflon coating to be a problem. There IS a burning smell, but I wasn&#x27;t particularly bothered by that either. However, I do feel that the teflon coating was a bad idea, in that not only does it not help, I think it&#x27;s one of the reasons my hair turned out frizzy, and was not able to stay in the straightener.     There are few pros to this straightener, but the bottom line is that it doesn&#x27;t straighten, which is a serious problem. Definitely not recommended.</li>
            <li> I gave this away. It catches my hair and pulls out too many strands. The plates are rough to the touch. A no go for me.</li>
            <li> After years of looking for a flat iron that wasn&#x27;t too hot, too damaging, and too expensive I finally stumbled upon this miracle. I have used the    - Andis black flat iron (not good enough)  - the conair with the yellow (doesn&#x27;t get hot enough)  - The Instyler (doesn&#x27;t get close to roots and it stopped working after 30 days, it short circuited)   - The infamous Chi- (too hot and the ceramic was horrible on my hair)  - Revlon Ceramic (ugh)  - Various other ceramic flat irons    I thought I was bound to have to go under the hood dryer forever with my fine grained African-American relaxed hair.     One day I was visiting my sister and used her flat irom (remingston teflon) and I FELL IN LOVE AFTER FIRST TRY!    It is so smooth and just glides down my hair. The temperature range is so big, so its good when you just need a little heat or when it is time for a relaxer and you need more heat.     I recommend using it with Morraccan Oil if you can afford it, its like $40 bucks a bottle. The Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply version, Arguan Oil is great too, about $5-$10 a bottle. Just put some in palm and massage through hair and flat ironing experience with this Remington straightner will be amazing.</li>
            <li> Of all the flat irons I&#x27;ve ever tried, this one by far is the worst.  I&#x27;m a hispanic woman with naturally wavy hair.  I had to go over my hair numerous times before it would fully straighten...and that&#x27;s because I had it on the highest heat setting.  Also, because the bottons take most of the handle, I kept pushing the bottons and had to keep looking at what I pushed and returned it to the setting i wanted.  It was annoying.  I wish those buttons weren&#x27;t in the way because I don&#x27;t know how else to hold it without getting burned. I&#x27;m forced to put my hands over the buttons, therefore pushing the buttons and chaning the setting.  Frustrating.  Plus now it takes me 2x as long to straighten my hair becuase I have to go over my hair so many times until it looks straight.  I&#x27;m buying another straightener asap.</li>
            <li> I picked this iron up at Ulta. Already the owner of several higher-end (&#x3D;higher priced) styling tools, I decided to go with this one. I was hesitant, because the price was lower than the so-called salon products.   However, this iron has not disappointed. I am super-impressed and have even ordered another Remington styling tool. This iron gets my hair smooth with one pass (if I don&#x27;t get a big chunk of hair) and it feels really nice and looks shiny as well. I have a hard time keeping my hands out of my hair.</li>
            <li> This product returns to the age old debate: healthy hair vs killer style.  This product is better for your hair.  The fabric is much softer on your hair than metal plates, and I could tell a difference in the shine/softness of my hair.    However, for me the fabric created it&#x27;s own problem.  Friz.  Every time I&#x27;d release the pates it looked, well, like I had ran fabric over my hair.  Also, although the straightener gets nice and hot, it had problems with my thick and wavy hair.    Overall the product is not bad per se.  It just depends where your priorities are when looking for a styling product.</li>
            <li> This flatiron is quite disappointing  i was trying to get rid of frizz. The hightest heat setting did not get hot enough to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> We have two hair straighteners, one with wider plates and this one. Both work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is smaller and lighter, which makes it easier to use. For that reason, it has become the favorite. We didn&#x27;t recognize the weight of the other one until we got this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have mentioned that the temperature buttons are too easy to push mistakenly while in use. There is in fact a temperature lock feature, just hold down the minus button and the temperature is locked in. Problem solved!</li>
            <li> I bought this item 6 months ago, have used it just 7 times and it does not work now. It&#x27;s not getting hot. Want it to be fixed or replaced.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moZ7XR91CSDVQ2]]The Remington S2044 is a unique perspective on the typical hair straightener. Most of straighteners use either metal or ceramic plates for contact with your hair. The Remington S2044 uses ceramic plates that have a fiber cover which keeps your hair from making direct contact with hot heating elements. The theory is that this makes it less damaging to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Designed for people who may have damaged or easily damaged hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You may want to watch the video, but due since your hair is not making contact with a smooth surface it is not as smooth when straightening your hair. It just doesn&#x27;t flow down your hair as well as the [[ASIN:B002LIXTFC Remington S9951 Shine Therapy Frizz Control, Humidity Resistant Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron, 1 Inch]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as hot or as effective as a more traditional straightener - and may not be effective enough for people with curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Does have auto-shut-off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Heats up quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Temperature is displayed on the unit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict - Not a bad straight iron - although it may not be effective for people with curly hair. It does offer some nice features, and could be very helpful for someone who is trying to minimize the damage to their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 1/2 Stars</li>
            <li> I like the high temp of this iron. It does a great job, my only complaint is that the buttons to turn it on/off, and to change the temp are right where I put my hands to hold the iron closed. It&#x27;s minor, and I would still buy it, because it seems like every flat iron or curling iron put their on/off buttons in the same place.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this flat iron to help my thick coarse hair which is prone to heat damage. I have not noticed any significant change.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really hard to hold it properly because of the placement of the temperature buttons.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Remington after my Revlon flat iron literally blew up in my hand! I had another Jilbere flat iron as a back-up but after buying this, I&#x27;ve already ditched it. This one is different and I really like the teflon fiber plates.  I have fine, wavy, frizzy hair and I usually have to iron twice to get my desired effect, but this iron is so efficient, it took only one pass and my hair is STRAIGHT!  Iron get&#x27;s very hot - heat setting was at 10 and hot. I REALLY like the feel of the teflon over a ceramic or metal surface it does seem to hug the hair better.  Also has a swivel cord, to it won&#x27;t kink and create an electrical hazard (like my revlon did).  Controls are in just the right spot too, they don&#x27;t get in the way at all.  I&#x27;m glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> i love these bad boys. i have natural thick curly hair and this flat iron works like magic u should buy it. i have no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> First let me say I have hideous hair.  I have purchased dozens of hairdryer, straighteners and curling irons and none have made a bit of difference until this one.  It actually transformed the texture of my hair.  For the first time in my very long life, I like my hair.</li>
            <li> First of all heat is not recommended for daily use on hair but because Remington claimed that \\&quot;The Remington Style Therapy: Damage Therapy 1-Inch Flat Iron features plates covered with ceramic fabric for 50 percent less hair splitting and damage. Ceramic Fiber creates more styling surface than flat, slim plates. This added surface helps prevent hairs from rubbing against each other, thereby reducing a major cause of splitting and damage\\&quot; we decided why not give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat iron does heat up pretty fast but did not straighten my daughters hair, so she was constantly trying to redo portions of her hair. With all that heat being constantly applied to her hair, her hair started looking crunchy and frizzy which is what this is not supposed to do. Because of all the constant retouching it takes a very long time to get her hair done as well. So not worth the time and effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really surprised at all the glowing 5 star ratings but this just isn&#x27;t for everyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener for 29.99 from Amazon, and am thrilled with it.  You can use it to either straighten or curl your hair with ease.  One weird thing is that the instructions are wrong (they said to hold the + button down to lock the temp, and the - button down to unlock the temp.  In reality, you hold BOTH buttons down to both lock and unlock.)  But other than that, it&#x27;s performed admirably well.  It even somehow adds shine to your hair.  Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a while!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has owned an expensive flat iron in the past that she left behind in Las Vegas.  She loves this one and paid a fraction of the price her prior flat iron cost.</li>
            <li> Since I been using hair straighteners on my hair for over nine years now, I&#x27;m always looking for ones that will do LESS damage on my hair.  Let&#x27;s face it, applying extreme heat to your hair - no matter what product you use - is doing damage, but that&#x27;s price to pay if I want to tame my unruly waves...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this particular hair straightener because:&lt;br /&gt;1.  It heats up fast&lt;br /&gt;2.  Has a variety of temp settings&lt;br /&gt;3.  Has rounded edges (which works beautifully if you want to have a curled under look)&lt;br /&gt;4.  The amount of split-ends and breakage of my hair reduced when I started using this product&lt;br /&gt;5.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for over 6 months with no issues or problems&lt;br /&gt;6.  My hair comes out shiny and healthy looking (not flat and dead)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wish could be better:&lt;br /&gt;1.  The iron&#x27;s width.  It doesn&#x27;t look like this product comes in a different size.  I would have loved a 2\\&quot; or at least a 1.5\\&quot; inch because of my thick hair&lt;br /&gt;2.  Because of the narrow size, it does take a while to straighten all of my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like Remington has a Style Therapy Series available right now ([[ASIN:B002LIXTFC Remington S-8510 Shine Therapy Frizz Control, Humidity Resistant Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron, 1 Inch]], [[ASIN:B001LF4I8I Remington S9950  Shine Therapy  Moisturizing and Conditioning Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener, 1\\&quot;]], and [[ASIN:B000K7E2G6 Remington S2044 Damage Therapy Ceramic Hair Straightener with Teflon Fiber Plates]]).  I can&#x27;t speak of the other two products, but I&#x27;m happy to own the Damage Therapy Ceramic Hair Straightener with Teflon Fiber Plates and feel that, of all the straightening irons I&#x27;ve used in the past, it is the least damaging on my hair.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and smooths hair quickly.  It works very well and I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Works great heats fast easy to travel with since it has the lock on the side flaws tips get extremely hot</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Amazon and I am very disaapointed with this product.  Withing three days,its display light gone and while using this product,it heat up a lot,due to too much heat on handle its very diffcult to hold</li>
            <li> Most, or should I say all flat irons gets real hot on the back of the heat plates that you sometimes (quite often, actually) burn your forehead or neck in the process of trying to straighten your hair...    NOT THIS ONE!    More goods news! It won&#x27;t burn our hair either!    Get results without any burning agonies whatsoever.  LUV IT!</li>
            <li> I really like this straightener.  My hair slides through much more easily than it did with the cheap Revlon I had before, which burned out after 2 months of use. For the price, this seems like a decent purchase.  My hair - medium length &amp; wavy - can be quite stubborn... whatever I want it to do, it usually does the opposite :)  This Remington flat iron seems to straighten it pretty well - I am able to make it fairly straight, flip it under, or flip it out with ease.  I get compliments pretty much every day. As an added bonus, my hair feels more soft and healthy using this flat iron.  I think another reviewer mentioned running her hands through her hair more often - I find I&#x27;m doing the same thing... It feels great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned one of the most expensive brand straighteners before and it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this one. I&#x27;ve had it for quite a while, use it at least once a day and still love it!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my first High Straightener, I have had more pricy ones, and less pricy ones.  This one performs very close to my Chi.  I think this one heats up faster than my Chi, and unlike my much more expensive Hair Straightener, this one has a temperature dial.  The Remington heats up quickly, and is ready in no time, which is perfect for when I am getting ready for work.  The Teflon plates make this glide through your hair.  If you are looking for a hair straightener this is a great option to try.  This is easy to use, heats up quickly, and simply glides through your hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this only because I was headed to the UK and needed a dual voltage flat iron. Got it, used it, liked it well enough. THEN I went on a trip in the U.S. and threw one of my other irons in the bag. By using a regular iron, I realized how munch I like the Remington iron! I am going to order another one so I have one for packing and one for every day use.</li>
            <li> This really does seem to be better for hair. the teflon fabric on the plates provide a softer surface for hair to slide through, and it just makes sense that not cruching strands of hair between two bare metal plates is better for your hair. That said, I do wish that it had a larger flattening surface.</li>
            <li> The product is as expected&lt;br /&gt;This item is OK, I like it&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to everybody&lt;br /&gt;This product is good quality</li>
            <li> Love that it has different temperature settings to pick from and that it protects your hair while getting the style you want! Great buy.</li>
            <li> 3 years ago I bought and still working excellently. With this hair iron I have super-straight. I recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> For a woman who has bougth all kinds of flat irons, this is just simply great! I like Remington because they have teflon plates! I also liked the fact that it has double voltage.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair straightener because My vidal sasooon was too small and pulled my hair out. So I bought this one hoping it wouldn&#x27;t damage my hair that much because it had the teflon fibers and what not. But when I used this my hair got straight but got all frizzy and dull too,and I have medium hair thickness. It wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> I went from a $15 Conair \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; straightener to this one and I absolutely love it.  I have terribly stubborn hair and even in humidity my hair stayed relatively straight after using this. You can curl with this straightener, too, because it has rounded edges.  I also didn&#x27;t think the swivel cord would be much of a big deal but it&#x27;s nice to not worry about the cord getting tangled, especially if you&#x27;re curling. The Teflon is a little weird at first because I was so used to my hair snagging, but I can see a difference in the amount of breakage I get when I straighten my hair and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  I also owned the previous model and was bummed when it finally died.  I had to find another one. Luckily, Amazon had it.  This one is sooo much smaller and easy to handle than its predecessor.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I just bought this iron last week and it is absolutely amazing. I have mostly straight hair but it tends to get VERY frizzy especially in the summertime in Florida where I live. It is comparable to a CHI with how straight and shiny my hair will stay for days! However, unlike the CHI this flat iron just glides over your hair. It has never once snagged a hair out and my hair actually looks healthier! The auto shut-off is very convenient as well because I tend to forget about turning things off so this is a safety feature that I can really appreciate AND it has a 4 year warranty! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This a great product. I bought it about 3 months ago and absolutly love it. I&#x27;ve been trying to find an iron that gets hot enough to straighten thick, curly hair and finally I found it.     Here&#x27;s What I Love About It:  -This iron DOESN&#x27;T SNAG OR BREAK YOUR HAIR!   -Really helps to keep from damaging your hair and fixing it up.  -It has different temperatures for different hair types.   -It also locks so when you&#x27;re ironing it doesn&#x27;t change temperatures on you.   -The Teflon Fiber is great, it straightens smoothly, you don&#x27;t feel it pulling your hair. It does sometimes smell like its burning but it isn&#x27;t burning your hair.  -Leaves your hair feeling smooth,shiny and frizz free (trust me, I have thick, curly, frizzy hair!!).  -The iron is not heavy so you don&#x27;t feel like you arm is about to break after ironing for a while.   -Locks for easy travel.  -Also, whats great is it automatically shuts off after an hour.  -Best part you have a four or five year warrenty, so if anything goes wrong Remington will take it back and send you a new one. They send you a new one first and then you send the old one back. They don&#x27;t make you send the iron to them and then have to wait for them to send you a new one. Also, they reimburse you for the postage.    Agian, if your looking for a cheap, high quality iron, this is the one!</li>
            <li> I have thick, long and lots of hair and this straightener works amazingly on my hair.  I am very happy!!! It gets really hot but you can change the temperature.</li>
            <li> I have had a couple of straighteners and nothing compares to this so far. I have very long, very curly hair. After my hair was blow dried a bit, and used this iron, must say results are great. Its been a week so far and it is still straight. My favorite thing about this iron is that it is very light in which helps me style my hair faster. With the blow dry and straightener it took under an hour, usually for it me it takes about an hour and a half or more. Doesn&#x27;t burn your hair or have that burnt smell. Absolutely love it!!! If you have any questions, ask me, hope I can help!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this iron for about a week now, and I think it&#x27;s great.  It heats up very fast (even before I&#x27;m ready to use it), and I like that it beeps when it&#x27;s ready.  The various temperature settings are great -- I&#x27;ve used mine at 360 degrees and that seems to work great, so I haven&#x27;t played with it.  The only annoying thing is that every time you turn it on, it defaults to 390 degrees.  It would be nice if it had the memory to come on where you last used it.  But three clicks down is something I can deal with.    The plates are great.  I was nervous that there isn&#x27;t a built-in comb (the other, larger iron I have has the comb and I think that&#x27;s useful for pulling my hair taut.  I have mostly straight hair with a flip/wave to it in the front, so that&#x27;s what I focus on straightening every day.  I was worried about \\&quot;ironing in\\&quot; the wave if there was no comb to pull it taut.)  However, the slight texture of the plates and perhaps smaller width of the iron seem to work great to still get my straight and smooth.  So far, I haven&#x27;t noticed any issues with static, but we haven&#x27;t hit the really dry weather around here yet when static normally rears its ugly head.    The swivel cord is nice and, so far, hasn&#x27;t kinked, but I also haven&#x27;t traveled with it or wrapped it up tight in my vanity drawer.    Lastly, the controls are in sort of an awkward position and I&#x27;ve accidentally bumped them and upped the temperature when straigtening my hair.  It took an adjustment on my grip and I&#x27;ve been able to avoid from happening again, but it&#x27;s not the greatest control placement.    Overall, I really like this iron and gave it only 4 stars because the controls aren&#x27;t quite perfect (both lack of memory and position).  Both small issues, though, and this iron is great -- definitely worth it!  I have no regrets.</li>
            <li> this is my 2nd straightener, and i love it. if you are researching which straightener to get, this one is one of your best bets    Pros:  -really nice look, shape, and display  -the buttons on mine arent too easy to press like some reviewers have said. i guess they changed the buttons on newer makes because mine are indented, unlike in the pictures  -swivel cord is really nice  -fast warm up. beeps and flashes when ready. it also resumes at the temp you previously had it on, unless you unplug it.  -safety auto shut off after an hour (although im always done in a few minutes so an hour seems excessive)  -never ever pulls out my hairs. feels soft and smooth and comfortable unlike bare ceramic blades. the blades also tilt a bit. and even when it isnt heated at all, it still seems to straighten my hair kinda well lol  -lock&#x27;s shut for easy storage/packing  -one slow motion through a section of my hair will straighten it awesomely  -somehow, the straightness lasts all day. i live by the beach and i can work with my work hat on while sweating, then sweat some more at the gym, go home, and it still wont be frizzy. (especially with some product in my hair)  -you wont find one this good at a cheaper price    Cons:  -i noticed a few days after using it that when you squeeze it closed there is a little too much resistance. it gives it a professional solid feel, but if you are rushing and using quick strokes, your hand will get tired. not a big deal for me, but im a guy and have strong hands  -for some reason it smokes whenever you squeeze it closed; even without using it on your hair. no big deal though - it just makes it seem like its straightening well</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried different hair styling irons and I would say that this one works pretty well. Some of the positive features are temeperature control, you can set the temperature from 300F for thin fine hair to a maximum of 430F for thick curly hair. It heats up pretty fast and it has a hinge lock so you can lock it when you&#x27;re not using it, that&#x27;s especially a good feature when you travel. The negative features are the iron is a little heavy and the the cord is a little stiff, but these last two features are comparable to other irons in this price range.  I have another iron of better qualify in which I prefer to use, but in all fairness, my other iron is more expensive. I think this is a good product if you don&#x27;t want to spend too much money.</li>
            <li> I am an occasional straightener and my daughter straightens her hair frequently. We both tried this new style with the Ceramic Fabric-wrapped plates hoping for a smooth, straight result on our very wavy hair without the frizzy damage...and we were happily surprised. Both of us found that our hair straightened with only a couple of passes, looked smooth and soft, and it lasted all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We liked the LCD indicator display with temperature choices (300-430-degree heat range), though I only needed it on the minimum temp for great results. It heated up almost instantly and gave us both long-lasting results. The swivel cord is a great feature too. No more fumbling around with the cord as you work at different angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably most important: it has an auto-shutoff for those times when you might be in a hurry and potentially leave it plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended, especially considering the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I liked this flat iron as I find that most do not stay hot enough after running it through my long hair repeatedly, most seem to cool off quite a bit. I also used this to try out curls on my hair and won&#x27;t be using it again to do that, as the curls were to small for my taste. My hair is a little below my mid back and although I don&#x27;t use a flat iron everyday, I have 4 of them. 2 being from the Vine and I really liked this one better as it stayed hot.</li>
            <li> If, like me, you&#x27;re not a die-hard hair flattener and only do it for certain occasions or funsies, then this is a great little product for the price. It heats up quickly and turns my hair lovely and sleek and smooth, although since I have VERY thick, long, wavy hair, I do have to do it in very small segments so it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, if you are looking for something you&#x27;re going to use once a week or more, this might wear out its welcome fast. The placement of the very sensitive buttons on the handle means you&#x27;re constantly accidentally hitting them with your fingers while you&#x27;re trying to get a secure grip on it as you use it, and as a result, it&#x27;s extremely awkward and frustrating to use. For casual, once-in-a-while usage, this is probably a good choice, but if you want something more comfortable to use more often, and for long periods of time, consider another product.</li>
            <li> Worth every cent! loved it,dont think twice it makes my hair looks lovely.&lt;br /&gt;my hair is dry and dameged it makes it shine and smooth&lt;br /&gt;great product,in great price!</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener solely because it was \\&quot;different\\&quot; than the other ones - the Teflon coating seemed like it would make sense, and for the price, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;m very glad I did! I have frizzy/wavy hair, and I often have to straighten and re-straighten my hair to get the results I want. With this, though, I don&#x27;t even have to turn it up to the maximum temperature! It gets hot very quickly and smooths over my hair like a $100 straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ONLY complaint is that if I turn it on more than 5-10 minutes before I need it, the outside can get very hot. Granted, I probably don&#x27;t need to turn it on that early since it only take a minute to heat up, but sometimes I forget :) Needless to say, you should use caution around small people with this, even if they just touch the outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a really great product and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My Chi flat iron burnt out and I bought this at the drug store as an emergency replacement. I thought I would use this for a short while until I had time to pick up another Chi or a similar salon quality iron. After using this once, I am not going back to the more expensive brands. My hair comes out so great, WAY better than the Chi ever did for me. It gets it super straight and it feels incredibly healthy when I am done! I LOVE this straightener!</li>
            <li> I had one of these and gave it to my daughter because she was using the other kind. This flat iron did not burn our hair while straightening. Cannot say enough about this product. Like it so much that I bought another one. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have the Remington Shine Therapy straightener and it works very well, so I thought this one might work well too, in addition to protecting my hair from the heat.  Well, it doesn&#x27;t straighten hair very well, so I can only imagine that by using the product for an even longer time trying to get hair straighter, my hair would get just as damaged.  I will just stick to my old straightener.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about the damage therapy straightener really making a difference but it does!  I have been using this straightener for about 3 weeks and I really do see a difference in my hair.  I have some split ends on the bottom of my hair.  This will not take those away but it really does minimize the look of them and seems to prevent new ones.  I had trimmed my daughter&#x27;s hair before using this to really get a good idea how this works and her hair really looks very healthy, no new split ends.  Now I do use a heat protection spray before straightening and I would never go without that.  That said, this straightener with the teflon fabric plates really does help.  I wash and fully straighten my hair about every 3rd day (bleached blonde &#x3D; dry hair!) and I also need to do a fast daily touch-up after sleeping on my hair.  The straightener has all the features you would look for in a good tool -- high heat - up to 430 degrees, quick heat up, swivel cord, temperature control and lock.  I highly recommend this if you are looking for a new straightener at a very good price.</li>
            <li> This flat iron has a swivel cord, on/off button with temperature controls. Temp controls come in handy because at the highest setting this iron becomes dangerously hot. Keep it away from small children! I know that&#x27;s probably obvious but I wanted to mention it anyway because it&#x27;s a serious concern for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular iron has a sturdy fabric (my words) covering the plates. It feels like burlap. I was wondering if it would eventually collect buildup from the haircare products but after a couple months it hasn&#x27;t seemed to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works wonderfully well on my moderately waves hair and would probably do a fine job straightening curly hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints here.</li>
            <li> OMG - why pay the price for a Chi when you have this amazing little guy.  I love the locking feature and not to mention how quickly it heats up... within seconds!  The fabric coating leaves my hair silky and non-frizzy.  I have not had a flat iron that works the way this iron does.  I beleive I will have this for years to come with very little or no heat damage.</li>
            <li> This straightener did the job. It straightened my hair after 1-2 passes (I am asian, with wavy hair). Straightened hair does not feel dry--it feels soft!  My only worry is that the plates look like they&#x27;re made of fabric--hair product might get caught there? the iron is now with my sister, so i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s easy to clean, or if gels, mousses, etc., will build up in the plates... all in all, this product performs well, and it&#x27;s a very good buy because it&#x27;s cheap--definitely worth your money.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my personal use, I like the size, color, and elegant design is perfect 100% recommended I love</li>
            <li> I would be happy to give this product 5 stars except for the fact that when holding the hot iron, one wants to keep fingers away from the hottest part.  That means that you will often change the temperature setting inadvertently!  I have waited until now to write this review, having owned this appliance for three years.  This is the one complaint I have.  It heats pretty quickly and has a quiet beep to let me know it has reached the set temperature, BUT you will always be re-setting your temperature due to where the button for that is placed.  Poor design for a great iron!</li>
            <li> I wind up having to buy myself a new straightener every 10 - 12 months because although it still feels just as hot, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to style my hair as well as it used to. I have had this one now for a few years and it still works great!</li>
            <li> This unit was easy to use and did what was advertised: straightened my hair. I liked that it had a fast heat up time and the digital temp gauge was a welcome change to the turn dial of my old straightener. Turn dials can be moved more easily when styling so the digital gauge with buttons worked out better for me. The cord swivel made it easy to use without the cord getting in the way. All in all, I would use this again to straighten my hair. It was lightweight enough to use without getting yoru arm tired halfway through. I would recommend using small sections of hair or you will have to go over the same spots again and again (leading to damage).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a fine line- style and damage hair or have unruly healthy hair.  I have a tendency use a straightener more often than I should.  I don&#x27;t know if this is &#x27;therapy&#x27; for your hair but I do feel that it is &#x27;damage control&#x27; for my hair.  I takes a bit to get used to the feel of you hair sliding through the Teflon plates but after that it&#x27;s a breeze.  I still have the same complaint about the buttons being poorly placed.  Most Remington straighteners have that problem. As you are using the iron it&#x27;s difficult not end up with your fingers changing the temperature. You have to hold it further up and try not to burn your fingers.</li>
            <li> my first purchase of a flat iron and it was a great choice. It works really well I love it. No breaking or burning , its awesome.</li>
            <li> Remington&#x27;s S2044 Ceramic Hair Straightener is top of the line.  I&#x27;ve used other Remington hair straighteners with conditioners, etc., which resulted in fried ends.  I had to cut off all the fried &amp; frizzies and start from scratch with the S2044.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6-months and I longer have fried &amp; frizzies.  I&#x27;m 68, have medium length &amp; medium texture hair which is currently brown with the help of L&#x27;Oreal :)</li>
            <li> I was living overseas when I bought this flat iron so I needed one that was dual voltage. I didn&#x27;t think it would be so hard to find one that was also full size. Most of the dual voltage or &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; flat irons are really small and I have a lot of hair so that wasn&#x27;t going to work for me. Not only was this flat iron dual voltage and full size, it&#x27;s also amazing! They suggest that you pull your hair through slowly and if you do, it really does straighten your hair in one pass. And I have really, really curly hair. It does such an amazing job that my hair stays straight even when it&#x27;s pretty humid out or it gets a tiny bit wet, like if I get caught outside and it starts drizzling out. I don&#x27;t straighten it everyday, only about every two or three. I used to have a CHI which I thought was great at the time but it turns out it&#x27;s not as great as this one. With the CHI I had to touch up my hair every morning. with this flat iron, I usually don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t have before and after pictures or anything, but I think my hair has gotten shinier and smoother the longer I&#x27;ve used this flat iron. I love this flat iron! I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year and it&#x27;s still as great as it was when I got it.</li>
            <li> I loved it. I do not flat iron my hair anymore. But when I did, this was an awesome flat iron.</li>
            <li> I consider myself to be a hair product junkie and expert.You name it i probably know about, have it, or tried it. I have used a Solia Flat Iron for 5 years. She still kicks but not quite like she use to. I can&#x27;t pin point it. It still gets hot but maybe not as even. Anyway I decided to try some cheaper iron just until I could splurge on another solia or comparable iron. I found this at target. The whole teflon thing made sense to me. Anyone who cooks knows the joy of a non-stick surface. IN theory hair gliding with less friction/strain would have less breakage. My first time using it. I started at around 1/2 way on the heat dial and I realized how crazy hot it was so i turned it down. Mostly out of fear my smoke alarm might go off. First Pass and I was like you have to be kidding me! ?! I am african american and my hair was in dire need of a relaxer and a deep condition. It was dry dry...that one pass left my hair sooo soft and shiny. I had some kind of shock. Then I asked myself how much i paid for this thing?? seriously?! Just get one. It&#x27;s equal to any of those expensive irons minus the damage. Also, I can leave this iron at a 5 and my hair is pin straight... it smokes/steams a lot. Doesn&#x27;t leave a smell or fried feeling. I think the iron reacts to left over conditioner and products in the hair and causes the smoke on the plates. I would be scared to put this thing on high. I have no idea how anyone could say it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough?! Are you trying to burn your hair off? Is it plugged in? Did you let it heat up for a few minutes? There is no reason anyone should need to put 410 degrees on their hair and then to say it didn&#x27;t get hot enough...    **Update-I think they are selling a different model these days...mine does not look like the one pictured. I will see if I can get the updated product and review that one as well.** Oh and I recently tried my old one after using the Sedu for awhile. When I get the updated model I will edit this review further to include my comparison to the Sedu :)**</li>
            <li> Bought this because it said &amp;#34;NEW&amp;#34; and it was refurbished.  Bought as gift and on the &amp;#34;new box&amp;#34; it did state &amp;#34;refurbished&amp;#34; in big letters.  Needless to say this was never given as a gift, but we did keep it b/c one of my daughters stepped on the box it when it was sitting by the front door for the mail man.  Never used and will not trust Amazon/sellers that say their merchandise is &amp;#34;NEW&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;This was the 2nd time this has happened to me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 6 months now. My hair is naturally pretty straight but I need a straightener for some of the stubborn wavy/frizzy pieces. This straightener is perfect. Heats up quickly and the teflon plates feel like it is not damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> it works very good and it is very nice i recomend this item it is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;best price for this item</li>
            <li> The only reason why I liked this product was because the temperature level was digital. I don&#x27;t really think it helped my damage hair at all. I&#x27;d prefer to splurge on an expensive straigtener they leave my hair spfter</li>
            <li> I purchased this @ Wal-Mart in 2008 and lost it in my travels..searched around everywhere (like a madwoman) for it until I found it on here about a year or so later. it was $1 higher than I paid at Wal-Mart, yet of course i didn&#x27;t mind and it was a no-brainer considering Amazon&#x27;s shipping is free for anything over $25..it has a four year warranty, it gets as hot as i want, the plates are an odd sight (because you think it wont straighten a jacket lol) yet gives a silky finish afterwards without seeing any plates burning or cinching my hair. if you have should see any smoke or hear a &amp;#34;frying&amp;#34; sound, you have it waaay to high (up to 410 degrees) and its reacting to any chemicals you have put in your hair (i dont recommend bc the straightener is enough really) as it is supposed to be 50% less damaging. my hair is natural and when i first used it i had a baby afro and it straightened my hair so silky/straight i thought it was a joke for $33.00 (at the time)!! It was also crazy bc products that perform worse costs more!! This is the best product and i am wearing a close cut now..have been using it on my little sisters&#x27; hairs (11 and 12) and it maintains in between their jeratin treatments.</li>
            <li> excellent quality, would recommend.</li>
            <li> i missed my old one which  is 1 and 1/2\\&quot; Reimington fabric iron so I order another one.&lt;br /&gt;i can only find this 1\\&quot; one and only Remington has a fabric iron that I found. Its nice but i believe the price goes upper and downsize.....i like the ols one much better. it gives hair straight but frizzy. im thinking about to invest on GHD next time.</li>
