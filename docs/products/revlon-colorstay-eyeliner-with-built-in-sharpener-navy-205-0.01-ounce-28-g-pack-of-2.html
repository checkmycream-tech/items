            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>The best eyeliner I own.</li>
            <li>This is a good color that stays in place fairly well.</li>
            <li>Never smudges and goes on easy !!</li>
            <li>Great color and smooth to use on eye...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great product, goes on effortlessly and looks great, upper and lower.</li>
            <li>lasts &amp; awesome if you have blue eyes.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Blues have a tendency to smear for some reason but this one is much better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li>so I can see and make sure it&#x27;s Revlon.</li>
            <li>the pencil glides on better than all of them.</li>
            <li>Love the Revlon navy colorstay eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Would like to find more</li>
            <li>I have used this eyeliner for more than a year.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found another long-lasting eyeliner that I like better than Revlon ColorStay.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what  I wanted</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because you can&#x27;t get a really fine point to make a skinny line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice liner but not very long lasting.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t find this particular eyeliner in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many more expensive liners and while this may give you a bit of unintentional smoke, for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried their new stuff, and it hurts going on...</li>
            <li>However, it does not go one nearly as easily as the black.</li>
            <li>Love this product, unfortunately it&#x27;s a discontinued item and no longer available</li>
            <li>and I see new colors that were previously not on shelves.</li>
            <li>I wear it on my inner eye lash area and outer and it really died stay.</li>
            <li>What distinguishes it from others that claim effortless application is that most of the others,I&#x27;ve found, glide for a few times but then must be babied, i,e, if you don&#x27;t twist or click it closed tight enough</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smear or smudge! You can&#x27;t find this particular eyeliner in the stores anymore. Not sure why!</li>
            <li> 01-01-2015 I am disappointed that the Navy Revlon Eyeliner with sharpener is apparently being discontinued. It is no longer on the shelf of Target or Walmart and I see new colors that were previously not on shelves. I will purchase a similar color by a different manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I use Revlon ColorStay products.  I have purchased these in different colors in multiple amounts, especially the navy blue.  Works great. lasts &amp; awesome if you have blue eyes.</li>
            <li> seemed to run still, i have bought instore of this product, and it didnt run</li>
            <li> This is a good color that stays in place fairly well. However, it does not go one nearly as easily as the black. The crayon is too hard and I have to go over the line several times and this irritates my eye. I rated the black a 5. I probably won&#x27;t buy this color again. However, I remain a fan of Revlon products.</li>
            <li> Love this product, unfortunately it&#x27;s a discontinued item and no longer available</li>
            <li> This eye pencil really dies last and has very little smudging. I like that I don&#x27;t have to sharpen it, as well. I wear it on my inner eye lash area and outer and it really died stay. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because you can&#x27;t get a really fine point to make a skinny line.</li>
            <li> my favorite,,cant seem to find the navy in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Wish they wouldn&#x27;t have discontinued the color!</li>
            <li> Great color and smooth to use on eye... Love it</li>
            <li> Only color of the revlon color stay pencils I like. Wish the Company would produce the navy color again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this liner! Blues have a tendency to smear for some reason but this one is much better than others I have tried. By the end of the day there is some smearing but not much and just a touch up with a cotton swab cleans it up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many more expensive liners and while this may give you a bit of unintentional smoke, for me it&#x27;s a great product, goes on effortlessly and looks great, upper and lower. What distinguishes it from others that claim effortless application is that most of the others,I&#x27;ve found, glide for a few times but then must be babied, i,e, if you don&#x27;t twist or click it closed tight enough your  glide is soon gone. My biggest problem is I have to put my glasses on so I can see and make sure it&#x27;s Revlon. Just give me my 10 x magnification mirror and the pencil glides on better than all of them. Go Revlon!!!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what  I wanted</li>
            <li> Love the Revlon navy colorstay eyeliner. Product has been discontinued. Would like to find more</li>
            <li> This navy color is quite pretty and softer than a black liner on my green eyes.  It&#x27;s a nice liner but not very long lasting.</li>
            <li> I have used this eyeliner for more than a year.  I like it.</li>
            <li> The best eyeliner I own. Stays on all day and all night. Never smudges and goes on easy !!</li>
            <li> This navy color is getting hard to find. I haven&#x27;t found another long-lasting eyeliner that I like better than Revlon ColorStay.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner. Every other type I&#x27;ve tried causes lid rashes, itchiness and puffiness. This is the only liner that works for me...and Revlon has discontinued it! Bring it back! I&#x27;ve tried their new stuff, and it hurts going on...I don&#x27;t even want to think how it will react with my skin once the pollen season starts!</li>
