            <li> Nice price compared to similar items. Not irritating as some C serums can be. Not a miracle worker, though, darnit!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.... Can&#x27;t live without....</li>
            <li> I rarely write review, but I had to take the time to write this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several skim products to reduce wrinkles and firm my skin.  This really works.  I&#x27;ve used it for four weeks and I can see a difference in my face.  The first change was a noticeably firmness to my skins and age spots fading.  It&#x27;s taken a little longer for wrinkles to soften, but I can see some progress of reduction of crows feet..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally purchased Medpeel Vitamin C through a Groupon and am so glad that I did.  I will be ordering more (at full price since its no longer available through Groupon).  I will be a repeat customer.  Wish they had a daily facial lotion.</li>
            <li> I think it really helps with the aging process.  Recommend</li>
            <li> Love it!  Excellent service</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month, per the instructions,  Absolutely nothing has happened.  It&#x27;s just like putting water on my face.  No change in the skin tone, texture, wrinkles, unevenness and age spots.  Everything is the exact same as the day before I wasted my money by buying this.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Gives my face and neck a youthful glow. I love it. Only notice this when my friends started complimenting me.</li>
            <li> Great product. This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased. I use it everyday and have noticed a great improvement in my complexion. I&#x27;ll never be without it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never ordered this product before.  I do not think it goes  on smoothly I prefer 27 0/0. My skin feels a little sticky .  Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hook. I saw the difference in my skin after only several days.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this product.  i use it daily and my skin has a really nice glow.</li>

            <li> I have been using this product for some time.</li>
            <li> Have noticed a difference in my wrinkles and my husbands dry skin on his face.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t read the damn tiny instructions or directions. I&#x27;m returning it. Guess this will take away from the product. I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> I like the density of the serum and how it feels on my skin. Nice product timely delivery. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Love this - add it to my face cream</li>
