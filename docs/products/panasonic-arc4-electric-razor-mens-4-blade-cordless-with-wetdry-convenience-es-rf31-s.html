            <li>This Panasonic shaver is one of the best all around cordless shavers out there.  </li>
            <li>Amazon customer service is (ultimately) great so there should be a rating system to rate Amazon!</li>

            <li>Very nice, cuts course beard</li>
            <li>Close save, great design wise purchase.</li>
            <li>Does a superb job; charges quickly; great price; came quickly and packaged well;  did not find a warranty registration card-maybe it got tossed in error.</li>
            <li>Good shaver for the price.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES-RF31-S does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Optimum Shaving&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shaver in the shower, nice close shave.</li>
            <li>It performs good and it worths the price for it.</li>
            <li>That is not a problem at all for me since I tend to keep my shavers charged fairly well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m truly delighted with it.  </li>
            <li>Shaves close and battery lasts for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>Feels good does not pull.  </li>
            <li>A good price as discounted.</li>
            <li>Panasonic&#x27;s razors were this good.</li>
            <li>My braun never shaved as good as this one, it always missed something.  </li>
            <li>Works good .</li>
            <li>Good deal.</li>
            <li>saw this at Amazon and with the good reviews, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave as good as I thought.</li>
            <li>It is a good quality of product.</li>
            <li>The battery life is excellent, allowing me to go almost a full week without needing a charge, easily this models best feature.</li>
            <li>perfect, Very cool :)</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Buy this and you will be very satisfied..</li>
            <li>It is the first item I have bought from Amazon (USA) and very happy with price, product and delivery.</li>
            <li>Allot better to be honest!  </li>
            <li>Well built and nice</li>
            <li>Nice razor for the price</li>
            <li>Shaving with it is a good felling and provide nice cleaning and refreshing effects.</li>
            <li>It gets only a 4 star, because nothing is perfect, but this is a great replacement for my 3 blade ES-7013.</li>
            <li>After all, I once had a Remington Razor (many moons ago) and I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Being able to clean both the blades and the shaver head with running water is great.  </li>
            <li>* the 4 blades isn&#x27;t that much better then the the 3 blades to be honest.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy with the old unit</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and compact, and holds a good charge.</li>
            <li>Very precise.  </li>
            <li>This razor is baaaaad to the bone, I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>Nanotech Technology combines with sonic vibration to get the most of 4 shaving surfaces.</li>
            <li>Many who switch to electric shavers don&#x27;t know about this break-in period.</li>
            <li>Yet, it&#x27;s critical to get the best shaving experience.</li>
            <li>Great Product  Fast Shipping</li>
            <li>The battery is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Good unit, univeral charger, easy to clean</li>
            <li>Love this shaver.</li>
            <li>More then one week of shaving with one charged&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also gives many shaves between charges.</li>
            <li>I have had a succession of Brauns, up to top of the line.</li>
            <li>Wonderful Electric Razor from a top Japanese brand.</li>
            <li>Very happy especially considering the price it was offered.</li>
            <li>It takes me about 15 minutes to get an acceptable shave, but it may be that my beard is thicker than most.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I used it for a month and it never got better.</li>
            <li>Panasonic shaver are my favorite over Norelco and Brauun.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time I don&#x27;t as I am running late.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Till Norelco or Brauun prove it can do better</li>
            <li>it can do better</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I love the lock switch</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Razor is just okay.  </li>
            <li>When it comes to airport security, the fewer electronic and mechanical devices you have in your carry-on luggage, the better.</li>
            <li>and of course love those four blades and wet/dry capability that Panasonic is famous for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After one nick too many I took the leap and bought the ES-RF31-S.  </li>
            <li>and I can see why some cost more.</li>
            <li>Does the job, but the disposible battery razor is best for me personally.</li>
            <li>One of the better electric razors I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It was okay but could have been better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 100% pleased</li>
            <li>I bought this razor because of the value more than anything.  </li>
            <li>said, I could not be more pleased with</li>
            <li>Great shaves, fast and close.</li>
            <li>Better than the Braun it replaced.</li>
            <li>I am just not in love with it, but it will do for now.</li>
            <li>but some models are most definitely better than others in their lineup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very happy and would recommend this to anyone looking to get a solid, wet/dry shaver.y use the trimmer on any shaver, but I do like to use it once and</li>
            <li>I am very happy and would recommend this to anyone looking to get a solid, wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li>comfortable shaves well  - 1/2 the price of Cdn. stores!</li>
            <li>I then searched some more and found this unit  WITH A SLIDE UP TRIMMER.  </li>
            <li>I bought this 3 weeks ago and love it.</li>
            <li>Shaving is nowhere close to what most reviewers are claiming.</li>
            <li>and I could do a faster and better job using a Gillette handheld</li>
            <li>and I thought that I&#x27;d give it ONE more shot with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>That higher end Panasonic razor is still my primary one, and still works great although the blades will be replaced</li>
            <li>Good product, the package came well protected and very fast.</li>
            <li>told, if you can swing it, I recommended going for the better linear models over this one, they are better all around shavers with faster and more comfortable shaves.</li>
            <li>Husband says pretty good for $60.</li>
            <li>Not as good as his higher end panasonic shaver</li>
            <li>It could shave a bit closer but over all pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The four blade razor works great, much better than my old three blade.</li>
            <li>Stil, it&#x27;s very easy to clean this shaver with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic ES-RF31-S Men&#x27;s 4-Blade Razor  easy to use, clean-shaven, well after the hanging skin very comfortable, easy to wash.</li>
            <li>But work great other wise.</li>
            <li>Instead of the high-pitched mosquito-sounding whine, it has a more pleasant and muted throaty lower tone that does not carry very far.</li>
            <li>No Liquid Crystal display, which is more of an observation than a huge disadvantage -- that cost savings has to come from somewhere, and for me it is a non-issue, but rather an observation&lt;br</li>
            <li>Never thought I would get such a good shave with an electric shaver!</li>
            <li>I wish this shaver had a cleaning system, but other than that this shaver is the best shaver I&#x27;ve evern used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon on the other hand was awesome on comparative pricing and delivery.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean, I love it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Cleans easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and wash.</li>
            <li>The charge reminder is easy for me to follow.</li>
            <li>Its easy to use</li>
            <li>Over 2 yrs now and still running strong</li>
            <li>However, the main use of this razor for shaving is good.</li>
            <li>Easy to fit in a travel bag</li>
            <li>delivery was fine.</li>
            <li>Bought this hoping I could both save some water and shave a bit more quickly.  </li>
            <li>wish everything came so quickly!</li>
            <li>very good as expected</li>
            <li>And I enjoy over 10 days of shaving without having to plug in for a charge.  </li>
            <li>The printers are cheap to buy  </li>
            <li>I envisionef a one pass giving me a smooth close shave.  </li>
            <li>It does not feel cheap at all.  </li>
            <li>For shaving every day of the week however, I would opt for one of the more powerful Panasonic wet/dry razors.</li>
            <li>but the shave is smooth and blade close.  </li>
            <li>easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic gives a smooth, close shave.</li>
            <li>Gives a close and comfortable shave&lt;br</li>
            <li>comfortable close shaves.  </li>
            <li>It is also quite easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It takes just a few minutes to get a great shave, better than my ES-7013 was able to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>feature- takes some getting use to after many &amp;#34;clean with a brush&amp;#34; razors and lastly, the battery is good for about 3 weeks of shaving before recharging.</li>
            <li>the Remmington was far superior.</li>
            <li>First ever electric razor and it seems to do a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean as you can run it under hot water.</li>
            <li>Shaves clean and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>At first is wasn&#x27;t too sure</li>
            <li>I bought Panasonic on the suggestion of a friend to shave not just my face but my head  using it in my shower.and originally found it satisfactory for about a year.</li>
            <li>works great as long as you don&#x27;t skip a day or two</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Very powerful, and most important, very cost-effective.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Only used it for a week so far but was impressed from day 1 with smoothness of shave and quietness of operation.</li>
            <li>I like the clean with water</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut cleanly, it&#x27;s too small/narrow</li>
            <li>It shaves clean.</li>
            <li>I still clean up with a razor but faster</li>
            <li>Cons are they are a bit large, but have a large battery and whatever they are doing in that large head is working great</li>
            <li>He loves it very much,and his friends love it too.</li>
            <li>The motor runs slower than the Remington and thus does not cut as fast thus requireing more time, also pulls when shaving under my nose.</li>
            <li>I replaced the cutters and foil for the remington and am much happier with it, it also has a much more functional trimmer.</li>
            <li>Gift it as a present, person loved it..</li>
            <li>It charges quickly and holds a charge through four full shaves.  </li>
            <li>Battery charges quickly</li>
            <li>Works great, quiet and fast in the morning.</li>
            <li>when I look in the mirror and see the stubbles growing out of my face (as Bill Cosby would say), I can quickly reach for this razor and get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the replacement&lt;br /&gt;ink cartridges are very high priced !!</li>
            <li>rating this with four stars only because I feel that the slower speed causes a bit more pull of my beard than the more powerful Panasonic razors.</li>
            <li>Apply minimal pressure and you get a remarkably close save..</li>
            <li>And this new replacement is even better than before.  </li>
            <li>you are new to Panasonic, I think they do a better job</li>
            <li>I have not had it long enough to say anything more than it has worked fine and does a good job.</li>
            <li>How do I return this as returned the first one with the original box!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously</li>
            <li>This is exactly what i want!</li>
            <li>Like my other Panasonic razors, it has a nice grip and feel and it is easy to hold and use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing product at a ridiculously low price on Amazon..</li>
            <li>My son tried it out and he too says, it is a really nice razor, it gives a close shave and much better than the round ones.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter because it does not work worth a spit.</li>
            <li>It is ideal if you want to have Panasonic wet/dry capability at a relative&#x27;s house you visit regularly but do not want to have to transport it in your luggage while traveling each time.</li>
            <li>I feel the additional cost would be well worth it for something that you may use for 2 to 4 years or longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth buying.</li>
            <li>The charge indicator and the fact that it shut itself off when fully charged was the only features I really liked besides the slide up trimmer</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>But overall, it does a nice job</li>
            <li>Some spots it does a nice smooth job, while on most other areas it won&#x27;t do much no matter how many times or different ways</li>
            <li>Lower pitch sound and quieter than the other Panasonic razors I own</li>
            <li>The good news is that it is a lot quieter than the other Panasonic shavers I have.</li>
            <li>I feel that the tilt and swivel head on the more expensive Panasonic&#x27;s might be better articulated and superior to the one on this particular</li>
            <li>I like it though a little more umph would make it better.  </li>
            <li>#34;clean up&amp;#34; any areas with a blade when done with the electric..  Finally, I have never seen an electric clean as easily as this one does.  </li>
            <li>Loved my previous Panasonic so I got another.  </li>
            <li>Great shaver and less noisy than the older model I had.</li>
            <li>This product was need priced right although I would buy a better quality one the next time.</li>
            <li>Very fast.</li>
            <li>At first it wouldn&#x27;t turn off, and then it wouldn&#x27;t turn on, (after being fully charged).  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m actually getting a shave in 3 minutes versus 5 or more, plus</li>
            <li>Battery lasts a long time and it&#x27;s easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>Having given up on buying $300 shavers years ago, I first got the Panasonic ES8243 wet/dry shaver about two years ago.</li>
            <li>Requires consistent cleaning.</li>
            <li>Next time I intend to buy more power unit with a 13000 RPM motor.</li>
            <li>This is the first wet/dry shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>He can&#x27;t stop thanking me as he loves it so much!</li>
            <li>Now he wants one...!</li>
            <li>After charging it and using it for the first time I can say I wish I had this shaver years ago.  </li>
            <li>so I bought a different panasonic razor which I love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding an electric shaver that is quick and good.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic really made some nice and high quality even in their smaller products.</li>
            <li>pretty much like Hewlett  Packard printers  -  </li>
            <li>Love the close shave and long battery life of this unit I&#x27;ve always had a problem with skin sensitivity and rashes after using.</li>
            <li>one downfall I&#x27;ve come across so far is the trimmer blade - it doesn&#x27;t seem to come out far enough from the shaver body for me to make good use out of it.</li>
            <li>I have tried every angle possible and this machine just isn&#x27;t shaving right!!  </li>
            <li>Just be aware when buying electrical products from USA is that the voltage is different, but this shaver has a 100-240 volt rating so it works fine; you just have to use a adaptor plug (about $2).</li>
            <li>It gives me a nice close shave, and is an improvement over previous electric razors.</li>
            <li>I started shaving more than 70 years ago  by borrowing my father&#x27;s single head ancient Schick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a blade for 50 years, largely because my whiskers tend to grow out &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; on my neck and jaw line.  </li>
            <li>If I was going to use this shaver everyday, I probably would be a bit irritated by the fact that the blades do not run as fast as the higher end Panasonics that I own.</li>
            <li>Love it, the shaver has no problem removing even two or three days of beard growth, even does a good job with the neck area, very long battery life, can go at least a week without charging.</li>
            <li>I think my older Panasonic even on the first week battery drain was faster, maybe because it had the lcd screen on</li>
            <li>Wet is more comfortable, and required fewer passes to achieve the same results as dry, so it&#x27;s the method I recommend the most for use with this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get the same but with the my older Panasonic, just that this one with a new blade head maybe a tad better.  </li>
            <li>screen broke, cost to replace was too much, so bought a Norelco AT830</li>
            <li>instead, much closer shave and faster shave than the Panasonic and Braun shavers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>It gives me a fast, close shave every day.</li>
            <li>Much smoother and quieter.</li>
            <li>very quite shaver, gives a close shave with no effort at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Decided to try the hundred dollar variety to see if there is really a difference.  </li>
            <li>Much smoother and quieter.  </li>
            <li>works  VERY</li>
            <li>This one real quite and fast.</li>
            <li>thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>IF you owned a preivious Panasonic you won&#x27;t really get a cleaner shave</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve tried it it really works well and fast.</li>
            <li>Shaves very well on face, just on the neck</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t keep my sideburns straight with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery indicator is very helpful plus it charges in an hour&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the &amp;#34;wait 30 days&amp;#34; and it is not satisfactory for something costing this much in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>just doesn&#x27;t  shave very close</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed with the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now a convinced Panasonic customer, these are real values.</li>
            <li>It cost almost as much as a enw shaver</li>
            <li>and I really dislike not having a stand for charging.  </li>
            <li>He likes it so much.</li>
            <li>I have been using this razor for a month now really like it.  </li>
            <li>Although, it&#x27;s much faster than shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li>From everything Ican tell, the blades of the more expensive Panasonic shavers that I own run a lot faster than this shaver&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This is the second Panasonic shaver I have owned and this one is so much better than my old one.  </li>
            <li>But like their more expensive cousins, it works fine with either dry shaving, using just plain water, or the wonderful shaving cream capability that this shaver allows you to experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the engine and motor sound is just the same in everyway as my older Panasonic from 3-4 years ago that is listed at 10,000rpm.  </li>
            <li>As a bonus, both the other shavers have liquid crystal displays that give you more information about the status of the razor, plus an ultrasonic cleaning feature that is marginally useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MOST OTHER PANASONIC SHAVERS.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the lower drone of the motor is more pleasing early in the morning, if you like to shave quickly, this shaver may have a little more pull on your beard than its faster and more expensive cousins.</li>
            <li>The 4 blade head does a good job cutting my whiskers and it is easy on my skin.</li>
            <li>More than once I&#x27;ve opened my travel case to find that the ES-7013 was switched to ON, running down my shaver battery.</li>
            <li>are pricey, therefore we just bought a whole new razor.</li>
            <li>The center blade is easily removed and reinserted  --  </li>
            <li>Found it to do a better job than previous rotary blade razors I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>My previous razor was a Remington Triple Foil and shaved better, but was of a lower build quality.  </li>
            <li>My first razor did not shave well, so I contacted Amazon, and was told to deal with the manufacturer directly, which upset me a LOT, and I conveyed that to Amazon as my point is when I buy from Amazon, versus a seller on Amazon, I should deal with Amazon, and someone fantastic not only got back to me, but also sent a replacement - that I felt made amends (though the first Amazon guy who told me to deal with Panasonic needs some upbraiding -</li>
            <li>your older model didn&#x27;t have.  </li>
            <li>Maybe Amazon has older model of the 10,000 rpm</li>
            <li>This an older model</li>
            <li>It is best to soap and dry the face at least 10 minutes prior to shaving, so that the beard is ready for shaving.</li>
            <li>Also, the different types of blades across the top gets the whiskers of different lengths so no need to &amp;</li>
            <li>However, I frequently go 3 or more days between shaves, and the trimmer&#x27;s narrow width and angle of attack leave much to be desired.  </li>
            <li>I cannot get a decent shave with this razor.</li>
            <li>I also owned a Norelco lift and cut and a Braun from my high school/ college</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I purchased this machine after reading somewhere online that it was highly recommended for head shaving.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this shaver to anyone</li>
            <li>Cuts a little better.</li>
            <li>Cuts a little better.</li>
            <li>The head must be completely taken off the razor and clean every one of the foils independently.</li>
            <li>This shaver shaves closer than my old norelco rotary, and it really shaves close when using shaving gel in the shower.</li>
            <li>+, it didnt make sense to me to put that much money into a 2-3 year old shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, in summary - a great but not perfect shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, in summary - a great but not perfect shaver.</li>
            <li>, maybe you get a few more features</li>
            <li>The most improved aspect is that it goes for weeks in between recharges with the lithium batteries as opposed to a few days with the nickel cadmium jammies.</li>
            <li>It may be because most of them might have been a Mongolian race (with few hair on their face or wherever).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got more than few</li>
            <li>It is a good shaver, not great.</li>
            <li>found the ES-RF31-S to be a competent shaver, shaving both my head and face in around 8-9 minutes every morning, not bad, but not great either.</li>
            <li>I do like using it in the shower, and this is a true wet/dry shaver (not like some other shavers that only let you run the shaving head under running tap water to clean the heads).</li>
            <li>The shave pro&#x27;s are a lot better for a lot less money!</li>
            <li>The battery stays charged for a long time and charges quickly.</li>
            <li>However, product looks new, so I may use this one.</li>
            <li>They dry quickly with a handheld hair dryer.</li>
            <li>When I switched to Panasonic linear shavers years ago, I felt they finally made a real shaver that works!  </li>
            <li>then many other Panasonic of the same &amp;#34;main&amp;#34; spec.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Blades appear to run somewhat slower than the more expensive Panasonic razors, possibly causing a bit more pull on one&#x27;s beard if shaving in a hurry&lt;br</li>
            <li>This new 4 blade nano system is basically bigger and better then the previous unit..</li>
            <li>Was to replace a cheap Remmington ( half the price of the panasonic) .</li>
            <li>burned my skin more than once wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>I had neck surgery and thought it would work fine for a few weeks</li>
            <li>It may take a few days to adjust to this new experience, but it is certainly worth it!</li>
            <li>My shave is not only closer, but also much faster than with my old razor.</li>
            <li>am completely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>im 38 years old</li>
            <li>would recomend this to a friend with no trouble at all.</li>
            <li>reccommend if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Initially looked for a like-for-like replacement for my ageing Braun, which I really got on well with, but decided on a switch to the RF31-S after reading reviews and checking prices.</li>
            <li>So far the battery lasted longer the the old Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used an old manual razer in a while.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>my old 10,000rpm model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Battery lasts forever because shaving is fast and this model has enough of a battery display to keep you informed when to charge.</li>
            <li>bought this as a replacement for a four year old panasonic elec razor.  </li>
            <li>but I like  it so far</li>
            <li>so I e-mailed panasonic directly.  </li>
            <li>So that should tell you how &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; this product really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if I can return it and get my money back???</li>
            <li>I was really surprised how well this shaver worked after reading all of the reviews before I purchased this shaver.  </li>
            <li>When turned on, the shaver isn&#x27;t loud at all.  </li>
            <li>so no real complaint.</li>
            <li>the linear models are always the more expensive ones...and they are worth their asking price and then some.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had such a quick and close shave in really long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, because I have two other Panasonic razors that are more powerful and more expensive, and that I am also very happy with, I would definitely choose one of them for my daily shaving needs if I had to choose between the less expensive Panasonic and one of the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>Quiet and close shave from the main blades.</li>
            <li>Same quick charging capabilityas the more expensive models&lt;</li>
            <li>well -  only one caveat and that being the high price of r replacement foils as it contains</li>
            <li>Overall I would not rate it too high compared to what I am accustomed to from panasonic.</li>
            <li>It is also quite quiet, given that it operates at high speed.</li>
            <li>It has a comfortable feel to it wet or dry shaving.</li>
            <li>Only fair as a wet shaver, and average as dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually kept my noisy old Remington around just for its wide, powerful trimmer.</li>
            <li>With other electric razors he would kind of alternate between blade shaving and electric shaving but with this little jewel he&#x27;s given up on blade shaving.</li>
            <li>No heavier than the other more expensive Panasonic razors (important to travelers)&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I had the two blade version for several years and decided to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>It simply did not give me a reasonable shave--not close enough.</li>
            <li>The 4th blade is only for the long hairs and on two days growth works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While the shaver is similar in many respects to my other (more expensive) Panasonic razors, it is also different.</li>
            <li>but when I started using this one I realize there is a major improvement..</li>
            <li>The stores in Australia should be be very scared about the competition that Amazon will bring to consumers in the future (so far, you can only buy books and digital products on Amazon Australia).</li>
            <li>I mostly buy cheap electric shavers, but I found this one on sale for about half price (but still expensive to me) and decided to splurge.</li>
            <li>This shaver works great on the neck and other difficult areas..</li>
            <li>The shaver itself works fine, but the trimmer is pretty much useless--</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always missing &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34; with this - it doesn&#x27;t capture hair around contours of the face, softer skin of the throat (neck), around the edges of sideburns - and I&#x27;m spending a lot longer to get a clean shave, therefore left with stinging, red welts on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compares poorly not only to my older 3 blade Braun but also the humbler Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>After 30+ years in the military, I had never found an electric razor that gave me a decent, close shave or one that didn&#x27;t irritate my face until buying this Panasonic razor!  </li>
            <li>Their single blade shavers did better for less money but not near as close a shave as the shave pro&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>God, I should stop reading &amp;#34;paid reviewers&amp;#34; posting bunch of bull crap about how amazing this product is.&lt;br /&gt;It is cheaply made although it commands big money.</li>
            <li>The small handle and the larger head are comfortable and convenient-</li>
            <li>Somewhat ok, not great.</li>
            <li>Bought this razor for my husband last Christmas, and now I&#x27;m shopping for a new one because his stopped working after only 8 months of use!</li>
            <li>like my other Panasonic razors, this one has four blades and is also wet/dry capable.</li>
            <li>It is also hard to clean with a brush.</li>
            <li>Ten year old Panasonic razor finally died, had to get another Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>And I really like the Panasonic because you do NOT need a special base to charge and clean the shaving head, like the Braun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried shaving twice as long as my old rotary razor, but it doesn&#x27;t make any difference.</li>
            <li>Gets tough to reach areas easily and with a close shave.</li>
            <li>This shaver cut right through with very little with no problems.</li>
            <li>While this isn&#x27;t a bad shaver at all, Panasonic does better, and at not too much of a higher premium.</li>
            <li>For me, on travel, a slightly slower shaver speed isn&#x27;t going to make that much difference to me especially since I will not be using it that often, only when visiting relatives.</li>

            <li> Feels good does not pull.  </li>
            <li> A good price as discounted.</li>
            <li> Panasonic&#x27;s razors were this good.</li>
            <li> My braun never shaved as good as this one, it always missed something.  </li>
            <li> Works good .</li>
            <li> Good deal.</li>
            <li> saw this at Amazon and with the good reviews, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as good as I thought.</li>
            <li> It is a good quality of product.</li>
            <li> The battery life is excellent, allowing me to go almost a full week without needing a charge, easily this models best feature.</li>
            <li> perfect, Very cool :)</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Buy this and you will be very satisfied..</li>
            <li> It is the first item I have bought from Amazon (USA) and very happy with price, product and delivery.</li>
            <li> Allot better to be honest!  </li>
            <li> Well built and nice</li>
            <li> Nice razor for the price</li>
            <li> Shaving with it is a good felling and provide nice cleaning and refreshing effects.</li>
            <li> It gets only a 4 star, because nothing is perfect, but this is a great replacement for my 3 blade ES-7013.</li>
            <li> After all, I once had a Remington Razor (many moons ago) and I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Being able to clean both the blades and the shaver head with running water is great.  </li>
            <li> * the 4 blades isn&#x27;t that much better then the the 3 blades to be honest.  </li>
            <li> I was very happy with the old unit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and compact, and holds a good charge.</li>
            <li> Very precise.  </li>
            <li> This razor is baaaaad to the bone, I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> Nanotech Technology combines with sonic vibration to get the most of 4 shaving surfaces.</li>
            <li> Many who switch to electric shavers don&#x27;t know about this break-in period.</li>
            <li> Yet, it&#x27;s critical to get the best shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Great Product  Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> The battery is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Good unit, univeral charger, easy to clean</li>
            <li> Love this shaver.</li>
            <li> More then one week of shaving with one charged&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also gives many shaves between charges.</li>
            <li> I have had a succession of Brauns, up to top of the line.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Electric Razor from a top Japanese brand.</li>
            <li> Very happy especially considering the price it was offered.</li>
            <li> It takes me about 15 minutes to get an acceptable shave, but it may be that my beard is thicker than most.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I used it for a month and it never got better.</li>
            <li> Panasonic shaver are my favorite over Norelco and Brauun.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time I don&#x27;t as I am running late.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Till Norelco or Brauun prove it can do better</li>
            <li> it can do better</li>
            <li> I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> and I love the lock switch</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Razor is just okay.  </li>
            <li> When it comes to airport security, the fewer electronic and mechanical devices you have in your carry-on luggage, the better.</li>
            <li> and of course love those four blades and wet/dry capability that Panasonic is famous for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After one nick too many I took the leap and bought the ES-RF31-S.  </li>
            <li> and I can see why some cost more.</li>
            <li> Does the job, but the disposible battery razor is best for me personally.</li>
            <li> One of the better electric razors I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It was okay but could have been better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% pleased</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because of the value more than anything.  </li>
            <li> said, I could not be more pleased with</li>
            <li> Great shaves, fast and close.</li>
            <li> Better than the Braun it replaced.</li>
            <li> I am just not in love with it, but it will do for now.</li>
            <li> but some models are most definitely better than others in their lineup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very happy and would recommend this to anyone looking to get a solid, wet/dry shaver.y use the trimmer on any shaver, but I do like to use it once and</li>
            <li> I am very happy and would recommend this to anyone looking to get a solid, wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li> comfortable shaves well  - 1/2 the price of Cdn. stores!</li>
            <li> I then searched some more and found this unit  WITH A SLIDE UP TRIMMER.  </li>
            <li> I bought this 3 weeks ago and love it.</li>
            <li> Shaving is nowhere close to what most reviewers are claiming.</li>
            <li> and I could do a faster and better job using a Gillette handheld</li>
            <li> and I thought that I&#x27;d give it ONE more shot with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> That higher end Panasonic razor is still my primary one, and still works great although the blades will be replaced</li>
            <li> Good product, the package came well protected and very fast.</li>
            <li> told, if you can swing it, I recommended going for the better linear models over this one, they are better all around shavers with faster and more comfortable shaves.</li>
            <li> Husband says pretty good for $60.</li>
            <li> Not as good as his higher end panasonic shaver</li>
            <li> It could shave a bit closer but over all pretty good.  </li>
            <li> The four blade razor works great, much better than my old three blade.</li>
            <li> Stil, it&#x27;s very easy to clean this shaver with soap and water.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic ES-RF31-S Men&#x27;s 4-Blade Razor  easy to use, clean-shaven, well after the hanging skin very comfortable, easy to wash.</li>
            <li> But work great other wise.</li>
            <li> Instead of the high-pitched mosquito-sounding whine, it has a more pleasant and muted throaty lower tone that does not carry very far.</li>
            <li> No Liquid Crystal display, which is more of an observation than a huge disadvantage -- that cost savings has to come from somewhere, and for me it is a non-issue, but rather an observation&lt;br</li>
            <li> Never thought I would get such a good shave with an electric shaver!</li>
            <li> I wish this shaver had a cleaning system, but other than that this shaver is the best shaver I&#x27;ve evern used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon on the other hand was awesome on comparative pricing and delivery.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean, I love it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Cleans easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and wash.</li>
            <li> The charge reminder is easy for me to follow.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use</li>
            <li> Over 2 yrs now and still running strong</li>
            <li> However, the main use of this razor for shaving is good.</li>
            <li> Easy to fit in a travel bag</li>
            <li> delivery was fine.</li>
            <li> Bought this hoping I could both save some water and shave a bit more quickly.  </li>
            <li> wish everything came so quickly!</li>
            <li> very good as expected</li>
            <li> And I enjoy over 10 days of shaving without having to plug in for a charge.  </li>
            <li> The printers are cheap to buy  </li>
            <li> I envisionef a one pass giving me a smooth close shave.  </li>
            <li> It does not feel cheap at all.  </li>
            <li> For shaving every day of the week however, I would opt for one of the more powerful Panasonic wet/dry razors.</li>
            <li> but the shave is smooth and blade close.  </li>
            <li> easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic gives a smooth, close shave.</li>
            <li> Gives a close and comfortable shave&lt;br</li>
            <li> comfortable close shaves.  </li>
            <li> It is also quite easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It takes just a few minutes to get a great shave, better than my ES-7013 was able to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> feature- takes some getting use to after many &amp;#34;clean with a brush&amp;#34; razors and lastly, the battery is good for about 3 weeks of shaving before recharging.</li>
            <li> the Remmington was far superior.</li>
            <li> First ever electric razor and it seems to do a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean as you can run it under hot water.</li>
            <li> Shaves clean and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> At first is wasn&#x27;t too sure</li>
            <li> I bought Panasonic on the suggestion of a friend to shave not just my face but my head  using it in my shower.and originally found it satisfactory for about a year.</li>
            <li> works great as long as you don&#x27;t skip a day or two</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Very powerful, and most important, very cost-effective.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Only used it for a week so far but was impressed from day 1 with smoothness of shave and quietness of operation.</li>
            <li> I like the clean with water</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut cleanly, it&#x27;s too small/narrow</li>
            <li> It shaves clean.</li>
            <li> I still clean up with a razor but faster</li>
            <li> Cons are they are a bit large, but have a large battery and whatever they are doing in that large head is working great</li>
            <li> He loves it very much,and his friends love it too.</li>
            <li> The motor runs slower than the Remington and thus does not cut as fast thus requireing more time, also pulls when shaving under my nose.</li>
            <li> I replaced the cutters and foil for the remington and am much happier with it, it also has a much more functional trimmer.</li>
            <li> Gift it as a present, person loved it..</li>
            <li> It charges quickly and holds a charge through four full shaves.  </li>
            <li> Battery charges quickly</li>
            <li> Works great, quiet and fast in the morning.</li>
            <li> when I look in the mirror and see the stubbles growing out of my face (as Bill Cosby would say), I can quickly reach for this razor and get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the replacement&lt;br /&gt;ink cartridges are very high priced !!</li>
            <li> rating this with four stars only because I feel that the slower speed causes a bit more pull of my beard than the more powerful Panasonic razors.</li>
            <li> Apply minimal pressure and you get a remarkably close save..</li>
            <li> And this new replacement is even better than before.  </li>
            <li> you are new to Panasonic, I think they do a better job</li>
            <li> I have not had it long enough to say anything more than it has worked fine and does a good job.</li>
            <li> How do I return this as returned the first one with the original box!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i want!</li>
            <li> Like my other Panasonic razors, it has a nice grip and feel and it is easy to hold and use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazing product at a ridiculously low price on Amazon..</li>
            <li> My son tried it out and he too says, it is a really nice razor, it gives a close shave and much better than the round ones.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter because it does not work worth a spit.</li>
            <li> It is ideal if you want to have Panasonic wet/dry capability at a relative&#x27;s house you visit regularly but do not want to have to transport it in your luggage while traveling each time.</li>
            <li> I feel the additional cost would be well worth it for something that you may use for 2 to 4 years or longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth buying.</li>
            <li> The charge indicator and the fact that it shut itself off when fully charged was the only features I really liked besides the slide up trimmer</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> But overall, it does a nice job</li>
            <li> Some spots it does a nice smooth job, while on most other areas it won&#x27;t do much no matter how many times or different ways</li>
            <li> Lower pitch sound and quieter than the other Panasonic razors I own</li>
            <li> The good news is that it is a lot quieter than the other Panasonic shavers I have.</li>
            <li> I feel that the tilt and swivel head on the more expensive Panasonic&#x27;s might be better articulated and superior to the one on this particular</li>
            <li> I like it though a little more umph would make it better.  </li>
            <li> #34;clean up&amp;#34; any areas with a blade when done with the electric..  Finally, I have never seen an electric clean as easily as this one does.  </li>
            <li> Loved my previous Panasonic so I got another.  </li>
            <li> Great shaver and less noisy than the older model I had.</li>
            <li> This product was need priced right although I would buy a better quality one the next time.</li>
            <li> Very fast.</li>
            <li> At first it wouldn&#x27;t turn off, and then it wouldn&#x27;t turn on, (after being fully charged).  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m actually getting a shave in 3 minutes versus 5 or more, plus</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time and it&#x27;s easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> Having given up on buying $300 shavers years ago, I first got the Panasonic ES8243 wet/dry shaver about two years ago.</li>
            <li> Requires consistent cleaning.</li>
            <li> Next time I intend to buy more power unit with a 13000 RPM motor.</li>
            <li> This is the first wet/dry shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> He can&#x27;t stop thanking me as he loves it so much!</li>
            <li> Now he wants one...!</li>
            <li> After charging it and using it for the first time I can say I wish I had this shaver years ago.  </li>
            <li> so I bought a different panasonic razor which I love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding an electric shaver that is quick and good.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic really made some nice and high quality even in their smaller products.</li>
            <li> pretty much like Hewlett  Packard printers  -  </li>
            <li> Love the close shave and long battery life of this unit I&#x27;ve always had a problem with skin sensitivity and rashes after using.</li>
            <li> one downfall I&#x27;ve come across so far is the trimmer blade - it doesn&#x27;t seem to come out far enough from the shaver body for me to make good use out of it.</li>
            <li> I have tried every angle possible and this machine just isn&#x27;t shaving right!!  </li>
            <li> Just be aware when buying electrical products from USA is that the voltage is different, but this shaver has a 100-240 volt rating so it works fine; you just have to use a adaptor plug (about $2).</li>
            <li> It gives me a nice close shave, and is an improvement over previous electric razors.</li>
            <li> I started shaving more than 70 years ago  by borrowing my father&#x27;s single head ancient Schick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a blade for 50 years, largely because my whiskers tend to grow out &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; on my neck and jaw line.  </li>
            <li> If I was going to use this shaver everyday, I probably would be a bit irritated by the fact that the blades do not run as fast as the higher end Panasonics that I own.</li>
            <li> Love it, the shaver has no problem removing even two or three days of beard growth, even does a good job with the neck area, very long battery life, can go at least a week without charging.</li>
            <li> I think my older Panasonic even on the first week battery drain was faster, maybe because it had the lcd screen on</li>
            <li> Wet is more comfortable, and required fewer passes to achieve the same results as dry, so it&#x27;s the method I recommend the most for use with this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get the same but with the my older Panasonic, just that this one with a new blade head maybe a tad better.  </li>
            <li> screen broke, cost to replace was too much, so bought a Norelco AT830</li>
            <li> instead, much closer shave and faster shave than the Panasonic and Braun shavers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> It gives me a fast, close shave every day.</li>
            <li> Much smoother and quieter.</li>
            <li> very quite shaver, gives a close shave with no effort at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Decided to try the hundred dollar variety to see if there is really a difference.  </li>
            <li> Much smoother and quieter.  </li>
            <li> works  VERY</li>
            <li> This one real quite and fast.</li>
            <li> thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> IF you owned a preivious Panasonic you won&#x27;t really get a cleaner shave</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve tried it it really works well and fast.</li>
            <li> Shaves very well on face, just on the neck</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t keep my sideburns straight with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery indicator is very helpful plus it charges in an hour&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the &amp;#34;wait 30 days&amp;#34; and it is not satisfactory for something costing this much in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> just doesn&#x27;t  shave very close</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed with the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now a convinced Panasonic customer, these are real values.</li>
            <li> It cost almost as much as a enw shaver</li>
            <li> and I really dislike not having a stand for charging.  </li>
            <li> He likes it so much.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for a month now really like it.  </li>
            <li> Although, it&#x27;s much faster than shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li> From everything Ican tell, the blades of the more expensive Panasonic shavers that I own run a lot faster than this shaver&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic shaver I have owned and this one is so much better than my old one.  </li>
            <li> But like their more expensive cousins, it works fine with either dry shaving, using just plain water, or the wonderful shaving cream capability that this shaver allows you to experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the engine and motor sound is just the same in everyway as my older Panasonic from 3-4 years ago that is listed at 10,000rpm.  </li>
            <li> As a bonus, both the other shavers have liquid crystal displays that give you more information about the status of the razor, plus an ultrasonic cleaning feature that is marginally useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MOST OTHER PANASONIC SHAVERS.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the lower drone of the motor is more pleasing early in the morning, if you like to shave quickly, this shaver may have a little more pull on your beard than its faster and more expensive cousins.</li>
            <li> The 4 blade head does a good job cutting my whiskers and it is easy on my skin.</li>
            <li> More than once I&#x27;ve opened my travel case to find that the ES-7013 was switched to ON, running down my shaver battery.</li>
            <li> are pricey, therefore we just bought a whole new razor.</li>
            <li> The center blade is easily removed and reinserted  --  </li>
            <li> Found it to do a better job than previous rotary blade razors I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> My previous razor was a Remington Triple Foil and shaved better, but was of a lower build quality.  </li>
            <li> My first razor did not shave well, so I contacted Amazon, and was told to deal with the manufacturer directly, which upset me a LOT, and I conveyed that to Amazon as my point is when I buy from Amazon, versus a seller on Amazon, I should deal with Amazon, and someone fantastic not only got back to me, but also sent a replacement - that I felt made amends (though the first Amazon guy who told me to deal with Panasonic needs some upbraiding -</li>
            <li> your older model didn&#x27;t have.  </li>
            <li> Maybe Amazon has older model of the 10,000 rpm</li>
            <li> This an older model</li>
            <li> It is best to soap and dry the face at least 10 minutes prior to shaving, so that the beard is ready for shaving.</li>
            <li> Also, the different types of blades across the top gets the whiskers of different lengths so no need to &amp;</li>
            <li> However, I frequently go 3 or more days between shaves, and the trimmer&#x27;s narrow width and angle of attack leave much to be desired.  </li>
            <li> I cannot get a decent shave with this razor.</li>
            <li> I also owned a Norelco lift and cut and a Braun from my high school/ college</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this machine after reading somewhere online that it was highly recommended for head shaving.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this shaver to anyone</li>
            <li> Cuts a little better.</li>
            <li> Cuts a little better.</li>
            <li> The head must be completely taken off the razor and clean every one of the foils independently.</li>
            <li> This shaver shaves closer than my old norelco rotary, and it really shaves close when using shaving gel in the shower.</li>
            <li> +, it didnt make sense to me to put that much money into a 2-3 year old shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, in summary - a great but not perfect shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, in summary - a great but not perfect shaver.</li>
            <li> , maybe you get a few more features</li>
            <li> The most improved aspect is that it goes for weeks in between recharges with the lithium batteries as opposed to a few days with the nickel cadmium jammies.</li>
            <li> It may be because most of them might have been a Mongolian race (with few hair on their face or wherever).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got more than few</li>
            <li> It is a good shaver, not great.</li>
            <li> found the ES-RF31-S to be a competent shaver, shaving both my head and face in around 8-9 minutes every morning, not bad, but not great either.</li>
            <li> I do like using it in the shower, and this is a true wet/dry shaver (not like some other shavers that only let you run the shaving head under running tap water to clean the heads).</li>
            <li> The shave pro&#x27;s are a lot better for a lot less money!</li>
            <li> The battery stays charged for a long time and charges quickly.</li>
            <li> However, product looks new, so I may use this one.</li>
            <li> They dry quickly with a handheld hair dryer.</li>
            <li> When I switched to Panasonic linear shavers years ago, I felt they finally made a real shaver that works!  </li>
            <li> then many other Panasonic of the same &amp;#34;main&amp;#34; spec.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Blades appear to run somewhat slower than the more expensive Panasonic razors, possibly causing a bit more pull on one&#x27;s beard if shaving in a hurry&lt;br</li>
            <li> This new 4 blade nano system is basically bigger and better then the previous unit..</li>
            <li> Was to replace a cheap Remmington ( half the price of the panasonic) .</li>
            <li> burned my skin more than once wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I had neck surgery and thought it would work fine for a few weeks</li>
            <li> It may take a few days to adjust to this new experience, but it is certainly worth it!</li>
            <li> My shave is not only closer, but also much faster than with my old razor.</li>
            <li> am completely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> im 38 years old</li>
            <li> would recomend this to a friend with no trouble at all.</li>
            <li> reccommend if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Initially looked for a like-for-like replacement for my ageing Braun, which I really got on well with, but decided on a switch to the RF31-S after reading reviews and checking prices.</li>
            <li> So far the battery lasted longer the the old Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an old manual razer in a while.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> my old 10,000rpm model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Battery lasts forever because shaving is fast and this model has enough of a battery display to keep you informed when to charge.</li>
            <li> bought this as a replacement for a four year old panasonic elec razor.  </li>
            <li> but I like  it so far</li>
            <li> so I e-mailed panasonic directly.  </li>
            <li> So that should tell you how &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; this product really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if I can return it and get my money back???</li>
            <li> I was really surprised how well this shaver worked after reading all of the reviews before I purchased this shaver.  </li>
            <li> When turned on, the shaver isn&#x27;t loud at all.  </li>
            <li> so no real complaint.</li>
            <li> the linear models are always the more expensive ones...and they are worth their asking price and then some.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had such a quick and close shave in really long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, because I have two other Panasonic razors that are more powerful and more expensive, and that I am also very happy with, I would definitely choose one of them for my daily shaving needs if I had to choose between the less expensive Panasonic and one of the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Quiet and close shave from the main blades.</li>
            <li> Same quick charging capabilityas the more expensive models&lt;</li>
            <li> well -  only one caveat and that being the high price of r replacement foils as it contains</li>
            <li> Overall I would not rate it too high compared to what I am accustomed to from panasonic.</li>
            <li> It is also quite quiet, given that it operates at high speed.</li>
            <li> It has a comfortable feel to it wet or dry shaving.</li>
            <li> Only fair as a wet shaver, and average as dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually kept my noisy old Remington around just for its wide, powerful trimmer.</li>
            <li> With other electric razors he would kind of alternate between blade shaving and electric shaving but with this little jewel he&#x27;s given up on blade shaving.</li>
            <li> No heavier than the other more expensive Panasonic razors (important to travelers)&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I had the two blade version for several years and decided to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> It simply did not give me a reasonable shave--not close enough.</li>
            <li> The 4th blade is only for the long hairs and on two days growth works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While the shaver is similar in many respects to my other (more expensive) Panasonic razors, it is also different.</li>
            <li> but when I started using this one I realize there is a major improvement..</li>
            <li> The stores in Australia should be be very scared about the competition that Amazon will bring to consumers in the future (so far, you can only buy books and digital products on Amazon Australia).</li>
            <li> I mostly buy cheap electric shavers, but I found this one on sale for about half price (but still expensive to me) and decided to splurge.</li>
            <li> This shaver works great on the neck and other difficult areas..</li>
            <li> The shaver itself works fine, but the trimmer is pretty much useless--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always missing &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34; with this - it doesn&#x27;t capture hair around contours of the face, softer skin of the throat (neck), around the edges of sideburns - and I&#x27;m spending a lot longer to get a clean shave, therefore left with stinging, red welts on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compares poorly not only to my older 3 blade Braun but also the humbler Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> After 30+ years in the military, I had never found an electric razor that gave me a decent, close shave or one that didn&#x27;t irritate my face until buying this Panasonic razor!  </li>
            <li> Their single blade shavers did better for less money but not near as close a shave as the shave pro&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> God, I should stop reading &amp;#34;paid reviewers&amp;#34; posting bunch of bull crap about how amazing this product is.&lt;br /&gt;It is cheaply made although it commands big money.</li>
            <li> The small handle and the larger head are comfortable and convenient-</li>
            <li> Somewhat ok, not great.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor for my husband last Christmas, and now I&#x27;m shopping for a new one because his stopped working after only 8 months of use!</li>
            <li> like my other Panasonic razors, this one has four blades and is also wet/dry capable.</li>
            <li> It is also hard to clean with a brush.</li>
            <li> Ten year old Panasonic razor finally died, had to get another Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> And I really like the Panasonic because you do NOT need a special base to charge and clean the shaving head, like the Braun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried shaving twice as long as my old rotary razor, but it doesn&#x27;t make any difference.</li>
            <li> Gets tough to reach areas easily and with a close shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver cut right through with very little with no problems.</li>
            <li> While this isn&#x27;t a bad shaver at all, Panasonic does better, and at not too much of a higher premium.</li>
            <li> For me, on travel, a slightly slower shaver speed isn&#x27;t going to make that much difference to me especially since I will not be using it that often, only when visiting relatives.</li>
            <li> It cuts very poorly, and the heads are huge, so I have to use my old Panasonic sa-40 to finish the spots that this shaver misses.</li>
            <li> The bad news is, the reason it has a lower pitch is because apparently the motor drives the blades a lot slower than the shaver&#x27;s more expensive cousins that I own.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that cleaning with water can rust the blades sooner that otherwise if they are not dried properly.  </li>
            <li> It did offer a quick charge (5 minutes of charging for a 5 minute shave), but that was hard to do if I was on a two day trip and didnt bring my charger!</li>
            <li> But there is some good news and bad news with regard to this shaver compared to my other two more expensive Panasonics.</li>
            <li> the only problem with this shaver is that it takes a long time  to shave.</li>
            <li> But since it will reside in a another location, that is not a major issue for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works well on parts of my face that the Remingtons I used for several years always left rough.</li>
            <li> HIgh quality shaver, and as usual Amazon had to my home on time.</li>
            <li> So far no good, takes forever to shave and not even close to my old remington electric</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin with a harsh stubborn beard.</li>
            <li> For those who&#x27;ve used a blade for long, switching to an electric shaver takes a couple of weeks - even 30 days - to \\&quot;season\\&quot;</li>
            <li> that is  because it does not shave long hair</li>
            <li> but it does the job with zero irritation and seems to hold a charge for  a long time.</li>
            <li> Actually this one was a replacement shaver after returning the first one which performed even worse.</li>
            <li> This shaver is quiet in comparison to other Panasonic models.  </li>
            <li> For me, the fact that my other two Panasonic razors can share the same power supply and this one cannot is a bit of a disadvantage.</li>
            <li> little facial hairs just seem to appear suddenly and in no time at all.</li>
            <li> It has very long battery life and there are no problem in using.</li>
            <li> It also saves us in shaving cream because he just uses it dry before showering.</li>
            <li> With the Brauns, you are forced to use a special base to charge and clean the shaver, and once the cleaning product runs out, you can&#x27;t charge the razor!</li>
            <li> I opted out of the self-cleaning models, as I have limited counter space.</li>
            <li> I have used it exclusively for a couple of weeks while at other times interspersing it with using a regular wet razor and have never had any skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> but it seems that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two Norelco&#x27;s and one Remington, I gave up using an electric shaver and the problem was that they were not powerful enough.  </li>
            <li> The ES-RF31-S4 Shaver can be used wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> Works almost as well dry as wet, with no electric razor neck burn like Norelco.</li>
            <li> The ability to shave wet or dry also helps a lot here.</li>
            <li> I had never used an electric razor, so it is little bit dificult to compare with another models, anyhow for me it works fine, while the trimmer is useless</li>
            <li> As others have stated, this item is not new and comes in a plain white box.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;the center  &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It gave me my face skin back , i was shaving two times a day and my skin was crying now to shave its a joke .I</li>
            <li> Had trouble sending it back for a return .</li>
            <li> I have not tried it wet shaving yet.</li>
            <li> It shaves close and even closer if shaving wet.  </li>
            <li> Dry took an average of a minute longer to shave, but that&#x27;s acceptable if your not in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a tough beard, but I have to pass over each area of my face multiple times to get even a barely acceptable result.  </li>
            <li> The shaver in the back is really small.</li>
            <li> I have only used rotary shavers in the past.</li>
            <li> Four blades was unnecessary and the back trimmer started acting up acfter just 3 weeks</li>
            <li> Takes off half the amount of time to shave with other razors.</li>
            <li> unit starts out being seemingly less sharp.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to do now and wonder if it has been too long to return this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The center blades themselves are NOT  available as an item which would</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t shave good at all, i was so mad to pay that mount of money on it!!!!</li>
            <li> It takes so long to get a half-way decent shave that I&#x27;m afraid to try it in the shower because of the wrinkled skin and the water bill.</li>
            <li> Half shaving time respect equivalent Braun model</li>
            <li> I know shaves quicker and with less foils.</li>
            <li> It also irritates my face much less.</li>
            <li> seems less noisy.  </li>
            <li> They shave faster and closer, with much less irritation than their slower motored counterparts, which this model is a part of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically use the trimmer on any shaver, but I do like to use it once and</li>
            <li> so I just buy a never shaver every year and a half.</li>
            <li> No head cleaning brush was provided and I am using the one designed for my previous shaver.</li>
            <li> current range of shavers from Panasonic can be broken down into two catagories, 10,000 rpm or less non linear models, and 13-14,000 rpm linear shavers.</li>
            <li> please don&#x27;t pay money on it because it is not worth it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would have given 5 stars but a little piece broke off</li>
            <li> And there was a hair in the blades, waving its little follicle at me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wasted my money</li>
            <li> I do not have heavy beard growth at all but definintly need to shave every day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as close as a plain razor shave, but he doesn&#x27;t get nicks or irritation from the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Lots of noise with past models.</li>
            <li> mustache trimmer seems to be a bit on the small side</li>
            <li> The shaving speed is ordinary.</li>
            <li> &gt; Not much more to say</li>
            <li> but I needed the extra words to post this....how silly.</li>
            <li> Amazon had not replaced the old bad one with the new bad one.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s hard to find anymore.</li>
            <li> Braun can&#x27;t be beat, at least not with Panasonic ES-RF31-S</li>
            <li> It was suggested I use this product for at least 30 days to get used to it.</li>
            <li> Not really thrilled with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Except for the trimmer, I would have rated the shaver at least a 4.  </li>
            <li> took usual amount of time to shave and still needed to shave again, do not buy!</li>
            <li> a cutting those long hairs.  </li>
            <li> The sad fact is that my beard tends to wear down the blades of any razor, no matter which brand.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with the degree of difficulty it takes to clean the razor head and shaver cutting block.</li>
            <li> Braun was never good</li>
            <li> After other panasonic models using in the past this shaver just bad.</li>
            <li> one thing that keeps me from giving this razor a 5 star rating is the weak beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Trimmer device floppy and weak,</li>
            <li> are a weak design and wanted one with a slide up trimmer instead.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands and was consistently disappointed.</li>
            <li> problem was I got tired of buying expensive blades</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Expensive spare parts&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Uncomfortable handle</li>
            <li> Replacement foils and cutters look expensive, however.</li>
            <li> Well, it was useless.</li>
            <li> The seller argued with me telling me I was wrong and after all, it was  low-level Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Quality of razor is questionable.  </li>
            <li> Would have been a solid 4 stars, but the pop up trimmer is among the worst.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s difficult to use because of its location on the razor.</li>
            <li> As a long time fan of Panasonic, I am very disappointed with this shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Awkward to use and doesn&#x27;t shave close at all.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun that had a bad battery.</li>
            <li> Yesterday, after a bad one, I pulled the razor away.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this shaver!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an especially difficult beard to cut.</li>
            <li> Horrible box condition.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> perfect, Very cool :)</li>
            <li> Only fair as a wet shaver, and average as dry. I have had two Remingtons and a Norelco, and this is nothing to brag on. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Never thought I would get such a good shave with an electric shaver!</li>
            <li> The four blade razor works great, much better than my old three blade. Battery charges quickly and I prefer the LEDs vs LCDs&lt;br /&gt;comments added 3/10/14.....screen broke, cost to replace was too much, so bought a Norelco AT830 instead, much closer shave and faster shave than the Panasonic and Braun shavers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I am completely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I try to contact the seller to get my refund, up until till now I have not heard from the seller.&lt;br /&gt;I went back using my traditional  razor blades.</li>
            <li> This razor is baaaaad to the bone, I couldn&#x27;t ask for more. It gives me a fast, close shave every day.</li>
            <li> Very good price so so good</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaver is one of the best all around cordless shavers out there.  I&#x27;ve used other brands and was consistently disappointed. I have sensitive skin with a harsh stubborn beard. When I switched to Panasonic linear shavers years ago, I felt they finally made a real shaver that works!  And this new replacement is even better than before.  Nanotech Technology combines with sonic vibration to get the most of 4 shaving surfaces. I opted out of the self-cleaning models, as I have limited counter space. Stil, it&#x27;s very easy to clean this shaver with soap and water.  And I enjoy over 10 days of shaving without having to plug in for a charge.  For those who&#x27;ve used a blade for long, switching to an electric shaver takes a couple of weeks - even 30 days - to \\&quot;season\\&quot; your beard to respond to an electric shave.  Many who switch to electric shavers don&#x27;t know about this break-in period. Yet, it&#x27;s critical to get the best shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Much smoother and quieter. Cuts a little better.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor. It is the second one he has purchased. I will say the replacement blades etc. are pricey, therefore we just bought a whole new razor. Very easy to clean as you can run it under hot water. Great purchase</li>
            <li> 5 stars! im 38 years old, this is very good item to me.</li>
            <li> It simply did not give me a reasonable shave--not close enough. I don&#x27;t have an especially difficult beard to cut.</li>
            <li> Great Product  Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> very quite shaver, gives a close shave with no effort at all.&lt;br /&gt;I would recomend this to a friend with no trouble at all.</li>
            <li> Item was given as a birthday gift to my father and within 2 weeks it stopped working.  At first it wouldn&#x27;t turn off, and then it wouldn&#x27;t turn on, (after being fully charged).  I returned it for a replacement for him, which is arriving this week, so hopefully it was just a fluke issue.</li>
            <li> HIgh quality shaver, and as usual Amazon had to my home on time.</li>
            <li> This is the gift for my brother, He lives in China.He loves it very much,and his friends love it too.</li>
            <li> Good shaver for the price. The Panasonic ES-RF31-S does a good job.  The battery is fantastic!  I charged it fully only once about a month ago.  I&#x27;m still shaving on that 1st charge.</li>
            <li> Very nice goods.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> I have always shaved with a blade and I guess I don&#x27;t know how to use it. I had neck surgery and thought it would work fine for a few weeks but it just won&#x27;t work for me.... burned my skin more than once wet or dry.  I guess I don&#x27;t have the patience it takes to learn to use it.  Wasted my money</li>
            <li> I have been using thirty dollar shavers for years.  Decided to try the hundred dollar variety to see if there is really a difference.  There is!!!  Much smoother and quieter.  Cuts a little better.</li>
            <li> This is the thrid shaver I have ever used, I normaly use blades cause shavers don&#x27;t give a close enough shave. This shaver definately delivers.</li>
            <li> Amazon customer service is (ultimately) great so there should be a rating system to rate Amazon! My first razor did not shave well, so I contacted Amazon, and was told to deal with the manufacturer directly, which upset me a LOT, and I conveyed that to Amazon as my point is when I buy from Amazon, versus a seller on Amazon, I should deal with Amazon, and someone fantastic not only got back to me, but also sent a replacement - that I felt made amends (though the first Amazon guy who told me to deal with Panasonic needs some upbraiding - as that was passing the buck).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this product is utterly rubbish - to the point that I&#x27;d never consider another Panasonic product!! I&#x27;m always missing &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34; with this - it doesn&#x27;t capture hair around contours of the face, softer skin of the throat (neck), around the edges of sideburns - and I&#x27;m spending a lot longer to get a clean shave, therefore left with stinging, red welts on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compares poorly not only to my older 3 blade Braun but also the humbler Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish Amazon had not replaced the old bad one with the new bad one. How do I return this as returned the first one with the original box!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously Braun can&#x27;t be beat, at least not with Panasonic ES-RF31-S (and where are the 4 blades and what do they do - they don&#x27;t cut hair)</li>
            <li> Good unit, univeral charger, easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Sales to Australia should possibly be flagged for adapter pins to suit plug configuration or a power unit with alternate plugs as for Apple products provided for international sales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an adapter in any case.</li>
            <li> Good!! Good!!! I Like Goods</li>
            <li> The shaver is great. It&#x27;s quiet and gives a close shave.</li>
            <li> works  VERY well -  only one caveat and that being the high price of r replacement foils as it contains&lt;br /&gt;the center  &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; .....The center blades themselves are NOT  available as an item which would most&lt;br /&gt;likely reduce this cost somewhat....The center blade is easily removed and reinserted  --  THIS quirk&lt;br /&gt;is pretty much like Hewlett  Packard printers  -  The printers are cheap to buy  but the replacement&lt;br /&gt;ink cartridges are very high priced !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trueman Bryer</li>
            <li> Do not like at all. After other panasonic models using in the past this shaver just bad. I am going to return it</li>
            <li> Takes a while to get used to, but otherwise it works well and the battery lasts a week plus for me and I shave every day.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver. Have been using Panasonic for 30 years. Very fast. Lots of noise with past models. This one real quite and fast. Great shave.</li>
            <li> I needed another Razor and the price was within what I wanted to pay. I had a Braun that had a bad battery. I replaced the battery after I bought the Panasonic. I use both now.</li>
            <li> + Optimum Shaving&lt;br /&gt;+ More then one week of shaving with one charged&lt;br /&gt;+ Half shaving time respect equivalent Braun model&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Expensive spare parts&lt;br /&gt;- Uncomfortable handle</li>
            <li> This appears to be the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had and I&#x27;m actually getting a shave in 3 minutes versus 5 or more, plus it&#x27;s a close shave too! I jut hope the performance continues.</li>
            <li> My last Panasonic wet/dry razor lasted over 15 years .  It&#x27;s a great shaver in the shower, nice close shave.</li>
            <li> It gave me my face skin back , i was shaving two times a day and my skin was crying now to shave its a joke .I reccommend if you have sensitive skin it would make you feel reborn, great price thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> It performs good and it worths the price for it. Easy to use and easy to clean, I love it.</li>
            <li> As a long time fan of Panasonic, I am very disappointed with this shaver. I only paid $25.00 on Amazon for it, and got what I paid for. It cuts very poorly, and the heads are huge, so I have to use my old Panasonic sa-40 to finish the spots that this shaver misses. I was amazed recently by an email from Panasonic which showed this shaver \\&quot;On sale\\&quot; for only $160.00! I suggest another model shaver than this one.</li>
            <li> My Remington foil shaver that I have been using for several years needed another set of cutters and foil - so Ithought I would try another brand for a change and after reading reviews I decided on this Panasonic shaver. The motor runs slower than the Remington and thus does not cut as fast thus requireing more time, also pulls when shaving under my nose. Actually this one was a replacement shaver after returning the first one which performed even worse. I replaced the cutters and foil for the remington and am much happier with it, it also has a much more functional trimmer.</li>
            <li> I never had a foil shaver before, always a rotary for an electric shaver. This shaver shaves closer than my old norelco rotary, and it really shaves close when using shaving gel in the shower. Very satisfied. It also gives many shaves between charges.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt the finest shaver I have ever owned. I have had a succession of Brauns, up to top of the line. This beats them all in giving a close shave. I started shaving more than 70 years ago  by borrowing my father&#x27;s single head ancient Schick. I can stop looking for the perfect shaver. I&#x27;ve found it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Electric Razor from a top Japanese brand. Close save, great design wise purchase. Very happy especially considering the price it was offered.</li>
            <li> The shaver in the back is really small. But work great other wise.</li>
            <li> Bought this hoping I could both save some water and shave a bit more quickly.  I envisionef a one pass giving me a smooth close shave.  Not so.  I don&#x27;t have a tough beard, but I have to pass over each area of my face multiple times to get even a barely acceptable result.  Don&#x27;t like it at all. Totally dissatisfied.  Can not recommend.</li>
            <li> Initially looked for a like-for-like replacement for my ageing Braun, which I really got on well with, but decided on a switch to the RF31-S after reading reviews and checking prices. Only used it for a week so far but was impressed from day 1 with smoothness of shave and quietness of operation. Replacement foils and cutters look expensive, however.</li>
            <li> At first is wasn&#x27;t too sure if I would like this razor, but after continued use I find it to give a great shave. The small handle and the larger head are comfortable and convenient- I like the clean with water feature- takes some getting use to after many &amp;#34;clean with a brush&amp;#34; razors and lastly, the battery is good for about 3 weeks of shaving before recharging.</li>
            <li> It takes me about 15 minutes to get an acceptable shave, but it may be that my beard is thicker than most.  I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding an electric shaver that is quick and good.  This isn&#x27;t it for me.</li>
            <li> My husbands razor broke so he ordered the same model, which arrived just a couple of days later. wish everything came so quickly! He&#x27;s happy with his replacement and the price.</li>
            <li> the only problem with this shaver is that it takes a long time  to shave. that is  because it does not shave long hair</li>
            <li> Horrible box condition. I did not get even an official box at all. However, product looks new, so I may use this one.</li>
            <li> Great shaver.... Love it.  Over 2 yrs now and still running strong</li>
            <li> The ES-RF31-S4 Shaver can be used wet or dry.  It can be used in the shower or in your car. Doesn&#x27;t matter because it does not work worth a spit. I have tried just about every product assist I can find and nothing seems to help. It takes so long to get a half-way decent shave that I&#x27;m afraid to try it in the shower because of the wrinkled skin and the water bill. It was suggested I use this product for at least 30 days to get used to it. HECK YES, then your return policy is null and void! So now I,m stuck with this piece of junk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to a friend, I need my friends!</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews before ordering it. Was to replace a cheap Remmington ( half the price of the panasonic) . Well, it was useless. I used it for a month and it never got better. the Remmington was far superior. Had trouble sending it back for a return . The seller argued with me telling me I was wrong and after all, it was  low-level Panasonic. They eventually gave in because they feared Amazon-not me! I replaced my Remington&#x27;s screens and blade array and have never looked back!</li>
            <li> as required by his work and he has no problem with this razor. It&#x27;s not quite as close as a plain razor shave, but he doesn&#x27;t get nicks or irritation from the Panasonic. It also saves us in shaving cream because he just uses it dry before showering.</li>
            <li> I decided to replace my 3 blade 10,000 rpm Panasonic.  I also owned a Norelco lift and cut and a Braun from my high school/ college days.&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to Panasonic, I think they do a better job then Norelco and Braun why the 4 stars.  IF you owned a preivious Panasonic you won&#x27;t really get a cleaner shave, maybe you get a few more features your older model didn&#x27;t have.  Amazon listed this as 10,000 rpm, Panasonic website said 14,000rpm.  I called Panasonic and they say they are correct.  I don&#x27;t believe them and think somebody at Panasonic had a brainfart and listed it incorrectly at 14,000rpm.  Why I feel like the engine and motor sound is just the same in everyway as my older Panasonic from 3-4 years ago that is listed at 10,000rpm.  Maybe Amazon has older model of the 10,000 rpm not the newer 14,000rpm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Postivies:&lt;br /&gt;+ Panasonic shaver are my favorite over Norelco and Brauun.  Remington is one noisery sahver and feel like a electric haircutter.&lt;br /&gt;+ Well built and nice looking.&lt;br /&gt;+ So far the battery lasted longer the the old Panasonic.  I think my older Panasonic even on the first week battery drain was faster, maybe because it had the lcd screen on even when not used.&lt;br /&gt;+ This an older model so why it is cheaper then many other Panasonic of the same &amp;#34;main&amp;#34; spec.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral&lt;br /&gt;* the 4 blades isn&#x27;t that much better then the the 3 blades to be honest.  I get the same but with the my older Panasonic, just that this one with a new blade head maybe a tad better.  I don&#x27;t get the baby soften after a cut as I did when I was in my 20s.&lt;br /&gt;* I haven&#x27;t used an old manual razer in a while.&lt;br /&gt;* You do get a closer cut if you use shaving cream for some reason.  Most of the time I don&#x27;t as I am running late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative:&lt;br /&gt;-14,000 maybe a typo on Panasonic website, it fells like my old 10,000rpm model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price you can&#x27;t beat this shaver, plus it was on sale here on amazon.  Till Norelco or Brauun prove it can do better I am staying with Panasonic as my shaver.rove it can do better I am staying with Panasonic as my shaver.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor. He hates shaving and would get razor burn but has no problems with that. The battery stays charged for a long time and charges quickly. Cleans with a squirt of soap in about 15 seconds.</li>
            <li> I mostly buy cheap electric shavers, but I found this one on sale for about half price (but still expensive to me) and decided to splurge. I am glad I did. My shave is not only closer, but also much faster than with my old razor.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic works great for me...I do not have heavy beard growth at all but definintly need to shave every day. This shaver does the trick for the price range it is in. Battery lasts a long time and it&#x27;s easy to clean and maintain. Easy to fit in a travel bag and I love the lock switch so it won&#x27;t turn on accidentally.</li>
            <li> Great razor for the money.  Ten year old Panasonic razor finally died, had to get another Panasonic.  It does not feel cheap at all.  For the money I like it.</li>
            <li> What brought me to this was the $20 dollar coupon. Now that I&#x27;ve tried it it really works well and fast. It has a comfortable feel to it wet or dry shaving. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Went 3 weeks without charging. Recharges in 1 hour. Easy to use. Cleans easily with soap and water. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Nice razor for the price</li>
            <li> Somewhat ok, not great.</li>
            <li> I forgot my electric shaver for my trip so I got this shaver at Target.  I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic Arc 3 at home and takes 4-5 minuts to shaver every day.  With extra brade (this is Arc 4 model), my shaving time is now 3-4 minuts every day.  This shaver is quiet in comparison to other Panasonic models.  I wish this shaver had a cleaning system, but other than that this shaver is the best shaver I&#x27;ve evern used.</li>
            <li> Best shaver ever. I use others Panasonic but this is the best</li>
            <li> very good as expected</li>
            <li> delivery was fine. Razor is just okay.  Quality of razor is questionable.  The razor is made of all plastics and there are some knobs and switches that don&#x27;t seem like they will hold up over time.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item from Australia. It is the first item I have bought from Amazon (USA) and very happy with price, product and delivery. The stores in Australia should be be very scared about the competition that Amazon will bring to consumers in the future (so far, you can only buy books and digital products on Amazon Australia). Ebay, who is in Australia, already has made a big impact, and if Amazon comes I think they will take over. Just be aware when buying electrical products from USA is that the voltage is different, but this shaver has a 100-240 volt rating so it works fine; you just have to use a adaptor plug (about $2). I saved about 50% compared to shops in Aus, and about 30% compared to Ebay. Shaves very well on face, just on the neck it seems to not get close, but with a razor I would always cut myself to get close and this is why I am trying a shaver, so it just may be a comprimise; blade-no stubble,bleeding neck, shaver-no blood, bit of stubble. Come on Amazon, open up down-under.</li>
            <li> Having given up on buying $300 shavers years ago, I first got the Panasonic ES8243 wet/dry shaver about two years ago. It is more expensive than this razor. It has worked great for me and I still use it. About a year ago I got the ES8249 shaver because it was on sale on Amazon. The sad fact is that my beard tends to wear down the blades of any razor, no matter which brand. That higher end Panasonic razor is still my primary one, and still works great although the blades will be replaced soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to stay with the Panasonic wet/dry shavers to keep at a relative&#x27;s house I visit regularly so that I do not have to pack it in my carry-on luggage when I travel there. When it comes to airport security, the fewer electronic and mechanical devices you have in your carry-on luggage, the better. So not wanting to spend a lot of money on a razor that I won&#x27;t use that often, I opted for this one. like my other Panasonic razors, this one has four blades and is also wet/dry capable. It also has a feature I like for travel purposes, and that is a locking mechanism so it cannot accidentally come on while packed in your carry-on luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the shaver is similar in many respects to my other (more expensive) Panasonic razors, it is also different. Instead of a liquid crystal display for the shaver status there are LED lights that show you the charge status. That is not a problem at all for me since I tend to keep my shavers charged fairly well. But there is some good news and bad news with regard to this shaver compared to my other two more expensive Panasonics. The good news is that it is a lot quieter than the other Panasonic shavers I have. Instead of the high-pitched mosquito-sounding whine, it has a more pleasant and muted throaty lower tone that does not carry very far. The bad news is, the reason it has a lower pitch is because apparently the motor drives the blades a lot slower than the shaver&#x27;s more expensive cousins that I own. From everything Ican tell, the blades of the more expensive Panasonic shavers that I own run a lot faster than this shaver&#x27;s. But considering the cost of the shaver compared to the others, you know that you have to give up something to get that lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the lower drone of the motor is more pleasing early in the morning, if you like to shave quickly, this shaver may have a little more pull on your beard than its faster and more expensive cousins. For me, on travel, a slightly slower shaver speed isn&#x27;t going to make that much difference to me especially since I will not be using it that often, only when visiting relatives. If I was going to use this shaver everyday, I probably would be a bit irritated by the fact that the blades do not run as fast as the higher end Panasonics that I own. But like their more expensive cousins, it works fine with either dry shaving, using just plain water, or the wonderful shaving cream capability that this shaver allows you to experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So based on how I plan to use this shaver, I&#x27;m very happy with it and of course love those four blades and wet/dry capability that Panasonic is famous for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, because I have two other Panasonic razors that are more powerful and more expensive, and that I am also very happy with, I would definitely choose one of them for my daily shaving needs if I had to choose between the less expensive Panasonic and one of the more expensive ones. As a bonus, both the other shavers have liquid crystal displays that give you more information about the status of the razor, plus an ultrasonic cleaning feature that is marginally useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary for this razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Low cost&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Lower pitch sound and quieter than the other Panasonic razors I own&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; No heavier than the other more expensive Panasonic razors (important to travelers)&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Same four blade system and wet/dry capability as its more expensive cousins&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Same quick charging capabilityas the more expensive models&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; A locking mechanism that helps prevent the shaver from coming on accidentally when packed in luggage&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Like my other Panasonic razors, it has a nice grip and feel and it is easy to hold and use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Blades appear to run somewhat slower than the more expensive Panasonic razors, possibly causing a bit more pull on one&#x27;s beard if shaving in a hurry&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; No Liquid Crystal display, which is more of an observation than a huge disadvantage -- that cost savings has to come from somewhere, and for me it is a non-issue, but rather an observation&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; For me, the fact that my other two Panasonic razors can share the same power supply and this one cannot is a bit of a disadvantage. But since it will reside in a another location, that is not a major issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; I feel that the tilt and swivel head on the more expensive Panasonic&#x27;s might be better articulated and superior to the one on this particular razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think it is a great razor for the money. It is ideal if you want to have Panasonic wet/dry capability at a relative&#x27;s house you visit regularly but do not want to have to transport it in your luggage while traveling each time. For shaving every day of the week however, I would opt for one of the more powerful Panasonic wet/dry razors. I feel the additional cost would be well worth it for something that you may use for 2 to 4 years or longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m rating this with four stars only because I feel that the slower speed causes a bit more pull of my beard than the more powerful Panasonic razors. For the money, however, I do believe it&#x27;s a winner, and would be excellent as an offsite or backup razor to someone who likes the Panasonic shaving system already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a blade for 50 years, largely because my whiskers tend to grow out &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; on my neck and jaw line.  My brother asked me if I still used a blade - his whiskers grow the same as mine - and he raved about this Panasonic. After one nick too many I took the leap and bought the ES-RF31-S.  I&#x27;m truly delighted with it.  I haven&#x27;t used the wet/dry feature yet but the shave is smooth and blade close.  It may take a few days to adjust to this new experience, but it is certainly worth it!</li>
            <li> Found it to do a better job than previous rotary blade razors I&#x27;ve had.  Would buy again</li>
            <li> I have been using a Braun Foil Shaver for years.  Braun was never good a cutting those long hairs.  I usually only shave 2-3 times a week so my facial hair has some length.  This shaver cut right through with very little with no problems.</li>
            <li> I had been using a Norelco, but found that it did not shave close enough. This one does the job.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing and using panasonic razors for about 20 years,this is my 7th or 8th unit and although it has 3 foils etc. it takes longer to shave with than the others Ive had.Overall I would not rate it too high compared to what I am accustomed to from panasonic.The most improved aspect is that it goes for weeks in between recharges with the lithium batteries as opposed to a few days with the nickel cadmium jammies.I would like to get a refund and buy a unit I know shaves quicker and with less foils.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver. I had the two blade version for several years and decided to buy a new one. This new 4 blade nano system is basically bigger and better then the previous unit.. Allot better to be honest!  I was very happy with the old unit but when I started using this one I realize there is a major improvement.. This shaver works great on the neck and other difficult areas.. Apply minimal pressure and you get a remarkably close save.. The pop up trimmer is a gem as well.. Very precise.  Amazing product at a ridiculously low price on Amazon.. Buy this and you will be very satisfied..</li>
            <li> Would have been a solid 4 stars, but the pop up trimmer is among the worst. I have had 4 different types of electric razors, and this is the only pop up trimmer that would pull and grab my facial hair. However, the main use of this razor for shaving is good. Shaves close and battery lasts for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> easy to clean.  mustache trimmer seems to be a bit on the small side</li>
            <li> This Panasonic gives a smooth, close shave. It works well on parts of my face that the Remingtons I used for several years always left rough. It also irritates my face much less. And, it&#x27;s very quiet. Like a purr. The last Remington I had was louder than my garbage disposal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that keeps me from giving this razor a 5 star rating is the weak beard trimmer. It&#x27;s much too narrow and underpowered. I can&#x27;t keep my sideburns straight with it. I&#x27;ve actually kept my noisy old Remington around just for its wide, powerful trimmer.</li>
            <li> Used to buy the 30 dollar ones and decided to try a more expensive one and I can see why some cost more. Great razor once your face gets used to it.</li>
            <li> Requires consistent cleaning. Does the job, but the disposible battery razor is best for me personally.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver for the money. Works almost as well dry as wet, with no electric razor neck burn like Norelco. Next time I intend to buy more power unit with a 13000 RPM motor.</li>
            <li> It is a good shaver, not great. The water cleaning method is a plus. However, was dissapointed that it only has 2 blades internally and a spring loaded foil that has 2 exterior surfaces. When I contacted Panasonic, they stated that the 2 foils are considered blades. However, it is not. The shaving speed is ordinary. It is best to soap and dry the face at least 10 minutes prior to shaving, so that the beard is ready for shaving.</li>
            <li> Gives a close and comfortable shave&lt;br /&gt;Battery indicator is very helpful plus it charges in an hour&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use,</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver, excellent quality.  Feels good does not pull.  I would recommend this Panasonic ES-RF31-S shaver. I have not tried it wet shaving yet.</li>
            <li> A good price as discounted. One of the better electric razors I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt; Not much more to say but I needed the extra words to post this....how silly.</li>
            <li> Does a superb job; charges quickly; great price; came quickly and packaged well;  did not find a warranty registration card-maybe it got tossed in error. Would reccommend this product and seller to anyone</li>
            <li> so ,every times i used it,it is a good for me,a very good for a man,....like it for a man</li>
            <li> I purchased this machine after reading somewhere online that it was highly recommended for head shaving. I have tried every angle possible and this machine just isn&#x27;t shaving right!!  Some spots it does a nice smooth job, while on most other areas it won&#x27;t do much no matter how many times or different ways I try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself works fine, but the trimmer is pretty much useless--It doesn&#x27;t cut cleanly, it&#x27;s too small/narrow, it&#x27;s difficult to use because of its location on the razor.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave close at all. Doesn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> Bought this razor for my husband last Christmas, and now I&#x27;m shopping for a new one because his stopped working after only 8 months of use! What a shame.....</li>
            <li> It was okay but could have been better. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> First ever electric razor and it seems to do a pretty good job. Dose not burn my face and seems quicker..</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES-RF31-S Men&#x27;s 4-Blade Razor  easy to use, clean-shaven, well after the hanging skin very comfortable, easy to wash. Worth buying.</li>
            <li> Not really thrilled with this purchase.  Razor only has 2 vibrating blades under the appearance of the 3 foils.  There may be something that moves for the third, but I don&#x27;t see it nor does my beard realize the results.  The 4th blade is only for the long hairs and on two days growth works pretty well.  I&#x27;ve tried the &amp;#34;wait 30 days&amp;#34; and it is not satisfactory for something costing this much in my opinion.  My previous razor was a Remington Triple Foil and shaved better, but was of a lower build quality.  Not sure what to do now and wonder if it has been too long to return this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon on the other hand was awesome on comparative pricing and delivery.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my son.</li>
            <li> This is the first wet/dry shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;m 100% pleased&lt;br /&gt;with it. It&#x27;s light and compact, and holds a good charge.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t shave good at all, i was so mad to pay that mount of money on it!!!! please don&#x27;t pay money on it because it is not worth it!</li>
            <li> As others have stated, this item is not new and comes in a plain white box. It appeared to have been cleaned, but there were several scuff marks on the handle. I guess you are not guaranteed to get a quality product just because it is &amp;#34;Fulfilled By Amazon&amp;#34;. I returned the razor with no problems.</li>
            <li> After 30+ years in the military, I had never found an electric razor that gave me a decent, close shave or one that didn&#x27;t irritate my face until buying this Panasonic razor!  I have used it exclusively for a couple of weeks while at other times interspersing it with using a regular wet razor and have never had any skin irritation.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This product was need priced right although I would buy a better quality one the next time. just doesn&#x27;t  shave very close</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed with the closeness of the shave. I must go over same area several times, and it leaves patches were it doesn&#x27;t remove hair at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because of the value more than anything.  MSRP of $159 and I paid $59.That said, I could not be more pleased with it&#x27;s performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always found electric razors to clog before I get a close shave.  Not so with the one.  Also, the different types of blades across the top gets the whiskers of different lengths so no need to &amp;#34;clean up&amp;#34; any areas with a blade when done with the electric..  Finally, I have never seen an electric clean as easily as this one does.  The only down side is that cleaning with water can rust the blades sooner that otherwise if they are not dried properly.  A cleaning dock would take care of this but so, I expect, will buying an alcohol based cleaning solution (such as that used in the Braun docks,) and keeping it by the sink.  I plan to go that route!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, if you are looking for an electric razor for under $100, this is the one to buy!</li>
            <li> I had no idea Panasonic&#x27;s razors were this good. Battery lasts forever because shaving is fast and this model has enough of a battery display to keep you informed when to charge. Great shaves, fast and close. Cons are they are a bit large, but have a large battery and whatever they are doing in that large head is working great so no real complaint. I&#x27;m now a convinced Panasonic customer, these are real values.</li>
            <li> Been using the Panasonic for a month now and totally happy with it. Better than the Braun it replaced.</li>
            <li> Very nice, cuts course beard quite well,  cleans well.</li>
            <li> Love it, the shaver has no problem removing even two or three days of beard growth, even does a good job with the neck area, very long battery life, can go at least a week without charging.</li>
            <li> I had never used an electric razor, so it is little bit dificult to compare with another models, anyhow for me it works fine, while the trimmer is useless</li>
            <li> I am just not in love with it, but it will do for now. It has a lock on the front so you can not start it by mistake</li>
            <li> Quiet and close shave from the main blades. Trimmer device floppy and weak, not up to the standards of the rest of the device.</li>
            <li> Was given as a gift to my husband... He can&#x27;t stop thanking me as he loves it so much! My son tried it out and he too says, it is a really nice razor, it gives a close shave and much better than the round ones. Now he wants one...!</li>
            <li> Loved my previous Panasonic so I got another.  The travel lock feature has already made it a great choice. Great.</li>
            <li> it worked I opened it up looking for the four blades and I found 2</li>
            <li> bought this as a replacement for a four year old panasonic elec razor.  seems less noisy.  comfortable close shaves.  recommend.  update--better than i hoped for.  give it five.</li>
            <li> Does a great job, hubby loves it. With other electric razors he would kind of alternate between blade shaving and electric shaving but with this little jewel he&#x27;s given up on blade shaving. This gives him as close a shave as the blade.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and wash. Shaving with it is a good felling and provide nice cleaning and refreshing effects.</li>
            <li> Takes off half the amount of time to shave with other razors. And a great price as well.  Purchase was a great find.</li>
            <li> I  never had an electric shaver befote and I am still getting used to it, but I like  it so far</li>
            <li> I have used Panasonic shavers for over a decade now, and find them to be the best of the best in terms of quality and ease of use. I always get a great shave out of them...but some models are most definitely better than others in their lineup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current range of shavers from Panasonic can be broken down into two catagories, 10,000 rpm or less non linear models, and 13-14,000 rpm linear shavers. the linear models are always the more expensive ones...and they are worth their asking price and then some. They shave faster and closer, with much less irritation than their slower motored counterparts, which this model is a part of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the ES-RF31-S to be a competent shaver, shaving both my head and face in around 8-9 minutes every morning, not bad, but not great either. The battery life is excellent, allowing me to go almost a full week without needing a charge, easily this models best feature. The ability to shave wet or dry also helps a lot here. Dry took an average of a minute longer to shave, but that&#x27;s acceptable if your not in a hurry. Wet is more comfortable, and required fewer passes to achieve the same results as dry, so it&#x27;s the method I recommend the most for use with this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, if you can swing it, I recommended going for the better linear models over this one, they are better all around shavers with faster and more comfortable shaves. While this isn&#x27;t a bad shaver at all, Panasonic does better, and at not too much of a higher premium.</li>
            <li> The razor works quite well. It is also quite easy to clean.  The charge reminder is easy for me to follow.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i want!</li>
            <li> It gets only a 4 star, because nothing is perfect, but this is a great replacement for my 3 blade ES-7013. I wanted to get replacement blades for the 7013, but at a cost of $40+, it didnt make sense to me to put that much money into a 2-3 year old shaver. Amazon had an $8 off coupon for this shaver, which after reviewing the specs, I jumped on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic (as does any electric shaver manufactuer) states you need 30 days before your face becomes accumlated to the electric razor. Since I already use an electric, and a Panasonic to boot, there was no waiting period to get great results. It takes just a few minutes to get a great shave, better than my ES-7013 was able to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the travel lock for the on/off switch. More than once I&#x27;ve opened my travel case to find that the ES-7013 was switched to ON, running down my shaver battery. It did offer a quick charge (5 minutes of charging for a 5 minute shave), but that was hard to do if I was on a two day trip and didnt bring my charger! I won&#x27;t have to worry about that with the ES-RF31.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the Panasonic ES-RF31 (and the ES-7013 before that) because it operates wet/dry. I do like using it in the shower, and this is a true wet/dry shaver (not like some other shavers that only let you run the shaving head under running tap water to clean the heads). And I really like the Panasonic because you do NOT need a special base to charge and clean the shaving head, like the Braun. With the Brauns, you are forced to use a special base to charge and clean the shaver, and once the cleaning product runs out, you can&#x27;t charge the razor! With the Panasonic, just a couple drops of hand soap on the head, turn it on under running water, let it foam up and rinse off. Simple and CHEAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downfall I&#x27;ve come across so far is the trimmer blade - it doesn&#x27;t seem to come out far enough from the shaver body for me to make good use out of it. The blade head seems to get in the way. I don&#x27;t typically use the trimmer on any shaver, but I do like to use it once and awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in summary - a great but not perfect shaver. I am very happy and would recommend this to anyone looking to get a solid, wet/dry shaver.y use the trimmer on any shaver, but I do like to use it once and awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in summary - a great but not perfect shaver. I am very happy and would recommend this to anyone looking to get a solid, wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this shaver! Awkward to use and doesn&#x27;t shave close at all. It is also hard to clean with a brush. The shave pro&#x27;s are a lot better for a lot less money! The charge indicator and the fact that it shut itself off when fully charged was the only features I really liked besides the slide up trimmer that&#x27;s hard to find anymore. Their single blade shavers did better for less money but not near as close a shave as the shave pro&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Gift it as a present, person loved it..</li>
            <li> luv it!  comfortable shaves well  - 1/2 the price of Cdn. stores!</li>
            <li> I purchased Panasonic shavers for over 10 years now.  The only issue is getting replacement blades and foil.  It cost almost as much as a enw shaver so I just buy a never shaver every year and a half.</li>
            <li> Recently, the pop up trimmer on my Braun shaver broke off. I&#x27;ve found that pop up trimmers are a weak design and wanted one with a slide up trimmer instead.  I searched amazon  and found none so I e-mailed panasonic directly.  They wrote back and said that they didn&#x27;t make a mens shaver with a slide up trimmer.  I then searched some more and found this unit  WITH A SLIDE UP TRIMMER.  I ordered it on christmas eve and got it by friday.  After charging it and using it for the first time I can say I wish I had this shaver years ago.  My braun never shaved as good as this one, it always missed something.  Also, my braun came with the added self cleaning stand. The refills for it were $11 for 2 and only lasted about 3-4 weeks each and the cleaning cycle never totally cleaned it.  I thought it would be an added benefit but it just made it more expensive and never helped its performance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a couple  of earlier models and found them to give a close shave for about 6months ,though blade kits last about 10 uses.&lt;br /&gt;This unit starts out being seemingly less sharp. and I really dislike not having a stand for charging.  I bought Panasonic on the suggestion of a friend to shave not just my face but my head  using it in my shower.and originally found it satisfactory for about a year.As for now I am not particulary happy.</li>
            <li> Husband says pretty good for $60. Not as good as his higher end panasonic shaver but it does the job with zero irritation and seems to hold a charge for  a long time. NOTE: THE CHARGER THIS COMES WITH IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MOST OTHER PANASONIC SHAVERS.</li>
            <li> Panasonic really made some nice and high quality even in their smaller products. I bought this Shaver when it was on sales&lt;br /&gt;for my son. He likes it so much. It has very long battery life and there are no problem in using.</li>
            <li> I bought this 3 weeks ago and love it. I have only used rotary shavers in the past. What a mistake. Love the close shave and long battery life of this unit I&#x27;ve always had a problem with skin sensitivity and rashes after using. rotary shavers. Not anymore. I have no irritation sensitivity what so ever since using this shaver. Wish I would have converted years ago. I would highly recommend this shaver to anyone</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with the degree of difficulty it takes to clean the razor head and shaver cutting block. The head must be completely taken off the razor and clean every one of the foils independently. No head cleaning brush was provided and I am using the one designed for my previous shaver. I would not recommend this razor for purchase.</li>
            <li> Works great, quiet and fast in the morning. Gets tough to reach areas easily and with a close shave. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> So far no good, takes forever to shave and not even close to my old remington electric took usual amount of time to shave and still needed to shave again, do not buy!</li>
            <li> Works good . My dad like it. It shaves clean. Good deal. Might get another one for my selfself next month</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been awesome! The battery life on this razor is incredible! I&#x27;ve been wanting an electric razor for some time and the Panasonic was a great choice!</li>
            <li> God, I should stop reading &amp;#34;paid reviewers&amp;#34; posting bunch of bull crap about how amazing this product is.&lt;br /&gt;It is cheaply made although it commands big money. Shaving is nowhere close to what most reviewers are claiming. It may be because most of them might have been a Mongolian race (with few hair on their face or wherever). I&#x27;ve got more than few and I am having to use a razor after using this shaver. So that should tell you how &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; this product really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if I can return it and get my money back???</li>
            <li> good price and best performance</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for a month now really like it.  It shaves close and even closer if shaving wet.  Great price.</li>
            <li> It could shave a bit closer but over all pretty good.  I still clean up with a razor but faster</li>
            <li> I was really surprised how well this shaver worked after reading all of the reviews before I purchased this shaver.  This is the second Panasonic shaver I have owned and this one is so much better than my old one.  The 4 blade head does a good job cutting my whiskers and it is easy on my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the saying \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot; goes with electric shavers but it seems that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two Norelco&#x27;s and one Remington, I gave up using an electric shaver and the problem was that they were not powerful enough.  Shoot with the three it took forever to shave and I could do a faster and better job using a Gillette handheld razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem was I got tired of buying expensive blades and I thought that I&#x27;d give it ONE more shot with an electric razor.  After all, I once had a Remington Razor (many moons ago) and I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this at Amazon and with the good reviews, I decided to try it.  The end result is:  I like it though a little more umph would make it better.  But overall, it does a nice job and I like that when I look in the mirror and see the stubbles growing out of my face (as Bill Cosby would say), I can quickly reach for this razor and get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Them little facial hairs just seem to appear suddenly and in no time at all.</li>
            <li> Four blades was unnecessary and the back trimmer started acting up acfter just 3 weeks so I bought a different panasonic razor which I love</li>
            <li> works great as long as you don&#x27;t skip a day or two shaving-- then I go back to using a razor.</li>
            <li> my favorite item!! very nice!!</li>
            <li> Except for the trimmer, I would have rated the shaver at least a 4.  However, I frequently go 3 or more days between shaves, and the trimmer&#x27;s narrow width and angle of attack leave much to be desired.  Being able to clean both the blades and the shaver head with running water is great.  They dry quickly with a handheld hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I have not had it long enough to say anything more than it has worked fine and does a good job. Shaves clean and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great shaver and less noisy than the older model I had. Very happy with it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would have given 5 stars but a little piece broke off that is supposed to help the side burn trimmer thing work. I never use that function so it is not a big deal for me.</li>
            <li> I cannot get a decent shave with this razor. I&#x27;ve tried shaving twice as long as my old rotary razor, but it doesn&#x27;t make any difference. And it pulls hair occasionally. Yesterday, after a bad one, I pulled the razor away. And there was a hair in the blades, waving its little follicle at me. Man, that hurts!</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for 2 months now, and I have been very happy with it. It gives me a nice close shave, and is an improvement over previous electric razors. I have not had a Panasonic razor before, but I would be happy to recommend this one. I have also found that the battery life is very good, going 3 weeks between charges. It is also quite quiet, given that it operates at high speed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as good as I thought. Although, it&#x27;s much faster than shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son-in-law. He said he loves it and that it him a closer shave than any blade he&#x27;s ever tried.</li>
            <li> This razor is a great all purpose shaver.  It charges quickly and holds a charge through four full shaves.  It does a great job on longer hairs, good for Me since I refuse to shave every day!  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Having always used a blade, I recently bought the ESRF31 and I have to say that its a great product. I haven&#x27;t had such a quick and close shave in really long. Its easy to use but it takes time for your skin to get used to it. When turned on, the shaver isn&#x27;t loud at all.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be returning to the blade any time soon.</li>
            <li> It is a good quality of product.</li>
            <li> Good product, the package came well protected and very fast. It works well and it helps to shave the bear faster.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quality is also very good compare with its price. Design is attractive, and the color is my favorite.too</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaver is one of the best shavers I have ever used.Very powerful, and most important, very cost-effective.&lt;br /&gt;I like it.</li>
