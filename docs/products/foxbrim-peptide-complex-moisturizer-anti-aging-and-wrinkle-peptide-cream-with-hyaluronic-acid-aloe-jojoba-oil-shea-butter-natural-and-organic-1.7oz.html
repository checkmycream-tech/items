            <li>But I do love the way this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I love this solution.</li>
            <li>like this moisturizer, use mostly at night, works likes reviews say.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so rich and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I was able to try it, to help someone who is so self conscious of the marks and have the appearance of them disappear is great and life changing.</li>
            <li>The texture of this product feels pretty good and not greasy.  </li>

            <li>Powerful Peptides stimulate collagen production increasing skin thickness and effectively refining the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Delivery was super fast and great quality.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when the company allowed me to try this product in return for a review because I&#x27;m always looking for a good facial moisturizer and can never seem to find a good one.</li>
            <li>easy to apply but</li>
            <li>The cream comes in an easy to use pump system.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is completely scent free and has a great feel to it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent at all, which I prefer.</li>
            <li>Refines appearance of wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>Non-irritating, fragrance free and with a composition of more than 69% organic ingredients, your skin will soak up all the benefits of this exceptional natural moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Superior</li>
            <li>Super lightweight!</li>
            <li>This would be a great before bed facial serum</li>
            <li>I like how my face feels, smooth</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with my last moisturizer</li>
            <li>I have plump glowing skin after applying and it feels smooth all day.</li>
            <li>the pores are much smaller and skin feels great and refreshed after application.</li>
            <li>Feels really light on my skin.</li>
            <li>Since it contains peptides, hyaluronic acid and jojoba oil it does a fantastic job at moisturizing.</li>
            <li>If it truly has the ingredients it claims ,I guess its good to use but don&#x27;t expect your wrinkles or soft lines to diminish like they say it won&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li>Perfect and suitable for dry and even sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited I found his product for a gift.</li>
            <li>Formulation - Bringing you a unique blend of hand-picked ingredients.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are all natural and some organic, making this an excellent facial cream.  </li>
            <li>I was going to hold out for at least two weeks but from what I&#x27;m seeing already I feel comfortable that this is good stuff!!!!  </li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel nice and soft!</li>
            <li>BUT I am looking forward to making this my full time moisturizer - morning and night.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it came very well packed</li>
            <li>They will refund your full purchase price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my opinion foxbrim has amazing quality, you can tell right away they use high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>and I noticed there wasn&#x27;t much of a smell which is a good sign for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is already starting to look a lot more healthy since I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
            <li>IT IS NOT GREASY AND IT PENETRATES THE SKIN QUICKLY .  </li>
            <li>The moisturizer is a soft cream, which makes it very easy to apply onto your skin.</li>
            <li>This was my very first product from this company</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very pleased with this product and definitely will buy it again.</li>
            <li>and I love trying new ones out but have never purchased moisturizer on line before</li>
            <li>I do have very oily skin, so I found this to be more moisturizing than I needed, but my grandma absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>I instantly loved the way it made my face feel smooth and supple on first use, and the results over the past couple of weeks alone have continued to smooth my skin significantly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Sooooooo pleased, loving the moisturizer, a little is all you need.</li>
            <li>It is light and absorb fast.</li>
            <li>The shea butter content helps calm my skin sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>Honest review for deep discount...</li>
            <li>I really wish i could purchase this in a larger bottle because it is so good.</li>
            <li>Love that the ingredients are natural and organic.  </li>
            <li>I have said this before about packaging, it seems to not really matter if the product is great, but the extra 5 seconds it can save me in my beauty routine if it&#x27;s well packaged and easy to dispense the right amount, really is a biggie for me.</li>
            <li>Peptide Complex a Moisterizer will leave your skin feeling so much more amazing then ever.</li>
            <li>Summers here are hot and dry and this is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This lotion smells great, goes on easily, and I have definitely noticed my skin being brighter after just a few weeks.</li>
            <li>My skin looks smooth and soft after using it, it also keeps my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it highly - Fast Shipping too !</li>
            <li>It is clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>first week used it once a day on the wrinkles on my forehead, saw no change.</li>
            <li>I really like!</li>
            <li>so I was interested to get my hands on the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>First thing I like to do is smell any products I&#x27;m putting on my face</li>
            <li>it makes my skin feel soft and supple and helps to promote a wrinkle free face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Complete Benefits - Expect the most from your daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Really moisturizers my skin!</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is nice and thick but goes on really smooth.  </li>
            <li>The Peptide Complex Moisturizer was delivered in protective packaging and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer was exactly as described on product page.  </li>
            <li>so it felt only right to get a moisturiser to go with it, its not sticky or greasy it absorbs into my face quickly.</li>
            <li>The specs: Hydrate &amp; Repair - Enjoy wonderfully delicate moisture with Hyaluronic Acid + Jojoba Oil and refreshing botanical actives.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating (my skin is getting dryer as the years go by).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was fortunate enough to come across a discount code that allowed me to purchase this product-</li>
            <li>This product really did nothing for my face or skin.</li>
            <li>, I have to say I have used this for about four days now morning and night to really give it a try</li>
            <li>The moisturizer absorbs to my skin almost immediately and very soothing.</li>
            <li>Thanks, leah</li>
            <li>but i feel that not as much as this one.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t know if it does much.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft, and I am starting to see more glowed youthful skin as I am using it.</li>
            <li>I really am happy with it so far, it spreads nicely, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I love the way this product feels after you apply it, it leave no residue and at the same time is not like other products that kind of evaporate after applying, is hard to describe the feeling</li>
            <li>So I purchased this in need of a new moisturizer</li>
            <li>These days, it seems like a new wrinkle shows up every day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and rich but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>a few weeks I noticed the tautness, texture and overall appearance of the skin look amazing and glowing..</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it - EVEN if you have sensitive skin with conditions such as dermatitis (such as myself).</li>
            <li>My face is sensitive to a lot, and I am loving the way this complex moisturizer makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>and I get a dry flaky skin on my face a lot, and with using this product, it has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>okay not sure I will purchase again</li>
            <li>My face is so soft after just one use!</li>
            <li>Comprehensive anti-aging benefits with regular application will give you a radiant and positively refreshed complexion.</li>
            <li>This summer I have noticed my facial skin drying out more and feeling a little beat by the sun.</li>
            <li>it seemed a bit more dull before.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy, yes, I&#x27;m concerned about my skin, AND - my skin is extremely sensitive and prone to break outs.</li>
            <li>Foxbrim Peptide Complex Moisturizer - Premium Face Moisturizer, 1.7oz:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this moisturizer for a couple of weeks now, and I absolutely love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do like the soft texture Of the creme.</li>
            <li>/&gt;especially when used directly after a bath or shower.  </li>
            <li>So far seems to be working well.</li>
            <li>I was surprised with the immediate effect.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but the this moisturizer doesnâ€™t cause any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>My skin is silky soft.  </li>
            <li>There is no detectable fragrance or ingredients that will upset my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is both oily and starting to wrinkle (really??</li>
            <li>Professional packaging.  </li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>and I rarely buy something over the counter that really works, but I must say that my skin looks clearer and brighter in the few weeks that I&#x27;ve been using this product.</li>
            <li>The Serums actually were a decent size</li>
            <li>Complete benefits from your moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight &amp; Effective - A beautifully delicate matte lotion, you&#x27;ll find Peptide Complex Moisturizer to be just the right amount of nourishment for your skin.</li>
            <li>I have problems with dry skin on my face and its just in certain places.</li>
            <li>I love this peptide complex moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Like the bottle with the pump action, just the right amount so nothing is wasted.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for a little over a week so haven&#x27;t really noticed much difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried some of there other products and they are really wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also begun to notice a reduction in dark spots, uneven skin tone, and fine lines.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to state effectiveness, but I like the product so far.</li>

            <li> I was so excited when the company allowed me to try this product in return for a review because I&#x27;m always looking for a good facial moisturizer and can never seem to find a good one.</li>
            <li> easy to apply but</li>

            <li> the pores are much smaller and skin feels great and refreshed after application.</li>
            <li> Feels really light on my skin.</li>
            <li> Since it contains peptides, hyaluronic acid and jojoba oil it does a fantastic job at moisturizing.</li>
            <li> If it truly has the ingredients it claims ,I guess its good to use but don&#x27;t expect your wrinkles or soft lines to diminish like they say it won&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> Perfect and suitable for dry and even sensitive skin types.</li>

            <li> Like the bottle with the pump action, just the right amount so nothing is wasted.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a little over a week so haven&#x27;t really noticed much difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some of there other products and they are really wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to state effectiveness, but I like the product so far.</li>
            <li> The white cream is how I like my daytime moisturizer step to be; thick enough that it doesn&#x27;t run but not too heavy and easy to spread.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any actual results.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it as frequently as the peptide serum, only because I&#x27;m trying to use up another one I had previously.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for quality products that help with my complex skin care issues that change but the one thing that doesn&#x27;t is the sensitivity and poc marks that I have from severe cystic acne as an adolescent and into young adult.</li>
            <li> And do nothing about the poc marks, which being a woman of color makes difficult to even do any sort of laser, dermatologist interventions for smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> She said it made her skin feel soft and very moisturized, without being oily, heavy or thick.  </li>
            <li> I use these every morning as a part of my daily routine and these haven&#x27;t let me down yet.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve only used a small bit of the bottle, with daily</li>
            <li> I was going through one of my very dry stages, my hormones have been wrecking havoc on my face.</li>
            <li> but when i got this i was ultimately disappointed in it&#x27;s size, pretty much this stuff is $20 for 1 oz.</li>
            <li> It also sinks into my skin after washing, toner and serum.</li>
            <li> I have started to see a difference on my skin its getting less dry and as soon as i stop using it</li>
            <li> and all other items from the  Foxbrim line.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely picky when it comes to skin care products.</li>
            <li> I have tried other FoxBrim serums before</li>
            <li> I have purchased other brands of moisturizers and they help</li>
            <li> but it says product not eligible for return due to</li>
            <li> Skin seems slightly smoother.</li>
            <li> always when using something new for my face, I am a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> and I see a little difference in my skin .</li>
            <li> I had a chance to review this at a heavily discounted price, and I have no</li>
            <li> After using this for a few days, I did feel like my skin was smoother than before, so</li>
            <li> this moisturizer did not feel heavy of greasy whatsoever.</li>
            <li> have noticed no difference in my skin too bad with all the positive reviews</li>
            <li> It comes in a pump container and all you need is a small amount.</li>
            <li> My crows  feet and small wrinkles around my eyes are gone, along with the line that occurs from sleeping  on my  side .  </li>
            <li> However the price isn&#x27;t bad for a typical facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use the peptide complex serum</li>
            <li> We find the Peptide complex seems to replace moisture,&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not fair),</li>
            <li> I like skin products to leave a fragrant scent behind, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> My wrinkles seem to be fading away slowly!</li>
            <li> It absorbs in minutes and doesn&#x27;t leave any stickiness or greasiness behind.</li>
            <li> Foxbrim stands behind their products with a no questions asked guarantee.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I just had 60th birthday.</li>
            <li> it is VERY small compared to how it looks!!</li>
            <li> Not That Bad of a product, I like it.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, yes, I&#x27;m concerned about my skin, AND - my skin is extremely sensitive and prone to break outs. So far this product has been great. I strongly recommend it - EVEN if you have sensitive skin with conditions such as dermatitis (such as myself).</li>

            <li> Foxbrim Peptide Complex Moisturizer - Premium Face Moisturizer, 1.7oz:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this moisturizer for a couple of weeks now, and I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;It definitely works as an anti-aging cream. I instantly loved the way it made my face feel smooth and supple on first use, and the results over the past couple of weeks alone have continued to smooth my skin significantly. I&#x27;ve also begun to notice a reduction in dark spots, uneven skin tone, and fine lines. And I&#x27;ve only used a small bit of the bottle, with daily applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fortunate enough to come across a discount code that allowed me to purchase this product-</li>
            <li> I was an esthetician for 18 years and I rarely buy something over the counter that really works, but I must say that my skin looks clearer and brighter in the few weeks that I&#x27;ve been using this product.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any actual results.  I&#x27;ll update soon.</li>
            <li> Not That Bad of a product, I like it. Seem&#x27;s to smell nice &amp; ton of product</li>
            <li> This moisturizer feels really good. It&#x27;s thick and rich but absorbs quickly. I haven&#x27;t used it as frequently as the peptide serum, only because I&#x27;m trying to use up another one I had previously. BUT I am looking forward to making this my full time moisturizer - morning and night.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My skin has felt the difference. It is clear and smooth. I did receieve this item to review but I love it .</li>
            <li> with all the great reviews I thought id try it. first week used it once a day on the wrinkles on my forehead, saw no change. Tried it the second week twice a day on my forehead, again I saw no improvment. i am now on  my third week and my skin still looks the same. I&#x27;m 42 dont smoke or drink i eat healthy and get plenty of sleep so this product while it feels creamy does not erase winkles as some have stated... don&#x27;t believe the Hipe. However the price isn&#x27;t bad for a typical facial moisturizer. I do like the soft texture Of the creme. the reason I&#x27;m giving this a two is because i did not notice that this product did what they claim it would. Feels like a regular moisturizer. If it truly has the ingredients it claims ,I guess its good to use but don&#x27;t expect your wrinkles or soft lines to diminish like they say it won&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> Honest review for deep discount...this sorta made my face skin oily. .Its easy to apply but within 2hrs of it being on my face ...I looked like I rubbed vaseline on it This would be a great before bed facial serum.....Its okay not sure I will purchase again</li>
            <li> The Peptide Complex Moisturizer was delivered in protective packaging and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer was exactly as described on product page.  We purchased the Peptide Complex&lt;br /&gt;in a promotion for testing and review.  We find the Peptide complex seems to replace moisture,&lt;br /&gt;especially when used directly after a bath or shower.  Our skin is exhibiting a healthy glow,&lt;br /&gt;where it seemed a bit more dull before.  Excellent for my sensitive skin, too.</li>
            <li> This product really did nothing for my face or skin. It feels ok going on but&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed no difference in my skin too bad with all the positive reviews</li>
            <li> So I purchased this in need of a new moisturizer and I love trying new ones out but have never purchased moisturizer on line before, I have to say I have used this for about four days now morning and night to really give it a try and I&#x27;m very happy with it. My skin feels so soft, and I am starting to see more glowed youthful skin as I am using it. I really am happy with it so far, it spreads nicely, a little goes a long way! Its very smooth! I wanted it too for more of an anti aging and to help with un even skin tone so I will continue using this and see what the outcome is! I can&#x27;t wait to see!</li>
            <li> Nice and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Your request to review a product has been approved!</li>

            <li> I like this product, it makes me feel nice &amp; smooth</li>
            <li> I like how my face feels, smooth</li>
            <li> Another amazing product from Foxbrim.  Great moisturizer, not greasy or sticky, works for&lt;br /&gt;both morning under makeup, and at night for a great clean feeling face.  I recommend this&lt;br /&gt;product and all other items from the  Foxbrim line.  Review for amztrader.</li>
            <li> So far seems to be working well. Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to state effectiveness, but I like the product so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely picky when it comes to skin care products. I wasn&#x27;t happy with my last moisturizer so I decided to try this product based on the reviews. I was surprised with the immediate effect. It has no scent and isn&#x27;t greasy. The packaging is gender-neutral and I convinced my husband to start using it as well. I only wish it had SPF protection in it.</li>
            <li> This summer I have noticed my facial skin drying out more and feeling a little beat by the sun. this product does a very good job moisturizing and restoring your skins softness. I really like! Purchased thru promotion for honest evaluation.</li>
            <li> I was given an opportunity to review this and it&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s light and nongreasy which I love.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of the product</li>
            <li> I had a chance to review this at a heavily discounted price, and I have no regrets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I absolutely love how there was a removable cap, and how easy it was to pump out the moisturizer and into my hands. The moisturizer is a soft cream, which makes it very easy to apply onto your skin. It absorbs in minutes and doesn&#x27;t leave any stickiness or greasiness behind. I wished it would have had a stronger scent, because honestly, I did not smell anything, which was kind of a downfall for me. I like skin products to leave a fragrant scent behind, if you know what I mean. After using this for a few days, I did feel like my skin was smoother than before, so I guess it&#x27;s working. This was my very first product from this company and I have to say that I was absolutely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it&#x27;s fragrance free. The moisturizer absorbs to my skin almost immediately and very soothing. Hydrate my skin but not oily so no break outs.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  Summers here are hot and dry and this is amazing.  My skin looks and feels better.</li>
            <li> I have tried other FoxBrim serums before so I was interested to get my hands on the moisturizer. The cream comes in an easy to use pump system. I have said this before about packaging, it seems to not really matter if the product is great, but the extra 5 seconds it can save me in my beauty routine if it&#x27;s well packaged and easy to dispense the right amount, really is a biggie for me. FoxBrim delivered! First thing I like to do is smell any products I&#x27;m putting on my face and I noticed there wasn&#x27;t much of a smell which is a good sign for my sensitive skin. The white cream is how I like my daytime moisturizer step to be; thick enough that it doesn&#x27;t run but not too heavy and easy to spread. It is also moisturizing but not oily which is key for daytime. It also sinks into my skin after washing, toner and serum. I found a few of the pumps was all i needed to cover my whole face and neck, which I never skip. I have plump glowing skin after applying and it feels smooth all day. *Discount given for unbiased opinion. I would recommend the product and order from the seller again.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it came very well packed and I see a little difference in my skin . Thanks, leah</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 25 so I don&#x27;t have very many fine lines or wrinkles yet, but I would definitely like to keep it that way and this stuff helps. My skin is already starting to look a lot more healthy since I&#x27;ve been using this. I wear it underneath my primer and makeup after washing my face and I find it to be a really nice moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent at all, which I prefer. It shakes up into my skin nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling oily or greasy. I always know I&#x27;m getting a great quality product when it comes to Foxbrim. I&#x27;ve tried some of there other products and they are really wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great, goes on easily, and I have definitely noticed my skin being brighter after just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I really wish i could purchase this in a larger bottle because it is so good. I have problems with dry skin on my face and its just in certain places. I have purchased other brands of moisturizers and they help but i feel that not as much as this one. It comes in a pump container and all you need is a small amount. I was worried that it would be greasy but to my surprise its not yet i can feel how my skin drinks it in and it leaves me with a dewy look. I have started to see a difference on my skin its getting less dry and as soon as i stop using it i can see it starting to come back.</li>
            <li> I love love love love love love LOVE this stuff. I was hesitant on using it as I was using part of a program and never had heard of Foxbrim before that time. I am always looking for quality products that help with my complex skin care issues that change but the one thing that doesn&#x27;t is the sensitivity and poc marks that I have from severe cystic acne as an adolescent and into young adult. No matter what I did, it was too oil, not enough hydrating or would make me break out. And do nothing about the poc marks, which being a woman of color makes difficult to even do any sort of laser, dermatologist interventions for smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks I noticed the tautness, texture and overall appearance of the skin look amazing and glowing.. the pores are much smaller and skin feels great and refreshed after application. I am so glad I was able to try it, to help someone who is so self conscious of the marks and have the appearance of them disappear is great and life changing.</li>
            <li> Great to use for non greasy and effective skin care. I like that it makes my skin feel soft and supple and helps to promote a wrinkle free face.</li>
            <li> Feels very good going on. Skin seems slightly smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited I found his product for a gift. It looks nice and fancy and the ingredients look great!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer .  It does what it says it does. My crows  feet and small wrinkles around my eyes are gone, along with the line that occurs from sleeping  on my  side .  I will  definitely  purchase  this  item  again .</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I just had 60th birthday. These days, it seems like a new wrinkle shows up every day. I just started using this product, and Iâ€™m already very impressed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this product:&lt;br /&gt;-- I have sensitive skin, but the this moisturizer doesnâ€™t cause any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;-- It absorbs almost immediately without any greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;-- Because it leaves a matte finish, I can use it as a makeup primer.&lt;br /&gt;-- The shea butter content helps calm my skin sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;-- My skin already feels  softer.&lt;br /&gt;---The product smells pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;-- Foxbrim stands behind their products with a no questions asked guarantee. They will refund your full purchase price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that it contained even a low SPF factor. But itâ€™s not a deal breaker because my foundation does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product and definitely will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel nice and soft!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is completely scent free and has a great feel to it.  The ingredients are all natural and some organic, making this an excellent facial cream.  I do have very oily skin, so I found this to be more moisturizing than I needed, but my grandma absolutely loves it!  She said it made her skin feel soft and very moisturized, without being oily, heavy or thick.  The packaging is very nice for this bottle too!</li>
            <li> I love the way this moisturizer feels.  My skin is silky soft.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> this stuff feels good and makes my skin look better...that&#x27;s all I need.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product feels after you apply it, it leave no residue and at the same time is not like other products that kind of evaporate after applying, is hard to describe the feeling but this is definitely the moisturizer to beat.  I wish it was a bit more affordable though.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is weightless and sinks completely into your skin as soon as you begin to rub it in. There is no detectable fragrance or ingredients that will upset my sensitive skin. My skin is both oily and starting to wrinkle (really?? Not fair), and this doesn&#x27;t leave a film or clog my pores. This does contain a &amp;#34;silk protein amino acid blend&amp;#34;, so if you are vegan, look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received a discount on this p product to enable me to try it and give my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I use this every night and feels so good on my face.</li>
            <li> Love that the ingredients are natural and organic.  Goes on smooth, non greasy and absorbs quickly, Love how it makes my face feel. Like the bottle with the pump action, just the right amount so nothing is wasted.  Professional packaging.  Will continue to use and recommend</li>
            <li> great moisturizer, too pricey though</li>
            <li> The texture of this product feels pretty good and not greasy.  I just don&#x27;t know if it does much.</li>

            <li> so so... does not do what it claims i try to return it but it says product not eligible for return due to I miss the cut off date which i disagree because base on the sellers return policy i think we have 60 days to try it &amp; it hasnt been 60 days yet. maybe it worked for some ppl but it didnt work for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  I love how it feels when I put it on my face, and it has been helping my skin look clearer and more youthful!</li>
            <li> I use this moisturizer after i cleansed and tone, then i aplied this product and my face feels amazing. Since it contains peptides, hyaluronic acid and jojoba oil it does a fantastic job at moisturizing. Another thing i noticed is thay this moisturizer did not feel heavy of greasy whatsoever. In my opinion foxbrim has amazing quality, you can tell right away they use high quality ingredients. These are my honest opinions im reviewing this product.</li>
            <li> My face is so soft after just one use! Really moisturizers my skin! I will continue to use &amp; purchase! Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I got this product for testing and reviewing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always when using something new for my face, I am a bit skeptical. My face is sensitive to a lot, and I am loving the way this complex moisturizer makes my face feel. I have type2 diabetes and I get a dry flaky skin on my face a lot, and with using this product, it has helped tremendously. I am so happy with it that I will be ordering more as soon as I run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a little over a week so haven&#x27;t really noticed much difference. But I do love the way this makes my skin feel. I do wish it  had an SPF in it though but no big deal.</li>
            <li> After the mask, and toner, I follow with this moisturizer.  It&#x27;s non greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this solution. I use these every morning as a part of my daily routine and these haven&#x27;t let me down yet. For about /2 the price of stores this is a great option. Delivery was super fast and great quality.</li>
            <li> I was going through one of my very dry stages, my hormones have been wrecking havoc on my face. I used this stuff along with the Hydrolic Acid serum and the Vitamin C serum and after one day my face looks 10 years younger + ALL of the moisture is restored in my face. The only downside to this order is the size of the bottle you receive, for $20 a bottle it is VERY small compared to how it looks!! The Serums actually were a decent size but when i got this i was ultimately disappointed in it&#x27;s size, pretty much this stuff is $20 for 1 oz. So it better be good right!!</li>
            <li> I gave five stars at this time because of delivery service and already seeing improvements with only using three days now.  I was going to hold out for at least two weeks but from what I&#x27;m seeing already I feel comfortable that this is good stuff!!!!  Sooooooo pleased, loving the moisturizer, a little is all you need.</li>
            <li> Absorbs well, no scent, lessens the dryness of my skin under my eyes</li>
            <li> like this moisturizer, use mostly at night, works likes reviews say.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS MOISTURIZER!!  IT IS NOT GREASY AND IT PENETRATES THE SKIN QUICKLY .  I CAN ALREADY SEE A DIFFERENCE IN MY COMPLEXION.</li>
            <li> WOW. I&#x27;m using this at night over my serum.  It&#x27;s so rich and feels amazing.</li>
