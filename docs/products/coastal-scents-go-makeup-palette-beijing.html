            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced a chalky shade as of this date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the pigmentation is not that great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>For the price, you get a great variety of colors.  </li>
            <li>If it didn&#x27;t work great on eyebrows I would give it a lower star.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>great neutral colors for school.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great value for the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as great as I was hoping.</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>a go- its a great price</li>
            <li>And I love it!!</li>
            <li>Love it though!!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing eye pallet!</li>
            <li>Oh and the price is amazing too!</li>
            <li>It really is a great product for a good price.</li>
            <li>very nice and good quality</li>
            <li>I have no idea how it got on there, but anyways the product was fine and the color swashes seemed great!</li>
            <li>Everyone went and on about how bright and pigmented they are.</li>
            <li>I bought this palette because I loved the idea of naming shade palettes after citites, and it seemed like a good price.</li>
            <li>Colors are fantastic and pigmentation is excellent.</li>
            <li>this might be good for a teenager.</li>
            <li>Its medium good quality, has quite a bit of fallout, and you will need an eyeshadow primer for it to look really good.</li>
            <li>They blend well and the compact has a good size mirror for application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as MAC shadows but its up there.</li>
            <li>I had heard good things about Coastal Scents from one of the beauty gurus I follow on YouTube</li>
            <li>Some of the colors don&#x27;t have good pigmentation and one of the browns I used ended up just looking like I had dirt smudged on my eyelid.</li>
            <li>The mirror is a good size</li>
            <li>With the good sized mirror and the versatility of the colors--all I need to add is some concealer, lip gloss and mascara as well as an applicator</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good size</li>
            <li>I loved using this for smokey eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>The colors are really nice, and with any mix of them, it gives a great look for any event, show,  or gathering.</li>
            <li>It is a good neutral palette to take with you for dance gigs and the like.</li>
            <li>Good colors.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I found something cheap and awesome that I am not allergic to!</li>
            <li>Fortunately Amazon.com&#x27;s return policy is really awesome.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m at work, I don&#x27;t have time to apply more makeup so this is great.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Great palette, love the colors.</li>
            <li>Love these eyeshadows, very nice colors and quality.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast and packaging was perfect.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>For a first impression of Coastal Scents I&#x27;m not too impressed.</li>
            <li>I love this palette!</li>
            <li>I lost all my makeup, which where mostly MAC!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this!</li>
            <li>They are about the size of a dime, but the colors are absolutely stunning!</li>
            <li>Just lovely!</li>
            <li>Ulta&#x27;s eyeshadows are way more pigmented than this!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;the colors are great perfect pigments and you barely need to dab your brush in the powder.</li>
            <li>The quality is amazing and the colors are soooo pigmented.</li>
            <li>Cheap packaging great eye shadow</li>
            <li>and that is so amazing.</li>
            <li>it is so convenient because of the size and then packaging which is amazing, not to mention how amazingly pigmented they are.</li>
            <li>They are amazing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall though I think the pros outwear the cons and this palette is AMAZING for those on a budget.</li>
            <li>I the eyeshadow quality itself seems to be nice.</li>
            <li>the colors go on very pigmented and complement my skin perfectly.  </li>
            <li>nice</li>
            <li>The pigmentation is kind of lacking</li>
            <li>Colors are exactly how they look gorgeous colors and for a great bargain.</li>
            <li>Being a cosmetologist, I look for exceptional quality and I am telling you this stuff is like the brands you pay for at the cosmetic counters, and really goes on like MAC!!!!  </li>
            <li>but I also bought the Moscow version and liked the palette better.</li>
            <li>It would be a much better product if it had either a eyeshadow applicator or a place to put your own applicator.</li>
            <li>I love love LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and very pigmented.  </li>
            <li>The color pigment is gorgeous and true to color.</li>
            <li>and the wrapper was very secure.</li>
            <li>Even more amazing the product was still as bright as when I first applied.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the colors in this palette.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in-love with the colour selection on this palette, the jewel type shades are great for my caramel complexion.  </li>
            <li>and i finally decided i needed some more neutrals because it&#x27;s just the perfect look for school and stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You could literally take this compact on vacation and need nothing else beyond mascara and a couple of lip colors, leaving more room for clothes and souveniers, and what&#x27;s not to love about that?!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>how much i LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more palettes :)</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t know better I would think it cost about twenty-five dollars.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product.</li>
            <li>I love the</li>
            <li>These colors are perfect about an equal amount of matte and sparkle, not chalky.  </li>
            <li>Want to try more.</li>
            <li>You have many ranges of the &amp;#34;smokey eye&amp;#34; with this set.  </li>
            <li>just okay.</li>
            <li>i love the mix of colors and</li>
            <li>so I love it.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use primer, but you should always use primer anyways.</li>
            <li>LOVE them both.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented and great eyeshadow colors!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Most are neutral colors.</li>
            <li>lasting.i love the mirror that goes with it.</li>
            <li>I wish I had paid better attention to the size .</li>
            <li>I know I did! :)</li>
            <li>i love the colors.</li>
            <li>As a brunette, I am also able to use the matte tan shade to fill in my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure this depends on skin tone.)</li>
            <li>but I won&#x27;t be running to buy any more CS eye colors.</li>
            <li>These colors do well on top of ofter colors, not alone.</li>
            <li>I use the elf shimmer primer, so it may work better with another primer.</li>
            <li>I love the colors</li>
            <li>The colors are lovely.</li>
            <li>but i love it,</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I had heard good things about the coastal scents, but I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  </li>
            <li>Colors are vibrant, go on smooth and blend incredibly well.</li>
            <li>Great palettes for natural smoky eyes!!</li>
            <li>Easy to blend, well pigmented and most of all CHEAP!</li>
            <li>it is worth it!!</li>
            <li>Love coastal scents and it came very quickly</li>
            <li>The case has a nice size mirror and the 12 colors are versatile enough to make this a great travel</li>
            <li>Okay, let me just start off by saying this make-up isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>I love this palette because I primarily wear neutral makeup.</li>
            <li>product is good, the fast service</li>
            <li>I have really fair skin and some of the colors don&#x27;t really suit me, but they are just how they look in the pictures.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this product and will order other sets.</li>
            <li>Because of this, I have found the colors I&#x27;ve used to be blendable, easy to apply, and they show up on my skin.</li>
            <li>The pigments are really strong and stay on all day, even through sweat.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful, very natural, ranges from natural shades to smokey sexy ones!</li>
            <li>three palettes that I&#x27;ve gotten are pretty neutral and fairly warm.</li>
            <li>Smaller than I anticipated, but the color combos are beautiful.</li>
            <li>Ok so this palette is ok size at first</li>
            <li>They are about the size of a dime (each shadow), but that&#x27;s perfect for travel or everyday use at work.</li>
            <li>The only matte shades are on the bottom row but those matte shades are great.</li>
            <li>Goes on light.  </li>
            <li>light-</li>
            <li>cheap for all the colors and quality!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and stay on a long time.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows are very pigmented and with the right brushes, its a good smokey eye combo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing colors from the Cairo palette right now, and I love the look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then i assumed but colors are potent and beautiful, all have a little glitter to them for a airbrushed look.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous colors, very shimmery and pretty.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty and I am glad I found an eyeshadow palette that compliments my medium skin tone</li>
            <li>I was really excited about buying this pallet..</li>
            <li>My favorite so far!!!!</li>
            <li>However, if push came to shove and you were stranded without anything but a fingertip, you&#x27;d still be able to pull off a pretty respectable job without too much trouble.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shimmery shades are great too and once blended only have a slight sheen so its a great over all pallet.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how rich the colors were and how nicely they went on.  </li>
            <li>Good color selection, but note the 12 shadows only amount to .28 oz.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love these</li>
            <li>they smell cheap and the smell is powerful.</li>
            <li>so I was looking for a good enough product and ran into this.</li>
            <li>Good mix of matte and some sparkly type ones mixed in.</li>
            <li>i dont have much to complain or rave about.it&#x27;s an okay palette.</li>
            <li>Also wish there wasn&#x27;t so much writing on the top of the cover.</li>
            <li>I really dont know if I will be able to use it.</li>
            <li>Also, you do not get so much that you will never use it and love the color combinations they offer.  </li>
            <li>This arrived quickly and well wrapped.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and the colors are perfect for everyday.</li>
            <li>none irritating and cruelty free great pigment color adored!  </li>
            <li>This particular palette is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>I have dark skin (color of toffee), and they are a great compliment.</li>
            <li>and I need to reply these shadows more often than any other palette I own.</li>
            <li>Its good for the price, but not very high quality.</li>
            <li>They last long and its perfect for your purse!</li>
            <li>The only one that I think is better is the Chanel line, but then again, it is Chanel!  </li>
            <li>This is a great little set of colors.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little compact of neutral/brown type eye shadows.</li>
            <li>and these colors are amazing, not only can i do a neutral</li>
            <li>only drawback with this compact is that there are no applicators to apply the shadows so you&#x27;ll need to have your own makeup brushes or sponge applicators.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These palettes were 8.95 and were well worth that price.</li>
            <li>Once getting past that, you&#x27;ll realize what a beautiful array of colors that are given--which was my reason for purchasing.</li>
            <li>The mirror as well is quite handy, especially on the go.</li>
            <li>the colors on this pallet are nice, but only dime sized.</li>
            <li>The colors are really powerful-</li>
            <li>Totally worth it,</li>
            <li>so this was not a disappointment.</li>
            <li>is deceiving it&#x27;s smaller than the picture shown, but handy</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is remarkable that for less than $10 you can get a color collection that can take you from day to evening and then to a rave after the clubs close.</li>
            <li>Eye shadows are very colorful, lots of choices and very nice case.......................how thick, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for when you are carrying a small purse.</li>
            <li>First of all, you get 12 colors for the same price you&#x27;d pay for a name brand quad from the local drug store and you would never find any that blend as beautifully as these colors do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tested it again by smearing a good amount around my eye before bed and the next morning my eyes were still clear!</li>
            <li>For example what I thought would be a light gray is actually a light blue, a color I will never use.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows are not too shimmery (it has matte shadows as well), not too bold, and they&#x27;re VERY pigmented.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really planing on trying to get as much use out of the colors as possible, and since I love experimenting every day I will have to do so again!</li>
            <li>A nice color selection for eye shadow, particularly for blue eyes.</li>
            <li>I love this palette for deep neutral smokey eye.  </li>
            <li>Im not huge into wearing bright colors on my eyes</li>
            <li>And for the price you really get a bang for your buck!</li>
            <li>I recently started using the CS brushes and fell in love with them.</li>
            <li>love this palette, slightly smaller</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like this product and would love to send it back</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>The white seems to be more of a highlighter instead of a color.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be ready for any activity!</li>
            <li>Love the colors not sure if I will buy this again not to pigmented for me pretty palette though love coastal scents products.</li>
            <li>I was pretty upset.</li>
            <li>The colors are versatile and the gold and white are the colors I mostly use every day.</li>
            <li>but the other is nice shade</li>
            <li>I recieved the product earlier than expected, It came in great condition.</li>
            <li>overall I would recommend this product because the colors last and are of good quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks now, love the color choices and how it stays on the whole day.</li>
            <li>Had to give this a try with all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>You get the EXACT colors from the palette onto your eyes, which I really like, and they go well with ANY skin tone.</li>
            <li>The pictures make it look a lot bigger, but since the price is great and you dont need a ton to get a dark effect</li>
            <li>and so quickly you really get a professional look by the time you&#x27;re ready to add mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has a lot of the colors she was looking for in a nice little compact.</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>i like it a lot because i dont really need 88 neutral colors just 12 that work</li>
            <li>and you dont need much to get the desired effect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You absolutely cannot beat this for value, quality and for versatility.</li>
            <li>so I think I can really give it an in-depth review.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just expected something more.</li>
            <li>and it can really give you some deeper neutral looks.</li>
            <li>I really cannot put into words</li>
            <li>very pigmented</li>
            <li>but It&#x27;ll have to do, I don&#x27;t really have time to jump through the hoops to get it corrected.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t&#x27; need much of the product to achieve the desired effect, and the colors are very definitive.</li>
            <li>and I really like this pallet.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to dig into the eye shadow or use much to get your look.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to add some variety to my eyeshadow but as it is, I don&#x27;t think this palette will get much use.</li>
            <li>The shades are much darker than pictured.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pigmented</li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it to you too!</li>
            <li>&quot; Didn&#x27;t find that so much with the browns.</li>
            <li>And I didn&#x27;t really care for the glittery ones.</li>
            <li>really wanted to like these products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m glad I got it (not really a loss since some other items in the box were good)</li>
            <li>im thinking of buying other one because  love the colors so much.</li>
            <li>colors are rich and coordinated to allow you a ridiculous number of combinations and looks, from fresh faced natural to sophisticated smoldering and everything in between.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this palette because the colors are everything I use in multiple palettes that I purchase at the store.</li>
            <li>I love the dark brown, shimmery copper, and shimmery gold.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the dark colors but the size of the palette</li>
            <li>really, it&#x27;s super dark or super</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the colors and quality of the eye shadow but each color is only about as big as the tip of your pinky.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think you should HAVE to in order to get a decent result.</li>
            <li>Trust me, I have to use primer to make it look halfway decent.</li>
            <li>Nice product but somewhat smaller than i expected.</li>
            <li>This product is compact and HIGHLY pigmented.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>These colors last all day and are so pretty!</li>
            <li>I really like these natural earthy colors.</li>
            <li>I received this product after watching a few youtube videos on makeup and Coastal Scents keep appearing in some of the videos I enjoyed.</li>
            <li>I loved the colors but when I opened it some of the palettes were broken.</li>
            <li>I am fairly new to Coastal Scents.</li>
            <li>I live the colors in this palette.</li>
            <li>The darker colors need different colors to create a look with them, and most of those other colors are not found in this palette.</li>
            <li>Since purchasing a majority of OTHER palettes, this one seemed to get pushed to the bottom of my stash because I didn&#x27;t find I could make many different looks out of it.  </li>
            <li>The pigment is just as rich as my more expensive shadows.</li>
            <li>I usually never use every color on the pallet but with this one I do.  </li>
            <li>I expected the color pallete to be a little bigger than in person, but the colors are amazing!</li>
            <li>My skin is fairly sensitive and</li>
            <li>Very pigmented too, I&#x27;ve used them without an eyeshadow primer and the colors still last and pop!</li>
            <li>The powder is looser than I expected, but this is a really useful set of colors.</li>
            <li>The colors are awesome but just hate the fact</li>
            <li>the colors are great, its is a little small its not a really big palette</li>
            <li>A little definitely goes a very long way and in loving it</li>
            <li>It is a decent size and can tell they will last me a while.</li>
            <li>small enough to be able to take on the go</li>
            <li>The yellow and silver are vibrant.</li>
            <li>I mainly use the mirror for personal use or two colors out of the palette.</li>
            <li>the colors are very pigmented and long</li>
            <li>It does smell a little but wears off quickly.</li>
            <li>and i live on the second floor.</li>
            <li>I love the colors, they last a long time and there is little to no fallout.</li>
            <li>However, some shadows (such as the white and the darker, right hand column) turn out to be pretty good -- but not all are (such as the gold which was very disappointing and</li>
            <li>Even a small amount will produce rich color that can be blended.&lt;br /&gt;-Love</li>
            <li>The quality is like in Coastal Scents palettes in general.</li>
            <li>the color is just like what I expected and it sticks on skin very well.</li>
            <li>This product received fairly quickly (almost 7 days for APO), however the quality of the colors are not worth you purchasing!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard really mixed reviews about their products, but I decided to go for it anyway, especially since people have been raving about these new Go Palettes.</li>
            <li>Also like other reviewers said, the colors are very pigmented but they don&#x27;t blend well and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made several MAC palettes, and honestly, they are not ideal for daily transport to/from work.</li>
            <li>This little palette is like a higher end palette with a rock bottom price.</li>
            <li>I have had trouble being able to see even the darkest colored shadows with other similar priced and even more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time the other day and was amazed at how it turned out with myoutfit!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there are enough neutral colors for it to really be the &amp;#34;for all occasions&amp;#34; eye shadow as other reviews suggested.</li>
            <li>I like the packaging and don&#x27;t mind the small portions because I rarely if ever hit pan on any eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t particularly fond of the colors in this compact, but I can&#x27;t wait to try some of coastal scents other eyeshadows!</li>
            <li>The colors are a little smaller than pictured, but they stay on really well using a primer.</li>
            <li>The shadow is VERY pigmented, so you only need a little bit.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> the pigmentation is not that great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> For the price, you get a great variety of colors.  </li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t work great on eyebrows I would give it a lower star.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> great neutral colors for school.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great value for the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as great as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> LOL</li>
            <li> a go- its a great price</li>
            <li> And I love it!!</li>
            <li> Love it though!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing eye pallet!</li>
            <li> Oh and the price is amazing too!</li>
            <li> It really is a great product for a good price.</li>
            <li> very nice and good quality</li>
            <li> I have no idea how it got on there, but anyways the product was fine and the color swashes seemed great!</li>
            <li> Everyone went and on about how bright and pigmented they are.</li>
            <li> I bought this palette because I loved the idea of naming shade palettes after citites, and it seemed like a good price.</li>
            <li> Colors are fantastic and pigmentation is excellent.</li>
            <li> this might be good for a teenager.</li>
            <li> Its medium good quality, has quite a bit of fallout, and you will need an eyeshadow primer for it to look really good.</li>
            <li> They blend well and the compact has a good size mirror for application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as MAC shadows but its up there.</li>
            <li> I had heard good things about Coastal Scents from one of the beauty gurus I follow on YouTube</li>
            <li> Some of the colors don&#x27;t have good pigmentation and one of the browns I used ended up just looking like I had dirt smudged on my eyelid.</li>
            <li> The mirror is a good size</li>
            <li> With the good sized mirror and the versatility of the colors--all I need to add is some concealer, lip gloss and mascara as well as an applicator</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good size</li>
            <li> I loved using this for smokey eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> The colors are really nice, and with any mix of them, it gives a great look for any event, show,  or gathering.</li>
            <li> It is a good neutral palette to take with you for dance gigs and the like.</li>
            <li> Good colors.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I found something cheap and awesome that I am not allergic to!</li>
            <li> Fortunately Amazon.com&#x27;s return policy is really awesome.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m at work, I don&#x27;t have time to apply more makeup so this is great.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great palette, love the colors.</li>
            <li> Love these eyeshadows, very nice colors and quality.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast and packaging was perfect.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> For a first impression of Coastal Scents I&#x27;m not too impressed.</li>
            <li> I love this palette!</li>
            <li> I lost all my makeup, which where mostly MAC!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this!</li>
            <li> They are about the size of a dime, but the colors are absolutely stunning!</li>
            <li> Just lovely!</li>
            <li> Ulta&#x27;s eyeshadows are way more pigmented than this!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;the colors are great perfect pigments and you barely need to dab your brush in the powder.</li>
            <li> The quality is amazing and the colors are soooo pigmented.</li>
            <li> Cheap packaging great eye shadow</li>
            <li> and that is so amazing.</li>
            <li> it is so convenient because of the size and then packaging which is amazing, not to mention how amazingly pigmented they are.</li>
            <li> They are amazing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall though I think the pros outwear the cons and this palette is AMAZING for those on a budget.</li>
            <li> I the eyeshadow quality itself seems to be nice.</li>
            <li> the colors go on very pigmented and complement my skin perfectly.  </li>
            <li> nice</li>
            <li> The pigmentation is kind of lacking</li>
            <li> Colors are exactly how they look gorgeous colors and for a great bargain.</li>
            <li> Being a cosmetologist, I look for exceptional quality and I am telling you this stuff is like the brands you pay for at the cosmetic counters, and really goes on like MAC!!!!  </li>
            <li> but I also bought the Moscow version and liked the palette better.</li>
            <li> It would be a much better product if it had either a eyeshadow applicator or a place to put your own applicator.</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and very pigmented.  </li>
            <li> The color pigment is gorgeous and true to color.</li>
            <li> and the wrapper was very secure.</li>
            <li> Even more amazing the product was still as bright as when I first applied.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the colors in this palette.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in-love with the colour selection on this palette, the jewel type shades are great for my caramel complexion.  </li>
            <li> and i finally decided i needed some more neutrals because it&#x27;s just the perfect look for school and stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You could literally take this compact on vacation and need nothing else beyond mascara and a couple of lip colors, leaving more room for clothes and souveniers, and what&#x27;s not to love about that?!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> how much i LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more palettes :)</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t know better I would think it cost about twenty-five dollars.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product.</li>
            <li> I love the</li>
            <li> These colors are perfect about an equal amount of matte and sparkle, not chalky.  </li>
            <li> Want to try more.</li>
            <li> You have many ranges of the &amp;#34;smokey eye&amp;#34; with this set.  </li>
            <li> just okay.</li>
            <li> i love the mix of colors and</li>
            <li> so I love it.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you use primer, but you should always use primer anyways.</li>
            <li> LOVE them both.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented and great eyeshadow colors!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Most are neutral colors.</li>
            <li> lasting.i love the mirror that goes with it.</li>
            <li> I wish I had paid better attention to the size .</li>
            <li> I know I did! :)</li>
            <li> i love the colors.</li>
            <li> As a brunette, I am also able to use the matte tan shade to fill in my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sure this depends on skin tone.)</li>
            <li> but I won&#x27;t be running to buy any more CS eye colors.</li>
            <li> These colors do well on top of ofter colors, not alone.</li>
            <li> I use the elf shimmer primer, so it may work better with another primer.</li>
            <li> I love the colors</li>
            <li> The colors are lovely.</li>
            <li> but i love it,</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I had heard good things about the coastal scents, but I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  </li>
            <li> Colors are vibrant, go on smooth and blend incredibly well.</li>
            <li> Great palettes for natural smoky eyes!!</li>
            <li> Easy to blend, well pigmented and most of all CHEAP!</li>
            <li> it is worth it!!</li>
            <li> Love coastal scents and it came very quickly</li>
            <li> The case has a nice size mirror and the 12 colors are versatile enough to make this a great travel</li>
            <li> Okay, let me just start off by saying this make-up isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> I love this palette because I primarily wear neutral makeup.</li>
            <li> product is good, the fast service</li>
            <li> I have really fair skin and some of the colors don&#x27;t really suit me, but they are just how they look in the pictures.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product and will order other sets.</li>
            <li> Because of this, I have found the colors I&#x27;ve used to be blendable, easy to apply, and they show up on my skin.</li>
            <li> The pigments are really strong and stay on all day, even through sweat.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful, very natural, ranges from natural shades to smokey sexy ones!</li>
            <li> three palettes that I&#x27;ve gotten are pretty neutral and fairly warm.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I anticipated, but the color combos are beautiful.</li>
            <li> Ok so this palette is ok size at first</li>
            <li> They are about the size of a dime (each shadow), but that&#x27;s perfect for travel or everyday use at work.</li>
            <li> The only matte shades are on the bottom row but those matte shades are great.</li>
            <li> Goes on light.  </li>
            <li> light-</li>
            <li> cheap for all the colors and quality!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and stay on a long time.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are very pigmented and with the right brushes, its a good smokey eye combo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing colors from the Cairo palette right now, and I love the look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then i assumed but colors are potent and beautiful, all have a little glitter to them for a airbrushed look.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous colors, very shimmery and pretty.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty and I am glad I found an eyeshadow palette that compliments my medium skin tone</li>
            <li> I was really excited about buying this pallet..</li>
            <li> My favorite so far!!!!</li>
            <li> However, if push came to shove and you were stranded without anything but a fingertip, you&#x27;d still be able to pull off a pretty respectable job without too much trouble.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shimmery shades are great too and once blended only have a slight sheen so its a great over all pallet.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how rich the colors were and how nicely they went on.  </li>
            <li> Good color selection, but note the 12 shadows only amount to .28 oz.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love these</li>
            <li> they smell cheap and the smell is powerful.</li>
            <li> so I was looking for a good enough product and ran into this.</li>
            <li> Good mix of matte and some sparkly type ones mixed in.</li>
            <li> i dont have much to complain or rave about.it&#x27;s an okay palette.</li>
            <li> Also wish there wasn&#x27;t so much writing on the top of the cover.</li>
            <li> I really dont know if I will be able to use it.</li>
            <li> Also, you do not get so much that you will never use it and love the color combinations they offer.  </li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and well wrapped.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and the colors are perfect for everyday.</li>
            <li> none irritating and cruelty free great pigment color adored!  </li>
            <li> This particular palette is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li> I have dark skin (color of toffee), and they are a great compliment.</li>
            <li> and I need to reply these shadows more often than any other palette I own.</li>
            <li> Its good for the price, but not very high quality.</li>
            <li> They last long and its perfect for your purse!</li>
            <li> The only one that I think is better is the Chanel line, but then again, it is Chanel!  </li>
            <li> This is a great little set of colors.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little compact of neutral/brown type eye shadows.</li>
            <li> and these colors are amazing, not only can i do a neutral</li>
            <li> only drawback with this compact is that there are no applicators to apply the shadows so you&#x27;ll need to have your own makeup brushes or sponge applicators.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These palettes were 8.95 and were well worth that price.</li>
            <li> Once getting past that, you&#x27;ll realize what a beautiful array of colors that are given--which was my reason for purchasing.</li>
            <li> The mirror as well is quite handy, especially on the go.</li>
            <li> the colors on this pallet are nice, but only dime sized.</li>
            <li> The colors are really powerful-</li>
            <li> Totally worth it,</li>
            <li> so this was not a disappointment.</li>
            <li> is deceiving it&#x27;s smaller than the picture shown, but handy</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is remarkable that for less than $10 you can get a color collection that can take you from day to evening and then to a rave after the clubs close.</li>
            <li> Eye shadows are very colorful, lots of choices and very nice case.......................how thick, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for when you are carrying a small purse.</li>
            <li> First of all, you get 12 colors for the same price you&#x27;d pay for a name brand quad from the local drug store and you would never find any that blend as beautifully as these colors do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tested it again by smearing a good amount around my eye before bed and the next morning my eyes were still clear!</li>
            <li> For example what I thought would be a light gray is actually a light blue, a color I will never use.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are not too shimmery (it has matte shadows as well), not too bold, and they&#x27;re VERY pigmented.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really planing on trying to get as much use out of the colors as possible, and since I love experimenting every day I will have to do so again!</li>
            <li> A nice color selection for eye shadow, particularly for blue eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this palette for deep neutral smokey eye.  </li>
            <li> Im not huge into wearing bright colors on my eyes</li>
            <li> And for the price you really get a bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> I recently started using the CS brushes and fell in love with them.</li>
            <li> love this palette, slightly smaller</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product and would love to send it back</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> The white seems to be more of a highlighter instead of a color.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be ready for any activity!</li>
            <li> Love the colors not sure if I will buy this again not to pigmented for me pretty palette though love coastal scents products.</li>
            <li> I was pretty upset.</li>
            <li> The colors are versatile and the gold and white are the colors I mostly use every day.</li>
            <li> but the other is nice shade</li>
            <li> I recieved the product earlier than expected, It came in great condition.</li>
            <li> overall I would recommend this product because the colors last and are of good quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks now, love the color choices and how it stays on the whole day.</li>
            <li> Had to give this a try with all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> You get the EXACT colors from the palette onto your eyes, which I really like, and they go well with ANY skin tone.</li>
            <li> The pictures make it look a lot bigger, but since the price is great and you dont need a ton to get a dark effect</li>
            <li> and so quickly you really get a professional look by the time you&#x27;re ready to add mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has a lot of the colors she was looking for in a nice little compact.</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> i like it a lot because i dont really need 88 neutral colors just 12 that work</li>
            <li> and you dont need much to get the desired effect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You absolutely cannot beat this for value, quality and for versatility.</li>
            <li> so I think I can really give it an in-depth review.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just expected something more.</li>
            <li> and it can really give you some deeper neutral looks.</li>
            <li> I really cannot put into words</li>
            <li> very pigmented</li>
            <li> but It&#x27;ll have to do, I don&#x27;t really have time to jump through the hoops to get it corrected.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t&#x27; need much of the product to achieve the desired effect, and the colors are very definitive.</li>
            <li> and I really like this pallet.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to dig into the eye shadow or use much to get your look.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to add some variety to my eyeshadow but as it is, I don&#x27;t think this palette will get much use.</li>
            <li> The shades are much darker than pictured.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pigmented</li>
            <li> Thanks so much</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it to you too!</li>
            <li> &quot; Didn&#x27;t find that so much with the browns.</li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t really care for the glittery ones.</li>
            <li> really wanted to like these products.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m glad I got it (not really a loss since some other items in the box were good)</li>
            <li> im thinking of buying other one because  love the colors so much.</li>
            <li> colors are rich and coordinated to allow you a ridiculous number of combinations and looks, from fresh faced natural to sophisticated smoldering and everything in between.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this palette because the colors are everything I use in multiple palettes that I purchase at the store.</li>
            <li> I love the dark brown, shimmery copper, and shimmery gold.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the dark colors but the size of the palette</li>
            <li> really, it&#x27;s super dark or super</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the colors and quality of the eye shadow but each color is only about as big as the tip of your pinky.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think you should HAVE to in order to get a decent result.</li>
            <li> Trust me, I have to use primer to make it look halfway decent.</li>
            <li> Nice product but somewhat smaller than i expected.</li>
            <li> This product is compact and HIGHLY pigmented.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> These colors last all day and are so pretty!</li>
            <li> I really like these natural earthy colors.</li>
            <li> I received this product after watching a few youtube videos on makeup and Coastal Scents keep appearing in some of the videos I enjoyed.</li>
            <li> I loved the colors but when I opened it some of the palettes were broken.</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to Coastal Scents.</li>
            <li> I live the colors in this palette.</li>
            <li> The darker colors need different colors to create a look with them, and most of those other colors are not found in this palette.</li>
            <li> Since purchasing a majority of OTHER palettes, this one seemed to get pushed to the bottom of my stash because I didn&#x27;t find I could make many different looks out of it.  </li>
            <li> The pigment is just as rich as my more expensive shadows.</li>
            <li> I usually never use every color on the pallet but with this one I do.  </li>
            <li> I expected the color pallete to be a little bigger than in person, but the colors are amazing!</li>
            <li> My skin is fairly sensitive and</li>
            <li> Very pigmented too, I&#x27;ve used them without an eyeshadow primer and the colors still last and pop!</li>
            <li> The powder is looser than I expected, but this is a really useful set of colors.</li>
            <li> The colors are awesome but just hate the fact</li>
            <li> the colors are great, its is a little small its not a really big palette</li>
            <li> A little definitely goes a very long way and in loving it</li>
            <li> It is a decent size and can tell they will last me a while.</li>
            <li> small enough to be able to take on the go</li>
            <li> The yellow and silver are vibrant.</li>
            <li> I mainly use the mirror for personal use or two colors out of the palette.</li>
            <li> the colors are very pigmented and long</li>
            <li> It does smell a little but wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> and i live on the second floor.</li>
            <li> I love the colors, they last a long time and there is little to no fallout.</li>
            <li> However, some shadows (such as the white and the darker, right hand column) turn out to be pretty good -- but not all are (such as the gold which was very disappointing and</li>
            <li> Even a small amount will produce rich color that can be blended.&lt;br /&gt;-Love</li>
            <li> The quality is like in Coastal Scents palettes in general.</li>
            <li> the color is just like what I expected and it sticks on skin very well.</li>
            <li> This product received fairly quickly (almost 7 days for APO), however the quality of the colors are not worth you purchasing!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard really mixed reviews about their products, but I decided to go for it anyway, especially since people have been raving about these new Go Palettes.</li>
            <li> Also like other reviewers said, the colors are very pigmented but they don&#x27;t blend well and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made several MAC palettes, and honestly, they are not ideal for daily transport to/from work.</li>
            <li> This little palette is like a higher end palette with a rock bottom price.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble being able to see even the darkest colored shadows with other similar priced and even more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time the other day and was amazed at how it turned out with myoutfit!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there are enough neutral colors for it to really be the &amp;#34;for all occasions&amp;#34; eye shadow as other reviews suggested.</li>
            <li> I like the packaging and don&#x27;t mind the small portions because I rarely if ever hit pan on any eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t particularly fond of the colors in this compact, but I can&#x27;t wait to try some of coastal scents other eyeshadows!</li>
            <li> The colors are a little smaller than pictured, but they stay on really well using a primer.</li>
            <li> The shadow is VERY pigmented, so you only need a little bit.  </li>
            <li> These palettes are about the size of a mirror compact, and you could really substitute it for your plain mirror b/c</li>
            <li> This make up was not what i expected its way to dark all the colors and the gold was not at all what i expected which is why i got the set in the first place</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Color did not last as long as I would have liked&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t last very long even with primer.  </li>
            <li> Even better is that even after a day of wear and a touch up for a party, I did not have any of that ugly creasing that happens when the shadows blends with the natural oils on my eyelids after extended wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used an eye shadow brush first time round and found that the dark dusky and midnight blues did a lot of \\&quot;sprinkling.\\</li>
            <li> Just be aware this palette is very small, about the size of my palm.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that (and with the other palette i purchased at the same time) is that the size is much smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> It was a bit smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> Not natural</li>
            <li> I use eye primer and the color lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li> i would say that they are a bit smaller then expected.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re really debating the purchase, I mean why not it&#x27;s under $10</li>
            <li> I lov e that there is such a variety in such a little compact.</li>
            <li> The colors are extremely pigmented, and last all day (with or without a primer)</li>
            <li> I have plenty of other white colors</li>
            <li> but i was really mad at first because I thought that if they threw it up there my product was for sure broken.</li>
            <li> Very stunning for the smokey eye subtle - or dramatic!</li>
            <li> Pretty Palet not a great color pay off though.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are dime sized but they seem pigmented enough that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not very hightly pigmented.....</li>
            <li> but a few are not the same color as pictured.</li>
            <li> SOO its just not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try the other palettes in the \\&quot;Go</li>
            <li> The actual size of each color is small (dime-sized).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll soon buy the other \\&quot;Go</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly what I need</li>
            <li> well i had ordered two other items with this one to arrive today and they did as planned, except some how this product ended up on my balcony...</li>
            <li> The quality is up there with other high-end name brands (and I&#x27;ve used them all).</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need a lot for extreme color.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am not terribly impressed so far.</li>
            <li> The black is now all over every other color</li>
            <li> If I had one hang up I would say it&#x27;s a little small (the colors are about dime size, maybe smaller)</li>
            <li> but that is the only negative about this palette.</li>
            <li> The colors do come off dark</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that it did not come with an applicator.</li>
            <li> The dark colors need to be used with caution.</li>
            <li> Or better results use an eyeshadow base.</li>
            <li> Would prefer a more beigy base.</li>
            <li> It was has a black shade you can use with an eyeliner brush</li>
            <li> opened it up one day and half the eyeshadows had almost exploded, and got everywhere.</li>
            <li> these colors are a little too dark for my taste.</li>
            <li> As with a lot of shadows, they do seems to smear a little without a primer.</li>
            <li> but I think it may be a little warped.</li>
            <li> They are not as rich as they look and i was fairly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I received this product today and it came with the white and black colors broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try Coastal Scents for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared to buy it because I thought it would be very little</li>
            <li> Pigment not strong.  </li>
            <li> The eye shadows while not Chanel (duh at this price?) are also not cheap drugstore Christmas gift specials...</li>
            <li> I usually buy make-up at Walmart or Walgreens.</li>
            <li> I did my usual allergy test of smearing liberal amounts all over an eye and waiting for the misery to start-</li>
            <li> The black sucks too but at least it works a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so, i was sooo excied when i received this , only to open the box and not one, not two, but THREE of the eyeshadows were broken !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to wear the forest green, too!!</li>
            <li> the two bottom left corner shadows were a bit of a disappointment as well).</li>
            <li> the ones I&#x27;ve used so far have had a ugly gray-green tinge to them, even the browns.</li>
            <li> The palette itself is thick and sturdy.</li>
            <li> size is not too small at all!</li>
            <li> This palette is very small and portable.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price, seriously.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t make me look like I threw glitter on myself, just give me a subtle sparkle.&lt;br /&gt;-Price-</li>
            <li> but I find blending a little difficult some times and longevity goes astray even over my Shadow Insurance.</li>
            <li> I always use a primer, concealer, or some type of base on my lids prior to using any shadows.</li>
            <li> Ask yourself: have you ever used ALL of one color from one of those store brands before you grew tired of it?</li>
            <li> but when I received one of the color was broken m</li>
            <li> but when I opened it some of the colors were all broken.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all broken.</li>
            <li> One problem is when you buy this you undoubtedly will have 1 or 2 broken eyeshadow pockets.</li>
            <li> Of the two highlighters, one has a blue base and the other a yellowish base.</li>
            <li> Not good!</li>
            <li> Sad purchase.</li>
            <li> I can mix and match for casual day at work and at night I can add to what I have for a nightime look.</li>
            <li> OBSESSED with my eyeshadow!</li>
            <li> For this price - you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> so sad :[</li>
            <li> but otherwise disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t show up when applied.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and without a base, eye shadow would disappear in an hour.</li>
            <li> (Worst color ever?</li>

            <li> The powder is looser than I expected, but this is a really useful set of colors. Works best with eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li> Excellent color pay off, creamy texture. This little palette is like a higher end palette with a rock bottom price.</li>
            <li> I lov e that there is such a variety in such a little compact. Great for when you are carrying a small purse.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous colors, very shimmery and pretty. It was a bit smaller than I expected but it was fully intact. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> These colors are beautiful. Easy to blend, well pigmented and most of all CHEAP! I love this palette for deep neutral smokey eye.  Absolutely perfect palette :D</li>
            <li> I LOVE the colors in this palette. Im not huge into wearing bright colors on my eyes so this was perfect. The quality is amazing and the colors are soooo pigmented.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in-love with the colour selection on this palette, the jewel type shades are great for my caramel complexion.  The size is perfect for on-the-go type application... I can&#x27;t wait to try the other palettes in the \\&quot;Go Palette\\&quot; collection</li>
            <li> Cheap packaging great eye shadow</li>
            <li> I have been a coastal scents fan for a while and i finally decided i needed some more neutrals because it&#x27;s just the perfect look for school and stuff. and these colors are amazing, not only can i do a neutral but i can also do smokey eye and that is so amazing. i like it a lot because i dont really need 88 neutral colors just 12 that work well.  it is so convenient because of the size and then packaging which is amazing, not to mention how amazingly pigmented they are. every girl needs some nice neutrals and this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Not very hightly pigmented.....doesn&#x27;t last very long even with primer.  Put on at a bout 8 am and was fading by 10</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this product! It goes on beautifully and you dont need much to get the desired effect. The only thing is that (and with the other palette i purchased at the same time) is that the size is much smaller than expected. The pictures make it look a lot bigger, but since the price is great and you dont need a ton to get a dark effect it isnt a big deal.</li>
            <li> Love coastal scents and it came very quickly</li>
            <li> From every angle, this collection is a winner.  First of all, you get 12 colors for the same price you&#x27;d pay for a name brand quad from the local drug store and you would never find any that blend as beautifully as these colors do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could literally take this compact on vacation and need nothing else beyond mascara and a couple of lip colors, leaving more room for clothes and souveniers, and what&#x27;s not to love about that?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are rich and coordinated to allow you a ridiculous number of combinations and looks, from fresh faced natural to sophisticated smoldering and everything in between.  They blend so well and so quickly you really get a professional look by the time you&#x27;re ready to add mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is remarkable that for less than $10 you can get a color collection that can take you from day to evening and then to a rave after the clubs close. Even better is that even after a day of wear and a touch up for a party, I did not have any of that ugly creasing that happens when the shadows blends with the natural oils on my eyelids after extended wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback with this compact is that there are no applicators to apply the shadows so you&#x27;ll need to have your own makeup brushes or sponge applicators.  However, if push came to shove and you were stranded without anything but a fingertip, you&#x27;d still be able to pull off a pretty respectable job without too much trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You absolutely cannot beat this for value, quality and for versatility.</li>
            <li> OBSESSED with my eyeshadow! These colors last all day and are so pretty! For this price - you can&#x27;t go wrong! Love it!</li>
            <li> these colors are a little too dark for my taste. but I also bought the Moscow version and liked the palette better. overall I would recommend this product because the colors last and are of good quality. a lot cheaper than your overpriced comestics and works just as well.</li>
            <li> Good color selection, but note the 12 shadows only amount to .28 oz. The price doesn&#x27;t make sense either, because they&#x27;re on sale on coastalscents.com for 5.99 USD. Don&#x27;t buy off Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have Indian skin, medium tan, and I wanted to get a warm/neutral eyeshadow pallete and I found this one. After reading the reviews, I had to try it. And I love it!! I can mix and match for casual day at work and at night I can add to what I have for a nightime look. Great for summer when I have my bronzy look going. And for the price you really get a bang for your buck! I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to Coastal Scents. I am a makeup artist and one of my artist friends raves about CS. RAVES! I recently started using the CS brushes and fell in love with them. I picked up this Cairo palette as well as the Beijing and the Paris palettes. Love them. They are about the size of a dime (each shadow), but that&#x27;s perfect for travel or everyday use at work. I&#x27;ve made several MAC palettes, and honestly, they are not ideal for daily transport to/from work. These palettes are about the size of a mirror compact, and you could really substitute it for your plain mirror b/c there is one included. I always use a primer, concealer, or some type of base on my lids prior to using any shadows. I have oily skin and without a base, eye shadow would disappear in an hour. Because of this, I have found the colors I&#x27;ve used to be blendable, easy to apply, and they show up on my skin. I haven&#x27;t experienced a chalky shade as of this date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These palettes were 8.95 and were well worth that price. I&#x27;m wearing colors from the Cairo palette right now, and I love the look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three palettes that I&#x27;ve gotten are pretty neutral and fairly warm. I have dark skin (color of toffee), and they are a great compliment. I am next going to get the Moscow palette and maybe the Sydney.</li>
            <li> For a first impression of Coastal Scents I&#x27;m not too impressed. I&#x27;ve had this for quite awhile so I think I can really give it an in-depth review. First off, the eyeshadows are quite small. Maybe I just expected something more. Once getting past that, you&#x27;ll realize what a beautiful array of colors that are given--which was my reason for purchasing. The mirror as well is quite handy, especially on the go. However, some shadows (such as the white and the darker, right hand column) turn out to be pretty good -- but not all are (such as the gold which was very disappointing and the two bottom left corner shadows were a bit of a disappointment as well). The darker colors need different colors to create a look with them, and most of those other colors are not found in this palette. I do manage to work with ALL of the shadows but I find blending a little difficult some times and longevity goes astray even over my Shadow Insurance. I&#x27;m really planing on trying to get as much use out of the colors as possible, and since I love experimenting every day I will have to do so again! Since purchasing a majority of OTHER palettes, this one seemed to get pushed to the bottom of my stash because I didn&#x27;t find I could make many different looks out of it.  If you&#x27;re really debating the purchase, I mean why not it&#x27;s under $10 and it can really give you some deeper neutral looks. But if you&#x27;re looking for versatility of neutrals, maybe consider the $40 extra and get a NAKED palette.</li>
            <li> I bought this palette because I loved the idea of naming shade palettes after citites, and it seemed like a good price. It really is a great product for a good price. The eyeshadows are very pigmented and with the right brushes, its a good smokey eye combo. Just be aware this palette is very small, about the size of my palm. The eyeshadows are dime sized but they seem pigmented enough that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I really cannot put into words how much i LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I am not kidding when I say this... this palette has colors I have searched years to find!</li>
            <li> beautiful colors. very pigmented</li>
            <li> This product is compact and HIGHLY pigmented. When it arrived, it was in its perfect condition. The actual size of each color is small (dime-sized). It was shipped and handled well by Amazon! I&#x27;ll soon buy the other \\&quot;Go Makeup Palette\\&quot; ones... I definitely recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Great palettes for natural smoky eyes!! I used it for the first time the other day and was amazed at how it turned out with myoutfit!!</li>
            <li> Arrived with one eyeshadow circle cracked and it&#x27;s a lot smaller than pictured but that is the only negative about this palette. Colors are fantastic and pigmentation is excellent. I will be buying more palettes :)</li>
            <li> This particular palette is my absolute favorite! I have purchased the Beijing, London, &amp; Paris palettes from Coastal scents and the Cairo has THE BEST shades for my skin tone. This product blends so well and last all day without feathering.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t Amazon&#x27;s fault, but whoever supplied Amazon with the product put the &amp;#34;Sydney&amp;#34; palette in a bag labeled &amp;#34;Cairo&amp;#34; I&#x27;m assuming this is an issue with the CostalScents company and how they package their products. It&#x27;s not exactly what I need but It&#x27;ll have to do, I don&#x27;t really have time to jump through the hoops to get it corrected. I the eyeshadow quality itself seems to be nice. I hope the Ciaro coloring is everything it says it is.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and well wrapped. The colors are beautiful and stay on a long time. Or better results use an eyeshadow base.</li>
            <li> well i had ordered two other items with this one to arrive today and they did as planned, except some how this product ended up on my balcony... and i live on the second floor. I dont know how it got there but i was really mad at first because I thought that if they threw it up there my product was for sure broken. I have no idea how it got on there, but anyways the product was fine and the color swashes seemed great! i havent tried them on my eyes yet but I will update you later!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crazy UPS guy :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the colors are great perfect pigments and you barely need to dab your brush in the powder. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> the colors on this pallet are nice, but only dime sized. the pigmentation is not that great.  this might be good for a teenager.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I anticipated, but the color combos are beautiful.</li>
            <li> Okay, let me just start off by saying this make-up isn&#x27;t cheap. The quality is up there with other high-end name brands (and I&#x27;ve used them all). The colors are beautiful and saturated. If I had one hang up I would say it&#x27;s a little small (the colors are about dime size, maybe smaller) but now I&#x27;m just splitting hairs. You can&#x27;t beat the price, seriously. The palette itself is thick and sturdy. If I didn&#x27;t know better I would think it cost about twenty-five dollars. Time for me to stock up on some Coastal Scents!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I had heard good things about the coastal scents, but I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  I was really surprised at how rich the colors were and how nicely they went on.  My skin is fairly sensitive and I havn&#x27;t had any problems.  The compact is great, feels alot sturdier than the cheezy maybelline ones that I always break!  I wasn&#x27;t particularly fond of the colors in this compact, but I can&#x27;t wait to try some of coastal scents other eyeshadows!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product. Colors are vibrant, go on smooth and blend incredibly well. A little definitely goes a very long way and in loving it</li>
            <li> This make up was not what i expected its way to dark all the colors and the gold was not at all what i expected which is why i got the set in the first place i would return it if i could!!!</li>
            <li> This palette is awesome!  the colors go on very pigmented and complement my skin perfectly.  I have received tons of compliments on my eyeshadow when I wear these.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  For the price, you get a great variety of colors.  You don&#x27;t&#x27; need much of the product to achieve the desired effect, and the colors are very definitive.</li>
            <li> My favorite so far!!!!! I love the colors:)&lt;br /&gt;The size is not too small at all! Fits great in make up bag and the colors are great!</li>
            <li> love this palette, slightly smaller then i assumed but colors are potent and beautiful, all have a little glitter to them for a airbrushed look. very nice and good quality</li>
            <li> Excellent colors, excellent price! The color pigment is gorgeous and true to color. Very stunning for the smokey eye subtle - or dramatic!</li>
            <li> Its good for the price, but not very high quality. Its medium good quality, has quite a bit of fallout, and you will need an eyeshadow primer for it to look really good. I use it a lot for my eyebrows now that I&#x27;m out of primer. If it didn&#x27;t work great on eyebrows I would give it a lower star. It was has a black shade you can use with an eyeliner brush so I&#x27;ve gotten use out of though not as eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Had to give this a try with all the positive reviews. I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks now, love the color choices and how it stays on the whole day. When I&#x27;m at work, I don&#x27;t have time to apply more makeup so this is great. The price can&#x27;t be beat and the &amp;#34;smallness&amp;#34; of each color doesn&#x27;t bother me. Ask yourself: have you ever used ALL of one color from one of those store brands before you grew tired of it?</li>
            <li> These colors are perfect about an equal amount of matte and sparkle, not chalky.  They are amazing.  Want to try more.</li>
            <li> I got this in my boxycharm this month and I really like this pallet. The only matte shades are on the bottom row but those matte shades are great. The shimmery shades are great too and once blended only have a slight sheen so its a great over all pallet.</li>
            <li> nice but when I received one of the color was broken m but the other is nice shade and I will order it again</li>
            <li> I love the colors, they last a long time and there is little to no fallout. They blend well and the compact has a good size mirror for application. I can&#x27;t wait to buy another palette.</li>
            <li> The quality is like in Coastal Scents palettes in general. I have also the warm palette, and in my opinion Cairo has the best colours from that palette.</li>
            <li> You have many ranges of the &amp;#34;smokey eye&amp;#34; with this set.  The colors do come off dark so you don&#x27;t have to dig into the eye shadow or use much to get your look.  My only complaint was that it did not come with an applicator.</li>
            <li> Pigment not strong.  Goes on light.  Its just okay.</li>
            <li> I live the colors in this palette. It does smell a little but wears off quickly. I want yo try out others in this range.</li>
            <li> This pallet is so awesome!!! Perfect for traveling! The colors are beautiful, very natural, ranges from natural shades to smokey sexy ones! Very pigmented too, I&#x27;ve used them without an eyeshadow primer and the colors still last and pop! Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> love it!!! the colors are great. they blend perfect and look awesome on. i love the mix of colors and how they look on.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love these and I guess some of the colors are alright but a few are not the same color as pictured. For example what I thought would be a light gray is actually a light blue, a color I will never use. Also like other reviewers said, the colors are very pigmented but they don&#x27;t blend well and the ones I&#x27;ve used so far have had a ugly gray-green tinge to them, even the browns. I bought this to add some variety to my eyeshadow but as it is, I don&#x27;t think this palette will get much use.</li>
            <li> I love this palette! The price is reasonable and the colors are perfect for everyday. They last long and its perfect for your purse!</li>
            <li> The colors are really powerful- you don&#x27;t need a lot for extreme color. I don&#x27;t think there are enough neutral colors for it to really be the &amp;#34;for all occasions&amp;#34; eye shadow as other reviews suggested. Not natural really, it&#x27;s super dark or super light- those are your choices. I also don&#x27;t like the way they smell- they smell cheap and the smell is powerful.</li>
            <li> so, i was sooo excied when i received this , only to open the box and not one, not two, but THREE of the eyeshadows were broken !!! no way of saving them at all. when i opened the box eyeshadow went everywhere!!! so sad :[</li>
            <li> This is a great little set of colors.  I use eye primer and the color lasts all day long.  The colors are the size of dime, just for reference.  Very happy with this product and will order other sets.</li>
            <li> I would consider this play makeup for 5 year olds.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product and would love to send it back but I&#x27;ve already used it.  The shades are much darker than pictured.</li>
            <li> I received this product today and it came with the white and black colors broken. The black is now all over every other color and I am devastated. I intended to give to my mother as a gift. With it being so close to christmas, I have no time to find anything else nor any money left. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> I lost all my makeup, which where mostly MAC! I didn&#x27;t want to go out and buy everything all at once so I was looking for a good enough product and ran into this. It&#x27;s very pigmented so I love it. It&#x27;s not as good as MAC shadows but its up there. Just make sure you use primer, but you should always use primer anyways.</li>
            <li> This was an Xmas gift to me from my son.  The colors are beautiful and very pigmented.  Look the same on my skin as they do in the palette.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I got the Cairo and the Singapore. LOVE them both. The colors are a little smaller than pictured, but they stay on really well using a primer. As with a lot of shadows, they do seems to smear a little without a primer. I would recommend!!</li>
            <li> Very pigmented and great eyeshadow colors!!&lt;br /&gt;I love it! It is a decent size and can tell they will last me a while.</li>
            <li> What I liked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Rich and pigmented color.  I have had trouble being able to see even the darkest colored shadows with other similar priced and even more expensive brands. Definitely not the case with Coastal Scents. Even a small amount will produce rich color that can be blended.&lt;br /&gt;-Love the color selection. Most are neutral colors. Good mix of matte and some sparkly type ones mixed in. I love the dark brown, shimmery copper, and shimmery gold.&lt;br /&gt;-Shimmery colors are not too shimmery. They don&#x27;t make me look like I threw glitter on myself, just give me a subtle sparkle.&lt;br /&gt;-Price- cheap for all the colors and quality!&lt;br /&gt;-Compact small enough to be able to take on the go if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so much:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Color did not last as long as I would have liked&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though I think the pros outwear the cons and this palette is AMAZING for those on a budget.</li>
            <li> the color is just like what I expected and it sticks on skin very well. and the wrapper was very secure.</li>
            <li> the colors are very pigmented and long lasting.i love the mirror that goes with it. i dont have much to complain or rave about.it&#x27;s an okay palette.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the colors and quality of the eye shadow but each color is only about as big as the tip of your pinky. SOO its just not what I had expected. I wish I had paid better attention to the size .</li>
            <li> Eye shadows are very colorful, lots of choices and very nice case.......................how thick, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;The product is good, the fast service..........good choice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try Coastal Scents for a few years now. I&#x27;ve heard really mixed reviews about their products, but I decided to go for it anyway, especially since people have been raving about these new Go Palettes. Let me tell you, I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this! I must warn you, though, that the eyeshadows aren&#x27;t as big as what you may see in the photos. They are about the size of a dime, but the colors are absolutely stunning! The eyeshadows are not too shimmery (it has matte shadows as well), not too bold, and they&#x27;re VERY pigmented. You get the EXACT colors from the palette onto your eyes, which I really like, and they go well with ANY skin tone. Trust me, you WILL get what you pay for. I know I did! :)</li>
            <li> Colors are exactly how they look gorgeous colors and for a great bargain. The eyeshadows are the same quality as my sephora and MAC products. The shipping was very fast and packaging was perfect. Thanks again!</li>
            <li> none irritating and cruelty free great pigment color adored!  Cannot wait to show to all my friends!  Thanks so much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product.  The shadow is VERY pigmented, so you only need a little bit.  I&#x27;m still playing with the colors.</li>
            <li> Well I have no personal opinion, however my wife loves it.  Has a lot of the colors she was looking for in a nice little compact.</li>
            <li> These shadows are an incredible deal. The pigment is just as rich as my more expensive shadows. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get the color to show. not even the white....The black sucks too but at least it works a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again I don&#x27;t know how to use make up. But I&#x27;m guessing it doesn&#x27;t take a scientist to smear some color on your eyes.</li>
            <li> i love the colors. i would say that they are a bit smaller then expected. The picture makes it seem bigger. Also wish there wasn&#x27;t so much writing on the top of the cover.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend purchased this for me a while back, and I use it all the time. The colors are extremely pigmented, and last all day (with or without a primer) As a brunette, I am also able to use the matte tan shade to fill in my eyebrows. Totally worth it, and I will forever be a Coastal Scents gal.</li>
            <li> I got this palette as part of a beauty subscription box. I had heard good things about Coastal Scents from one of the beauty gurus I follow on YouTube but I had never tried it. Overall, I am not terribly impressed so far. I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times and I don&#x27;t think the consistency has been very good. In fairness, I did not use an eyeshadow primer but I don&#x27;t think you should HAVE to in order to get a decent result. Some of the colors don&#x27;t have good pigmentation and one of the browns I used ended up just looking like I had dirt smudged on my eyelid. (Worst color ever? Maybe. But I&#x27;m sure this depends on skin tone.) I like the packaging and don&#x27;t mind the small portions because I rarely if ever hit pan on any eyeshadows. The mirror is a good size but I think it may be a little warped. Overall, I&#x27;m glad I got it (not really a loss since some other items in the box were good) but I won&#x27;t be running to buy any more CS eye colors.</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented, exactly what I was looking for. The white seems to be more of a highlighter instead of a color. I have plenty of other white colors so this was not a disappointment. The yellow and silver are vibrant. The dark colors need to be used with caution. The perfect amount will do the trick.</li>
            <li> I received this product after watching a few youtube videos on makeup and Coastal Scents keep appearing in some of the videos I enjoyed. This product received fairly quickly (almost 7 days for APO), however the quality of the colors are not worth you purchasing!! Trust me, I have to use primer to make it look halfway decent. These colors do well on top of ofter colors, not alone. They are not as rich as they look and i was fairly disappointed. I mainly use the mirror for personal use or two colors out of the palette. Sad purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice product but somewhat smaller than i expected.</li>
            <li> Pretty Palet not a great color pay off though.</li>
            <li> A nice color selection for eye shadow, particularly for blue eyes.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this palette because the colors are everything I use in multiple palettes that I purchase at the store. The picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice; there is a lot of shimmer in the golds &amp; reds that I didn&#x27;t expect. I&#x27;m anxious to wear the forest green, too!! Just lovely!</li>
            <li> The colors aren&#x27;t as pigmented as they look. I used an e.l.f. eye shadow primer and it didn&#x27;t help at all. The colors are pretty and I am glad I found an eyeshadow palette that compliments my medium skin tone but otherwise disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t show up when applied.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing eye pallet! The colors are great! I usually never use every color on the pallet but with this one I do.  It it&#x27;s lasting me forever because you don&#x27;t have to use a lot!  I will definitely be buying this again and I highly recommend it to you too!</li>
            <li> These are some of my standard colors I like to wear so this is my on the go shadow kit!</li>
            <li> Love the dark colors but the size of the palette is deceiving it&#x27;s smaller than the picture shown, but handy</li>
            <li> Colors are just like they look on the swatches. They aren&#x27;t chalky, they are just perfect. I have really fair skin and some of the colors don&#x27;t really suit me, but they are just how they look in the pictures.</li>
            <li> I loved the colors but when I opened it some of the palettes were broken. I really dont know if I will be able to use it. Not good!</li>
            <li> Great palette, love the colors. They don&#x27;t crease, but they do fade. I use the elf shimmer primer, so it may work better with another primer. Love it though!!</li>
            <li> great neutral colors for school. They go perfect with any look. It has your darks and your lights. It has your shimmery colors and your mats.</li>
            <li> I really like these natural earthy colors. Especially when some shadows are matted. Very wearable for the everyday make-up. Oh and the price is amazing too!</li>
            <li> This is a great little compact of neutral/brown type eye shadows. The case has a nice size mirror and the 12 colors are versatile enough to make this a great travel shadow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a couple of &#x27;criticisms&#x27; (nothing major)--the compact does not come with an applicator. I used an eye shadow brush first time round and found that the dark dusky and midnight blues did a lot of \\&quot;sprinkling.\\&quot; Didn&#x27;t find that so much with the browns. I also would prefer a different selection for highlighting under the brow. Of the two highlighters, one has a blue base and the other a yellowish base. Would prefer a more beigy base. Just my preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the dime sized colors, the selections in the Cairo palette can take you from work to evening to clubbing if you wish. You can do a &#x27;regular&#x27; eye or a smokey eye. You can also mix the colors to darken or lighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great value for the money. The eye shadows while not Chanel (duh at this price?) are also not cheap drugstore Christmas gift specials...you know the type you buy with dozens of dime sized colors and when you go to try them they flake, crumble and smear?  None of that with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to use this on a trip next month. With the good sized mirror and the versatility of the colors--all I need to add is some concealer, lip gloss and mascara as well as an applicator and I&#x27;ll be ready for any activity!</li>
            <li> Ok so this palette is ok size at first I was a little scared to buy it because I thought it would be very little but it&#x27;s good size I love the colors and I have no problems with it that&#x27;s just me!! (:</li>
            <li> I usually buy make-up at Walmart or Walgreens. After running across this brand (and similar ones) on amazon, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It&#x27;s not as great as I was hoping. Everyone went and on about how bright and pigmented they are. They weren&#x27;t for me. And I didn&#x27;t really care for the glittery ones. It got to the point where I just gave up and stopped wearing eyeshadow. Ulta&#x27;s eyeshadows are way more pigmented than this!</li>
            <li> Love the colors not sure if I will buy this again not to pigmented for me pretty palette though love coastal scents products.</li>
            <li> I love this palette because I primarily wear neutral makeup. The eyeshadows have great pigment and the colors are beautiful. It reminds me of the more expensive Urban Decay Naked 2 palette. Love it!</li>
            <li> I loved using this for smokey eyeshadow. Well, for the 2 weeks the palette stayed intact.&lt;br /&gt;I opened it up one day and half the eyeshadows had almost exploded, and got everywhere. I had a similar experience with the Coastal Scents Contour palette, as well.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like these products.</li>
            <li> I gave this three stars because I like the colors. But the colors don&#x27;t blend well. The pigmentation is kind of lacking and I need to reply these shadows more often than any other palette I own.</li>
            <li> The colors are really nice, and with any mix of them, it gives a great look for any event, show,  or gathering.</li>
            <li> The palette is bulky given the sizes of the eyeshadows but that is about the only drawback.  It is a good neutral palette to take with you for dance gigs and the like.</li>
            <li> I recieved the product earlier than expected, It came in great condition. I expected the color pallete to be a little bigger than in person, but the colors are amazing!</li>
            <li> Has some fallout.  Good colors.</li>
            <li> Love these eyeshadows, very nice colors and quality.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about buying this pallet..a friend told me about and I decided to give it a try. When I received it in the mail it did have bubble wrap around it but when I opened it some of the colors were all broken. I was pretty upset. The colors are awesome but just hate the fact it&#x27;s all broken.</li>
            <li> Being a cosmetologist, I look for exceptional quality and I am telling you this stuff is like the brands you pay for at the cosmetic counters, and really goes on like MAC!!!!  I think MAC uses this manufacturer.  Also, you do not get so much that you will never use it and love the color combinations they offer.  Try just one, believ me you will never buy name brand again, like Estee Lauder, Mac etc...  The only one that I think is better is the Chanel line, but then again, it is Chanel!  LOL</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product! I am allergic to EVERYTHING cosmetic- even the so call hypoallergenic products have me with blood shot weepy eyes in minutes. I figured I would give this product a go- its a great price and if it didn&#x27;t work out my daughter would use it. She was praying for me to be allergic to it! The colors are lovely. I did my usual allergy test of smearing liberal amounts all over an eye and waiting for the misery to start- it never came! I tested it again by smearing a good amount around my eye before bed and the next morning my eyes were still clear! Even more amazing the product was still as bright as when I first applied. I can&#x27;t believe I found something cheap and awesome that I am not allergic to! I will be buying again. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> the colors are great, its is a little small its not a really big palette but i love it, im thinking of buying other one because  love the colors so much. it is worth it!!</li>
            <li> The colors in this palette are very good.  It would be a much better product if it had either a eyeshadow applicator or a place to put your own applicator.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price. The pigments are really strong and stay on all day, even through sweat. I used ELF primer underneath and didn&#x27;t want to come off at all.</li>
            <li> This palette is very small and portable. The colors are versatile and the gold and white are the colors I mostly use every day. One problem is when you buy this you undoubtedly will have 1 or 2 broken eyeshadow pockets. Fortunately Amazon.com&#x27;s return policy is really awesome.</li>
