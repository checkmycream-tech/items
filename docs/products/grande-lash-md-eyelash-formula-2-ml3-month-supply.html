            <li> Amazing product. My lashes actually grew!! I&#x27;m Recommending this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have very short eye lashes and Grande Lash Md Eyelash Formula&lt;br /&gt;keeps my eyelashes double the normal length.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worthy. I love that products.</li>
            <li> Helped my lashes recover from nearly four years of wearing lash extensions. After I stopped using them, my lashes were short and thin. I tried different things, mainly organic oils, to help them grow. Nothing has worked but this. After only a couple of months using this my lashes are growing longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> It really works with me. I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 2 years now.</li>
            <li> Thickened my lashes which is what they needed. Also made them a bit longer.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! My eyelashes are getting super long and that includes the bottom lashes too! My mom and my mother in law have gotten amazing results too!</li>
            <li> This is product to grow lashes.  I think it works.</li>
            <li> Have been using for about 3 weeks and can notice fuller longer lashes :)</li>
            <li> This is my second  time ordering the product.  It works very well , no need to use mascara after a month of daily use.</li>
            <li> Need eyelashes or brows?  Buy this product.  After just 4 weeks, I have gorgeous thick lashes and brows. It&#x27;s a miracle.</li>
            <li> As with anything where people say it works dramatically I was a little skeptical at first... I read many of the previous reviews before purchasing and I thought it was too good to be true but I&#x27;ll give it a try hoping that it worked as good as they said.  It took a couple of weeks for it to really kick in but after that my eyelashes seemed to grow almost daily!  I didn&#x27;t have super short eyelashes to begin with but I did want to make them a little longer and thicker and after using it nightly I literally had to slow down because they were almost reaching my eyebrows once I put on mascara!  My lashes seemed to almost get thicker and darker and I especially loved the growth of my lower lashes.  It definitely is a &amp;#34;must try&amp;#34; for anyone who is trying to grow them out and/or making them thicker!  Made a believer out of me :o)</li>
            <li> Think twice about buying this. It works well but there is hardly anything in the tube. This isn&#x27;t a fluke either, this was my third (and final) tube. I can&#x27;t afford the rip off.</li>
            <li> As I have aged I have less eyelashes and they are short which makes them hard to see.  I was told about the GrandeLash and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This product works!  I really noticed a difference after two weeks of using the product AM and PM.  I look like I have fake lashes when I have mascara on!!!</li>
            <li> It really works!!! I use it on my eyebrows too.</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with my GrandeLash!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every night for 4 weeks and do not see any difference. Hopefully by 8 weeks it will change.</li>
            <li> Love Grande Lash!  This is my second time to use it.  It works like crazy!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping. Great produce.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. I saw a remarkable difference in my lashes in just one month.</li>
            <li> Been using for sometime and happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It was a 5 star for me.  Didn&#x27;t want to spend for Rx, so I tried this and was very pleased.  My lashes grew more than I expected and I loved the product.  Will order again and again.  By the way I&#x27;m 72 and wear contacts and this is much better than falsies.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I now have long lashes for first time in my life. I actually bought an eyelash curler - never able to use one before</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product! Anyone who struggles with thinning eyebrows should be using it!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works really well. All except the latest tube I purchased from Great Look: hercosme. The product was in a slightly different color container than any I&#x27;ve previously owned. The slight tingle was barely evident. I&#x27;m not sure if it was simply a bad tube or a knock off. I contacted the seller to determine a resolution to the problem, and was told that it was passed the 30 day window. This is unfortunate, because I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt in their defective product, so I continued to use it. I will not be purchasing again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the results.  It look a little longer than expected.  I didn&#x27;t see results for about four weeks but once they started, it was amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been asked if I have eyelash extensions</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd purchase of this product.  It really works and this was priced very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!! Highly recommend. My eye lashes have never looked so beautiful!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It works fast. Only downside is that it turns my skin around eyes a little reddish/brown and my eyes red for a couple days after using. I use about 2 times per week.</li>
            <li> This thing is works . I love it !!! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I used Grandelash for 2 months and got very large dark under eye circles all around my eyes. I look like a panda. My dermatologist told me to stop using it immediately.  She said eyelash serums are known to be the cause of the darkness.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any changes.</li>
            <li> Lashes definitely are longer,  but not thicker .  I will continue to use this product</li>
            <li> Minor irritation the first couple days and then nothing. Still waiting to see results- has been about 2-3 wks and no huge change yet.</li>
            <li> Good product that I have been using for long.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Nilda Acle</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have color… It&#x27;s for lengthening eyelashes</li>
            <li> I have used this product now for about 4 months with no side effects , no skin discolor no change of eye color I love this product Everyone thinks I am wearing fake eyelashes It s a great product</li>
            <li> It works great for me, my eye lashes are long and fuller.  Great item.  Judy Hanson</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for way over a year now and it has definitely made my thin, menopausal eyelashes grow again! I would definitely recommend it, just save some for me!!!!</li>
            <li> Fabulous and IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> After using product for 2 months , I see no difference.</li>
