            <li>I feel safe in stating that this is unscented and very pleasant without an oily feel..</li>
            <li>good thing is it makes my skin feel good</li>

            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the lotion so far.</li>
            <li>this product is great for people that try to achieve the natural tone of your skin color.</li>
            <li>and my skin is smooth and silky...</li>
            <li>How will I know important information about the product if I cannot understand the instructions or read the ingredients?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smooth and non sticky .</li>
            <li>Meaning I order this a lot....now with summer in full swing I need the UV protection....still need to limit sun</li>
            <li>So, even with it not being full strength, it seems to be lightening my skin.  </li>
            <li>Despite the 400ml , it&#x27;s worth the buy .</li>
            <li>Its goes on smooth and dries up pretty fast...</li>
            <li>After using this regularly for almost four months, I can say confidently that it  does not lighten skin.</li>
            <li>i really reconminded</li>
            <li>It doesnt really work as it stated on the description.</li>
            <li>Used the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>Good but rather thin consistency.</li>
            <li>I had second thoughts at first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not dramatic, but there is an obvious difference.  </li>
            <li>I used nivea lightening cream before and the results were very noticeable even though I was using it sporadically (and using it only on my hands).</li>

            <li> I used nivea lightening cream before and the results were very noticeable even though I was using it sporadically (and using it only on my hands).</li>
            <li> but this didn&#x27;t moisturize it long enough either.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin totally moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> I guess my skin might be extra dry</li>
            <li> After using this product on my face for a few months (I know it&#x27;s not exactly for the face, but I wanted to try it there), I have to say it really does work in brightening up your complexion.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived later than expected.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a bit long.</li>
            <li> maybe due to it coming from another country.</li>
            <li> Its a little expensive and for the size, its worth buying it.</li>
            <li> So I was expecting the same results this time, but when the product arrived and I saw the entire label was in a different language than the previous one, I suspected this was a fake - or at least a subpar version.</li>
            <li> as I don&#x27;t use it everyday and when I do, I mix it in my hand with Amlactin lotion with 12% Lactic Acid and a little Almond Oil.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday after my shower and I can&#x27;t recall if it has a scent.</li>
            <li> It takes some time, but with a little patience you&#x27;ll see the results!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure why I&#x27;m not getting any whiter even after a year.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product.</li>

            <li> Love it will buy more after this bottles i have it works great!</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t lighten skin it just moisturizes</li>
            <li> After using this regularly for almost four months, I can say confidently that it  does not lighten skin. I used nivea lightening cream before and the results were very noticeable even though I was using it sporadically (and using it only on my hands). So I was expecting the same results this time, but when the product arrived and I saw the entire label was in a different language than the previous one, I suspected this was a fake - or at least a subpar version. The lack of results confirms it</li>

            <li> Works great for just borns. Ask your doctor before applying.&lt;br /&gt;My sisters kid seemed to have gained good&lt;br /&gt;complexion after using this.</li>
            <li> Love it this stuff! smell awesome, I don&#x27;t see any whitening yet, but I will use it everyday just for the delicious smell!!</li>
            <li> Meaning I order this a lot....now with summer in full swing I need the UV protection....still need to limit sun but I still need the UV protection as an African American female.  Nivea keeps my skin glowing.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> The product arrived later than expected. maybe due to it coming from another country. I&#x27;m happy with the lotion so far. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
            <li> Its goes on smooth and dries up pretty fast... ive beeen using it for a week now and my skin is smooth and silky... I haven&#x27;t seen brightness yet but I&#x27;ll continue to use it...</li>
            <li> I have used the entire bottle as of today, trust when I say no results achieved. I am very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I had second thoughts at first but honestly this is the perfect cream. I suffered from sun burn and I been using this cream for about two weeks and I can definitely see a difference. My skin is smoother and lighter. Its a little expensive and for the size, its worth buying it.</li>
            <li> Giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because all but the product name on the bottle is in an Asian language.  How will I know important information about the product if I cannot understand the instructions or read the ingredients?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t take away from the fact that it seems to be working.  Today makes 2 weeks since I received it and began using it (likely started the next day).  I can see a lightening of my skin (on my body).  It&#x27;s not dramatic, but there is an obvious difference.  I&#x27;m impressed, as I don&#x27;t use it everyday and when I do, I mix it in my hand with Amlactin lotion with 12% Lactic Acid and a little Almond Oil.  So, even with it not being full strength, it seems to be lightening my skin.  Hoping it will work on my hard-to-lighten elbows eventually.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing is it makes my skin feel good after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But i&#x27;m not sure why I&#x27;m not getting any whiter even after a year.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I guess my skin might be extra dry but this didn&#x27;t moisturize it long enough either.</li>
            <li> Looking to repair my sun damaged neven toned skin. I cannot rate this prodct yet.I have not used it yet.Iwill say this product reached my home in a 2-5 day period.</li>
            <li> What a great stuff !!!</li>
            <li> this product is great for people that try to achieve the natural tone of your skin color. refresh an amazing also it had a uv ray that help you from sun light damage. i really reconminded</li>
            <li> Good but rather thin consistency. Does what it states lightens spots and discoloration but does not bleach your color, this is what&lt;br /&gt;  I love.</li>
            <li> It doesnt really work as it stated on the description. I have keep using for a month but I see no result</li>
            <li> Used the whole bottle. Smells good but didn&#x27;t motive any difference. Shipping took a bit long.</li>
            <li> Does not whiten anything like it says</li>
            <li> Smooth and non sticky . One push is all you need . Great whitening effect too ! And it dried fast after you applied to your body . Despite the 400ml , it&#x27;s worth the buy .</li>
            <li> I love it.  It keeps my skin totally moisturized all day long. Minnesota&#x27;s climate takes a definite toll on my skin. This stuff is a God-send. I use it everyday after my shower and I can&#x27;t recall if it has a scent. I feel safe in stating that this is unscented and very pleasant without an oily feel..</li>
