            <li>I have ordered twice from these folks with good results&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>have had good results with DHS products.</li>
            <li>and she loved it also.</li>
            <li>Good cleanser</li>
            <li>it lathers surprisingly well</li>
            <li>I loved this shampoo until they changed to the Improved Formula.  </li>
            <li>Great lather, no perfume smell, very clean rinse and great shine.&lt;br /&gt;The hoser</li>
            <li>It lathers nice, it has no fragrance but has some sort of neutral pleasant scent still.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find it on Amazon because I could not find it the store here in TN.</li>
            <li>My eczema did get better, and this shampoo works great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li>Found this and fell in love!</li>
            <li>I am very happy to have found this mild, clear shampoo, which is also an excellent shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Liked it but bothered my eyes</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair conditioned and feeling nice.</li>
            <li>The lather is nice and there is virtually no scent (not even chemicals).</li>
            <li>My hair is clean and manageable and the conditioner is great for tangles and softening my hair.  </li>
            <li>Rinses easily off skin, and tea tree oil is good for skin anyhow.</li>
            <li>As I said its good for people with sensitivities or that are easily irritated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of shampoos and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>If you looking for a fragrance free shampoo, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>I have used the original formula for many years and have depended on it and loved it.  </li>
            <li>pretty happy.</li>
            <li>Have used any number of times by now and find the cleaning good and the effect on the scalp mild.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>Why do I love it?  </li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t have any perfumes added.</li>
            <li>Clear and odor free  best my hair has felt in years  </li>
            <li>The brand I found in Walgreens does not agree as well for body wash as does the DHS or the Aura.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I LOVE the DHS for both body and hair</li>
            <li>Switch back to your old formula!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve yet to find a fragrance-free shampoo that I love.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I have skin allergies and this was on my safe list.  </li>
            <li>I am sure he will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure will do so,again.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Got a sample of this at my dermatologist and I love it.</li>
            <li>For my dermatitis, there&#x27;s nothing better.</li>
            <li>I have used DHS Shampoo for many years.  </li>
            <li>and it is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>Very clean and no chemicals.</li>
            <li>Best daily shampoo, rich lather, silky</li>
            <li>Got a sample from dermatologist and loved it, so ordered a large bottle.  </li>
            <li>older I get, the more I wonder whether Karl Marx may have had some good ideas after</li>
            <li>This is my favorite fragrance free shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance free, ph balanced, yet my hair has never felt better.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for the \\&quot;other day\\&quot; shampooing.</li>
            <li>It was recommended to me by a dermatologist as being very mild on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Easy to rinse.</li>
            <li>but this one gets a strong 4 and in practical terms I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
            <li>This one seemed fine, but it ends up that I am having a food/plant allergy and shampoo</li>
            <li>It seems to make my fine hair thicker</li>
            <li>I was having a mild allergic reaction to most shampoos I tried, including those purchased at stores stocking \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and non-allergenic products.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo works great, but definitely needs a conditioner to go along with it.  </li>
            <li>I have found a fragrance free shampoo in Walgeens,  but it leaves my hair oily.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d be covered with pus filled bumps all over my head.</li>
            <li>Fantastic shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance free, does the job well and</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found any fragrance free</li>
            <li>She also prescribed scalp lotion but this  helped to significantly decrease the scalp itching.</li>
            <li>It cleans my hair wonderfully while leaving my sensitive scalp quiet and pain free.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and manageable.  </li>
            <li>so I was getting build up around the beads and couldn&#x27;t get my scalp clean.</li>
            <li>or they didn&#x27;t clean my hair.</li>
            <li>But, it doesn&#x27;t separate, isn&#x27;t perfumed, doesn&#x27;t smell like a chemical factory, and gets my hair clean.</li>
            <li>It feels so clean after I shampoo and stays clean longer.</li>
            <li>Shiny clean hair</li>
            <li>We bought it not only for out own use but recommended it to many people.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out, while stil getting my hair clean</li>
            <li>so I need a mild shampoo that will clean the chemicals from my scalp without washing ALL the dye from my hair.</li>
            <li>Being very allergic to many products including fragrances I have used DHS products for years</li>
            <li>My hair just doesn&#x27;t feel as good as it does when I use the regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While nothing is as good as my salon products from the past, it&#x27;s nice to feel like a girl again and not some hippie who doesn&#x27;t bathe.</li>
            <li>Old formula worked great &amp; the new does not.</li>
            <li>It was ok, but I found that the Free and Clear conditioner leaves my hair silkier and goes farther than the one from DHS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>quickly, packed well.</li>
            <li>And while I am so very truly thankful to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for carrying the Aura brand of hair products (they saved me for many years as they were the ONLY truly unscented brand I could find for many years--and I am so grateful!)</li>
            <li>DHS Shampoo has worked great...and it is not expensive like the prescription shampoos we tried!</li>
            <li>Most fragrance free tend to either be a bit dry or a bit light or just not quite 5 star</li>
            <li>I do, however, live in an area with very clean water.  </li>
            <li>But to be careful I only use it during flares and it is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>I have rarely had any scalp irritations since I have been using the DHS products.</li>
            <li>but so far I love the way it makes my hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for those with true contact dermatitis, fragrance allergies!</li>
            <li>It has really made helped my scalp look good and put the right nutrients back into my hair.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li>price is right.</li>
            <li>My hair stays clean so much longer when I use DHS shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance free shampoo does a great job cleaning your hair but doesn&#x27;t have a lot of chemicals that are irritating.  </li>
            <li>The scent free was only available to us on-line.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and easy to manage</li>
            <li>After I received my first 16 oz.</li>
            <li>This helped him from the moment he first tried it.</li>
            <li>I have had problems with fragrances since January and have changed all of my products and tried many different replacements.  </li>
            <li>The Free &amp; Clear didn&#x27;t irritate my scalp, but is runny and doesn&#x27;t lather well.</li>
            <li>Just like most products I&#x27;ve come across with &amp;#34;new &amp; improved&amp;#34; written on the item, it seems to be a money saving maneuver by the manufacturer, that is keep the same price with inferior ingredients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, by my experience: DHS Shampoo, Free and Clear conditioner is the power duo for fragrance-free shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>No weird smell, cleans well without over-cleaning.</li>
            <li>(propylene glycol) used as a preservitive and binder many products from shampoos, liquid laundry detergent, salad dressings such as ranch, boxed cake mixes, some mayonnaise.</li>
            <li>I am able to use this daily without conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have used DHS Clear shampoo for many years and had been very satisfied with the product in the past.</li>
            <li>It was apparent that the consistency of the shampoo, which used to be more like a gel, was now much thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Used this product for a few years, loved it.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use and for sensitive scalps.  </li>
            <li>My husband ad I really like this product, it foams up nicely, better than the last in scented product I used.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works well, is very gentle and suds up really well.  </li>
            <li>I just wanted to add a positive post for those of you that are thinking about it but can&#x27;t make up your mind.  </li>
            <li>since long ago I had learned not to shampoo more than twice a week</li>
            <li>Nice thick, rich lather  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Looking through all of Amazon&#x27;s offerings my eye landed on DHS Clear Shampoo and the good ratings other customers had given it.</li>
            <li>I tend to have sensitive skin / scalp and mild eczema.  </li>
            <li>have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very silky, it lathers well.</li>
            <li>Gentle on hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the DHS shampoo, but don&#x27;t recommend the DHS conditioner.  </li>
            <li>to try - Earth&#x27;s Science which is on the way thanks to Amazon.</li>
            <li>That was the whole purpose of using this shampoo in this 1st place.</li>
            <li>very concentrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had issues with scalp irritations my whole life.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped him a lot with a scalp/ear problem.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist wants me to try some shampoos for a period and see how they do.  </li>
            <li>Non-irritating and gentle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve have used it twice now and while I&#x27;m still not entirely itch free elsewhere my scalp is no longer irritated.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>If you get too much, you have lather everywhere.</li>
            <li>I recently traveled to an area with harder water and my hair didn&#x27;t feel as clean, but that was more the water than the product.    </li>
            <li>I started using the first bottle from my most recent order, it quickly became apparent that several things had changed.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s better than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.    </li>
            <li>I like it, and like the fact that there are fewer ingredients than many other shampoos.</li>
            <li>I wash my eyes and hair with this shampoo specifically to keep my pores open and clean.</li>
            <li>This behaves just like the normal shampoo I knew and loved before my scalp started acting up due to my allergy to fragrance.</li>
            <li>And thinning down the consistency of the shampoo means you have to use a lot more of it than before to get an equivalent lather.</li>
            <li>We found DHS Clear Shampoo after trying about a half dozen different shampoos available via the Internet and it is much better at cleaning hair, rinsing out etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably order some more in the future, just from a different supplier.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for something high performance shampoo then this may not be the one for you.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I have chronic dermatology issues and this product was highly recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>order this shampoo for one of my daughters who is highly  sensitivity to normal shampoos.</li>
            <li>DHS Clear Shampoo is working for gentle cleaning of my hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li>I really thought this product might be a natural way to take care of my dandruff.</li>
            <li>Not my normal</li>
            <li>I am ordering my second 16 0z bottle right now.  </li>
            <li>Then, when I turned the bottle upside-down and gently squeezed it, as I have done in the past, a lot more shampoo dropped into my hand than I had anticipated, much more than in the past.</li>
            <li>The new ingredients are like everybody else.  </li>
            <li>Even the Dermatologist Recommended statement remains on the new product and should be removed.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a shampoo without a lot of heavy chemicals and it does not have a strong perfume smell.</li>
            <li>My dermetologist recommended this because I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Even with very sensitive skin I can use it every day (and have been using it for years now).</li>
            <li>my seborrheic dematitis and my excema started to clear up immediately!</li>
            <li>Many \\&quot;fragrance-free\\&quot; products stretch the meaning of that term, with twenty or thirty ingredients including floral essences and other obvious allergens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For consumers who still have an old bottle, I recommend saving the toggle-switch cap and use it on the new bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding certain products fragrance free, so my scalp will flare if I have to use them.</li>
            <li>There are lot of weird chemicals in shampoos, so switching to this was a very good idea if you&#x27;re not ready to go completely &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>DHS Clear is the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this in the past so based on past experience it is a great product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>dhs clear shampoo works.</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis and extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It helps with my sensitive skin as well as performing well as a shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried two so far.</li>
            <li>so my dermatologist recommended this shampoo to rule out that my skin is sensitive to ingredients in shampoo.</li>
            <li>Just what my husband needed for his sensitive hands.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It may my hair soft and manageable with</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and supple.</li>
            <li>theory is that these changes were all made with the following intention: to get the consumer to use up the contents of a bottle much quicker than before in order to increase sales.</li>
            <li>In fact, I could not find the words &amp;#34;Dermatologist Recommended&amp;#34; on my old bottle.</li>
            <li>This is the only one that really works for me.</li>
            <li>I have found that I am sensitive to the dyes/fragrances/preservatives in a number of shampoos.  </li>
            <li>compared the list of ingredients on my old and new bottles, and I noticed the order of 2 ingredients had changed, and one ingredient called &amp;#34;Cocamide MEA&amp;#34; had been apparently replaced by &amp;#34;Cocamidepropyl Hydroxysultaine&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, on rechecking this out, even when I used 3 times as much shampoo as before, I was not able to produce an adequate amount of lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you really need the absence of anything except the cleaning agents.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend buying the smaller version first if you&#x27;re still going to try it</li>
            <li>It might have been a decent shampoo to alternate with 1-2 per week but at $15 for a 16 ounce, I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li>I have finally found my new favorite shampoo and conditioner (with no more reactions to fragrances)!  </li>
            <li>Such is the case with the new DHS clear shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have severe sensitivity to scents and the new &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; formula  has a scent that was not present before.  </li>
            <li>In particular, I was looking for a shampoo that was free of scent of unnecessary</li>
            <li>Some of the shampoos came from beauty shops, general shopping stores, and even a prescription</li>
            <li>In a last ditch effort, I bought this DHS Clear off of Amazon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m apparently allergic to everything.</li>
            <li>[a lot of fragrance-free shampoos barely lather].</li>
            <li>It was highly recommended to me by the dermatologist two years ago due to my sensitive scalp and this stuff works.  </li>
            <li>It is odd to use as it is completely transparent so you have to look closely to see how much is in your hand when you use it.  </li>
            <li>It rinses cleanly and a little of the shampoo goes a long way.</li>
            <li>have an intense respiratory issue and also asthma, and any perfume will cause extreme distress with my breathing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Which is a very brief list of rather common, cheap chemicals.  </li>
            <li>But, definitely use the DHS Clear on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I alternate the clear and zinc shampoos daily and also use the conditioner/rinse.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t seem to need a lot to get my thick hair clean.  </li>
            <li>All this literature about TEA laurel sulfate has not been validated, at least not any more so than the other sulfates.  </li>
            <li>Because it hasn&#x27;t been on my pharmacy shelves for a long time, I&#x27;ve had to special order it through the pharmacy, usually ordering three 16 oz.</li>
            <li>The new cap and the thinner shampoo makes it harder to control the amount of shampoo being dispensed.</li>
            <li>My thin fine hair has body even without using mousse or gels.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Good cleanser</li>
            <li> it lathers surprisingly well</li>
            <li> I loved this shampoo until they changed to the Improved Formula.  </li>

            <li> It lathers nice, it has no fragrance but has some sort of neutral pleasant scent still.</li>

            <li> My eczema did get better, and this shampoo works great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> Found this and fell in love!</li>
            <li> I am very happy to have found this mild, clear shampoo, which is also an excellent shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Liked it but bothered my eyes</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair conditioned and feeling nice.</li>
            <li> The lather is nice and there is virtually no scent (not even chemicals).</li>
            <li> My hair is clean and manageable and the conditioner is great for tangles and softening my hair.  </li>
            <li> Rinses easily off skin, and tea tree oil is good for skin anyhow.</li>
            <li> As I said its good for people with sensitivities or that are easily irritated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of shampoos and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> If you looking for a fragrance free shampoo, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> I have used the original formula for many years and have depended on it and loved it.  </li>
            <li> pretty happy.</li>
            <li> Have used any number of times by now and find the cleaning good and the effect on the scalp mild.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> Why do I love it?  </li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t have any perfumes added.</li>
            <li> Clear and odor free  best my hair has felt in years  </li>
            <li> The brand I found in Walgreens does not agree as well for body wash as does the DHS or the Aura.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I LOVE the DHS for both body and hair</li>
            <li> Switch back to your old formula!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to find a fragrance-free shampoo that I love.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I have skin allergies and this was on my safe list.  </li>
            <li> I am sure he will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure will do so,again.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Got a sample of this at my dermatologist and I love it.</li>
            <li> For my dermatitis, there&#x27;s nothing better.</li>
            <li> I have used DHS Shampoo for many years.  </li>
            <li> and it is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> Very clean and no chemicals.</li>
            <li> Best daily shampoo, rich lather, silky</li>
            <li> Got a sample from dermatologist and loved it, so ordered a large bottle.  </li>
            <li> older I get, the more I wonder whether Karl Marx may have had some good ideas after</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance free shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragrance free, ph balanced, yet my hair has never felt better.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for the \\&quot;other day\\&quot; shampooing.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by a dermatologist as being very mild on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Easy to rinse.</li>
            <li> but this one gets a strong 4 and in practical terms I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
            <li> This one seemed fine, but it ends up that I am having a food/plant allergy and shampoo</li>
            <li> It seems to make my fine hair thicker</li>
            <li> I was having a mild allergic reaction to most shampoos I tried, including those purchased at stores stocking \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and non-allergenic products.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo works great, but definitely needs a conditioner to go along with it.  </li>
            <li> I have found a fragrance free shampoo in Walgeens,  but it leaves my hair oily.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d be covered with pus filled bumps all over my head.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Fragrance free, does the job well and</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found any fragrance free</li>
            <li> She also prescribed scalp lotion but this  helped to significantly decrease the scalp itching.</li>
            <li> It cleans my hair wonderfully while leaving my sensitive scalp quiet and pain free.</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean and manageable.  </li>
            <li> so I was getting build up around the beads and couldn&#x27;t get my scalp clean.</li>
            <li> or they didn&#x27;t clean my hair.</li>
            <li> But, it doesn&#x27;t separate, isn&#x27;t perfumed, doesn&#x27;t smell like a chemical factory, and gets my hair clean.</li>
            <li> It feels so clean after I shampoo and stays clean longer.</li>
            <li> Shiny clean hair</li>
            <li> We bought it not only for out own use but recommended it to many people.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out, while stil getting my hair clean</li>
            <li> so I need a mild shampoo that will clean the chemicals from my scalp without washing ALL the dye from my hair.</li>
            <li> Being very allergic to many products including fragrances I have used DHS products for years</li>
            <li> My hair just doesn&#x27;t feel as good as it does when I use the regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While nothing is as good as my salon products from the past, it&#x27;s nice to feel like a girl again and not some hippie who doesn&#x27;t bathe.</li>
            <li> Old formula worked great &amp; the new does not.</li>
            <li> It was ok, but I found that the Free and Clear conditioner leaves my hair silkier and goes farther than the one from DHS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> quickly, packed well.</li>
            <li> And while I am so very truly thankful to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for carrying the Aura brand of hair products (they saved me for many years as they were the ONLY truly unscented brand I could find for many years--and I am so grateful!)</li>
            <li> DHS Shampoo has worked great...and it is not expensive like the prescription shampoos we tried!</li>
            <li> Most fragrance free tend to either be a bit dry or a bit light or just not quite 5 star</li>
            <li> I do, however, live in an area with very clean water.  </li>
            <li> But to be careful I only use it during flares and it is wonderful!  </li>
            <li> I have rarely had any scalp irritations since I have been using the DHS products.</li>
            <li> but so far I love the way it makes my hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for those with true contact dermatitis, fragrance allergies!</li>
            <li> It has really made helped my scalp look good and put the right nutrients back into my hair.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li> price is right.</li>
            <li> My hair stays clean so much longer when I use DHS shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This fragrance free shampoo does a great job cleaning your hair but doesn&#x27;t have a lot of chemicals that are irritating.  </li>
            <li> The scent free was only available to us on-line.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and easy to manage</li>
            <li> After I received my first 16 oz.</li>
            <li> This helped him from the moment he first tried it.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with fragrances since January and have changed all of my products and tried many different replacements.  </li>
            <li> The Free &amp; Clear didn&#x27;t irritate my scalp, but is runny and doesn&#x27;t lather well.</li>
            <li> Just like most products I&#x27;ve come across with &amp;#34;new &amp; improved&amp;#34; written on the item, it seems to be a money saving maneuver by the manufacturer, that is keep the same price with inferior ingredients.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, by my experience: DHS Shampoo, Free and Clear conditioner is the power duo for fragrance-free shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> No weird smell, cleans well without over-cleaning.</li>
            <li> (propylene glycol) used as a preservitive and binder many products from shampoos, liquid laundry detergent, salad dressings such as ranch, boxed cake mixes, some mayonnaise.</li>
            <li> I am able to use this daily without conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have used DHS Clear shampoo for many years and had been very satisfied with the product in the past.</li>
            <li> It was apparent that the consistency of the shampoo, which used to be more like a gel, was now much thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Used this product for a few years, loved it.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use and for sensitive scalps.  </li>
            <li> My husband ad I really like this product, it foams up nicely, better than the last in scented product I used.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works well, is very gentle and suds up really well.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted to add a positive post for those of you that are thinking about it but can&#x27;t make up your mind.  </li>
            <li> since long ago I had learned not to shampoo more than twice a week</li>
            <li> Nice thick, rich lather  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Looking through all of Amazon&#x27;s offerings my eye landed on DHS Clear Shampoo and the good ratings other customers had given it.</li>
            <li> I tend to have sensitive skin / scalp and mild eczema.  </li>
            <li> have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very silky, it lathers well.</li>
            <li> Gentle on hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the DHS shampoo, but don&#x27;t recommend the DHS conditioner.  </li>
            <li> to try - Earth&#x27;s Science which is on the way thanks to Amazon.</li>
            <li> That was the whole purpose of using this shampoo in this 1st place.</li>
            <li> very concentrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had issues with scalp irritations my whole life.  </li>
            <li> It has really helped him a lot with a scalp/ear problem.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist wants me to try some shampoos for a period and see how they do.  </li>
            <li> Non-irritating and gentle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have used it twice now and while I&#x27;m still not entirely itch free elsewhere my scalp is no longer irritated.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> If you get too much, you have lather everywhere.</li>
            <li> I recently traveled to an area with harder water and my hair didn&#x27;t feel as clean, but that was more the water than the product.    </li>
            <li> I started using the first bottle from my most recent order, it quickly became apparent that several things had changed.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s better than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.    </li>
            <li> I like it, and like the fact that there are fewer ingredients than many other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I wash my eyes and hair with this shampoo specifically to keep my pores open and clean.</li>
            <li> This behaves just like the normal shampoo I knew and loved before my scalp started acting up due to my allergy to fragrance.</li>
            <li> And thinning down the consistency of the shampoo means you have to use a lot more of it than before to get an equivalent lather.</li>
            <li> We found DHS Clear Shampoo after trying about a half dozen different shampoos available via the Internet and it is much better at cleaning hair, rinsing out etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably order some more in the future, just from a different supplier.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for something high performance shampoo then this may not be the one for you.</li>
            <li> We highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I have chronic dermatology issues and this product was highly recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> order this shampoo for one of my daughters who is highly  sensitivity to normal shampoos.</li>
            <li> DHS Clear Shampoo is working for gentle cleaning of my hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> I really thought this product might be a natural way to take care of my dandruff.</li>
            <li> Not my normal</li>
            <li> I am ordering my second 16 0z bottle right now.  </li>
            <li> Then, when I turned the bottle upside-down and gently squeezed it, as I have done in the past, a lot more shampoo dropped into my hand than I had anticipated, much more than in the past.</li>
            <li> The new ingredients are like everybody else.  </li>
            <li> Even the Dermatologist Recommended statement remains on the new product and should be removed.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a shampoo without a lot of heavy chemicals and it does not have a strong perfume smell.</li>
            <li> My dermetologist recommended this because I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Even with very sensitive skin I can use it every day (and have been using it for years now).</li>
            <li> my seborrheic dematitis and my excema started to clear up immediately!</li>
            <li> Many \\&quot;fragrance-free\\&quot; products stretch the meaning of that term, with twenty or thirty ingredients including floral essences and other obvious allergens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For consumers who still have an old bottle, I recommend saving the toggle-switch cap and use it on the new bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding certain products fragrance free, so my scalp will flare if I have to use them.</li>
            <li> There are lot of weird chemicals in shampoos, so switching to this was a very good idea if you&#x27;re not ready to go completely &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> DHS Clear is the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past so based on past experience it is a great product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> dhs clear shampoo works.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It helps with my sensitive skin as well as performing well as a shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried two so far.</li>
            <li> so my dermatologist recommended this shampoo to rule out that my skin is sensitive to ingredients in shampoo.</li>
            <li> Just what my husband needed for his sensitive hands.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It may my hair soft and manageable with</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and supple.</li>
            <li> theory is that these changes were all made with the following intention: to get the consumer to use up the contents of a bottle much quicker than before in order to increase sales.</li>
            <li> In fact, I could not find the words &amp;#34;Dermatologist Recommended&amp;#34; on my old bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the only one that really works for me.</li>
            <li> I have found that I am sensitive to the dyes/fragrances/preservatives in a number of shampoos.  </li>
            <li> compared the list of ingredients on my old and new bottles, and I noticed the order of 2 ingredients had changed, and one ingredient called &amp;#34;Cocamide MEA&amp;#34; had been apparently replaced by &amp;#34;Cocamidepropyl Hydroxysultaine&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, on rechecking this out, even when I used 3 times as much shampoo as before, I was not able to produce an adequate amount of lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you really need the absence of anything except the cleaning agents.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend buying the smaller version first if you&#x27;re still going to try it</li>
            <li> It might have been a decent shampoo to alternate with 1-2 per week but at $15 for a 16 ounce, I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> I have finally found my new favorite shampoo and conditioner (with no more reactions to fragrances)!  </li>
            <li> Such is the case with the new DHS clear shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have severe sensitivity to scents and the new &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; formula  has a scent that was not present before.  </li>
            <li> In particular, I was looking for a shampoo that was free of scent of unnecessary</li>
            <li> Some of the shampoos came from beauty shops, general shopping stores, and even a prescription</li>
            <li> In a last ditch effort, I bought this DHS Clear off of Amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m apparently allergic to everything.</li>
            <li> [a lot of fragrance-free shampoos barely lather].</li>
            <li> It was highly recommended to me by the dermatologist two years ago due to my sensitive scalp and this stuff works.  </li>
            <li> It is odd to use as it is completely transparent so you have to look closely to see how much is in your hand when you use it.  </li>
            <li> It rinses cleanly and a little of the shampoo goes a long way.</li>
            <li> have an intense respiratory issue and also asthma, and any perfume will cause extreme distress with my breathing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which is a very brief list of rather common, cheap chemicals.  </li>
            <li> But, definitely use the DHS Clear on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I alternate the clear and zinc shampoos daily and also use the conditioner/rinse.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t seem to need a lot to get my thick hair clean.  </li>
            <li> All this literature about TEA laurel sulfate has not been validated, at least not any more so than the other sulfates.  </li>
            <li> Because it hasn&#x27;t been on my pharmacy shelves for a long time, I&#x27;ve had to special order it through the pharmacy, usually ordering three 16 oz.</li>
            <li> The new cap and the thinner shampoo makes it harder to control the amount of shampoo being dispensed.</li>
            <li> My thin fine hair has body even without using mousse or gels.</li>
            <li> BUT I can get better or at least the equivalent for a hell of a lot less money!</li>
            <li> all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, in reference to a previous review of this product, I could not find the words &amp;#34;New and Improved&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Dermatologist Recommended&amp;#34; on the new bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll come back and modify the review after I see how it effects my long hair</li>
            <li> I am a 75 year old male with thin and straight hair and have a problem with oily hair and control.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way as it highly bubbles and rinses out.</li>
            <li> scalp has started to get dry from daily shampooing and I am returning to shampooing twice a week and adding a&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, the very convenient &amp;#34;toggle-switch&amp;#34; type cap had been replaced with a inconvenient traditional cap which has to be unscrewed and removed in order to dispense the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Product should now be placed on the store shelves with all the other cheaper shampoos that have the same harsh Sodium Sulfates as their main ingredient.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot on my long hair as it doesn&#x27;t lather well.</li>
            <li> I am a life long costumer of this brand</li>
            <li> as long as i use this shampoo no pimples.</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t want to buy the smaller version, due to shipping costs, but I should have assumed this shampoo wasn&#x27;t going to help).</li>
            <li> I credit the lack of perfumes and colorants and other chemical for my present state of happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I find that repeated use of the Aura brand makes my hair dry.  </li>
            <li> Also leaves my hair feeling dry, straw-like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my dermatologist for my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate my skin but strips my hair color and seems to dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> Unless you like dry hair I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> The new and improved version sucks</li>
            <li> Living in Florida I shampoo daily and when I travel I only need a small amount</li>
            <li> The bottom line is: this shampoo will leave your hair very dry after using it.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo my little one can use.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in my area and more expensive in my drug store</li>
            <li> This shampoo really is delicate and really is for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few days</li>
            <li> no allergic reactions whatsoever and all previous allergic symptoms have cleared up, even a minor skin condition that I, and my dermatologist, thought was due to something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works as advertised and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this shampoo based on the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> (I like to switch my shampoo and conditioning every other day)</li>
            <li> I was not able to find the product locally.  </li>
            <li> I think a customer who is considering this product from this company should know other avenues sell it where the packaging allows it to arrive intact.</li>
            <li> I recommend this shampoo to anyone who doesn&#x27;t tolerate perfumes, colorants and other stuffs that irritates your scalp.</li>
            <li> I have a shower filter and tried every other &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; shampoo I could find.  </li>
            <li> I have tried product after product with no success with the exception of the DHS products.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair flat or dull.</li>
            <li> My wife stated with a sample from her dermatologist, due to her sensitivity to harsh shampoos.</li>
            <li> Less soap residue?</li>
            <li> DHS lathers like typical shampoo, does not irritate my scalp, and leaves my hair and scalp feeling</li>
            <li> A little goes along way, and I use it 2-3 times a week alternating with another product.</li>
            <li> One of the few shampoos that doesn&#x27;t cause my scalp to break out.  </li>
            <li> My scalp still felt irritated after use and the shampoo dried out my hair.  </li>
            <li> if you want a shampoo that you can use everyday and that doesn&#x27;t hurt your scalp.</li>
            <li> I have used for a few years and like a lot.</li>
            <li> I have very short thin hair</li>
            <li> No strong scent.</li>
            <li> The new shampoo leaves my hair feeling dirty and stringy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this is so.  </li>
            <li> No more itching, irritation and redness of her scalp.</li>
            <li> No more rash or dryness.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product as way to not put bad chemicals on my scalp.</li>
            <li> used to try several other shampoos and either they would have bad odor (even if they said they didn&#x27;t have any odor)</li>
            <li> Anyone with allergies to fragrance knows how hard it is to find something without fragrance  </li>
            <li> It was hard the 1st time finding something that agrees with me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;conditioner at least once a week.  </li>
            <li> Have used product for at least 2 years now and no recurrence of flaking and/or itchiness.</li>
            <li> The supplier was slow.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I really hate all those shampoos and conditioners that are so ridiculously overly scented that give me a headache directly out of the shower.</li>
            <li> You are almost a year behind.</li>
            <li> SUCKS, NOT HAPPY!!!!</li>
            <li> The cap was broken on arrival.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t appreciate a broken cap which is why I give it one star.</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews I mix in DHS Zinc for a day or two when it is itching bad.</li>
            <li> I tried a very expensive fragrance free shampoo and it was horrible.  </li>
            <li> When I tried using it I found it dried my scalp a ton though :(</li>
            <li> However, I had to deduct one star because it seems to be rather expensive for what it is.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after spending $17 bucks on a shampoo, I&#x27;ve got to keep looking for something that will appease my problematic scalp.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid to try this product, afraid that it wouldn&#x27;t be like a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; shampoo.  </li>
            <li> My scalp was itching like crazy</li>
            <li> After six joint replacement surgeries my hair and scalp were really in bad shape.  </li>
            <li> It has made me miserable and disgusted.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance free shampoo.  Anyone with allergies to fragrance knows how hard it is to find something without fragrance  This also does a good job of cleaning without drying out hair and scalp</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for several years. My dermetologist recommended this because I have very sensitive skin. It is great because it has not perfume. It leaves my hair very silky, it lathers well. I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> The product is good.  Overpriced, but good.  The supplier was slow.  Look for it locally if you can find it.  It was recommended to me by a dermatologist as being very mild on the skin.  I think it is.  I&#x27;ll probably order some more in the future, just from a different supplier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to the standard fragrance mix. Many \\&quot;fragrance-free\\&quot; products stretch the meaning of that term, with twenty or thirty ingredients including floral essences and other obvious allergens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo contains purified water plus just these seven ingredients: TEA-lauryl sulfate, cocamidopropyl betaine, PEG-8 distearate, benzyl alcohol, cocamide MEA, polyquaternium-22, and citric acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have - or suspect - fragrance allergies, this is a great solution.  If you want to avoid perfumed shampoos, give this a try. It does a great job of washing my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for several years.  Hard to find in my area and more expensive in my drug store</li>
            <li> Best shampoo for  me.... no residue and no  scent!</li>
            <li> El mejor shampoo que he usado para mi serio problema de dermatitis seborreica. No irrita, me deja el cabello suave y saludable. Además está a un excelente precio.</li>
            <li> I had a scalp condition and went to a dermatologist who had lab tests performed and could not find any specific cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He recommended DHS shampoo.  After I received my first 16 oz. bottle, I tried it every day for a week.  Not my normal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;routine since long ago I had learned not to shampoo more than twice a week our your hair starts to fall out.  Imagine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my surprise when the shampoo not only worked as advertised, but my hair did not fall out and my scalp problem&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cleared up! I am ordering my second 16 0z bottle right now.  Good product and a 5-star recommendation from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scalp has started to get dry from daily shampooing and I am returning to shampooing twice a week and adding a&lt;br /&gt;conditioner at least once a week.  Awaiting my second bottle of shampoo and trying the Aveeno conditioner that Amazon&lt;br /&gt;users are recommending.</li>
            <li> My son has a concern with his scalp, which several shampoos didn&#x27;t help, especially the prescription ones.  DHS Shampoo has worked great...and it is not expensive like the prescription shampoos we tried!</li>
            <li> My order was completed and shipped promptly. There were no issues, no difficulties, no hassles.</li>
            <li> great for skin, purchase for daughter who has breakouts. Her skin totally clears up when she uses this shampoo on her hair which is oily.</li>
            <li> Great as always. Easy to rinse. Gentle on hair. No strong scent. Rinses easily off skin, and tea tree oil is good for skin anyhow.</li>
            <li> I really like the DHS shampoo, but don&#x27;t recommend the DHS conditioner.  The shampoo works great, but definitely needs a conditioner to go along with it.  I like the way the shampoo lathers and I don&#x27;t seem to need a lot to get my thick hair clean.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo.  I have a sensitivity to perfumes and this is great as there is no sent to speak of.</li>
            <li> I was having a mild allergic reaction to most shampoos I tried, including those purchased at stores stocking \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and non-allergenic products.  I decided to try this shampoo based on the other reviews.  I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo for about a month and it&#x27;s been great: no allergic reactions whatsoever and all previous allergic symptoms have cleared up, even a minor skin condition that I, and my dermatologist, thought was due to something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> I have used the original formula for many years and have depended on it and loved it.  The new and improved version sucks and I cannot use it.  I have tried about 30 diff. shampoos and none work.  It has made me miserable and disgusted.  You do not realize what a great shampoo you had.  The new shampoo leaves my hair feeling dirty and stringy.  The new ingredients are like everybody else.  All this literature about TEA laurel sulfate has not been validated, at least not any more so than the other sulfates.  There is no proof that it causes cancer.    You need to update your ingredient list. You are almost a year behind.</li>
            <li> My wife has environmental asthma. This means that all of the fragrances that are embedded in commercial personal hygiene products cannot be used around her for fear of triggering an asthma attack. We found DHS Clear Shampoo after trying about a half dozen different shampoos available via the Internet and it is much better at cleaning hair, rinsing out etc. than the competition that we have tried, AND it does not smell like Aunt Sally&#x27;s deodorant. Kudos!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my acne. Don&#x27;t know if it or accutane cleared it but I will keep using it!</li>
            <li> This shampoo was recommended by my dermatologist for skin/scalp issues that I have because of fragrances.  I was afraid to try this product, afraid that it wouldn&#x27;t be like a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; shampoo.  I tried a very expensive fragrance free shampoo and it was horrible.  My hair felt like I had washed it in oil.  In a last ditch effort, I bought this DHS Clear off of Amazon and I absolutely LOVE it.  Honestly, it&#x27;s better than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.    Why do I love it?  *Nice thick, rich lather  *No fragrance, whatsoever  *No residue; I&#x27;m even able to go a day without washing and my hair still looks great!    I have thick, curly hair and I straighten it every day, so to go a day without washing is AWESOME.  I do, however, live in an area with very clean water.  I recently traveled to an area with harder water and my hair didn&#x27;t feel as clean, but that was more the water than the product.    I highly recommend this shampoo.  If you have frangrance issues, or are just looking for a great shampoo, this is a must-try.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo with NO PERFUME smell.  It works as advertised and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Have used any number of times by now and find the cleaning good and the effect on the scalp mild. It rinses cleanly and a little of the shampoo goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If you really need the absence of anything except the cleaning agents. DHS Clear is the product. I have eczema and allergies to fragrances. This is the shampoo I can count on.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the DHS Zinc shampoo by advice of my dermatologist.  I have psoriasis and extremely sensitive skin. I can use both with no problems. This product is perfect for the \\&quot;other day\\&quot; shampooing. (I like to switch my shampoo and conditioning every other day) This shampoo does the job, cleanses without drying or irritation and that&#x27;s all I need. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have any perfumes added. I really hate all those shampoos and conditioners that are so ridiculously overly scented that give me a headache directly out of the shower. Well anyway that enough of my ranting. I just wanted to add a positive post for those of you that are thinking about it but can&#x27;t make up your mind.  As I said its good for people with sensitivities or that are easily irritated. If you are looking for something high performance shampoo then this may not be the one for you.</li>
            <li> . . . BUT I can get better or at least the equivalent for a hell of a lot less money!</li>
            <li> I have allergies to scented shampoos, and this is the best fragrance-free shampoo that I have tried.  No irritation, cleans well, and my hair looks good after using it.</li>
            <li> Dermotologist  recommended........works  great !!</li>
            <li> My hair stays clean so much longer when I use DHS shampoo.  I&#x27;m not sure why this is so.  Less soap residue?</li>
            <li> My doctor had me using this trying to figure out what I&#x27;m allergic to. It takes a lot on my long hair as it doesn&#x27;t lather well. Seems to do the job though.</li>
            <li> This is a product I have been using for over 8 years.  It helps with my sensitive skin as well as performing well as a shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to everyone.  I was very pleased to find it on Amazon because I could not find it the store here in TN.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product because his dermatologist recommended it. He fights allergies and an itchy scalp. This helped him from the moment he first tried it. We order it ahead so he never runs out! We highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really is delicate and really is for everyday use. Even with very sensitive skin I can use it every day (and have been using it for years now).</li>
            <li> Clear and odor free  best my hair has felt in years  Highly recommend this product as way to not put bad chemicals on my scalp.</li>
            <li> My husband ad I really like this product, it foams up nicely, better than the last in scented product I used. Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> However, I had to deduct one star because it seems to be rather expensive for what it is.  Which is a very brief list of rather common, cheap chemicals.  That said, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I tend to have sensitive skin / scalp and mild eczema.  This fragrance free shampoo does a great job cleaning your hair but doesn&#x27;t have a lot of chemicals that are irritating.  My hair feels clean and manageable.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair flat or dull.</li>
            <li> Liked it but bothered my eyes</li>
            <li> I have had problems with fragrances since January and have changed all of my products and tried many different replacements.  This shampoo (and the conditioner) are my favorites.  My hair is clean and manageable and the conditioner is great for tangles and softening my hair.  I have finally found my new favorite shampoo and conditioner (with no more reactions to fragrances)!  Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with a fragrance allergy almost a year ago. It has nothing to do with smells, I get severe contact dermatitis from fragrance or parfume. Which is a bummer because I am all girl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I started using &amp;#34;Free and Clear&amp;#34; but it does not lather at all! I have hair extensions so I was getting build up around the beads and couldn&#x27;t get my scalp clean. It was awful! Found this and fell in love! DHS lathers like typical shampoo, does not irritate my scalp, and leaves my hair and scalp feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding certain products fragrance free, so my scalp will flare if I have to use them. Based on other reviews I mix in DHS Zinc for a day or two when it is itching bad. It has fragrance, but it must not be one I am allergic too. But to be careful I only use it during flares and it is wonderful!  Totally calms and soothes my skin. But, definitely use the DHS Clear on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While nothing is as good as my salon products from the past, it&#x27;s nice to feel like a girl again and not some hippie who doesn&#x27;t bathe. I highly recommend for those with true contact dermatitis, fragrance allergies!</li>
            <li> One of the few shampoos that doesn&#x27;t cause my scalp to break out.  It can be quite drying, so a conditioner is necessary.  Trying to find a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts is another issue...</li>
            <li> LOVE this shampoo!! I have found a fragrance free shampoo in Walgeens,  but it leaves my hair oily. And while I am so very truly thankful to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for carrying the Aura brand of hair products (they saved me for many years as they were the ONLY truly unscented brand I could find for many years--and I am so grateful!), I find that repeated use of the Aura brand makes my hair dry.  Let me add that I can only use the unscented shampoos on my body as well.  Otherwise I get a rash.  The brand I found in Walgreens does not agree as well for body wash as does the DHS or the Aura.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I LOVE the DHS for both body and hair</li>
            <li> I have vitiligo so I started my search for a fragrance-free shampoo. I&#x27;ve tried two so far. The Free &amp; Clear didn&#x27;t irritate my scalp, but is runny and doesn&#x27;t lather well. Also leaves my hair feeling dry, straw-like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo, DHS, lathers well which I like, but I find my scalp itches when using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next to try - Earth&#x27;s Science which is on the way thanks to Amazon.</li>
            <li> My wife stated with a sample from her dermatologist, due to her sensitivity to harsh shampoos. She immediately had me order this DHS shampoo and what a difference with her hair and scalp, especially. No more itching, irritation and redness of her scalp. We are so grateful to her dermatologist to suggest and forward the sample. Great lather, no perfume smell, very clean rinse and great shine.&lt;br /&gt;The hoser</li>
            <li> Great product, great price. I would definity buy this product again, it works so well and I got a great deal</li>
            <li> Just like most products I&#x27;ve come across with &amp;#34;new &amp; improved&amp;#34; written on the item, it seems to be a money saving maneuver by the manufacturer, that is keep the same price with inferior ingredients. Such is the case with the new DHS clear shampoo. Old formula worked great &amp; the new does not. Even the Dermatologist Recommended statement remains on the new product and should be removed. Product should now be placed on the store shelves with all the other cheaper shampoos that have the same harsh Sodium Sulfates as their main ingredient.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for people with allergies!</li>
            <li> best shampoo for my type of hair</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several years. It is the only shampoo I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an intense respiratory issue and also asthma, and any perfume will cause extreme distress with my breathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo has no odor at all, but yet is still great for getting my hair clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to try several other shampoos and either they would have bad odor (even if they said they didn&#x27;t have any odor) or they didn&#x27;t clean my hair. And some even caused allergic reaction on my scalp and I&#x27;d be covered with pus filled bumps all over my head. Some of the shampoos came from beauty shops, general shopping stores, and even a prescription shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only shampoo I have no problems with at all.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shampoo.  Everything else makes my scalp itch! my seborrheic dematitis and my excema started to clear up immediately!</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling sticky!</li>
            <li> Used this product for a few years, loved it. Have allergies, and this product was great. Recently reordered 4 bottles, without knowing they changed their product. HORRIBLE!!!!! Makes my head itch!!! That was the whole purpose of using this shampoo in this 1st place. Not to itch. So now stuck with 3 1/2 bottles of shampoo that I can&#x27;t use. SUCKS, NOT HAPPY!!!! Switch back to your old formula!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was hard the 1st time finding something that agrees with me. Now I have to start again. You have lost a customer DHS.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a basic shampoo. I&#x27;ve yet to find a fragrance-free shampoo that I love. But, it doesn&#x27;t separate, isn&#x27;t perfumed, doesn&#x27;t smell like a chemical factory, and gets my hair clean. So, I keep buying it.</li>
            <li> This behaves just like the normal shampoo I knew and loved before my scalp started acting up due to my allergy to fragrance. It lathers very nicely and never leaves residue or oil in my hair. I&#x27;ve tried several different fragrance-free shampoos now, and this one definitely performs the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, if you&#x27;re looking for conditioner, I wouldn&#x27;t use the one made by DHS. It was ok, but I found that the Free and Clear conditioner leaves my hair silkier and goes farther than the one from DHS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, by my experience: DHS Shampoo, Free and Clear conditioner is the power duo for fragrance-free shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> My scalp still felt irritated after use and the shampoo dried out my hair.  Unfortunately, after spending $17 bucks on a shampoo, I&#x27;ve got to keep looking for something that will appease my problematic scalp.  I would definitely recommend buying the smaller version first if you&#x27;re still going to try it (I didn&#x27;t want to buy the smaller version, due to shipping costs, but I should have assumed this shampoo wasn&#x27;t going to help).</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my dermatologist for my dry scalp. Ithelps alot.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate my skin but strips my hair color and seems to dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> DHS Clear Shampoo is working for gentle cleaning of my hair and scalp.  I use it in conjunction with the DHS Conditioning Rinse.</li>
            <li> Hair color irritates my scalp so I need a mild shampoo that will clean the chemicals from my scalp without washing ALL the dye from my hair.</li>
            <li> Best daily shampoo, rich lather, silky feel.&lt;br /&gt;I have super sensitive skin and this was perfect. Living in Florida I shampoo daily and when I travel I only need a small amount very concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came quickly, packed well.</li>
            <li> The bottom line is: this shampoo will leave your hair very dry after using it. Unless you like dry hair I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Well this time I don&#x27;t agree with the reviews! I really thought this product might be a natural way to take care of my dandruff. It lathers nice, it has no fragrance but has some sort of neutral pleasant scent still. It leaves my hair conditioned and feeling nice. It just does not do anything for my scalp nor my dandruff. My scalp still itches. Some folks were reporting that it did wonders for their scalp. It did not work for me. It might have been a decent shampoo to alternate with 1-2 per week but at $15 for a 16 ounce, I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> I saw immediate results with this product. My itchy scalp feels great, and I can now go 2 days without having to shampoo. Very, very satisfied with the results!</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my forehead and neck so my dermatologist recommended this shampoo to rule out that my skin is sensitive to ingredients in shampoo. My eczema did get better, and this shampoo works great. No weird smell, cleans well without over-cleaning. My occasional dandruff problem is solved. Would also recommend for people who have back acne problem. There are lot of weird chemicals in shampoos, so switching to this was a very good idea if you&#x27;re not ready to go completely &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this shampoo to me years ago.  I have some scalp allergy problems manifesting with itchiness.  DHS shampoo is the only one I&#x27;ve tried that does not exacerbate this condition.</li>
            <li> this is a good product that was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo.  Got a sample from dermatologist and loved it, so ordered a large bottle.  Would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a shampoo without a lot of heavy chemicals and it does not have a strong perfume smell.</li>
            <li> My scalp was itching like crazy so I went to a dermatologist who recommended this for a diagnosis of dermatitis of the scalp.  She also prescribed scalp lotion but this  helped to significantly decrease the scalp itching.</li>
            <li> I have ordered twice from these folks with good results&lt;br /&gt;We order this shampoo for one of my daughters who is highly  sensitivity to normal shampoos. (propylene glycol) used as a preservitive and binder many products from shampoos, liquid laundry detergent, salad dressings such as ranch, boxed cake mixes, some mayonnaise. She breaks out in a skin rash.&lt;br /&gt;We have had good results with DHS products.</li>
            <li> Just what my husband needed for his sensitive hands. No more rash or dryness.</li>
            <li> finally found a shampoo that works for me</li>
            <li> I bought this in my quest for shampoo that wouldn&#x27;t make me itch and breakout all over my head and body. This wasn&#x27;t it. I&#x27;m apparently allergic to everything.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo my little one can use. It&#x27;s been great for the eczema. When I tried using it I found it dried my scalp a ton though :(</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist because, of all things, I had itchy ears! Lathers beautifully. No need for conditioner either. Leaves hair soft and manageable. But, watch the pricing here. Bought the 16 oz size at local supermarket pharmacy for $13.95.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist recommended for dandruff.  Unscented.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Just reviewed the DHS conditioner, and my review also applies to the shampoo.  I like it, and like the fact that there are fewer ingredients than many other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past so based on past experience it is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I still have another product I&#x27;m using and when I&#x27;m finished using that then&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use this.</li>
            <li> Being very allergic to many products including fragrances I have used DHS products for years and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have results yet.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with scalp irritations my whole life.  I have tried product after product with no success with the exception of the DHS products.  The DHS products are the only ones that have worked for me.  I alternate the clear and zinc shampoos daily and also use the conditioner/rinse. I have rarely had any scalp irritations since I have been using the DHS products.</li>
            <li> DHS Shampoo was recommended by my dermatologist.  Have used it for years and have had no scalp prolems since using this product. Price and convenience is great with Amazon.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s fragrance free, ph balanced, yet my hair has never felt better. It feels so clean after I shampoo and stays clean longer. I&#x27;ve recommended (and bought) for my daughter and she loved it also. I&#x27;ve used a lot of shampoos and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I am a 75 year old male with thin and straight hair and have a problem with oily hair and control.  I used samples of this product from my dermatologist and was happy with it&#x27;s results. It may my hair soft and manageable with it&#x27;s PH balance properties.  I was not able to find the product locally.  I found it at a couple of stores online but bought it from Amazon in a bundle with several products.</li>
            <li> If you looking for a fragrance free shampoo, this is a good choice. Shampoo is very effective. Suds and cleans well.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to fragrance and this product is great. It works well and does not cause me to have an asthma attack.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used!  Ever!  And it does not have stinky perfume that contains polluting chemicals.  I wish this company made a hair gel.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I have skin allergies and this was on my safe list.  This is the second brand I&#x27;ve tried and cannot seem to find one I like as well as my regular shampoo.  I have thick hair and I have to use a ton of the shampoo and conditioner to get it through my hair.  My hair just doesn&#x27;t feel as good as it does when I use the regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a fragrance-free shampoo, this is the one.  Good cleanser and makes the hair look great.  Will keep buying it for my granddaughter who has eczema.</li>
            <li> One of the best fragrance-free shampoos! it lathers surprisingly well [a lot of fragrance-free shampoos barely lather].</li>
            <li> A doctor recommended my husband use this.  It has really helped him a lot with a scalp/ear problem. I am sure he will continue to use it. The scent free was only available to us on-line.</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with how my hair feels after washing. I am able to use this daily without conditioner. The lather is nice and there is virtually no scent (not even chemicals). This will be my shampoo for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle and I&#x27;m still very happy. My psoriasis has diminished and dandruff is no longer an issue.</li>
            <li> Effective!!!  Keeps the itchy scalp at bay.  Have used product for at least 2 years now and no recurrence of flaking and/or itchiness. Beats the prescription shampoos recommended by dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Told to buy by my daughters doc.  Like it a lot.  Very clean and no chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have used this for my eczema treatment.  My dermatologist wants me to try some shampoos for a period and see how they do.  This one seemed fine, but it ends up that I am having a food/plant allergy and shampoo my not be the cure.</li>
            <li> Best Shampoo I have yet to use. Fragrance free, does the job well and price is right. Must try!</li>
            <li> This shampoo works well, is very gentle and suds up really well.  I have only used it a few days but so far I love the way it makes my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect shampoo for me.  No irritation from alcohol, additives, scents... My second time ordering this and I&#x27;m sure will do so,again.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  Have had scalp issues and this is the only shampoo that has helped and eliminated problem.  Have used this shampoo for over a year.</li>
            <li> This was the shampoo I ordered. The cap was broken on arrival. I didn&#x27;t appreciate a broken cap which is why I give it one star. I think a customer who is considering this product from this company should know other avenues sell it where the packaging allows it to arrive intact.</li>
            <li> I wash my eyes and hair with this shampoo specifically to keep my pores open and clean. Non-irritating and gentle. Love it.</li>
            <li> It cleans my hair wonderfully while leaving my sensitive scalp quiet and pain free. A little goes along way, and I use it 2-3 times a week alternating with another product. Shiny clean hair</li>
            <li> I loved this shampoo until they changed to the Improved Formula.  We bought it not only for out own use but recommended it to many people.  I have severe sensitivity to scents and the new &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; formula  has a scent that was not present before.  I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Got a sample of this at my dermatologist and I love it. My thin fine hair has body even without using mousse or gels. Amazing!!</li>
            <li> if you want a shampoo that you can use everyday and that doesn&#x27;t hurt your scalp. then, buy dhs shampoo</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found any fragrance free I&#x27;d rate 5 stars but this one gets a strong 4 and in practical terms I&#x27;ll keep buying it. Most fragrance free tend to either be a bit dry or a bit light or just not quite 5 star but I&#x27;ve found by interchanging them that is overcome. The DHS is definitely a regular in my rotation.</li>
            <li> Recently my allergies have been out of control, and with my symptoms it has meant that I&#x27;ve been itchy... all over.  Even my scalp has been itchy. So I decided to change shampoos. In particular, I was looking for a shampoo that was free of scent of unnecessary chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking through all of Amazon&#x27;s offerings my eye landed on DHS Clear Shampoo and the good ratings other customers had given it. And after dithering and consideration I went ahead and made my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty happy. I&#x27;ve have used it twice now and while I&#x27;m still not entirely itch free elsewhere my scalp is no longer irritated.  I credit the lack of perfumes and colorants and other chemical for my present state of happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend you try this if you have an irritated scalp. I saw definitely improvement after the second shampoo.  I&#x27;ll come back and modify the review after I see how it effects my long hair --dries it out or not.</li>
            <li> For my dermatitis, there&#x27;s nothing better. I recommend this shampoo to anyone who doesn&#x27;t tolerate perfumes, colorants and other stuffs that irritates your scalp.</li>
            <li> I have used DHS Shampoo for many years.  It was recommended by my dermatologist.  It has really made helped my scalp look good and put the right nutrients back into my hair.  After six joint replacement surgeries my hair and scalp were really in bad shape.  This shampoo brought my hair back to life.</li>
            <li> came on time and this is the best shampoo I have ever used.  It was highly recommended to me by the dermatologist two years ago due to my sensitive scalp and this stuff works.  I have tried 4 of their shampoos and have had great results with them all.  I am a life long costumer of this brand and I will definitely order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo without a chemical I am allergic ! I have used for a few years and like a lot. It leaves my hair soft and easy to manage</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo. It seems to make my fine hair thicker I have used three or four bottles of it, so that means that I have used it for years.  I have very short thin hair and it is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> i have had pimples on my scalp for 5 yrs. couldnt find anything that would work. dhs clear shampoo works. as long as i use this shampoo no pimples.</li>
            <li> The only shampoo I am not allergic to. It leaves my hair soft and supple. I will use this the rest of my life&#x27;</li>
            <li> My dermatologist and I figured that I was allergic to the shampoo and conditioner that I had been using. She&#x27;s allergic to just about everything scented so she recommended this. A little goes a long way as it highly bubbles and rinses out. Since using this, the breakout on my scalp has disappeared. It is odd to use as it is completely transparent so you have to look closely to see how much is in your hand when you use it.  If you get too much, you have lather everywhere.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo. It was recommended to me by my dermatologist. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out, while stil getting my hair clean</li>
            <li> I have used DHS Clear shampoo for many years and had been very satisfied with the product in the past. Because it hasn&#x27;t been on my pharmacy shelves for a long time, I&#x27;ve had to special order it through the pharmacy, usually ordering three 16 oz. bottles at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started using the first bottle from my most recent order, it quickly became apparent that several things had changed. First, the very convenient &amp;#34;toggle-switch&amp;#34; type cap had been replaced with a inconvenient traditional cap which has to be unscrewed and removed in order to dispense the shampoo. Then, when I turned the bottle upside-down and gently squeezed it, as I have done in the past, a lot more shampoo dropped into my hand than I had anticipated, much more than in the past. It was apparent that the consistency of the shampoo, which used to be more like a gel, was now much thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compared the list of ingredients on my old and new bottles, and I noticed the order of 2 ingredients had changed, and one ingredient called &amp;#34;Cocamide MEA&amp;#34; had been apparently replaced by &amp;#34;Cocamidepropyl Hydroxysultaine&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My theory is that these changes were all made with the following intention: to get the consumer to use up the contents of a bottle much quicker than before in order to increase sales. The new cap and the thinner shampoo makes it harder to control the amount of shampoo being dispensed. For consumers who still have an old bottle, I recommend saving the toggle-switch cap and use it on the new bottle. And thinning down the consistency of the shampoo means you have to use a lot more of it than before to get an equivalent lather. However, on rechecking this out, even when I used 3 times as much shampoo as before, I was not able to produce an adequate amount of lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The older I get, the more I wonder whether Karl Marx may have had some good ideas after all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, in reference to a previous review of this product, I could not find the words &amp;#34;New and Improved&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Dermatologist Recommended&amp;#34; on the new bottles. In fact, I could not find the words &amp;#34;Dermatologist Recommended&amp;#34; on my old bottle.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use and for sensitive scalps.  I have search for YEARS for shampoo that didn&#x27;t make my head itch and flake.  I have a shower filter and tried every other &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; shampoo I could find.  This is the only one that really works for me.</li>
            <li> I have found that I am sensitive to the dyes/fragrances/preservatives in a number of shampoos.  I am very happy to have found this mild, clear shampoo, which is also an excellent shampoo.  It has resolved a lot of the scalp itchiness problems I have had.</li>
            <li> I have chronic dermatology issues and this product was highly recommended by my dermatologist. It has been very effective for me.</li>
    </ol>
