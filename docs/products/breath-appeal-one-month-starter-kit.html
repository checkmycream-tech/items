            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy I found it  </li>
            <li>One day I ran across an ad for great products</li>
            <li>But, don&#x27;t take my word for it, order some and reap the great results![[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Breath Appeal is a very effective product, I wish I had this product years ago.</li>
            <li>and I feel so good about my breath</li>
            <li>You will be happy you did and so will the ones you love.</li>

            <li>Breath Appeal, is truly an amazing product.</li>
            <li>and I get nice results.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is watery without any kind of consistancy whatsoever and doesn&#x27;t feel at all like it&#x27;s doing anything.</li>
            <li>The ratings must come from people who have some kind of interest in the product.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, love it and</li>
            <li>Very refreshing and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I am so proud of my fresh, sweet breath!</li>
            <li>This product simply works great!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll purchase more of it.</li>
            <li>Gave me more confidence to speak to people without them offering me a mint or backing away from me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for five years and am confident that I no longer have to be concerned about my breath.</li>
            <li>An outstanding product.</li>
            <li>I was bad-breath free!</li>
            <li>I feel so much more confident around people now.</li>
            <li>Love it and recommend you try it.</li>
            <li>was pretty good, so far I am happy using that</li>
            <li>Most of my work is done interacting with people so fresh breath is a must.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and quick and convenient to re-order.</li>
            <li>I actually am excited to do so--because people will even comment--\\&quot;your breath smells like strawberries\\</li>
            <li>Product does not work and does not leave mouth with a clean refreshed feeling.  </li>
            <li>before I spend more on this product, it would have to become more affordable for someone on a fixed income.</li>
            <li>#34;it tastes like cool aid&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Bleach strips didn&#x27;t do anything to help, so I did a full at home bleach session.</li>
            <li>The taste is not bad.  </li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>I knew I was duped when I first swished it in my mouth!</li>
            <li>I had used the \\&quot;Starter Kit\\&quot; up and everything was ok and my breath was great; I had a bit of a problem with dry mouth, but nothing big, so I re-ordered a 3 month supply.</li>
            <li>I just started using the Breath Appeal product and so far it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Makes your breath feel and smell so fresh.  </li>
            <li>I even wake up fresh.</li>
            <li>like the product very much, will order again</li>
            <li>innovative product &amp; doesn&#x27;t require toothpaste interestingly enough.</li>
            <li>I contacted Breath Appeal and told them what he said and that I wanted to return the product, and the person said sure, no problem, and that it would be credited back to my card.</li>
            <li>I guess if I would have looked into their convoluted \\&quot;guarantee\\&quot; that they will only guarantee their product for the first 30 days of use, and after that they wash their hands of it, I might have thought twice about getting more of it, but</li>
            <li>I have been using it for almost a month and haven&#x27;t heard ONE \\&quot;your breath is stinky\\&quot; comment since the first time I used Breath Appeal.  </li>
            <li>I used to never kiss my husband when we got married.</li>
            <li>Oh how I regret not using it right away, because this is what I really needed to help me battle my gingivitis.</li>
            <li>How could a young, pretty, healthy women have such stinky breath 10 minutes after brushing?</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for a product that really works..</li>
            <li>Too much work required</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>They came in a timely manner but the red bottle was open and spilled all over the box they did replace it fast ,,,, needs to be boxed better</li>
            <li>The product actually works and does so quickly.</li>
            <li>I brushed many times a day, gargled, tried different products, asked dentists, etc to no avail.</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied and I definitely recommend this product to everyone who deals with the same problem.</li>
            <li>I would recommend and have recommended it to a few people, who all are satisfied customers.</li>
            <li>have stopped using other cheap products found in retail stores and use breath appeal exclusivly.</li>
            <li>I take very good care of my teeth; I was flossing 2x a day, I do twice yearly cleanings, &amp; use periodic bleach strips to brighten them up, so this was very noticable and ugly.</li>
            <li>However, when I used the second set of concentrate, the Activator solution didn&#x27;t smell like the first.</li>
            <li>Just wanted to warn you that if you have gone through your first 30 days and are doing well on it, rather than buying a 60 day refill supply, maybe have a friend/spouse buy another starter set for you for your next 30 day supply, just so that you have the guarantee in place in case you have problems.  </li>

            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>The first one has that chlorine like smell, I didn&#x27;t smell the same when I used the second activator bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot eat or drink or my breath will start to have an odor again when using this, but overall it&#x27;s a decent product</li>
            <li>, I expected to get a product ready for use, I did not know I would have to measure and mix before use.</li>
            <li>Wow, like others it instantly took the years of yuck away!</li>
            <li>Bought this product, really skeptical, They were right after the first night I did not have to brush my teeth!  </li>
            <li>When my new boyfriend was constantly telling my breath was \\&quot;stinky\\&quot; nearly every other day, I decided I needed to do something about it.  </li>
            <li>So, since I noticed it, I use my electric toothbrush with plain water first then use the Breath Appeal</li>

            <li> So, since I noticed it, I use my electric toothbrush with plain water first then use the Breath Appeal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised I haven&#x27;t seen any other comments regarding this side effect.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any negative effects using this product, only positive.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered with halitosis, for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> He said that he had seen stains like that before from other mouth rinses and the only way to remove them was to scrape them off.</li>
            <li> did not live up to expectations.  </li>
            <li> After suffering from chronic sour breath for years I finally found a product that WORKS.  </li>
            <li> Works well - red may stain teeth a little</li>
            <li> I love waking up without bad breath.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I have now spent almost $200.00 on cleaning and the product that I can&#x27;t use and the company is telling me that they have never had this happen before.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I have now spent almost $200.00 on cleaning and the product that I can&#x27;t use and the company is telling me that they have never had this happen before.</li>
            <li> The problem I had disappeared and I do not use anymore any other product.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I have tried other products supposed to work like it</li>
            <li> I hope that you don&#x27;t have the problem that I did, but as a potential warning, this product stained my teeth DARK BROWN around my gum line after I had been using it for a little over a month!</li>
            <li> I have noticed that if you&#x27;re using a regular toothpaste prior to using this product it leaves a slight chemical taste behind.  </li>
            <li> I do wish there was a travel size - hard to take the big bottles...</li>
            <li> After continuing with the product, (I&#x27;d been using it for about 6 weeks)I noticed my gumline getting dark.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone that hates that sour taste in their mouth when they wake up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s considered a completely benign condition, nothing to be worried about, but I don&#x27;t want it to get worse, and I can even FEEL the furriness.</li>
            <li> I do wish that it was a little stronger though.</li>
            <li> I noticed it a few days ago and this morning,</li>
            <li> while scraping my tongue, I realized it was getting worse; I couldn&#x27;t deny that my tongue definitely looked \\&quot;furry\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> This product somehow breaks down the icky stuff in your mouth and on your tongue during the swishing phase, even before you begin brushing.</li>
            <li> I used to be very self-conscious about my bad breath.</li>
            <li> This stuff does absolutely nothing for bad breath.</li>
            <li> There are a few \\&quot;hidden\\&quot; things that I found out about this product AFTER reordering!</li>
            <li> No more being ashamed and turning away.</li>
            <li> Last year I spent thousands of dollars on fixing my teeth, trying to rid of bad smell.</li>
            <li> I have used it for over 5 months and not only has it cured my bad breath, my teeth stay cleaner too.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of bad breath remedies and this is the only product that gave me the confidence to talk to people close up..</li>
            <li> I went in and spent $119.00 on a very uncomfortable teeth deep-cleaning to get the stains scraped off.</li>
            <li> Now the bad news: because of the oxidizing agent in this product, it can cause dry mouth which leads to a condition known as \\&quot;furry tongue\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I recommend Breath Appeal to anyone who experiences dry mouth from tooth paste or chronic bad breath (ask your spouse if you should use Breath Appeal).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also too complicated.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t feel at all uncomfortable talking in &#x27;close quarters&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> When I heard about Breath Appeal,  I was a bit  skeptical.</li>
            <li> If anyone has a problem with bad breath, please give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I have always suffered from bad breath.</li>
            <li> , it HAS solved my bad breath problem.</li>
            <li> I had bad breath all my life and nothing I tried helped.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had bad breath since.</li>
            <li> If you have bad breath, don&#x27;t delay buying this.</li>
            <li> I do not won&#x27;t to ever be without it, using it has boost my confidence knowing I do not have bad breath issues ever.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t just mask bad breath like mouthwash and mints.  </li>
            <li> After years of having terrible breath, I was discouraged and distraught.</li>
            <li> That didn&#x27;t make a dent in the brown stains which continued to grow, so I went to my dentist and he was appalled!</li>
            <li> Even if nobody else will notice it, I&#x27;m completely disgusted.  </li>
            <li> My son has terrible breath since he was a toddler.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work!!!! It tastes like cherry kool-aid.</li>
            <li> Too much work required, I expected to get a product ready for use, I did not know I would have to measure and mix before use.</li>
            <li> Does not work, like another customer said &amp;#34;it tastes like cool aid&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Last year I spent thousands of dollars on fixing my teeth, trying to rid of bad smell. I had this product in a box for over a year, just laying on my shelf. Oh how I regret not using it right away, because this is what I really needed to help me battle my gingivitis. I hope my review can help somebody else.</li>
            <li> This product simply works great!  I have used it for over 5 months and not only has it cured my bad breath, my teeth stay cleaner too.  There was no side effects.  You have to use this product in conjunction with flossing and daily brushing. I have tried a lot of bad breath remedies and this is the only product that gave me the confidence to talk to people close up.. Thanks so much for a product that really works.. I&#x27;ll be a life time customer...</li>
            <li> They came in a timely manner but the red bottle was open and spilled all over the box they did replace it fast ,,,, needs to be boxed better</li>
            <li> Did not work for me.👎</li>
            <li> I just started using the Breath Appeal product and so far it&#x27;s okay.  I&#x27;m into the second set of bottles now so I&#x27;ll see how it goes from here.  The taste is not bad.  I have noticed that if you&#x27;re using a regular toothpaste prior to using this product it leaves a slight chemical taste behind.  I believe it&#x27;s the activator with the toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t go well together.  So, since I noticed it, I use my electric toothbrush with plain water first then use the Breath Appeal and I get nice results.  I use my toothpaste to brush at night for continued whitening of my teeth.  I&#x27;m working with it and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll purchase more of it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, love it and so my wife. The problem I had disappeared and I do not use anymore any other product.</li>
            <li> I found this product by a simple google search and have been using breath appeal for almost a year now.  The product actually works and does so quickly. Most of my work is done interacting with people so fresh breath is a must.&lt;br /&gt;I have stopped using other cheap products found in retail stores and use breath appeal exclusivly.</li>
            <li> Excellent! The only breath freshener that worked for me. Even after eating onions my breath was great! Gave me more confidence to speak to people without them offering me a mint or backing away from me. Thank you Breath Appeal!</li>
            <li> innovative product &amp; doesn&#x27;t require toothpaste interestingly enough. I do wish that it was a little stronger though. then perhaps it would have longer staying power.</li>
            <li> The product works great. However, when I used the second set of concentrate, the Activator solution didn&#x27;t smell like the first. The first one has that chlorine like smell, I didn&#x27;t smell the same when I used the second activator bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The red colored solution maintains it&#x27;s consistency in terms of the smell of the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, I am not sure if I am getting a consistent set of product.</li>
            <li> Makes your breath feel and smell so fresh.  My dentist commented about it.  But didn&#x27;t tell her what I was using for fear she would have some negativity about it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works and I am so happy I found it  I will continue to reorder.</li>
            <li> Watch Out! There are a few \\&quot;hidden\\&quot; things that I found out about this product AFTER reordering! I hope that you don&#x27;t have the problem that I did, but as a potential warning, this product stained my teeth DARK BROWN around my gum line after I had been using it for a little over a month! I had used the \\&quot;Starter Kit\\&quot; up and everything was ok and my breath was great; I had a bit of a problem with dry mouth, but nothing big, so I re-ordered a 3 month supply. After continuing with the product, (I&#x27;d been using it for about 6 weeks)I noticed my gumline getting dark. I take very good care of my teeth; I was flossing 2x a day, I do twice yearly cleanings, &amp; use periodic bleach strips to brighten them up, so this was very noticable and ugly. I had been brushing 2-3x a day with an electric toothbrush, so I tried brushing my teeth as well as using the rinse, thinking that both were needed, but that didn&#x27;t help, and the brown stains were getting bigger. Bleach strips didn&#x27;t do anything to help, so I did a full at home bleach session. That didn&#x27;t make a dent in the brown stains which continued to grow, so I went to my dentist and he was appalled! He said that he had seen stains like that before from other mouth rinses and the only way to remove them was to scrape them off. I contacted Breath Appeal and told them what he said and that I wanted to return the product, and the person said sure, no problem, and that it would be credited back to my card. I went in and spent $119.00 on a very uncomfortable teeth deep-cleaning to get the stains scraped off. After 3 weeks had gone by with no refund I called Breath Assure again and was told that I wouldn&#x27;t be getting a refund because it was a refill, and they only refund the 30 day initial supply! I guess if I would have looked into their convoluted \\&quot;guarantee\\&quot; that they will only guarantee their product for the first 30 days of use, and after that they wash their hands of it, I might have thought twice about getting more of it, but hindsight... Anyway, I have now spent almost $200.00 on cleaning and the product that I can&#x27;t use and the company is telling me that they have never had this happen before. Huuuummm. Somehow I doubt I am the only one out there that has had this problem. Just wanted to warn you that if you have gone through your first 30 days and are doing well on it, rather than buying a 60 day refill supply, maybe have a friend/spouse buy another starter set for you for your next 30 day supply, just so that you have the guarantee in place in case you have problems.  I wish I had!ight... Anyway, I have now spent almost $200.00 on cleaning and the product that I can&#x27;t use and the company is telling me that they have never had this happen before. Huuuummm.

            <li> I love waking up without bad breath.  I never thought it would be possible until I tried Breath Appeal.  I recommend this to anyone that hates that sour taste in their mouth when they wake up.  I also noticed that I don&#x27;t feel like I need to chew gum or use breath mints anymore.  I haven&#x27;t had any negative effects using this product, only positive.  I wish I would had this product sooner!</li>
            <li> Product does not work and does not leave mouth with a clean refreshed feeling.  Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> This item did nothing for me. It&#x27;s also too complicated. I did not like not using toothpaste. I stop using this after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Breath Appeal is a very effective product, I wish I had this product years ago. If anyone has a problem with bad breath, please give this product a try. You will be happy you did and so will the ones you love.</li>
            <li> I have always suffered from bad breath. When my new boyfriend was constantly telling my breath was \\&quot;stinky\\&quot; nearly every other day, I decided I needed to do something about it.  He didn&#x27;t like approaching me for kisses, and shied away from me when I spoke at times.  Finally, I found something that worked for me.  I have been using it for almost a month and haven&#x27;t heard ONE \\&quot;your breath is stinky\\&quot; comment since the first time I used Breath Appeal.  Now the bad news: because of the oxidizing agent in this product, it can cause dry mouth which leads to a condition known as \\&quot;furry tongue\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m surprised I haven&#x27;t seen any other comments regarding this side effect.  I noticed it a few days ago and this morning, while scraping my tongue, I realized it was getting worse; I couldn&#x27;t deny that my tongue definitely looked \\&quot;furry\\&quot;.  I think I&#x27;ll have to use this product once a day in addition to rinsing with hydrogen peroxide, which is what the Mayo Clinic suggests.  It&#x27;s considered a completely benign condition, nothing to be worried about, but I don&#x27;t want it to get worse, and I can even FEEL the furriness. Even if nobody else will notice it, I&#x27;m completely disgusted.  Other than that, it HAS solved my bad breath problem.</li>
            <li> I had bad breath all my life and nothing I tried helped. I even went to several doctors. I&#x27;ve been using Breath Appeal for 5 years now and I haven&#x27;t had bad breath since. It&#x27;s easy to use and quick and convenient to re-order. If you have bad breath, don&#x27;t delay buying this. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for five years and am confident that I no longer have to be concerned about my breath. This really works.</li>
            <li> Works well - red may stain teeth a little</li>
            <li> I have used  this  product for some time now.  I have gone off it at times when i have become complacent about my breath--but time and time again i continue to re order.  It not only makes the breath &#x27;not smelly&#x27;--but your breath will literally smell like strawberries after you have used it regularly for about a week.  I used to never kiss my husband when we got married. I used to not talk alot around him as well--as my horrid breath  would literally saturate and permeate the entire room! Now we kiss all the  time and I feel so good about my breath it is like getting a confidence makeover!  And I don&#x27;t feel at all uncomfortable talking in &#x27;close quarters&#x27;.  I actually am excited to do so--because people will even comment--\\&quot;your breath smells like strawberries\\&quot;  I am so proud of my fresh, sweet breath!</li>
            <li> After years of having terrible breath, I was discouraged and distraught. How could a young, pretty, healthy women have such stinky breath 10 minutes after brushing? I brushed many times a day, gargled, tried different products, asked dentists, etc to no avail. My mother also has it so I believed it was hereditary. One day I ran across an ad for great products so I tried it. Wow, like others it instantly took the years of yuck away! I even wake up fresh. I have tried to go off it and save money but find I can&#x27;t go without it - unless I want to feel yuck again! No more being ashamed and turning away. My only concern was price but they have started specials which truly helps! I have tried other products supposed to work like it but NONE do. I do wish there was a travel size - hard to take the big bottles...&lt;br /&gt;otherwise a must!</li>
            <li> like the product very much, will order again</li>
            <li> did not live up to expectations.  would not purchase again  Claims did not materialize and so would not rebuy again</li>
            <li> An outstanding product. It works as advertised.</li>
            <li> It really works!! I will reorder when the time comes.</li>
            <li> I cannot eat or drink or my breath will start to have an odor again when using this, but overall it&#x27;s a decent product</li>
            <li> I have suffered with halitosis, for as long as I can remember. At times, I would ponder, since, we have products to treat underarm odor, why isn&#x27;t there a product to treat halitosis. However, I was briefing this magazine, one day back in \\&quot;1999\\&quot;, where I saw an ad about \\&quot;Breath Appeal.\\&quot; I decided to order a month&#x27;s supply. After trying the product and conducting a breath test on my family, which resulted in rave results. I was bad-breath free! Breath Appeal, is truly an amazing product. I would recommend and have recommended it to a few people, who all are satisfied customers. I can&#x27;t go without it. But, don&#x27;t take my word for it, order some and reap the great results![[ASIN:B008LI9P22 Breath Appeal One Month Starter Kit]]</li>
            <li> When I heard about Breath Appeal,  I was a bit  skeptical. I tried it and IT worked so well it&#x27;s now a MUST HAVE! I do not won&#x27;t to ever be without it, using it has boost my confidence knowing I do not have bad breath issues ever. Thank you, Breath Appeal</li>
            <li> After suffering from chronic sour breath for years I finally found a product that WORKS.  Doesn&#x27;t just mask bad breath like mouthwash and mints.  I feel so much more confident around people now.</li>
            <li> before I spend more on this product, it would have to become more affordable for someone on a fixed income.</li>
            <li> Used the product for years.  After trying gum/mints and different Mouth Washes, I find&lt;br /&gt;this is the only product that has worked.  Very refreshing and easy to use.  I highly&lt;br /&gt;recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Breath Appeal for over 10 years and I would not go back to tooth paste. This is the best product for fresh breath and I don&#x27;t have to worry about offending anyone when I speak to them. I recommend Breath Appeal to anyone who experiences dry mouth from tooth paste or chronic bad breath (ask your spouse if you should use Breath Appeal).</li>
            <li> was pretty good, so far I am happy using that</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 20 years. It cleans my mouth without the burning minty alcohol feel of mouthwash. It tastes like cherry. This product somehow breaks down the icky stuff in your mouth and on your tongue during the swishing phase, even before you begin brushing. Love it and recommend you try it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Breath Appeal for about a year now. I used to be very self-conscious about my bad breath. Therefore I tried everything including gums, mints, and mouth wash but nothing worked. It all changed once I found Breath Appeal. I am extremely satisfied and I definitely recommend this product to everyone who deals with the same problem.</li>
            <li> buyer beware this stuff is basically koolaid. This stuff does absolutely nothing for bad breath. I knew I was duped when I first swished it in my mouth! This stuff is watery without any kind of consistancy whatsoever and doesn&#x27;t feel at all like it&#x27;s doing anything. The ratings must come from people who have some kind of interest in the product.</li>
            <li> My son has terrible breath since he was a toddler. This stuff makes is GONE</li>
            <li> Bought this product, really skeptical, They were right after the first night I did not have to brush my teeth!  Although I still did.  I will continue to use this product.  It has only been three days.</li>
