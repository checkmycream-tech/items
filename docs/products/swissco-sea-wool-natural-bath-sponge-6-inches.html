            <li>And amazing.</li>
            <li>This thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I have a really nice bath sponge that cost about $20</li>
            <li>It creates a nice foam when used with shower gel or soap.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a nice substitute for those plastic poofy sponges.  </li>
            <li>It lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li>Nice size for the bath.</li>
            <li>This is a nice sized sponge that can hold lots of bubbles and water.</li>
            <li>Very nice and clean</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, soft and silky to the skin as promised.</li>
            <li>Great size, good quality natural sponge.</li>
            <li>But apparently, sponges are a renewable resource, and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li>This is very good and soft on the body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an appealing slogan.</li>
            <li>Used it once and love it.</li>
            <li>Again, I love the sponge.</li>
            <li>and I have been pleased with the ones I bought .</li>
            <li>one of my favorite smells :-)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cost of seventeen dollars each,  the five inch at eleven dollars is a better buy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still in one piece after many uses, something I always appreciate.</li>
            <li>I love my Swissco sponge.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for one&#x27;s skin and really lathers up well.  </li>
            <li>There are better sponges on the market.</li>
            <li>I love this bath sponge.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It was better than one I got in the Bahamas</li>
            <li>OK...</li>
            <li>Using a sponge makes me feel I&#x27;m more in touch with nature and the sea than using a wash cloth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought it and plan to buy more.</li>
            <li>Overall an excellent product...thank you mother nature!</li>
            <li>Great natural sponge.</li>
            <li>Perfect texture and softness when wet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice sponge on the soft side.</li>
            <li>Still, a very nice natural sponge for the price.</li>
            <li>It comes apart easily, doesn&#x27;t make as sudsy of a foam, and takes longer to use.  </li>
            <li>I liked very much.</li>
            <li>Love love love my new sea sponge!</li>
            <li>I ordered this sponge and from the day I received it and used it for the first time, I have been happy that i got the real thing.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine for use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it and have another half of a sponge waiting for me once this one starts to wear out a bit.</li>
            <li>For all those who love to indulge in a soaking hot bath, try this, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed it while using it, but it breaks apart fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>These are great sponges for adults with super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Nice sponge-soft on skin and  large for the money--would recommend.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how people enjoy that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is nice to touch and gently exfoliates my skin (no scratching).</li>
            <li>and Ive loved them up until my most recent order.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good but just barely 6 inches!</li>
            <li>but it expanded beautifully when wet.</li>
            <li>I love bathing with sea sponges and the bigger, the better!</li>
            <li>This silky soft sponge makes bathing pure joy.  </li>
            <li>All I have done is rinse it after each use, and it still looks and smells clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used different sea sponges and these are the best ones I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>Love the large, plush feel of the sponge.</li>
            <li>Considering I am pushing it to use a washcloth a full week this is unreal.  </li>
            <li>Good for an exfoliating session that daily use I guess.</li>
            <li>So far it has worked nicely for me.</li>
            <li>It is soft and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>It hold a huge amount of water when you need to rinse, and I seem to use less soap because the sponge does a great job of holding it in the sponge as you wash.</li>
            <li>It was fine at first, but deteriorated and fell apart in about 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to remember where I bought the good one I had previously, but this just ain&#x27;t it!</li>
            <li>I gave it a quick wash when it took it out of the packaging, but it was pretty clean already.</li>
            <li>It lathers so well that I barely need much body wash (and is the perfect duet to my new favorite body wash by Not Soap, Radio, which I purchased at the same time:</li>
            <li>I somehow expected to get more lather than it gives, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I love natural sponge</li>
            <li>Love these sponges, durable and leaves skin soft</li>
            <li>I love these all natural bath sponges.</li>
            <li>but instead I have two, still... worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price, I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels on my skin - soft</li>
            <li>A pleasure to use and worth the cost.</li>
            <li>The only place to buy original products is online (mostly through Amazon.com).</li>
            <li>The sponge is as good as any other, and i like the smell of it...</li>
            <li>NOT AS GOOD AS OTHER SPONGES</li>
            <li>...medium is just right for my hand size...</li>
            <li>but I feel like I&#x27;m really scrubbed clean.</li>
            <li>Very soft and easy on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order this again though because they feel great, just not very long lasting or economical...........</li>
            <li>the size is more than adequate and I suspect it will last a while as I have used it</li>
            <li>Generates a great lather using just a small amount of body wash.</li>
            <li>Lathers up nicely and cleans easily, but a little large for my hand.</li>
            <li>I considered writing a very favorable review on this natural (?) sponge during the first two weeks, but decided to give it more time to test.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d ONLY recommend for an infant, because it&#x27;s only good for mildly washing - OF COURSE - WHEN SOAKED FOR YOUR CHILD.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li>and that are consistently of the softest variety.</li>
            <li>This bath sponge was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>and it stands up pretty well.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m willing to bet I&#x27;ll replace it in another month...  </li>
            <li>It lathers up nicely and isn&#x27;t too rough on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>or else I would show that my sponge fell apart after the first use.</li>
            <li>They love it and use it daily for washing faces.</li>
            <li>When it is dry and a little stiff,the sponge is perfect for my face.</li>
            <li>This new sponge is nice and big.</li>
            <li>It is very soft when wet and does a good job of lathering up.  </li>
            <li>i love this sponge  its not too hard or too soft and its a nice size</li>
            <li>My first real sea sponge.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t need to worry though; this sponge is large and uniform in size.  </li>
            <li>If you have the extra money and enjoy your bath or shower this will make it a little more special.</li>
            <li>Then really, really rinse the sponge to get the soap out.</li>
            <li>I had noticed that the texture started feeling like \\&quot;hair\\&quot; instead of spongy, and when I started lightly pulling on the \\&quot;hair\\&quot;, I found that I was pulling the entire sponge apart.  </li>
            <li>I knew that a real bath sponge wasn&#x27;t going to be cheap, but I had purchased several of the man-made-to-imitate-sponges and they just didn&#x27;t match up to the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Well I can tell you the shape is very pointed.  </li>
            <li>I have never owned a real sponge but got this for my wife.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, it is a real sea sponge and works well.</li>
            <li>Much rougher than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Turns out, not so much.  </li>
            <li>Just didn&#x27;t like it, the sponge didn&#x27;t really hold the body wash and when squeezed and released it didn&#x27;t regain it&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shopped at only sells cheap foam rubber ones nowadays.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a sea sponge in the past and was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>I have noticed though that my bath gels do not foam up as much as with the synthetic sponges.</li>
            <li>The last thing that I love about it is so far it has not been washed.  </li>
            <li>I had my last natural sponge for many years until it started to fall apart.  </li>
            <li>I know it costs more than the usual thing, but for me it is worth its price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Flimsy and not as good as the same product purchased previously.</li>
            <li>Makes more lather with less bath gel than synthetic sponges,</li>
            <li>I was able to cut this sponge in half.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size and lathers up a lot more with less soap than my old artificial loofa.</li>
            <li>the sponge is soft and suds up very well for gentle cleansing.</li>
            <li>It comes in a decent size.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that durable, but I like how soft it is and prefer it over the \\&quot;more durable\\&quot; sponges that are like a rock the first few weeks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fall apart as quickly as many other natural sponges.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the sponge works fine as expected.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and of high quality, they are soft and make lots of bubbles.</li>
            <li>The sponge is soft and gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>After using it for a few weeks, I love it.</li>
            <li>You can also get away with using less soap overall because the sponge generates a nice lather.</li>
            <li>It was also very small and didn&#x27;t suds up like my nice one.  </li>
            <li>a satisfactory product worth the price, I do wish it were a little larger, but still it is gentle, softer than a wash cloth, and rinses quickly.  </li>
            <li>Smells a little like the ocean for the first couple of uses (not a bad thing) but now is completely neutralized.</li>
            <li>this sponge got a big hole in it and then began to tear the first time i used it.</li>
            <li>--I got a whole sponge that&#x27;s quite full and round.  </li>
            <li>This was our first natural sponge and our last.</li>
            <li>I have bought natural sponges in the past and have paid much more for a sponge of this quality.</li>
            <li>These last a long time and can even be used to clean pets or vehicles.​</li>
            <li>but I cut it in pieces, it was far too large, I cut out the dense part in the middle, washed it with a natural soap</li>
            <li>Super soft on one side and has some scrubbing capabilities on the other.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised that no one in the reviews mentioned this.</li>
            <li>After I have used it for my face, I put soft soap on it for my body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft since day and practical to use without making your skin to burn.</li>
            <li>ALSO, if you do get it, completely wring out, then SET somewhere to air-dry.</li>
            <li>No round</li>
            <li>It is soft but has some abrasiveness to it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so soft and luxurious that you just want to use it to caress your skin.</li>
            <li>Soft.</li>
            <li>category unless you have some sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>soft to the touch...rinses well.</li>
            <li>I bought this sponge because it was natural.</li>
            <li>This bath sponge is definitely natural sponge.</li>
            <li>This is a natural sponge.</li>
            <li>Undoubtedly the nicest natural sponge I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>It is soft on the skin, sturdy and uniform in size.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing special about this product, it is just an oddly shaped sponge.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right size, and becomes so soft when it&#x27;s fully wet.</li>
            <li>Ordered the larger 6&amp;#34; sponge for an additional charge, but still received a sponge that only measured 5&amp;#34; (despite being marked as 6&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>Provides some degree of exfoliation, but is soft enough for more delicate skin.</li>
            <li>Big thirsty sponge has a rough side and smooth flat side.  </li>
            <li>Looks like you are getting a whole sponge, in reality what you see is the top half, the bottom is flat where the sponge is cut in half.  </li>
            <li>I love it and use it at least daily.</li>
            <li>Far superior to an artificial sponge.</li>
            <li>I have no trouble building up suds with it especially with liquid soaps.</li>
            <li>It is also soft when wet which makes it very gentle on dry skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this product looking to replace my usual loofas, which fall apart fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>These sponges are not round all over and will have a flat side.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to finally get a natural sea sponge!</li>
            <li>This sponge is soft yet it exfoliates the skin without having to scrape skin dry.  </li>
            <li>I am careful to rinse all the soap from the sponge, squeeze  as much water from it as I can and let it air dry.</li>
            <li>It is a little large and has a lump in the middle of the sponge.</li>
            <li>Recieved wrong item,  but a replacement along with an additional  free sponge was resent and arrived promptly.&lt;br /&gt;Sponges are natural but slightly smaller than description.  </li>

            <li> Nice size for the bath.</li>
            <li> This is a nice sized sponge that can hold lots of bubbles and water.</li>
            <li> Very nice and clean</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, soft and silky to the skin as promised.</li>
            <li> Great size, good quality natural sponge.</li>
            <li> But apparently, sponges are a renewable resource, and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> This is very good and soft on the body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an appealing slogan.</li>
            <li> Used it once and love it.</li>
            <li> Again, I love the sponge.</li>
            <li> and I have been pleased with the ones I bought .</li>
            <li> one of my favorite smells :-)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cost of seventeen dollars each,  the five inch at eleven dollars is a better buy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still in one piece after many uses, something I always appreciate.</li>
            <li> I love my Swissco sponge.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for one&#x27;s skin and really lathers up well.  </li>
            <li> There are better sponges on the market.</li>
            <li> I love this bath sponge.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It was better than one I got in the Bahamas</li>
            <li> OK...</li>
            <li> Using a sponge makes me feel I&#x27;m more in touch with nature and the sea than using a wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought it and plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> Overall an excellent product...thank you mother nature!</li>
            <li> Great natural sponge.</li>
            <li> Perfect texture and softness when wet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice sponge on the soft side.</li>
            <li> Still, a very nice natural sponge for the price.</li>
            <li> It comes apart easily, doesn&#x27;t make as sudsy of a foam, and takes longer to use.  </li>
            <li> I liked very much.</li>
            <li> Love love love my new sea sponge!</li>
            <li> I ordered this sponge and from the day I received it and used it for the first time, I have been happy that i got the real thing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine for use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it and have another half of a sponge waiting for me once this one starts to wear out a bit.</li>
            <li> For all those who love to indulge in a soaking hot bath, try this, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it while using it, but it breaks apart fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> These are great sponges for adults with super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Nice sponge-soft on skin and  large for the money--would recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how people enjoy that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is nice to touch and gently exfoliates my skin (no scratching).</li>
            <li> and Ive loved them up until my most recent order.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but just barely 6 inches!</li>
            <li> but it expanded beautifully when wet.</li>
            <li> I love bathing with sea sponges and the bigger, the better!</li>
            <li> This silky soft sponge makes bathing pure joy.  </li>
            <li> All I have done is rinse it after each use, and it still looks and smells clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used different sea sponges and these are the best ones I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> Love the large, plush feel of the sponge.</li>
            <li> Considering I am pushing it to use a washcloth a full week this is unreal.  </li>
            <li> Good for an exfoliating session that daily use I guess.</li>
            <li> So far it has worked nicely for me.</li>
            <li> It is soft and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> It hold a huge amount of water when you need to rinse, and I seem to use less soap because the sponge does a great job of holding it in the sponge as you wash.</li>
            <li> It was fine at first, but deteriorated and fell apart in about 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to remember where I bought the good one I had previously, but this just ain&#x27;t it!</li>
            <li> I gave it a quick wash when it took it out of the packaging, but it was pretty clean already.</li>
            <li> It lathers so well that I barely need much body wash (and is the perfect duet to my new favorite body wash by Not Soap, Radio, which I purchased at the same time:</li>
            <li> I somehow expected to get more lather than it gives, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I love natural sponge</li>
            <li> Love these sponges, durable and leaves skin soft</li>
            <li> I love these all natural bath sponges.</li>
            <li> but instead I have two, still... worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price, I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on my skin - soft</li>
            <li> A pleasure to use and worth the cost.</li>
            <li> The only place to buy original products is online (mostly through Amazon.com).</li>
            <li> The sponge is as good as any other, and i like the smell of it...</li>
            <li> NOT AS GOOD AS OTHER SPONGES</li>
            <li> ...medium is just right for my hand size...</li>
            <li> but I feel like I&#x27;m really scrubbed clean.</li>
            <li> Very soft and easy on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order this again though because they feel great, just not very long lasting or economical...........</li>
            <li> the size is more than adequate and I suspect it will last a while as I have used it</li>
            <li> Generates a great lather using just a small amount of body wash.</li>
            <li> Lathers up nicely and cleans easily, but a little large for my hand.</li>
            <li> I considered writing a very favorable review on this natural (?) sponge during the first two weeks, but decided to give it more time to test.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d ONLY recommend for an infant, because it&#x27;s only good for mildly washing - OF COURSE - WHEN SOAKED FOR YOUR CHILD.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li> and that are consistently of the softest variety.</li>
            <li> This bath sponge was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> and it stands up pretty well.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m willing to bet I&#x27;ll replace it in another month...  </li>
            <li> It lathers up nicely and isn&#x27;t too rough on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> or else I would show that my sponge fell apart after the first use.</li>
            <li> They love it and use it daily for washing faces.</li>
            <li> When it is dry and a little stiff,the sponge is perfect for my face.</li>
            <li> This new sponge is nice and big.</li>
            <li> It is very soft when wet and does a good job of lathering up.  </li>
            <li> i love this sponge  its not too hard or too soft and its a nice size</li>
            <li> My first real sea sponge.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t need to worry though; this sponge is large and uniform in size.  </li>
            <li> If you have the extra money and enjoy your bath or shower this will make it a little more special.</li>
            <li> Then really, really rinse the sponge to get the soap out.</li>
            <li> I had noticed that the texture started feeling like \\&quot;hair\\&quot; instead of spongy, and when I started lightly pulling on the \\&quot;hair\\&quot;, I found that I was pulling the entire sponge apart.  </li>
            <li> I knew that a real bath sponge wasn&#x27;t going to be cheap, but I had purchased several of the man-made-to-imitate-sponges and they just didn&#x27;t match up to the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Well I can tell you the shape is very pointed.  </li>
            <li> I have never owned a real sponge but got this for my wife.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, it is a real sea sponge and works well.</li>
            <li> Much rougher than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Turns out, not so much.  </li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t like it, the sponge didn&#x27;t really hold the body wash and when squeezed and released it didn&#x27;t regain it&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shopped at only sells cheap foam rubber ones nowadays.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a sea sponge in the past and was very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> I have noticed though that my bath gels do not foam up as much as with the synthetic sponges.</li>
            <li> The last thing that I love about it is so far it has not been washed.  </li>
            <li> I had my last natural sponge for many years until it started to fall apart.  </li>
            <li> I know it costs more than the usual thing, but for me it is worth its price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Flimsy and not as good as the same product purchased previously.</li>
            <li> Makes more lather with less bath gel than synthetic sponges,</li>
            <li> I was able to cut this sponge in half.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size and lathers up a lot more with less soap than my old artificial loofa.</li>
            <li> the sponge is soft and suds up very well for gentle cleansing.</li>
            <li> It comes in a decent size.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that durable, but I like how soft it is and prefer it over the \\&quot;more durable\\&quot; sponges that are like a rock the first few weeks.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fall apart as quickly as many other natural sponges.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the sponge works fine as expected.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and of high quality, they are soft and make lots of bubbles.</li>
            <li> The sponge is soft and gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few weeks, I love it.</li>
            <li> You can also get away with using less soap overall because the sponge generates a nice lather.</li>
            <li> It was also very small and didn&#x27;t suds up like my nice one.  </li>
            <li> a satisfactory product worth the price, I do wish it were a little larger, but still it is gentle, softer than a wash cloth, and rinses quickly.  </li>
            <li> Smells a little like the ocean for the first couple of uses (not a bad thing) but now is completely neutralized.</li>
            <li> this sponge got a big hole in it and then began to tear the first time i used it.</li>
            <li> --I got a whole sponge that&#x27;s quite full and round.  </li>
            <li> This was our first natural sponge and our last.</li>
            <li> I have bought natural sponges in the past and have paid much more for a sponge of this quality.</li>
            <li> These last a long time and can even be used to clean pets or vehicles.​</li>
            <li> but I cut it in pieces, it was far too large, I cut out the dense part in the middle, washed it with a natural soap</li>
            <li> Super soft on one side and has some scrubbing capabilities on the other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised that no one in the reviews mentioned this.</li>
            <li> After I have used it for my face, I put soft soap on it for my body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft since day and practical to use without making your skin to burn.</li>
            <li> ALSO, if you do get it, completely wring out, then SET somewhere to air-dry.</li>
            <li> No round</li>
            <li> It is soft but has some abrasiveness to it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so soft and luxurious that you just want to use it to caress your skin.</li>
            <li> Soft.</li>
            <li> category unless you have some sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li> soft to the touch...rinses well.</li>
            <li> I bought this sponge because it was natural.</li>
            <li> This bath sponge is definitely natural sponge.</li>
            <li> This is a natural sponge.</li>
            <li> Undoubtedly the nicest natural sponge I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> It is soft on the skin, sturdy and uniform in size.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing special about this product, it is just an oddly shaped sponge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right size, and becomes so soft when it&#x27;s fully wet.</li>
            <li> Ordered the larger 6&amp;#34; sponge for an additional charge, but still received a sponge that only measured 5&amp;#34; (despite being marked as 6&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> Provides some degree of exfoliation, but is soft enough for more delicate skin.</li>
            <li> Big thirsty sponge has a rough side and smooth flat side.  </li>
            <li> Looks like you are getting a whole sponge, in reality what you see is the top half, the bottom is flat where the sponge is cut in half.  </li>
            <li> I love it and use it at least daily.</li>
            <li> Far superior to an artificial sponge.</li>
            <li> I have no trouble building up suds with it especially with liquid soaps.</li>
            <li> It is also soft when wet which makes it very gentle on dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product looking to replace my usual loofas, which fall apart fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> These sponges are not round all over and will have a flat side.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to finally get a natural sea sponge!</li>
            <li> This sponge is soft yet it exfoliates the skin without having to scrape skin dry.  </li>
            <li> I am careful to rinse all the soap from the sponge, squeeze  as much water from it as I can and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> It is a little large and has a lump in the middle of the sponge.</li>
            <li> Recieved wrong item,  but a replacement along with an additional  free sponge was resent and arrived promptly.&lt;br /&gt;Sponges are natural but slightly smaller than description.  </li>
            <li> My aunt loves these natural wool bath sponges and have been buying these for other family members as well.</li>
            <li> This is the only company that consistently sends sponges that are at least 5 inches in diameter</li>
            <li> it is larger than I expected, bigger than my open hand</li>
            <li> Also,  they are not complete sponges,  but rather pieces cut from a larger section.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to comment on the durability.</li>
            <li> I know this will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> The only issue with these is they won&#x27;t dry out unless you can find a way to hang them up between uses.</li>
            <li> They can be stored on a shower caddy and should be left to air dry.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised but it is not round as pictured, It&#x27;s  irregular in shape  (natural in name must mean the source AND the shape.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s glued and gathered in the back, and that spot won&#x27;t even dry!  </li>
            <li> (like, mine had those little fleuret like things that are shared by sea invertebrates I have encountered while they were still alive).</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it feels so much better than artificial ones</li>
            <li> I was hoping this one would last longer (I&#x27;ve had natural ones in the past that did), but I doubt it will.  </li>
            <li> The size difference is likely minimal.</li>
            <li> and I suspect the sponge is going to become 2 sponges before too long.</li>
            <li> such a shame they are not very durable.</li>
            <li> I bought sponges at local spa center</li>
            <li> I really could care less, but the the picture is a little deceiving. .</li>
            <li> Sorry it had to be removed from the ocean, but it is very useful...</li>
            <li> As stated in other reviews, at first it&#x27;s slow to develop lather; but then it turns into a soap fountain.</li>
            <li> Allow to dry.</li>
            <li> Helps to exfoliate dry skin.  </li>
            <li> In fact, once I complete this review I am going to figure out how to return this rather small sponge that is also lacking any density for product [body wash] absorption and application.</li>
            <li> The problem I&#x27;m having is that it&#x27;s not a full sponge as shown but rather 1/4th of a larger sponge.</li>
            <li> Could have been a little larger.</li>
            <li> It is not round soft roll all over unfortunately.</li>
            <li> but you may have to position it carefully if it is for decoration</li>
            <li> That side is rough to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace another sponge which only lasted a few months.  </li>
            <li> Just a dab of gel on the wet sponge produces a ton of lather.</li>
            <li> As you can see it is barely 6 inches in length and not full round.  </li>
            <li> Too, I spend a LOT of money with Amazon; they have angered me on this purchase by expiring the return time so quickly, so I will definitely be looking for other avenues to purchase items in the future.</li>
            <li> ; was too thick &amp; large for my quite small hands.</li>
            <li> Really soft not good for exfoliating</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll last past 10 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 other sponges in the past 6 months (from different companies) and they have each lasted me about 3 months before deteriorating.</li>
            <li> After about ten showers it deteriorated; small chunks falling off and stretching out to look like a dishrag.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered a few of these and they don&#x27;t seem to last that long, they often arrive fairly dirty and they just don&#x27;t have much structure.  </li>
            <li> It is a little odd in that it is quite obvious that you are washing yourself with the corpse of a dead sea creature</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re only using this extremely delicate skin.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Also quite durable, despite heavy use for the past several months.</li>
            <li> But this one is definitely not worth getting.</li>
            <li> The size of this is less than advertised, saying this is 6 inches is somewhat deceptive.  </li>
            <li> It also has the side benefit of letting me use less shower gel each day.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 and they are both oddly cut, not longer round and are about 2/3 the size of any of my previous orders.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because the shape isn&#x27;t round like photo.</li>
            <li> Also, hair gets caught and trapped in it</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> The photo in this ad is deceptive as it shoes the sponge being round in shape...where the delivered product is oval.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now and it is holding up well.  </li>
            <li> and it is pretty much impossible to extract it.  </li>
            <li> This smelled funny bad when I got it</li>
            <li> but then again I am not sure what these sponges are supposed to look like.  </li>
            <li> When I received mine, it still had a small shell stuck inside.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been ordering products through Amazon for years and this is the first time I have been thoroughly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how to post a picture</li>
            <li> I was worried when I opened the small mailer that this came in</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and it tears.</li>
            <li> After one month of daily usage (twice a day), they grew very thin and started to fall apart..</li>
            <li> Before &amp; after cutting, I have multi flat sided sponges instead of a round.</li>
            <li> It had a hard spot at the end</li>
            <li> The gathering is HARD.  </li>
            <li> It has a bit of an unpleasant smell after rinsing it out, but that is about my only complaint.</li>
            <li> This replaced a nasty gritty sponge I bought locally.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard and poor texture.</li>

            <li> The sponge is great but I can&#x27;t get over the awful smell. I juse used it and I feel like I need to re-shower with something else to get this odor out of my skin. I smell like I just came hone from the beach. I don&#x27;t see how people enjoy that. I don&#x27;t want to walk around smelling like a salty sea animal. I want to smell like my body wash. No body wash or perfume ever advertised as &amp;#34;you&#x27;ll smell like salt and beach all day!&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s not an appealing slogan. I&#x27;m surprised that no one in the reviews mentioned this. I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this item if I knew how terrible it smells and how the stench will follow me all day. Gross!</li>
            <li> These are great sponges for adults with super sensitive skin. This is the only company that consistently sends sponges that are at least 5 inches in diameter and that are consistently of the softest variety. You can also get away with using less soap overall because the sponge generates a nice lather. The only issue with these is they won&#x27;t dry out unless you can find a way to hang them up between uses. If you leave them to sit on a ledge, they&#x27;ll stay soggy.</li>
            <li> It is good. I somehow expected to get more lather than it gives, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> The size is bigger than I expect, resistant  it doesn&#x27;t break out in pieces</li>
            <li> Cashmere like sponge.  Used it once and love it.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this sponge! It feels so good. When it is dry and a little stiff,the sponge is perfect for my face. After I have used it for my face, I put soft soap on it for my body. Then really, really rinse the sponge to get the soap out. Allow to dry. Again, I love the sponge.</li>
            <li> the sponge is soft and suds up very well for gentle cleansing.</li>
            <li> This is a man sized sponge that won&#x27;t break apart in the shower.  It could be made into two sponges.  My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> So this is not one of them. It&#x27;s soft since day and practical to use without making your skin to burn. It&#x27;s not that durable, but I like how soft it is and prefer it over the \\&quot;more durable\\&quot; sponges that are like a rock the first few weeks.</li>
            <li> 1) DON&#x27;T DO IT!  - THIS IS A MESS!!&lt;br /&gt;2) Unless you&#x27;re only using this extremely delicate skin.&lt;br /&gt;3) This is NOT a loofah, exfoliating experience at all.&lt;br /&gt;4) I&#x27;d ONLY recommend for an infant, because it&#x27;s only good for mildly washing - OF COURSE - WHEN SOAKED FOR YOUR CHILD.&lt;br /&gt;5) ALSO, if you do get it, completely wring out, then SET somewhere to air-dry.</li>
            <li> Nice sponge-soft on skin and  large for the money--would recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice sponge on the soft side. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because the shape isn&#x27;t round like photo. The 6&amp;#34; was too thick &amp; large for my quite small hands. I wound up cutting in half. Before &amp; after cutting, I have multi flat sided sponges instead of a round. Still, a very nice natural sponge for the price.</li>
            <li> The only reason it&#x27;s not a 5 star is because it&#x27;s cut to be a 6 inch sponge. I really could care less, but the the picture is a little deceiving. .</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it while using it, but it breaks apart fairly quickly.  Also, hair gets caught and trapped in it and it is pretty much impossible to extract it.  Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> It had a hard spot at the end like it was cut off at the route. It is not round soft roll all over unfortunately. It was expensive for what I received.</li>
            <li> I made a mistake buyimg this sponge. It&#x27;s hard and poor texture. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item from Amazon (the actual seller) on Sept. 5 and the delivery was Sept 13.  I considered writing a very favorable review on this natural (?) sponge during the first two weeks, but decided to give it more time to test.  However, on Oct. 19, I started noticing pieces of the sponge in the tub.  I had noticed that the texture started feeling like \\&quot;hair\\&quot; instead of spongy, and when I started lightly pulling on the \\&quot;hair\\&quot;, I found that I was pulling the entire sponge apart.  I cannot believe that this is actually a sponge at all.  When I looked into \\&quot;returns and refunds\\&quot;, I found that the time frame to return had expired on Oct. 15.  So, from the time that I received this $15+ sponge and until the time that it because unusable and was literally falling apart, it was only about 4 weeks.  This is the third sponge that I have bought on Amazon (3 different sellers) and I have not had any luck with any of them.  These 3 sponges have cost me approximate $40+ and I have not gotten but maybe 6 months total use out of them.  I am going to go back to the synthetic $2 sponges at Walmart.  Too, I spend a LOT of money with Amazon; they have angered me on this purchase by expiring the return time so quickly, so I will definitely be looking for other avenues to purchase items in the future.</li>
            <li> I love natural sponge and I have been pleased with the ones I bought .</li>
            <li> The sponge is as good as any other, and i like the smell of it...it smells like the sea, one of my favorite smells :-)</li>
            <li> Could have been a little larger.</li>
            <li> This sponge is soft yet it exfoliates the skin without having to scrape skin dry.  When using soap ensure to rinse it thoroughly.</li>
            <li> i love this sponge  its not too hard or too soft and its a nice size</li>
            <li> This bath sponge was exactly what I needed. Perfect size--BIG--and very good quality. I think another reviewer mentioned their sponge arrived as a piece cut from a larger sponge, but that&#x27;s not what I received--I got a whole sponge that&#x27;s quite full and round.  Recommend!</li>
            <li> Love these sponges, durable and leaves skin soft</li>
            <li> I knew that a real bath sponge wasn&#x27;t going to be cheap, but I had purchased several of the man-made-to-imitate-sponges and they just didn&#x27;t match up to the real thing.  I ordered this sponge and from the day I received it and used it for the first time, I have been happy that i got the real thing.  Some things just can&#x27;t be created by man....</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  l like its use in the shower.  It is expensive,  however, and I think I would have made a better purchase with the five inch sponges.  When looking at the six inch and it&#x27;s cost of seventeen dollars each,  the five inch at eleven dollars is a better buy.  The size difference is likely minimal.</li>
            <li> Who Lives in a Pineapple Under the Sea?</li>
            <li> NOT AS GOOD AS OTHER SPONGES I HAVE BOUGHT.</li>
            <li> one of the best sponge deals I have found. the size is more than adequate and I suspect it will last a while as I have used it and it stands up pretty well. it is larger than I expected, bigger than my open hand</li>
            <li> Very nice and clean but it is a cut off piece just so consumer knows....it&#x27;s fine for use but you may have to position it carefully if it is for decoration</li>
            <li> It is big and fluffy BUT has a horrible smell. It also is gathered and glued on the bottom and is discolored a bright orange around the gathering.  The gathering is HARD.  I tossed it and am now looking for another.</li>
            <li> a satisfactory product worth the price, I do wish it were a little larger, but still it is gentle, softer than a wash cloth, and rinses quickly.  I have no trouble building up suds with it especially with liquid soaps.</li>
            <li> I have a really nice bath sponge that cost about $20 so I thought I would see if this was comparable.  Well I can tell you the shape is very pointed.  No round like it looks.  It was also very small and didn&#x27;t suds up like my nice one.  Threw it away.  It was just a hassle to use.</li>
            <li> I watched a show on tv about how they get these sponges from the ocean.  I knew I had to try. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have never owned a real sponge but got this for my wife.  My wife acted indifferent to it so I started using it and I was impressed.  It is soft but has some abrasiveness to it.  It hold a huge amount of water when you need to rinse, and I seem to use less soap because the sponge does a great job of holding it in the sponge as you wash. The last thing that I love about it is so far it has not been washed.  All I have done is rinse it after each use, and it still looks and smells clean.  Considering I am pushing it to use a washcloth a full week this is unreal.  If you have the extra money and enjoy your bath or shower this will make it a little more special.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, soft and silky to the skin as promised. I would order again.  Makes more lather with less bath gel than synthetic sponges,</li>
            <li> I bought this product looking to replace my usual loofas, which fall apart fairly quickly. After three uses this sponge has not held up to my expectations and has started to rip a bit. For the outrageous price tag on this thing I hoped it would last at least a few weeks but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll last past 10 days. There&#x27;s nothing special about this product, it is just an oddly shaped sponge. I would recommend if it were $2 or $3 however this is not the case.</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s moist it&#x27;s so soft and luxurious that you just want to use it to caress your skin. It is a luxury!</li>
            <li> It was fine at first, but deteriorated and fell apart in about 4 weeks.  Save your money and buy a fake sponge at Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Perfect for washing your face over the sink in the evening. I break it up into smaller pieces for this. It holds the water nicely for rinsing, and it exfoliates the skin perfectly.</li>
            <li> This sponge did not have the touch that I was looking for. It is a little large and has a lump in the middle of the sponge. Lathers up nicely and cleans easily, but a little large for my hand.</li>
            <li> Really soft not good for exfoliating</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fall apart as quickly as many other natural sponges. It&#x27;s still in one piece after many uses, something I always appreciate.</li>
            <li> Just feels wierd saying it.  Big thirsty sponge has a rough side and smooth flat side.  I think it is great.</li>
            <li> It has a poor quality</li>
            <li> Great size, good quality natural sponge. Nothing compares to a sea sponge!</li>
            <li> Love the large, plush feel of the sponge. As stated in other reviews, at first it&#x27;s slow to develop lather; but then it turns into a soap fountain. The sponge is soft and gentle on your skin. I love my Swissco sponge.</li>
            <li> Looks like you are getting a whole sponge, in reality what you see is the top half, the bottom is flat where the sponge is cut in half.  That side is rough to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it is a real sea sponge and works well. Good price for the side I just don&#x27;t like &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; areas.</li>
            <li> was not in the best shape but then again I am not sure what these sponges are supposed to look like.  Mine looked discolored and dirty even though it probably wasn&#x27;t.  I guess the presentation wasn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li> I have ordered a few of these and they don&#x27;t seem to last that long, they often arrive fairly dirty and they just don&#x27;t have much structure.  The last one was like using a wash cloth after a week or so.</li>
            <li> I had been using a tourist-grade wool sponge from a gift store on the sponge docks in Tarpon Springs for a year or so. Finally I decided it was time to try a bath grade one.  I love it and use it at least daily.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace another sponge which only lasted a few months.  I was hoping this one would last longer (I&#x27;ve had natural ones in the past that did), but I doubt it will.  It&#x27;s glued and gathered in the back, and that spot won&#x27;t even dry!  I&#x27;ve had it a month and I&#x27;m willing to bet I&#x27;ll replace it in another month...  This has been very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Ordered the larger 6&amp;#34; sponge for an additional charge, but still received a sponge that only measured 5&amp;#34; (despite being marked as 6&amp;#34;).  Otherwise, the sponge works fine as expected.</li>
            <li> Much rougher than I thought it would be. Also doesn&#x27;t lather well. Good for an exfoliating session that daily use I guess.</li>
            <li> Sensual. erotic, playful, and indulgent. That what this sponge is, and there can be no dispute.  In the shower, hydrobath, alone or with my partner these add an experience of pleasure.</li>
            <li> I love it&lt;br /&gt;it feels so much better than artificial ones&lt;br /&gt;wish it was a bit bigger though&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Very nice sponge. I know it costs more than the usual thing, but for me it is worth its price.&lt;br /&gt;Natural means a lot to me. When I received mine, it still had a small shell stuck inside.&lt;br /&gt;It is nice to touch and gently exfoliates my skin (no scratching). It creates a nice foam when used with shower gel or soap.&lt;br /&gt;This sponge is aesthetically pleasing to look at and have in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;At the end of my shower I am careful to rinse all the soap from the sponge, squeeze  as much water from it as I can and let it air dry. So far it has worked nicely for me. I am happy to have it.</li>
            <li> The size of this is less than advertised, saying this is 6 inches is somewhat deceptive.  It&#x27;s tiny for a man&#x27;s hand so be warned.  Added a picture for scale and measurement.  As you can see it is barely 6 inches in length and not full round.  The photo in this ad is deceptive as it shoes the sponge being round in shape...where the delivered product is oval.</li>
            <li> it serves the purpose</li>
            <li> Soft. And amazing. Get this sponge. Lasts about 60-days depending on scrubbing power.</li>
            <li> I was able to cut this sponge in half.  I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now and it is holding up well.  It lathers up nicely and isn&#x27;t too rough on my skin.  I&#x27;m very happy with it and have another half of a sponge waiting for me once this one starts to wear out a bit.</li>
            <li> Super soft on one side and has some scrubbing capabilities on the other. I wouldn&#x27;t put this in the &amp;#34;too abrasive&amp;#34; category unless you have some sensitive skin. The size of the sponge I received was 6&amp;#34;+. Highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> this sponge got a big hole in it and then began to tear the first time i used it. i returned it and ordered a different sponge</li>
            <li> I love these all natural bath sponges. I found one in a gift shop in Florida for $25.00. What a steal when you buy from here!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but just barely 6 inches!</li>
            <li> Great natural sponge.</li>
            <li> This smelled funny bad when I got it but I cut it in pieces, it was far too large, I cut out the dense part in the middle, washed it with a natural soap and it&#x27;s perfect now, if I had planned it better I could have gotten three poufs out of the one but instead I have two, still... worth the money.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to finally get a natural sea sponge! This thing is amazing.  It lathers so well that I barely need much body wash (and is the perfect duet to my new favorite body wash by Not Soap, Radio, which I purchased at the same time: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K1HFY3A/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1).  It is also great to rub over the skin in a bubble bath and looks lovely sitting on my bath counter.  I definitely plan to include this in future gifts to friends!</li>
            <li> The shape was weird.  Does not look like the picture.  I would NOT order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karen</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve been using sponges from the Home Depot paint department for my shower.  I never knew there were different sponges out there.  These sponges are so much better!</li>
            <li> Love love love my new sea sponge! It&#x27;s exactly what I was expecting. It&#x27;s the perfect size and lathers up a lot more with less soap than my old artificial loofa. Well worth the price, I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Good sponge but not the size they said it was , about 5inch and just starting to fall apart that&#x27;s why I give it 3 stars</li>
            <li> I had my last natural sponge for many years until it started to fall apart.  I was concerned about getting a good replacement...didn&#x27;t need to worry though; this sponge is large and uniform in size.  It&#x27;s great for one&#x27;s skin and really lathers up well.  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Ive been buying and using these sponges for a couple of years and Ive loved them up until my most recent order.  I purchased 2 and they are both oddly cut, not longer round and are about 2/3 the size of any of my previous orders.</li>
            <li> Recieved wrong item,  but a replacement along with an additional  free sponge was resent and arrived promptly.&lt;br /&gt;Sponges are natural but slightly smaller than description.  Also,  they are not complete sponges,  but rather pieces cut from a larger section.</li>
            <li> I have been ordering products through Amazon for years and this is the first time I have been thoroughly disappointed.  Do not waste your money.  In fact, once I complete this review I am going to figure out how to return this rather small sponge that is also lacking any density for product [body wash] absorption and application.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how to post a picture or else I would show that my sponge fell apart after the first use. I&#x27;ve had 2 other sponges in the past 6 months (from different companies) and they have each lasted me about 3 months before deteriorating.</li>
            <li> There are better sponges on the market. It has a tendency to feel slimy,</li>
            <li> Sorry it had to be removed from the ocean, but it is very useful...lathers well and scrubs great...medium is just right for my hand size...</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a nice substitute for those plastic poofy sponges.  Turns out, not so much.  It comes apart easily, doesn&#x27;t make as sudsy of a foam, and takes longer to use.  Stick with the poofies.</li>
            <li> Perfect size to fit in your hand.  Perfect texture and softness when wet.  I know this will last a very long time. Great value and purchase!!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for our daughter&#x27;s Easter Basket.</li>
            <li> This was our first natural sponge and our last. Just didn&#x27;t like it, the sponge didn&#x27;t really hold the body wash and when squeezed and released it didn&#x27;t regain it&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li> I love this bath sponge.  Smells a little like the ocean for the first couple of uses (not a bad thing) but now is completely neutralized.</li>
            <li> This replaced a nasty gritty sponge I bought locally. And it is the softest sponge I have ever owned. It is a little odd in that it is quite obvious that you are washing yourself with the corpse of a dead sea creature (like, mine had those little fleuret like things that are shared by sea invertebrates I have encountered while they were still alive). But apparently, sponges are a renewable resource, and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> Great sponge.  Very soft and easy on the skin.  It does pick up a lot of dirt at the same time.  Love it.</li>
            <li> My first real sea sponge. It lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li> I was worried when I opened the small mailer that this came in but it expanded beautifully when wet. Nice size for the bath.</li>
            <li> I liked very much. It was better than one I got in the Bahamas</li>
            <li> It works as advertised but it is not round as pictured, It&#x27;s  irregular in shape  (natural in name must mean the source AND the shape.</li>
            <li> Far superior to an artificial sponge. Also quite durable, despite heavy use for the past several months. Provides some degree of exfoliation, but is soft enough for more delicate skin. Great for body wash users.</li>
            <li> This is very good and soft on the body.</li>
            <li> The sponge works OK...lot&#x27;s of lather...soft to the touch...rinses well. The problem I&#x27;m having is that it&#x27;s not a full sponge as shown but rather 1/4th of a larger sponge. The cut edges are already starting to rip and I suspect the sponge is going to become 2 sponges before too long. If I&#x27;m wrong I will revise my review but I&#x27;m not hopeful.</li>
            <li> This silky soft sponge makes bathing pure joy.  Using a sponge makes me feel I&#x27;m more in touch with nature and the sea than using a wash cloth.  I&#x27;m so glad I bought it and plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> These were a great surprise. Reasonably priced and of high quality, they are soft and make lots of bubbles. I have bought natural sponges in the past and have paid much more for a sponge of this quality.</li>
            <li> My aunt loves these natural wool bath sponges and have been buying these for other family members as well. Ever store I&#x27;ve shopped at only sells cheap foam rubber ones nowadays. The only place to buy original products is online (mostly through Amazon.com).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lousy sponge. It&#x27;s small and it tears.</li>
            <li> I love bathing with sea sponges and the bigger, the better! This is a nice sized sponge that can hold lots of bubbles and water. I gave it a quick wash when it took it out of the packaging, but it was pretty clean already. These sponges are not round all over and will have a flat side. They can be stored on a shower caddy and should be left to air dry. I&#x27;ve used different sea sponges and these are the best ones I have tried so far. These last a long time and can even be used to clean pets or vehicles.​</li>
            <li> Flimsy and not as good as the same product purchased previously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a sea sponge in the past and was very pleased.  But this one is definitely not worth getting. After about ten showers it deteriorated; small chunks falling off and stretching out to look like a dishrag.  I&#x27;d love to remember where I bought the good one I had previously, but this just ain&#x27;t it!</li>
            <li> I bought this sponge because it was natural. After using it for a few weeks, I love it. It&#x27;s just the right size, and becomes so soft when it&#x27;s fully wet. I love the way it feels on my skin - soft but I feel like I&#x27;m really scrubbed clean. It also has the side benefit of letting me use less shower gel each day. Just a dab of gel on the wet sponge produces a ton of lather. I just rinse it well after use and it dries thoroughly</li>
            <li> This sponge has lived up to my expectations.  It is very soft when wet and does a good job of lathering up.  It has a bit of an unpleasant smell after rinsing it out, but that is about my only complaint. Good size.  Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to comment on the durability.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT SPONGE JUST RIGHT SIZE</li>
            <li> This bath sponge is definitely natural sponge. It is soft and lathers nicely. I got two of them, one for my Mom and one for my sister. They love it and use it daily for washing faces. However, both sponges are very fragile! After one month of daily usage (twice a day), they grew very thin and started to fall apart.. such a shame they are not very durable. I bought sponges at local spa center so I know this is uncommon. I&#x27;m going to order this again though because they feel great, just not very long lasting or economical...........</li>
            <li> Fell apart after 3 uses.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great deal and great product and fast ship!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a natural sponge. Yet it has a firmness to it, so you get the effectiness of a luffa. I really like this. It comes in a decent size.  For all those who love to indulge in a soaking hot bath, try this, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Helps to exfoliate dry skin.  Generates a great lather using just a small amount of body wash.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sponge to replace one I got a couple of years ago that was finally falling apart.  This new sponge is nice and big. It is also soft when wet which makes it very gentle on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Undoubtedly the nicest natural sponge I have ever owned.It is soft on the skin, sturdy and uniform in size. A pleasure to use and worth the cost. I have noticed though that my bath gels do not foam up as much as with the synthetic sponges. Overall an excellent product...thank you mother nature!</li>
