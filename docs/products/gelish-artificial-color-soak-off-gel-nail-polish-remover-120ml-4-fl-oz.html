    <ol>
            <li>But this is the best product for removal of gelish</li>
            <li>It worked great!</li>
            <li>The bottle was not the best design as the liquid went all over the place when I was trying to put it in a container to soak off my nails.</li>
            <li>This is great for removing gel polish.</li>
            <li>Works great but knowing what I now know about the Cleanser and the Soak off remover, I will probably not reorder refills.</li>
            <li>Smell great, nourishes your nails and removes all of your polish.</li>
            <li>And I tried Vaseline around my nails with the acetone when soaking my gel off and it worked great</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>Hope this helps somebody, and good luck.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>Good price as well.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the product</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Effective for any nail type.</li>
            <li>Nice color &amp; packaging.  </li>
            <li>this is effective, but not as effective.</li>
            <li>While I hoped I could remove my own gel nails, it did not remove any layers of polish.</li>
            <li>I love the Gelish removal system because its nourishing and it smells good.</li>
            <li>I do my own Gel Nails at home every 2 weeks and this bottle has lasted around 6 months.</li>
            <li>it is fantastic removing the soack off and leaves a good parfum.</li>
            <li>and I found acetone to be, in my opinion, more effective.</li>
            <li>This remover has worked the best so far</li>
            <li>This is an amazing deal on a product I love</li>
            <li>So easy!   </li>
            <li>greetings from Spain, Good correo.rapidez, kind, right can have the utmost confidence with AMAZON AND ITS PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>Then I use a very fine filing block to remove the shiny top coat so that the acetone can permeate into the polish.</li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t lay it on its side, it will leak out.</li>
            <li>I then tried soaking in the 100% acetone, which was so drying to my fingers and nails and it took forever -- more than 20 minutes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought it more than once myself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Directions:  Roughen the surface of the nail polish (Top It Off) to help the remover saturate into the layers below.  </li>
            <li>I cover this with the Top</li>
            <li>I cover this with the Top</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product line.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and great price.</li>
            <li>When mine arrived, the top had a layer of adhesive tape around it, but it was already leaking in transit.  </li>
            <li>This product worked much better than what i used to use to take off the gel nails.</li>
            <li>I guess its okay, but I just do not use it.</li>
            <li>an excellent product, very durable quality&#x27;m inaccuracies, thank you very much ..</li>
            <li>easy to use I</li>
            <li>There are some conditioning/replenishing agent in this product, which is great and smells better, however, nails have to be dehydrating before and in order to apply gel foundation to adhere properly.</li>
            <li>If it still does not remove easily, I would question then if one of the products used during the manicure was not of the SOAK OFF product line.  </li>
            <li>and I was so amazed at how easy it was to remove the nail gel polish with this solution.</li>
            <li>To remove the first Gelish polish I got done in a Salon, I tried one reviewer&#x27;s suggestion and got the swirl kind of acetone nail polish remover</li>
            <li>The product is fine but the bottle leaked during shipment.  </li>
            <li>Also the smell is more pleasant than what I was used to from regular nail polish removers.  </li>
            <li>Twist the free end of the foil to enclose and secure the cotton ball in place.  </li>
            <li>Finish by lightly buffing the nail plate and applying the nourish cuticle oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have found it is much easier and more economical to purchase acrylic (water-base) paints and mix my own color of choice for my nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I have found it is much easier and more economical to purchase acrylic (water-base) paints and mix my own color of choice for my nail polish.  </li>
            <li>No dried out finger tips from soaking in a bowl at the salon &amp; it smelled good too.</li>
            <li>Everything worked good and I am pleased with everything overall.</li>
            <li>I file off the top coat then apply this to cotton pads and wrap in foil, takes closer to 15 minutes than 10 but still the polish just slides right off afterwards.</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle of 100% acetone from a local drug store which was cheaper and will probably be much more effective.</li>
            <li>I have found the acetone to remove gel polish is nothing special.</li>
            <li>A special solvent evaporates and cures the resin thorugh oxidation or through exposure to an LED or UV lamp.  </li>

            <li>Acetone is much cheaper and you get a lot more.</li>
            <li>well as now I have beautiful long-lasting manicure and pedicure (through a few try-and-errors).    </li>
            <li>Okay so I am new to the gelish polish world</li>
            <li>I use regular oil free $1.99 nail polish remover to clean off the tackiness from the Top it Off instead of the Cleanser.</li>
            <li>The Gelish polish was great on and stayed the same as new for over 1.3 week</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it so far</li>
            <li>Ingredients:  Acetone, Water (Aqua), Propylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Red 33 (CL 17200), Rose Fragrance (Parfum), Hydroxycitronellol, Phenethyl Alcohol, Geranyl Acetate, Geraniol, Dipropylene Glycol, Cymbopogon Martini Oil, Benzyl Acetate, Amyl Cinnamal, Isobutenyl Methyltetrahydropyran,</li>
            <li>This will be worth the saving</li>
            <li>They should find a better way to ship this item because it clearly spilled in the package.</li>
            <li>They are very fast on delivery and products are new &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>This does as described and even has a good smell to it unlike other removers just be careful to soak in glass not plastics or also use Cotten swab on nail and wrap with tin foil works just as good</li>
            <li>I used the cotton &amp; foil method to soak my nails for about 10 minutes and the gel polish just slid right off.</li>
            <li>This remover smells pleasant -- just a faint nice smell, which is another plus.   </li>
            <li>It goes very fast.</li>
            <li>I was very very very  worried about the removal process when I first learned about this Gelish polish  -- DIY or at salons.    </li>
            <li>I first recieved a damadge product but the seller was 100%</li>
            <li>so it is almost hot.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because that is what I was shown when I first started manicures...</li>
            <li>I wanted to try to do the gel nails for myself because the price at the salon was so much more than the traditional manicure and all the Gelish products I purchased were exactly as promised and enable me to save lots of money.</li>
            <li>I will keep buying this product because it really works!</li>
            <li>This is large size of what comes in the one I got when I first got gel nail polish.</li>
            <li>If the Gelish Soak Off product doesn&#x27;t remove easily, repeat the process described above.  </li>
            <li>The product worked better than expected.</li>
            <li>I did the whole cotton ball covered with aluminum and even scraping afterward</li>
            <li>I always apply vitamin E oil to my nails and fingers after this process because the acetone is very drying.</li>
            <li>So, personally, I don&#x27;t really get the replenishing agent.</li>
            <li>I am very upset.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>even if it is soft enough to scratch off the rest... it will scratch the top layer of you</li>
            <li>but it can be a pain in the rear to get this stuff off to apply new!</li>
            <li>You can get a better deal buying the generic brand from a local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>Really helps the process of getting the old gel off... much faster than just acetone.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I ordered it; it is worth the little bit extra</li>
            <li>love the gelish manicures, but one of the downsides is having to go to the salon to have it removed (for a fee), or destroy my nails while I obsessively peel it off.  </li>
            <li>When I recieved this package it had the lid on it with a layer of plastic wrap on the top and seemed like it was used by the amount that was missing</li>
            <li>It does not solve Gelish at all, which is great because if I decide to put a coat of different color regular polish on during the week I can do that, removed it with regular polish and go back to a French manicure.</li>
            <li>Its better to just pour a small amount into a bowl and just let them soak.</li>
            <li>and I have tried regular nail polish remover and straight acetone before trying this!</li>
            <li>but I was not aware that nail gels needs a special remover.</li>
            <li>Wish it was a large container for the same price.</li>
            <li>Took an hour to soak off, only takes 15 minutes with pure acetone.</li>
            <li>but if you do it this way instead of soaking your entire hand in a bowl of this stuff you won&#x27;t use as much.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate all the tips from various reviewers for how to do the Gelish nails</li>
            <li>Using a wooden stick, gently remove Gelish product.  </li>
            <li>And again, without damaging my natural nails.</li>
            <li>In 12 minutes it completely removes the gelish without stripping my natural nails.</li>
            <li>I used 1/3 already and had 3 manicures so far.</li>
            <li>Another selling point is that the amazon price is ALWAYS lower than in a professional beauty supply.</li>
            <li>My nails were not brittle and dry like they are when I&#x27;ve used the pure acetone.</li>
            <li>The lady at Sally&#x27;s said pure acetone works just as well and its only couple dollars for big bottle.</li>
            <li>Ive tried pure acetone as a removal system because it much cheaper to buy in bulk but the acetone smells really harsh and it turns my cuticles white and chalky.</li>
            <li>Gelish Soak Off Remover works great, doesn&#x27;t smell too bad (its got acetone in it</li>
            <li>I brought this to keep from using pure acetone to soak off my gel, so my skin wouldn&#x27;t get so dried out.</li>
            <li>What does not just literally drop off while soaking, I gently scrape off what little is left.</li>
            <li>I have tried several of the soak of things, like the pads and such, but it is so much easier to put a little in a bowl, and that seems to work quicker too.</li>
            <li>This product works very well and doesn&#x27;t dry your cuticles out as much as other products I have used.  </li>

            <li> And again, without damaging my natural nails.</li>
            <li> In 12 minutes it completely removes the gelish without stripping my natural nails.</li>
            <li> I used 1/3 already and had 3 manicures so far.</li>
            <li> Another selling point is that the amazon price is ALWAYS lower than in a professional beauty supply.</li>
            <li> My nails were not brittle and dry like they are when I&#x27;ve used the pure acetone.</li>
            <li> The lady at Sally&#x27;s said pure acetone works just as well and its only couple dollars for big bottle.</li>
            <li> Ive tried pure acetone as a removal system because it much cheaper to buy in bulk but the acetone smells really harsh and it turns my cuticles white and chalky.</li>
            <li> Gelish Soak Off Remover works great, doesn&#x27;t smell too bad (its got acetone in it</li>
            <li> I brought this to keep from using pure acetone to soak off my gel, so my skin wouldn&#x27;t get so dried out.</li>
            <li> What does not just literally drop off while soaking, I gently scrape off what little is left.</li>
            <li> I have tried several of the soak of things, like the pads and such, but it is so much easier to put a little in a bowl, and that seems to work quicker too.</li>
            <li> This product works very well and doesn&#x27;t dry your cuticles out as much as other products I have used.  </li>
            <li> Maybe soak time wasn&#x27;t long enough.</li>
            <li> Polishes of the 20th century were largely enamel-based paints, as are the present day polishes made for acrylic or false nails.  </li>
            <li> This last the same amount of time as does the Gelish Soak Off Gel Nail Polish which is an average cost of $10 per .5oz bottle.  </li>
            <li> This last the same amount of time as does the Gelish Soak Off Gel Nail Polish which is an average cost of $10 per .5oz bottle.  </li>
            <li> There are only a few tiny spots left</li>
            <li> Not a large bottle, but I don&#x27;t get gel nails all the time, so I think it will last me awhile.</li>
            <li> I soak the pad in this remover and then wrap TIGHTLY onto the nails with tin foil (which was also cut to smaller pieces to be just enough to cover the finger tips).   </li>
            <li> Using a light-weight tin foil 4X4 sheet, tightly wrap the foil around the finger from the first joint, extending out past the finger tip.  </li>
            <li> , my skin didn&#x27;t dry out at all this way.</li>
            <li> My nails were a mess and needed the extra protection.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was half empty when I finally unpacked it.</li>
            <li> This is simply acetone with fragrance, a little bit of oil for moisture and a touch of alcohol.</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that the bottle leaked a tiny bit during shipping, so the ink from the packing slip smeared onto the bottle.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have as harsh of a smell as regular polish remover, but it still isn&#x27;t a smell you&#x27;d want all over the place.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and quality as expected.</li>
            <li> Remover did cause some ease of removal but not to the extent I expected.</li>
            <li> AND this didn&#x27;t dry our my cuticles like the other stuff!</li>
            <li> The only difference between this small bottle and the gallon jugs is the name harmony and the \\&quot;for uv gel polish\\&quot; written on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I put water in one and 100% acetone in the other.</li>
            <li> I ordered it along with other \\&quot;Harmony Gelish\\</li>
            <li> The other is a water-based acrylic paint.  </li>
            <li> So after reading other reviews I decided to try the Harmony Remover.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Purpose: Gelish artificial nail remover is designed to remove the Gelish product lines and Acrylic nail polishes from the natural nail without drying the skin or damaging the natural nail plate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the bottle was half empty when it arrived.</li>
            <li> It arrived half spilled in the package.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Removal Times:  Gelish 10 minutes or less.  </li>
            <li> my removal time will be 10 minutes or less</li>
            <li> my removal time will be 10 minutes or less</li>
            <li> Used about half the bottle.</li>
            <li> Really a mess.</li>
            <li> I think it works a little faster than acetone too.</li>
            <li> Using the Gelish Artificial Nail Remover, saturate a cotton ball and place it over the entire nail trying to cover as little skin as possible (you may need to tear the cotton ball in half to reduce its size).  </li>
            <li> I sat with little pieces of cotton on my nails wrapped in tin foil like in the salon with this remover on the cotton and after a few minutes the gel just lifted off.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am too impatient for this method.</li>
            <li> Left behind is</li>
            <li> Left behind is</li>
            <li> Will never buy this again, what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is probably a waste of money.</li>
            <li> You can use plain Acetone to remove soak off gel nails if you want too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle</li>
            <li> just pour a small amount in a dish and soak the gel off scraping the excess off with a cuticle stick.</li>
            <li> What I do now is I take two small bowls.</li>
            <li> The amount of product used was minimal, so there is no great</li>
            <li> Anybody that&#x27;s ever used glitter and/or glitter polish knows that it&#x27;s usually a pain to get off - this is the solution.  </li>
            <li> I tried this a couple times, but it was difficult and further damaged my nails.</li>
            <li> What I did was cutting the cotton pads to be slightly bigger than each nail.  </li>
            <li> To have it removed in a salon would cost at least $3 for the fingernails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less expensive, quicker and this seller was a nightmare for me.</li>
            <li> Bottle design is not good.</li>
            <li> I was getting sick of paying $30 twice a month to get my nails done at the salon, this seller has made it possible for me to do this myself and saved me a ton of money for years to come.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s forgettable.</li>
            <li> I was so afraid of chemicals (e.g., Acetone) that would hurt my nails and finger skins.   </li>
            <li> I chose the rating because it got the job done to remove nail polish but did not do well to remove my artificial nails.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay salon prices to have my gel polish soaked off, so I ordered this instead. The product worked better than expected. I used the cotton &amp; foil method to soak my nails for about 10 minutes and the gel polish just slid right off. No dried out finger tips from soaking in a bowl at the salon &amp; it smelled good too. Not a large bottle, but I don&#x27;t get gel nails all the time, so I think it will last me awhile. My only complaint was that the bottle leaked a tiny bit during shipping, so the ink from the packing slip smeared onto the bottle.</li>
            <li> I first recieved a damadge product but the seller was 100% and he sent me another. I am very satisfied with the product it is fantastic removing the soack off and leaves a good parfum.</li>
            <li> I sat with little pieces of cotton on my nails wrapped in tin foil like in the salon with this remover on the cotton and after a few minutes the gel just lifted off. It&#x27;s a small bottle but if you do it this way instead of soaking your entire hand in a bowl of this stuff you won&#x27;t use as much.</li>
            <li> Works good. Make sure you don&#x27;t lay it on its side, it will leak out.</li>
            <li> Works well!  Put a cotton ball with some remover on it over your nails, then wrap in tinfoil.  Wait about 15 minutes and then you can scrape off the polish.  Didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because you do have to scrape it off, it doesn&#x27;t just wipe off.  But this is the best product for removal of gelish I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the gelish manicures, but one of the downsides is having to go to the salon to have it removed (for a fee), or destroy my nails while I obsessively peel it off.  This product fixes that!  Has already paid for itself because I didn&#x27;t have to go to the salon for removal!</li>
            <li> easy to use I just pour a small amount in a dish and soak the gel off scraping the excess off with a cuticle stick.</li>
            <li> This does as described and even has a good smell to it unlike other removers just be careful to soak in glass not plastics or also use Cotten swab on nail and wrap with tin foil works just as good</li>
            <li> I did a review for this product by accident on the alcohol that is used as a last step in the process. don&#x27;t buy either go to your beauty supply store 100% alcohol is the same thing and saves you about $4.</li>
            <li> Gelish Soak Off Remover works great, doesn&#x27;t smell too bad (its got acetone in it so it&#x27;s gonna have some smell).&lt;br /&gt;Conditioners in remover sooth nails and skin. You can use plain Acetone to remove soak off gel nails if you want too. This is just gentler on your hands.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li> an excellent product, very durable quality&#x27;m inaccuracies, thank you very much .. greetings from Spain, Good correo.rapidez, kind, right can have the utmost confidence with AMAZON AND ITS PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> To remove the first Gelish polish I got done in a Salon, I tried one reviewer&#x27;s suggestion and got the swirl kind of acetone nail polish remover and it did NOT work at all.   I then tried soaking in the 100% acetone, which was so drying to my fingers and nails and it took forever -- more than 20 minutes and I basically had to scrap the polish off at the end.  I did the second Gelish nails myself.  The Gelish polish was great on and stayed the same as new for over 1.3 week but I needed to change colors so  I used this Harmony remover this time: it took about 12 minutes and left no drying feeling on my fingers!!   This remover smells pleasant -- just a faint nice smell, which is another plus.   What I did was cutting the cotton pads to be slightly bigger than each nail.  I soak the pad in this remover and then wrap TIGHTLY onto the nails with tin foil (which was also cut to smaller pieces to be just enough to cover the finger tips).   The polish just came off as one big, swollen piece.  There are only a few tiny spots left that I just used my nature nails to scrap them off.   So easy!   I was very very very  worried about the removal process when I first learned about this Gelish polish  -- DIY or at salons.    I was so afraid of chemicals (e.g., Acetone) that would hurt my nails and finger skins.   I really appreciate all the tips from various reviewers for how to do the Gelish nails well as now I have beautiful long-lasting manicure and pedicure (through a few try-and-errors).    I highly recommend this remover as it took away my worries about nasty gel removal process and adverse effects on nails.</li>
            <li> You can get a better deal buying the generic brand from a local beauty supply store. I have found the acetone to remove gel polish is nothing special. The only difference between this small bottle and the gallon jugs is the name harmony and the \\&quot;for uv gel polish\\&quot; written on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Effective for any nail type. Nice color &amp; packaging.  Wish it was a large container for the same price.</li>
            <li> I tried using this product and had no luck with it all. I did the whole cotton ball covered with aluminum and even scraping afterward did not even touch it. Maybe I am too impatient for this method. What I do now is I take two small bowls. I put water in one and 100% acetone in the other. HEAT the one with the WATER so it is almost hot. Then I place the bowl with the acetone inside of the bowl with water.This will heat up the acetone and you will be amazed at the improved results.The HOTTER the WATER the WARMER the ACETONE. DO NOT HEAT THE ACETONE!! (FIRE HAZARD) Then I use a very fine filing block to remove the shiny top coat so that the acetone can permeate into the polish. Soak nails for approximately 10-15 minutes. What does not just literally drop off while soaking, I gently scrape off what little is left. Acetone is much cheaper and you get a lot more.I got mine from Wal Mart. I always apply vitamin E oil to my nails and fingers after this process because the acetone is very drying.Then I wash with soap and water and polish using the proper steps. Hope this helps somebody, and good luck.</li>
            <li> Works just like it says to remove the gelish shellac polishes.  Also the smell is more pleasant than what I was used to from regular nail polish removers.  I&#x27;ve bought it more than once myself.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to test it against what I already use to soak-off/remove gel polish and I found acetone to be, in my opinion, more effective. There are some conditioning/replenishing agent in this product, which is great and smells better, however, nails have to be dehydrating before and in order to apply gel foundation to adhere properly. So, personally, I don&#x27;t really get the replenishing agent. And, you can always replenish cuticles with oils afterwards, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is effective, but not as effective. I did the cotton ball and wrap method to soak-off...fyi.</li>
            <li> This product works very well and doesn&#x27;t dry your cuticles out as much as other products I have used.  I think it works a little faster than acetone too.</li>
            <li> I ordered it along with other \\&quot;Harmony Gelish\\&quot; polishes. I was looking to do Gel Nails at home. Everything worked good and I am pleased with everything overall. With this nail polish remover, I noticed it&#x27;s just like the polish remover you would buy at the store. I actually bought the one where you stick your finger in it and twist it around. That worked just as well to remove the gel nails, and for a fraction of the cost. Had I known this before hand, I would have skipped the cost of this and opted for another colored polish. I will end using it to refill the one I stick my finger in when it runs out.</li>
            <li> It arrived half spilled in the package. The lady at Sally&#x27;s said pure acetone works just as well and its only couple dollars for big bottle. The acetone worked for me. If I try this, I&#x27;ll buy it locally. It&#x27;s less expensive, quicker and this seller was a nightmare for me. They did end up refunding my purchase and shipping costs.</li>
            <li> This is great for removing gel polish. Its better to just pour a small amount into a bowl and just let them soak. I have tried several of the soak of things, like the pads and such, but it is so much easier to put a little in a bowl, and that seems to work quicker too. Then all you have to do is scrap it off with a  wood file or something.</li>
            <li> Okay so I am new to the gelish polish world and I LOVE it so far but it can be a pain in the rear to get this stuff off to apply new! This remover has worked the best so far and I have tried regular nail polish remover and straight acetone before trying this! I file off the top coat then apply this to cotton pads and wrap in foil, takes closer to 15 minutes than 10 but still the polish just slides right off afterwards. And nothing else I have used worked that well AND this didn&#x27;t dry our my cuticles like the other stuff! I will use and buy again.</li>
            <li> Ingredients:  Acetone, Water (Aqua), Propylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Red 33 (CL 17200), Rose Fragrance (Parfum), Hydroxycitronellol, Phenethyl Alcohol, Geranyl Acetate, Geraniol, Dipropylene Glycol, Cymbopogon Martini Oil, Benzyl Acetate, Amyl Cinnamal, Isobutenyl Methyltetrahydropyran, Citronellol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purpose: Gelish artificial nail remover is designed to remove the Gelish product lines and Acrylic nail polishes from the natural nail without drying the skin or damaging the natural nail plate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:  Roughen the surface of the nail polish (Top It Off) to help the remover saturate into the layers below.  Using the Gelish Artificial Nail Remover, saturate a cotton ball and place it over the entire nail trying to cover as little skin as possible (you may need to tear the cotton ball in half to reduce its size).  Using a light-weight tin foil 4X4 sheet, tightly wrap the foil around the finger from the first joint, extending out past the finger tip.  Twist the free end of the foil to enclose and secure the cotton ball in place.  Let this sit the required time limit.  Unwrap the foil and remove the cotton.  Using a wooden stick, gently remove Gelish product.  If the Gelish Soak Off product doesn&#x27;t remove easily, repeat the process described above.  If it still does not remove easily, I would question then if one of the products used during the manicure was not of the SOAK OFF product line.  If this is the case, you may need to file that product off.  Finish by lightly buffing the nail plate and applying the nourish cuticle oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal Times:  Gelish 10 minutes or less.  Acrylic polish 20 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General Information:  The term \\&quot;acrylic nail polish\\&quot; can apply to two types of finger nail polish.  One is a polish produced specifically for use on acrylic or false nails.  The other is a water-based acrylic paint.  Polishes of the 20th century were largely enamel-based paints, as are the present day polishes made for acrylic or false nails.  They are made by putting drying enamel acid together with alcohol.  Tiny fibers, or resin, are floated in the enamel mixture.  A special solvent evaporates and cures the resin thorugh oxidation or through exposure to an LED or UV lamp.  Left behind is a tough yet flexible fiber-based cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I have found it is much easier and more economical to purchase acrylic (water-base) paints and mix my own color of choice for my nail polish.  I cover this with the Top It Off gel ensuring I swipe my nail tip to protect the acrylic water-based paint.  This last the same amount of time as does the Gelish Soak Off Gel Nail Polish which is an average cost of $10 per .5oz bottle.  I am guaranteed my removal time will be 10 minutes or less and I save a fortune in buying nail polishes.ails.  They are made by putting drying enamel acid together with alcohol.

            <li> This is a product that I couldn&#x27;t do with out! I bought this product because that is what I was shown when I first started manicures... I absolutely love this product line. I will definitely buy this again....</li>
            <li> When I recieved this package it had the lid on it with a layer of plastic wrap on the top and seemed like it was used by the amount that was missing, that was visible when I opened the box. I am very upset.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try to do the gel nails for myself because the price at the salon was so much more than the traditional manicure and all the Gelish products I purchased were exactly as promised and enable me to save lots of money.</li>
            <li> This product soaked off the gelish polish in 15 minutes.  My nails were not brittle and dry like they are when I&#x27;ve used the pure acetone. I used the cotton pads cut in squares the same size as my nails and wrapped them in foil. After 10 minutes, the polish started to flake. In 15, the polish just \\&quot;fell\\&quot; off.  The amount of product used was minimal, so there is no great expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used glitter on my nails for some \\&quot;holiday glitz\\&quot;.  In order to do this, I used two coats of the gel builder to set the glitter.  This product still soaked both the glitter and the gel builder off without any problems.  Anybody that&#x27;s ever used glitter and/or glitter polish knows that it&#x27;s usually a pain to get off - this is the solution.  And again, without damaging my natural nails.</li>
            <li> I purchased 1 set of Gelish nail gel but I was not aware that nail gels needs a special remover. To have it removed in a salon would cost at least $3 for the fingernails. So I ordered Gelish Soak Off from Amazon and I was so amazed at how easy it was to remove the nail gel polish with this solution. I just followed the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
            <li> It does its job and that is all you can ask for. Just be careful, so far the bottles of remover have all leaked for me if they tip over. It doesn&#x27;t have as harsh of a smell as regular polish remover, but it still isn&#x27;t a smell you&#x27;d want all over the place.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and quality as expected.</li>
            <li> I bought the Gelish nail polish after researching it online and trying it at a salon a couple times.  My nails were a mess and needed the extra protection.  The manicurist said I could remove them with 100% acetone.  I tried this a couple times, but it was difficult and further damaged my nails. So after reading other reviews I decided to try the Harmony Remover.  It worked great! In 12 minutes it completely removes the gelish without stripping my natural nails. I am so glad I ordered it; it is worth the little bit extra it cost compared to the acetone.</li>
            <li> works as it should, alothough i recommend if using gelish polish, to soak it twenty minutes then rub off excess polish and do it again. even if it is soft enough to scratch off the rest... it will scratch the top layer of you nail off too.</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions , no results! In the end I had to soak my nails in acetone because to remove my gelish non-chip polish...</li>
            <li> Works great but knowing what I now know about the Cleanser and the Soak off remover, I will probably not reorder refills. I will get 100% acetone for a cheaper price at stores it does not have to be brand name. It goes very fast. I used 1/3 already and had 3 manicures so far. I use regular oil free $1.99 nail polish remover to clean off the tackiness from the Top it Off instead of the Cleanser. It does not solve Gelish at all, which is great because if I decide to put a coat of different color regular polish on during the week I can do that, removed it with regular polish and go back to a French manicure.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great price. Save money because nail salon charge additional 8.00 to remove gel nail. This will be worth the saving</li>
            <li> This is large size of what comes in the one I got when I first got gel nail polish. Good product</li>
            <li> You need this product in order to get all of your gelish polish off of your nails. Smell great, nourishes your nails and removes all of your polish.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing deal on a product I love I was getting sick of paying $30 twice a month to get my nails done at the salon, this seller has made it possible for me to do this myself and saved me a ton of money for years to come. They are very fast on delivery and products are new &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This product evaporates in front of your eyes!  Beware. When mine arrived, the top had a layer of adhesive tape around it, but it was already leaking in transit.  The bottle was half empty when I finally unpacked it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I can&#x27;t find it in stores, so have to order it.  100% acetone does the job of soaking of art nails, but this product is conditioning, so the nails, cuticles, etc. aren&#x27;t damaging, like with the acetone.</li>
            <li> I used this to remove gellish shellac with individual finger insert soakers. Remover did cause some ease of removal but not to the extent I expected. Still had polish that was difficult to remove &amp; used quite a bit of remover. Maybe soak time wasn&#x27;t long enough. Used about half the bottle. Bottle design is not good. There&#x27;s a hole where the liquid comes out but lots of spillage before it comes out properly. I bought a bottle of 100% acetone from a local drug store which was cheaper and will probably be much more effective.</li>
            <li> While I hoped I could remove my own gel nails, it did not remove any layers of polish. Even afte several minutesof soaking and several time of soaking, it did no produce the results I hoped for.</li>
            <li> I chose the rating because it got the job done to remove nail polish but did not do well to remove my artificial nails.  The bottle was not the best design as the liquid went all over the place when I was trying to put it in a container to soak off my nails.</li>
            <li> I love the Gelish removal system because its nourishing and it smells good. Ive tried pure acetone as a removal system because it much cheaper to buy in bulk but the acetone smells really harsh and it turns my cuticles white and chalky. Ick! with the Gelish remover my gels flake off after 15minutes in a wrap and the skin around my fingers is unchanged. Another selling point is that the amazon price is ALWAYS lower than in a professional beauty supply. I do my own Gel Nails at home every 2 weeks and this bottle has lasted around 6 months.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!! I brought this to keep from using pure acetone to soak off my gel, so my skin wouldn&#x27;t get so dried out. Took an hour to soak off, only takes 15 minutes with pure acetone. And I tried Vaseline around my nails with the acetone when soaking my gel off and it worked great, my skin didn&#x27;t dry out at all this way. Will never buy this again, what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Really helps the process of getting the old gel off... much faster than just acetone.</li>
            <li> Love it! This products is what it promised it would do. I will keep buying this product because it really works!</li>
            <li> This is probably a waste of money. This is simply acetone with fragrance, a little bit of oil for moisture and a touch of alcohol. You can buy these and mix them for pennies.</li>
            <li> One of the bottles was cut and leaked during the shipment.  I received a credit for the damaged bottle.</li>
            <li> I ordered as an experiment to see if this product would work with Sensationails.  It did!  No problems or reactions.</li>
            <li> This product works... it soaked off all the gel polish. However, the bottle was half empty when it arrived. They should find a better way to ship this item because it clearly spilled in the package.</li>
            <li> This product worked much better than what i used to use to take off the gel nails. Good price as well.</li>
            <li> I guess its okay, but I just do not use it. It is not that convenient for me. It&#x27;s forgettable.</li>
            <li> The product is fine but the bottle leaked during shipment.  Bottle was taped around the seal and the tape melted to the bottle.  Really a mess.</li>
