            <li>Love all the ole products</li>

            <li>I LOVE it.</li>

            <li>I really do love this.</li>
            <li>I love this product I&#x27;ve been using it for quite some time now.</li>
            <li>and I believe it has made my skin just generally more youthful.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I have tried Clinique,Kiehls, and many more.</li>
            <li>Love consistency and texture and smell.</li>
            <li>At first I loved this.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and hydrated and I have had psoriasis and acne most of my life, so</li>
            <li>Wish I had paid closer attention to reviews complaining of &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;... turns out to be true!  </li>
            <li>This is a great product that leaves my face smooth, silky, and soft.</li>
            <li>It works in to the skin so easily and allows make-up to be applied evenly.</li>
            <li>I also pair this with the collagen booster, which is pretty darn amazing too.</li>
            <li>having good skin is new to me.</li>
            <li>(you can get them for free).</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li>I still have some will try for light summer coverage.</li>
            <li>Fine cream, nothing special but can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li>It has a unique citrus scent that may not appeal to everyone, but I like it.</li>
            <li>in her opinion this is a very good product, the only thing she didn&#x27;t like its that it is too small, lol.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve been eating very healthy lately and wanting to use more organic products, and most of all, products NOT tested on animals (always look for the bunny).</li>
            <li>Your older self will thank you :)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy, blends into the skin beautifully without feeling heavy on the skin.  </li>
            <li>This product is a bit too greasy for someone like me, who has super oily skin, but I am sure that women who have dry or combination skin will just love it.</li>
            <li>It is also useful to sooth and replenish my skin.</li>
            <li>Worth the $.</li>
            <li>This is such a nice product.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend Ole Henriksen Truth Creme Advanced Hydration ...</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for a month and have noticed my dull skin with a beautiful glow and smoothness.</li>
            <li>Ole Henriksen Truth Creme Advanced Hydration is a wonderful moisturizer, (the jar I already have is almost empty, so I thought I&#x27;d buy a second before it was gone), but what I received was NOT the same product.  </li>
            <li>For a tiny $45 product, it should look very clean and nice, not a sticky black top, cheap, white seller lable accross its front.....</li>
            <li>I am on my third jar and am a huge fan!</li>
            <li>I first used this product when I got a tester at Sephora</li>
            <li>I have almost forgotten how much more red my skin was before I started using this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In Comparison to the Sheer Transformation: this one is a BIT heavier as it leads more towards drier skin.</li>
            <li>The only thing authentic about the product I received was the jar it arrived in.  </li>
            <li>Its different from most hydrating creams.  </li>
            <li>I am nearly seventy years old now and don&#x27;t expect face cream to work miracles , this cream keeps my face feeling lose and comfortable .</li>
            <li>very runny, I  think this is a knock off.</li>
            <li>I use the whole vitamin C productline by Ole Henrickson.</li>
            <li>I was able to compare it directly with the jar I already had; it has a different consistency, color, and smell.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very soft and pretty too.  </li>
            <li>have super sensitive sensitive skin ...</li>
            <li>After countless products, my dermatologist recommended this moisturizer to use on off-days from my prescription retinoid (Atralin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is super citrusy ...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li>Now, in all frankness, it is difficult to know how much of the results are a result of the prescription retinoid or this creme; however, what I can tell you with certainty is that my skin used to be slightly dry as a result of the retinoid and now it is glowing, flawless, and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Its really light in texture, but effectively hydrates my dry skin without needing a thick, gooey cream.  </li>
            <li>and I had no negative reaction to this product whatsoever.</li>
            <li>but it really makes my skin glow w a nice poor texture</li>
            <li>Love the product, buy it somewhere else, this product was not authentic.</li>
            <li>I used to use sisley and this is the only creme that works great for me besides those expensive cremes.</li>
            <li>So, when I began converting all of my beauty products to those that are predominately natural or organic, I had quite a challenge in front of me.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s your word of caution: you need to purchase this via Amazon directly.</li>
            <li>It might be good but really useless to me</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and this entire product line.</li>
            <li>I will go back to purchasing this via a local store and pay a little more to get a product that I can trust.</li>
            <li>The fake moisturizer I received was the consistency of slimy water, with a froth of bubbles on top as though it had been half full of the real stuff, then mixed with water to fill it up to the top.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This creme provides multilevel moisturization in tandem with antiaging benefits, Truth Creme imparts a radiant glow with advanced hydration complex and vitamin C.</li>
            <li>And, even if one uses an excess (like I do at night), it is still clear (not all white and streaky).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results?</li>
            <li>I only started buying it on line because I don&#x27;t like going so far to buy it in the store.</li>
            <li>So, pay that extra and buy directly through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin but lean towards the dry side as I live in Nevada.</li>

            <li> I have combination skin but lean towards the dry side as I live in Nevada.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a long time.</li>
            <li> You only need a little so this bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> This has helped my skin glow, become smoother and less rough, as well as make me look younger!</li>
            <li> I have tried other lotions and as they help the dry parts of my face,  my oily T-zone breaks out.  </li>
            <li> this jar requires that you dip your fingers into it over and over (which can lead to contamination even if you carefully wash your hands before each usage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me, beauty products are an area in which I am not willing to compromise.</li>
            <li> Buying via a third party at Amazon can mean that you are receiving expired (i.e. dumpster-diving) products, improperly cared for products, etc.</li>
            <li> Works well under make up and seems to give my face a slight glow.</li>
            <li> NOT trust these new sellers, they&#x27;re scamming people with fake</li>
            <li> The lid was very sticky, the seller lable was accross the product, leaving an ugly lable or sticky mess.</li>
            <li> Not sure I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Know that this is not an artificial fragrance, this is the aroma of the natural components.</li>
            <li> are the very few drawbacks to this product: 1.)</li>
            <li> It is hard for me to find a product that absorbs well into my skin and this does just that.</li>
            <li> I have always had a hard time with finding moisturizer because one product will be too thick or another will feel too oily on my skin.</li>
            <li> Smells bad like its old.</li>
            <li> the container is small and expensive, and 2.)</li>
            <li> Looks horrible on my mozaic tray with the other ole henriksen products.</li>
            <li> Very sad.</li>
            <li> I continued to use it, but was disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> I am positively crazy for Ole Henriksen!</li>
            <li> FAKE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought it here from Cita Villa Beauty Palor and it was runny and awful.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible, I just can&#x27;t use it because of the smell.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Fine cream, nothing special but can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that leaves my face smooth, silky, and soft. It has a unique citrus scent that may not appeal to everyone, but I like it. This product is a bit too greasy for someone like me, who has super oily skin, but I am sure that women who have dry or combination skin will just love it.</li>
            <li> FAKE!!!!!! Compared it at sephora Also had an expiration date of May 2015</li>
            <li> I only go off of reviews when I purchase anything and since there aren&#x27;t many on here I am making one so people can decide for themselves. I first used this product when I got a tester at Sephora (you can get them for free). I have always had a hard time with finding moisturizer because one product will be too thick or another will feel too oily on my skin. Also, I&#x27;ve been eating very healthy lately and wanting to use more organic products, and most of all, products NOT tested on animals (always look for the bunny). Ole really has created an awesome moisturizer. The best part is that he&#x27;s in his 60&#x27;s and has amazing skin and hasn&#x27;t had any work done before. This smells amazing, and will even out your skin a lot. I have almost forgotten how much more red my skin was before I started using this. Don&#x27;t forget to moisturize your neck and chest as well! Your older self will thank you :)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer of all time!  It feels like silk on your skin and it has a delicious creamsicle smell.  I love all of Ole Henriksen&#x27;s products.  This isn&#x27;t cheap but it&#x27;s oh-so-worth it.  If you use this daily, one jar should last you about 4 months!</li>
            <li> Wish I had paid closer attention to reviews complaining of &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;... turns out to be true!  Won&#x27;t make the same mistake again.</li>
            <li> If you like the scent of citrus and want silky skin, this creme is for you. My skin feels smooth and hydrated and I have had psoriasis and acne most of my life, so having good skin is new to me. I am on my third jar and am a huge fan!</li>
            <li> very runny, I  think this is a knock off.</li>
            <li> This was a great product when I got a sample of it from Sephora. When I ordered it on Amazon however, it smelled rancid, as if it had heat damage. Just returned the item for a refund.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a month and have noticed my dull skin with a beautiful glow and smoothness.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin but lean towards the dry side as I live in Nevada. And I find this moisturizer is the perfect balance between moisturize and not greasy. I have tried other lotions and as they help the dry parts of my face,  my oily T-zone breaks out.  I Feely my skin is more radiant and healthy after using this and I have fully made the switch from using Dermalogica.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Comparison to the Sheer Transformation: this one is a BIT heavier as it leads more towards drier skin. And Sheer Transformation leans towards oiler skin. I did like it too but not enough moisture for NV. I would use the Sheer Trans. on vacation closer to the coast (more humidity).</li>
            <li> This cream is a dream, I love it! It was shipped to me on time</li>
            <li> When I started ordering this product - I REALLY loved it.  The last several orders have arrived rancid smelling.  I don&#x27;t know if its a storage temperature issue or what but I won&#x27;t be ordering this again as the last several times I received the product it just did NOT smell okay.  Very sad. Wish I could count on a consistency in freshness.</li>
            <li> The only thing authentic about the product I received was the jar it arrived in.  Ole Henriksen Truth Creme Advanced Hydration is a wonderful moisturizer, (the jar I already have is almost empty, so I thought I&#x27;d buy a second before it was gone), but what I received was NOT the same product.  I was able to compare it directly with the jar I already had; it has a different consistency, color, and smell.  The fake moisturizer I received was the consistency of slimy water, with a froth of bubbles on top as though it had been half full of the real stuff, then mixed with water to fill it up to the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT trust these new sellers, they&#x27;re scamming people with fake products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Ole Henriksen Truth Creme Advanced Hydration ... but you&#x27;re probably going to have to buy it elsewhere, since who knows what you&#x27;ll actually receive if you order it here.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a long time. It is the best thing I have found for my skin. I am nearly seventy years old now and don&#x27;t expect face cream to work miracles , this cream keeps my face feeling lose and comfortable . I also like the fact that it is not greasy. I only started buying it on line because I don&#x27;t like going so far to buy it in the store. works for me..pagepet</li>
            <li> At first I loved this.  Nice light lotion. But seems to have fizzled out.  Not sure I would buy again. I still have some will try for light summer coverage.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product in a department store and LOVED it. I bought it here from Cita Villa Beauty Palor and it was runny and awful. Love the product, buy it somewhere else, this product was not authentic.</li>
            <li> Love all the ole products</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful silky smooth moisturizer.  I highly recommend it.  It works in to the skin so easily and allows make-up to be applied evenly.</li>
            <li> Product received had separated and was more a liquid than a cream. I had store clerk look at it said product had been affected by heat, but still usable. I continued to use it, but was disappointed in the product. I will go back to purchasing this via a local store and pay a little more to get a product that I can trust.</li>
            <li> A staple in my medicine cabinet. I use it daily.</li>
            <li> The lid was very sticky, the seller lable was accross the product, leaving an ugly lable or sticky mess. Looks horrible on my mozaic tray with the other ole henriksen products. Smells bad like its old. For a tiny $45 product, it should look very clean and nice, not a sticky black top, cheap, white seller lable accross its front.....</li>
            <li> This has helped my skin glow, become smoother and less rough, as well as make me look younger! Highly recommend these products. I also pair this with the collagen booster, which is pretty darn amazing too. Get both!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mom, she asked for it, so I decided to gave it to her, in her opinion this is a very good product, the only thing she didn&#x27;t like its that it is too small, lol. Great shipping, arrived when estimated.</li>
            <li> Not quite as deep hydrating as I had hoped, but it really makes my skin glow w a nice poor texture</li>
            <li> I am loving this moisturizer, as well as the corresponding vitamin C truth serum. It is hard for me to find a product that absorbs well into my skin and this does just that. It has a pure scent and gives my skin a beautiful glow. It is also useful to sooth and replenish my skin. I have yet to find vitamin c products as exceptional as these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This creme provides multilevel moisturization in tandem with antiaging benefits, Truth Creme imparts a radiant glow with advanced hydration complex and vitamin C. I apply evenly to my face and neck in the morning and evening. And,mthe price won&#x27;t break your bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are:&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua/Eau), Glycerin, Squalane, Triheptanoin, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Candelilla/Jojoba/Rice Bran Polyglyceryl-3 Esters, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5, Ceramide 2, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Hydrolyzed Viola Tricolor Extract, Calcium Ascorbate, Rosa Canina Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Saccharum Officinarium (Sugar Cane) Extract, Acer Saccharinum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Soybean Sterols, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Bisabolol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Trehalose, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Vaccinium Myrtillus Extract, Sorbitol, Xanthan Gum, Potato Starch Modified, Sodium Phytate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Parfum/Fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. 04-01-14</li>
            <li> I am positively crazy for Ole Henriksen! For me, beauty products are an area in which I am not willing to compromise. So, when I began converting all of my beauty products to those that are predominately natural or organic, I had quite a challenge in front of me. After countless products, my dermatologist recommended this moisturizer to use on off-days from my prescription retinoid (Atralin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is super citrusy ... I LOVE it. Know that this is not an artificial fragrance, this is the aroma of the natural components. And, the product just melts into one&#x27;s skin. And, even if one uses an excess (like I do at night), it is still clear (not all white and streaky).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results? They are just gorgeous. Now, in all frankness, it is difficult to know how much of the results are a result of the prescription retinoid or this creme; however, what I can tell you with certainty is that my skin used to be slightly dry as a result of the retinoid and now it is glowing, flawless, and hydrated. That&#x27;s enough for me! I am now onto my fourth jar and cannot imagine using a different moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super sensitive sensitive skin ... and I had no negative reaction to this product whatsoever. Now, I cannot speak for you (your sensitivities and allergies may differ from mine), but that is also extraordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the very few drawbacks to this product: 1.) the container is small and expensive, and 2.) this jar requires that you dip your fingers into it over and over (which can lead to contamination even if you carefully wash your hands before each usage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s your word of caution: you need to purchase this via Amazon directly. Buying via a third party at Amazon can mean that you are receiving expired (i.e. dumpster-diving) products, improperly cared for products, etc. This is not Amazon&#x27;s fault since they cannot monitor these independent warehouses. So, pay that extra and buy directly through Amazon. This way you will KNOW that you have the best this product can offer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy, blends into the skin beautifully without feeling heavy on the skin.  You only need a little so this bottle will last a long time.  Worth the $.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  Its different from most hydrating creams.  Its really light in texture, but effectively hydrates my dry skin without needing a thick, gooey cream.  Works well under make up and seems to give my face a slight glow.</li>
            <li> This is such a nice product.  I have tried them all.  Learned about this from QVC.  Did my homework on it and just ordered it.  It works.  My skin feels so much better since using this.  The smell is very soft and pretty too.  Even my husband compliments the smell after I&#x27;ve washed my face and use this cream.  I really do love this.</li>
            <li> I love this product I&#x27;ve been using it for quite some time now. I use the whole vitamin C productline by Ole Henrickson. The wipes, the vitamin C serum, and this cream. I use all of those faithfully once every morning and I believe it has made my skin just generally more youthful. I highly recommend this and this entire product line.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible, I just can&#x27;t use it because of the smell.  It might be good but really useless to me</li>
            <li> I used to use sisley and this is the only creme that works great for me besides those expensive cremes. Love it</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I have ever purchased. I have tried Clinique,Kiehls, and many more. Love consistency and texture and smell. In a nutshell makes you feel great.</li>
