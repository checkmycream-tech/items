            <li>If looking for a product that would result to no more breakout of the skin in future, acne face and body wash is the best.</li>
            <li>Literally smells like chemicals and gave me more pimples from the second wash.</li>
            <li>After using this, I felt pretty again.</li>
            <li>your clear and smooth skin?</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s meant to.  </li>
            <li>Keeping my skin clear of blemishes and improving the quality of my skin is important to me.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>Mild for sensitive skin wash that has improved the texture and blemishes on my skin !</li>
            <li>I just ended up spending huge money on trying various products until I found benzoyl peroxide face wash.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This peroxide wash really does wonders for my acne.</li>
            <li>This acne wash really did a measure for my skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much improvement.</li>
            <li>this really clears my skin fast in just 2days</li>
            <li>I am very statisfied of my purchase</li>
            <li>This really helps with my oily face and neck.  </li>
            <li>once at night.&lt;br /&gt;Worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;The peroxide is an organic compound that is not so much for the antibiotic resistance to acne but dealing with the oil and dirt in your skin directly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of positive reviews but for me in particular it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>I read so many great reviews and thought that it would clear up the acne on my face, ah I was wrong!</li>
            <li>I am excited to finally find a product that really works and has no side effects.</li>
            <li>This product has significantly reduced my back acne.</li>
            <li>I use this on a daily basis because it’s gentle and leaves my skin really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>For about 3 weeks I&#x27;ve been using I cannot live without it !</li>
            <li>love all of the products, really cleans deeply and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>As an adult with occasional acne and concerns about aging skin, I&#x27;m excited about this product.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling soft and clean all day, I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>so everytime i used it i pum0 and lock it all the way just to make sure i dont waste it but still dripping..</li>
            <li>After experiencing Beauty facial extremes products before, I know I would be getting my moneys worth; And that I did.</li>
            <li>Since small changes (working out a lot more) brought acne back into my life, it was good to see a small change got rid of it.</li>
            <li>I new</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Low concentration of benzoyl peroxide is exactly what my sensitive skin needs.</li>
            <li>This product is a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>and wait for a week skin will be clear and so soft.</li>
            <li>And its made with natural ingredients which is safer too.</li>
            <li>Once I found this, my life changed; my acne cleared up and my skin feels soft and looks glamorous.</li>
            <li>Washing my face, shoulders, and back with this acne face and body wash has really helped.</li>
            <li>Many facial products left my skin red, dry and itchy.</li>
            <li>This wash, in conjunction with the Beauty Facial Extreme toner, cleared up my blemishes without causing much dryness, safe to use everyday!  </li>
            <li>and my acne has turned from blackheads everywhere and large cystic zits(yeah, its gross) to just minor pock marks</li>
            <li>I finally  found something that clear my acne up and does not dry my face out .</li>
            <li>Within a couple of applications, my acne marks appeared less harsh and prominent...</li>
            <li>I noticed that due to the nature of my skin, I need something that really is going to go deep into the pores and compel the dirt from the crevices of my skin.</li>
            <li>Not as soapy as I was anticipated after first few uses, but will update again after using it for a while.</li>
            <li>If you use this product religiously and stay on schedule(twice a day) then you will start to see clearer skin and an improved social status by the end of the month.</li>

            <li> Honestly, im obsessed with all the products from Beauty Facial Extreme, but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve been doing a research on Benzoyl Peroxide and its benefits; when I realized its known for clearing blemishes fast, its anti aging properties, and the fact it kills the Acne causing bacteria..</li>
            <li> Even with everyday use it has not dried out my skin, or, created any type of irritation like some products do.</li>
            <li> i never felt that before on any pricey prescriftion drugstores products those makes ur skin dry and patchy  </li>
            <li> This stuff will dry and work the oil out of your face directly.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy</li>
            <li> My mom is going to buy it to get a dry skin like me!</li>
            <li> I have bad acne at certain times and this really helps to keep it under control - rrc</li>
            <li> I use it every other day and it seems to be keeping the pimples at bay.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well when combined with clay mint healing mask and ensures the skin is fully transformed.</li>
            <li> After trying almost every other product on the market, from proactiv to toothpaste and used mint leaves, I tried this</li>
            <li> I despise breakouts, so the fact that this product prevents breakouts is an extreme benefit.</li>
            <li> I hate acne, but fortunately so does this face wash!</li>
            <li> I tend to have oily skin and this wash helped make me less shiny through out the day.</li>
            <li> For a sensitive skin like mine, it is very painful to find the right product.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s little to no foam...</li>
            <li> I was always suffering from quite harsh acne.</li>
            <li> After I started using this product no more dark spots and no acne.</li>
            <li> I Used to have terrible acne, this combined with diligent facial washing and body scrubbing has really helped me to let my skin shine radiantly.</li>
            <li> My blemishes and acne is not good .</li>
            <li> First of all it smells terrible !</li>
            <li> I had a terrible acne problem, but once I combined this with the toner, I started to clear all that up.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s useless!</li>
            <li> I had a bad skin.</li>
            <li> I think it was one of the worst skin ever seen.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product to use.  Throughly cleanses!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Honestly, im obsessed with all the products from Beauty Facial Extreme, but this one is my favorite. I love the presentation because it really helps keep track of how much product I need without wasting any. Now, about the product. Is fantastic. It makes my skin shine and it cleanses my pores. Since the first time i used it i could feel the changes.</li>
            <li> This is sort of the left jab of the 1-2 punch of acne care. I had a terrible acne problem, but once I combined this with the toner, I started to clear all that up. I felt a lot of embarrassment about having acne at my age and with being darker skinned, I wasn&#x27;t sure it would even work for me. This was sort of my last stop before taking it to a dermatologist, so I&#x27;m unbelievably happy it did what it was supposed to do. Since small changes (working out a lot more) brought acne back into my life, it was good to see a small change got rid of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of marvel comics and great marketing so I think I have found a great fit.Its also very easy to use and the results showed up faster then I thought.This is a great addition to my beauty collection.</li>
            <li> This peroxide wash really does wonders for my acne.</li>
            <li> This acne wash really did a measure for my skin. Not only does it fight acne and pimples, but it tones my skin complexion and relieves marks made over time by constant acne. It leaves my face feeling soft and clean all day, I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much improvement. I read a lot of positive reviews but for me in particular it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> For a sensitive skin like mine, it is very painful to find the right product. I just ended up spending huge money on trying various products until I found benzoyl peroxide face wash. This product has helped in sebum clearing and acne treatment. Great product !</li>
            <li> Low concentration of benzoyl peroxide is exactly what my sensitive skin needs. This product delivers!</li>
            <li> I use this with a combination of Estée lauder cleanser and leaves my face flawless</li>
            <li> if someone wants a good fair clean skin then this is probably the best product which you can use. I have really liked it and have used several times. Very good quality and removes acne within a few days, brilliant one. One should definitely buy it. Its worth applying on skin.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash it makes my face very clean and now im acne free. I will be buying more of their products soon.</li>
            <li> Many facial products left my skin red, dry and itchy. Benzoyl Peroxide 5% Wash is different. I use this on a daily basis because it’s gentle and leaves my skin really soft and smooth. If you have stubborn acne like I did, this is the best product to use.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a little pricey but it&#x27;s all worth it! This cleanser works wonders on the face and it works fast! It gets rid of pimples, redness, excess dirt and oil and leaves the skin smooth and refreshed after every use. This wash can be used anywhere on your body and it works without over drying. I think this wash is good for all skin types. I tend to have oily skin and this wash helped make me less shiny through out the day. I will buy again!</li>
            <li> I wanted a body wash that could help me with my back acne.This product has significantly reduced my back acne. The results are above and beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for clearing blemishes caused by acne.</li>
            <li> great product!! ilove this of all i bought for&lt;br /&gt;my acne this really clears my skin fast in just 2days u will notice that acnes are drying up. and wait for a week skin will be clear and so soft. i never felt that before on any pricey prescriftion drugstores products those makes ur skin dry and patchy  but this never!! but have to say that they need to improve the packiging for $40 for this size u wanna use every drops of it ryt? pump still dripping even i pulled up already and i still see drops whenever  i go to bathroom. so everytime i used it i pum0 and lock it all the way just to make sure i dont waste it but still dripping.. i think the pump holds some still after u pump it</li>
            <li> I was always suffering from quite harsh acne. This wash has helped me get rid of it so much! My skin on my face is so much smoother now! I am very statisfied of my purchase (I saw it at the local store) and I definitly recommend this face wash if you are suffering from acne and want to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> This acne wash is really very good product. After I started using this product no more dark spots and no acne. Not only fights against acne, it has given me even skin tone. And its mild also which is good for sensitive skin. And its made with natural ingredients which is safer too. I use it daily. My skin is now soft and charming. I&#x27;m loving my healthy, smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like washing my face with soaps. This is a great, healthy alternative.</li>
            <li> This really helps with my oily face and neck.  I use it every other day and it seems to be keeping the pimples at bay.</li>
            <li> This is a great brand! love all of the products, really cleans deeply and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I have bad acne at certain times and this really helps to keep it under control - rrc</li>
            <li> Totally amazed with the results... Within a couple of applications, my acne marks appeared less harsh and prominent... And the best feature which won over me is the fact that it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin in any way !!</li>
            <li> I have never seen a face wash like this before. I have used many products and therefore I thought that all the face washes are same. But my friend told me to use this. I went and got this one. Simply the best because it removes all the dark circles, pimples and acne from the face. The odor is so dam good. It makes your face glow. I liked the product and am going to buy more. One should try it once.</li>
            <li> Not as soapy as I was anticipated after first few uses, but will update again after using it for a while. Still hoping it will do it&#x27;s intended job!  *Fingers crossed*</li>
            <li> If looking for a product that would result to no more breakout of the skin in future, acne face and body wash is the best. It works extremely well when combined with clay mint healing mask and ensures the skin is fully transformed. It has worked for me and my friends.</li>
            <li> After dealing with skin problems my entire life, I became discouraged when it came to buying products. Once I found this, my life changed; my acne cleared up and my skin feels soft and looks glamorous.</li>
            <li> Within a week I noticed a difference!!</li>
            <li> This product is a huge waste of money. I read so many great reviews and thought that it would clear up the acne on my face, ah I was wrong! First of all it smells terrible ! Literally smells like chemicals and gave me more pimples from the second wash. There&#x27;s little to no foam...it&#x27;s useless! Please, if you are reading this, save your money !!! I gave this product one star because you can&#x27;t give it zero.</li>
            <li> I had a bad skin. I think it was one of the worst skin ever seen. Thanks to this product, my skin is wonderful and I am so happy! I have never had a face like this! My mom is going to buy it to get a dry skin like me! Wow!</li>
            <li> Another great and effective product from Beauty Facial Extreme</li>
            <li> I hate acne, but fortunately so does this face wash! I love this product, it smells delicious and is soft on my face, not to mention it always gets rid of my breakouts and blemishes.</li>
            <li> If you have problem skin like I do, you might find this to be the best product on the market for you! This wash, in conjunction with the Beauty Facial Extreme toner, cleared up my blemishes without causing much dryness, safe to use everyday!  As with any product containing benzoyl peroxide, make sure to moisturize after washing and toning, and be prepared to fall in love with your skin!</li>
            <li> Benzoyl Peroxide unclogged my pores and substantially improved the appearance of my face.  http://www.amazon.com/review/RTLA1FPN952BQ/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B00THPYRZS</li>
            <li> My blemishes and acne is not good . I finally  found something that clear my acne up and does not dry my face out . It&#x27;s has not been 2 weeks and I notice a difference already .</li>
            <li> I recommend everyone who&#x27;s reading this to buy this product. This is an all in one product that cleanses the entire body from dirt and oil then leaves the body smooth and smelling good..</li>
            <li> After using this, I felt pretty again.</li>
            <li> Works ok but be patient.  It took a number of weeks to notice some improvement.</li>
            <li> After trying almost every other product on the market, from proactiv to toothpaste and used mint leaves, I tried this and I&#x27;m on my third week of this and my acne has turned from blackheads everywhere and large cystic zits(yeah, its gross) to just minor pock marks and I can already start to see them disappear. If you use this product religiously and stay on schedule(twice a day) then you will start to see clearer skin and an improved social status by the end of the month.</li>
            <li> I just had a breakout and I immediately knew to slather my face in this stuff two times a day once in the morning and once at night.&lt;br /&gt;Worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;The peroxide is an organic compound that is not so much for the antibiotic resistance to acne but dealing with the oil and dirt in your skin directly.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your face feel so soft and clean and the effectiveness is amazing. This stuff will dry and work the oil out of your face directly.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your clear and smooth skin?</li>
            <li> After experiencing Beauty facial extremes products before, I know I would be getting my moneys worth; And that I did. I noticed that due to the nature of my skin, I need something that really is going to go deep into the pores and compel the dirt from the crevices of my skin. I despise breakouts, so the fact that this product prevents breakouts is an extreme benefit. Lately, I&#x27;ve been doing a research on Benzoyl Peroxide and its benefits; when I realized its known for clearing blemishes fast, its anti aging properties, and the fact it kills the Acne causing bacteria.. I new I needed to get this one! A soft touch is a happy touch!</li>
            <li> I Used to have terrible acne, this combined with diligent facial washing and body scrubbing has really helped me to let my skin shine radiantly. I feel so much better now that I can go outside without feeling self-conscious and insecure about my skin.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s meant to.  Personally I&#x27;m not a fan of benzoyl peroxide I find it too harsh for my skin, but this is super gentle and pleasant.  I will definitely use it again.</li>
            <li> As an adult with occasional acne and concerns about aging skin, I&#x27;m excited about this product.  Keeping my skin clear of blemishes and improving the quality of my skin is important to me.  This is a must have!</li>
            <li> Washing my face, shoulders, and back with this acne face and body wash has really helped. Even with everyday use it has not dried out my skin, or, created any type of irritation like some products do. I am excited to finally find a product that really works and has no side effects.</li>
            <li> This product really works. It helps me with breakouts!! I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Mild for sensitive skin wash that has improved the texture and blemishes on my skin ! For about 3 weeks I&#x27;ve been using I cannot live without it !</li>
