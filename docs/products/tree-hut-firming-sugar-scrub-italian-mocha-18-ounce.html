            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>not as good smell as the brazil nut scrub - also rate of 3 stars is because i did not see any firming anywhere - it does leave your skin smoooooth</li>

            <li>Great smell and consistency, and you get many</li>

            <li>Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>It lingers nicely on the skin.</li>
            <li>, this brand is so good and their scrubs are top notch.</li>
            <li>This has a very strong coffee odor.  </li>
            <li>I smell wonderful and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy it for the firming benefit, I bought it for the scrubbing benefit and it leaves my skin soft and smelling great!</li>
            <li>After 1 use my skin was more soft and supple - it is an awesome exfoliator, and it smells like coffee!</li>
            <li>Funny smell, but works great.</li>
            <li>Buying more.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This was ok.  </li>
            <li>Some may love it.</li>
            <li>I purchased (3) tubs and made sure to use them all before writing my review.</li>
            <li>When I switched to this scrub after reading reviews I thought it would get the job done even better</li>
            <li>It smells really nice, leaves my skin feeling smooth and is Vegan but aside from that no &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; here.</li>
            <li>My skin was so smooth!</li>
            <li>I love Tree Hut products and this product is no exception.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just got a foul odor that I don&#x27;t think most people either could or would tolerate.  </li>
            <li>It smelled ok while using it and</li>
            <li>and I scrubbed all over twice just to make sure all of the product was gone.  </li>
            <li>love this body scrub.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>

            <li>Such a great product!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and smooth, smells great, too!  </li>
            <li>This scrub smells soooooo good, like fragrant, freshly ground coffee beans.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels after I use this scrub.</li>
            <li>Works well and smells like Mocha - what could be better.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t ever what to be without it and what can be better first thing in the morning but the smell of coffee!!!</li>
            <li>Wow, this is a beautiful scrub... delivers soft, smooth skin and an delightful aroma.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice but as a scrub - nothing special.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and leaves my skin super soft without any drying.  </li>
            <li>The scrub itself has a pretty strong coffee smell, but I find it pleasant.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a scrub that wouldn&#x27;t dry out my skin from soap or salt and this one is perfect!</li>
            <li>smells great and exfoliates my skin but as far as &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It smells SO good, and it makes skin SO smooth, and it&#x27;s SO reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, my skin felt smooth after one use.</li>
            <li>This sugar scrub keeps my skin baby soft and in great condition.</li>
            <li>Bought it to try and keep my skin looking good during pregnancy, and it really does the trick.</li>
            <li>I feel my skin very smooth and clean after I use it</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s empty because the scrub is amazing and makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li>Really strong smell of coffee though.</li>
            <li>First of all, it smells amazing, but isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>The particles do not dissolve quickly, and many stick to my skin.</li>
            <li>It smells really good and makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>but it smells great and leaves your skin super soft.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge improvement in just over a month.</li>
            <li>I love to use it on legs and feet to keep them nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really great coarse scrub.  </li>
            <li>Great product, especially for couples in the shower.</li>
            <li>It keeps all my skin looking fresh and lovely.</li>
            <li>and it makes my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>I use it once or twice a week in my entire body and works great.</li>
            <li>Fine quality ingredients, amazing selection, large size for a great price compared to similar products, and the texture was just right.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>My new favorite scrub!</li>
            <li>so excited to have found this.</li>
            <li>My skin is much softer after use, but I would say it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>But still, I wish the details for this product had listed the full ingredients.  </li>
            <li>but it definitely feels good on my body.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I used it in the shower this morning all over, and at first it was fine.  </li>
            <li>But seriously, it smells super great - COFFEEEEEE!!!!</li>
            <li>The scent is fantastic, absolutely mouthwatering and the scrub leaves my skin feeling so smooth.</li>
            <li>I cant stop touching my skin because its just ridiculously smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Scrub isn&#x27;t fine and have a coarse texture which i really love and does the job leaving skin really smooth.</li>
            <li>Tree hut is definitely my new favorite scrub brand.</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd Tree Hut scrub I&#x27;ve tried, and I love it!</li>
            <li>This is the first sugar scrub I&#x27;ve tried &amp; I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>In many instances, ingredients lists are written in descending amount order, so if a product has a large amount of &amp;#34;Ingredient A&amp;#34; and a tiny amount of &amp;#34;Ingredient X&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Ingredient A&amp;#34; will be at the top of the ingredients list while &amp;#34;Ingredient X&amp;#34; will be at the bottom.  </li>
            <li>Really make your skin feel smooth</li>
            <li>This is a great scrub for sloughing off dead skin.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>My teen daughter really likes this product and sometimes can be overzealous during the rubbing stage (since it smells so good)</li>
            <li>The  price is so affordable and the amount of product makes it worth every cent.</li>
            <li>Packaging is nice enough to keep out.</li>
            <li>For less than $10 you can enjoy a spa time at home love it!</li>
            <li>If interested in this product, please check out this link first for the full list of ingredients:  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now the sugar is a great exfoliator and so gentle with your skin, you can feel the all those dead cells gone</li>
            <li>Hello smooth soft skin!</li>
            <li>smells nice but very dry and  cakes up</li>
            <li>I purchased the Almond Sugar Scrub from this company about 2 months ago  and was so  pleased that I decided to try a different flavor.</li>
            <li>If you are an individual who enjoys scented fragrances then you will fall in love with the mocha scent.</li>
            <li>the first ingredient is Sucrose</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy a citrus fragrance next time :)</li>
            <li>The firming scrub works wonders on my skin firming and making it feel baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I opened up my scrub for the first time yesterday to take a bath.</li>
            <li>Makes skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably a good exfoliant and isn&#x27;t too harsh on my skin</li>
            <li>Product does smell good, however doesn&#x27;t firm, hasn&#x27;t done anything but smotoh my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The skin on my right upper arm is almost completely smooth and bump-free.</li>
            <li>My left arm has improved greatly as well, but I figure it will take a bit more time to work since it was in worse shape.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling so smooth and soft, really enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>Finally, it has diminished the appearance of cellulite in my body very quickly.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have to buy every single one to see which is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It smells great in the jar, but I just used it and for some reason when I actually started to rub it on it developed this strange odor, sort of a musty smell.</li>
            <li>Wow, it&#x27;s exactly a mocha frappuccino smell!</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really notice any firming..</li>
            <li>I really like the scrub itself.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Works very well, would have given 5 stars, but the smell can be overpowering</li>
            <li>I have used this scrub twice and my skin feels so much smoother.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m done with it, I absolutely will not buy it again.</li>
            <li>and I really feel this helps.</li>
            <li>The smell is absolutely intoxicating...</li>
            <li>giving this product two stars for the following reason:  I have sensitive skin and allergies to many things, including the ingredient &amp;#34;Fragrance&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other scents from them and like them better.</li>
            <li>I just found this at Walmart for $6 bucks, along with the Body Lotion in the same scent - also rich and luxurious skin soothing -</li>
            <li>I would love to try other things from this brand.</li>
            <li>but I was willing to risk that in hopes that at least the scrub factor would be nice and I could then just return it for another scent</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;After the first use the scrub made my skin so soft-baby skin soft.</li>
            <li>The wide mouth jar makes it easy to scoop up what you need.  </li>
            <li>The older</li>
            <li>This scrub definitely does the job, sincw the very first time it gives u a very soft skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and exfoliates very well.</li>
            <li>I have had keratosis pilaris on my upper arms for most of my life which gets better for a while then gets worse.</li>
            <li>Not so sure about the firming claims, but it certainly keeps skin smooth &amp;, unless you have some serious dry skin issues, you may not even need lotion after using it.</li>
            <li>I try to shower every other day in the winter and this stuff is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I use it every day, let me very soft skin.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Not sure if it works on firming the skin but my favorite scent and consistency of all the Tree Hut Sugar Scrubs.</li>
            <li>, it makes my skin incredibly soft!</li>
            <li>The result is better than the very expensive brands and the sugar is better for sensitive skin than salt scrubs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different products and while some helped reduce the appearance of the bumps a little, nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li>Did leave my skin soft.</li>
            <li>action going on from this scrub that I&#x27;ve been using for two weeks now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Advertisement -3&lt;br /&gt;Smell &amp; Soft Skin</li>
            <li>Now, I found this product when I searched for &amp;#34;all natural sugar scrubs&amp;#34; here and checked the details of the product to see the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I had to use my shower pouf with soap meant for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Granted, I should have searched for the product online to find a complete ingredients list for the scrub, so</li>
            <li>Its too early to say that it has been firming my skin</li>
            <li>Leaves skin really soft</li>
            <li>but it totaly works to get a soft skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty gritty not rough on the skin</li>
            <li>, many uses for a small price!</li>
            <li>The details apparently only list the main ingredients of the product instead of listing all of them, and nowhere in the details was the ingredient &amp;#34;Fragrance&amp;#34; listed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;ONLY way to get my money back or a new product is to send in the old one...</li>
            <li>Smells AMAZING, works nicely as a body scrub in general, but it leaves an unpleasant sting on the skin - not sure what ingredient it is that has that effect.  </li>
            <li>The scrub is very thick and the smell is so good-almost like you are drinking coffee while showering :)</li>
            <li>So, based on that general knowledge I decided to try out the product anyway and hope I wouldn&#x27;t have a reaction.  </li>
            <li>but when i use it on my face it burns not real bad but bad enough to where i&#x27;ll rinse it off with cool water quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m nearly finished with my second tub and will buy a third.</li>
            <li>Thick enough so it is easy to work with and liquid enough</li>
            <li>I like the scrub itself, it leaves my skin feeling so soft and doesn&#x27;t dry it out, BUT the smell is horrendous.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> And the scent is great.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping it and using it because, as I said, the scrub itself is great.  </li>
            <li> and I have had great results.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  </li>
            <li> A great purchase.</li>
            <li> Smells great</li>
            <li> I use this ones a week, it is great by itself</li>
            <li> Very nice scrub with a great coffee scent.</li>
            <li> I love it!!  </li>
            <li> Makes skin smooth!!!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and works like a charm !</li>
            <li> but thankfully it was amazing in every way!</li>
            <li> Also this scent is really nice smells like Starbucks!</li>
            <li> Better than any cellulite cream I&#x27;ve ever tried (awesome plus).</li>
            <li> Still liked it!</li>
            <li> so I love this product even more for it&#x27;s smell!!!</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant aroma of coffee.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell of coffee brewing in the morning.</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> This scrub smells good, but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate that well.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin (redhead) and over the years of being in the sun, have done some damage to my skin.</li>
            <li> I was telling my friend about how much I loved it</li>
            <li> nice smell, great softness</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> not as good smell as the brazil nut scrub - also rate of 3 stars is because i did not see any firming anywhere - it does leave your skin smoooooth</li>
            <li> Love it and it smells so good!</li>
            <li> Great smell and consistency, and you get many</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells and feels great on skin.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve found this, I&#x27;ll never use Body Scrub scrubs again because this is so much better bang-for-your-buck!</li>
            <li> Love this scrub!  </li>

            <li> This scrub is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This smells so amazing</li>
            <li> Kind of smelled like a cigar to me..</li>
            <li> so I was kind of expecting it</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> It lingers nicely on the skin.</li>
            <li> , this brand is so good and their scrubs are top notch.</li>
            <li> This has a very strong coffee odor.  </li>
            <li> I smell wonderful and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it for the firming benefit, I bought it for the scrubbing benefit and it leaves my skin soft and smelling great!</li>
            <li> After 1 use my skin was more soft and supple - it is an awesome exfoliator, and it smells like coffee!</li>
            <li> Funny smell, but works great.</li>
            <li> Buying more.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This was ok.  </li>
            <li> Some may love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased (3) tubs and made sure to use them all before writing my review.</li>
            <li> When I switched to this scrub after reading reviews I thought it would get the job done even better</li>
            <li> It smells really nice, leaves my skin feeling smooth and is Vegan but aside from that no &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; here.</li>
            <li> My skin was so smooth!</li>
            <li> I love Tree Hut products and this product is no exception.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just got a foul odor that I don&#x27;t think most people either could or would tolerate.  </li>
            <li> It smelled ok while using it and</li>
            <li> and I scrubbed all over twice just to make sure all of the product was gone.  </li>
            <li> love this body scrub.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The smell just like coffee.. Makes me wanna eat it :)</li>
            <li> Such a great product!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft and smooth, smells great, too!  </li>
            <li> This scrub smells soooooo good, like fragrant, freshly ground coffee beans.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after I use this scrub.</li>
            <li> Works well and smells like Mocha - what could be better.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever what to be without it and what can be better first thing in the morning but the smell of coffee!!!</li>
            <li> Wow, this is a beautiful scrub... delivers soft, smooth skin and an delightful aroma.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice but as a scrub - nothing special.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and leaves my skin super soft without any drying.  </li>
            <li> The scrub itself has a pretty strong coffee smell, but I find it pleasant.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a scrub that wouldn&#x27;t dry out my skin from soap or salt and this one is perfect!</li>
            <li> smells great and exfoliates my skin but as far as &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It smells SO good, and it makes skin SO smooth, and it&#x27;s SO reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, my skin felt smooth after one use.</li>
            <li> This sugar scrub keeps my skin baby soft and in great condition.</li>
            <li> Bought it to try and keep my skin looking good during pregnancy, and it really does the trick.</li>
            <li> I feel my skin very smooth and clean after I use it</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s empty because the scrub is amazing and makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li> Really strong smell of coffee though.</li>
            <li> First of all, it smells amazing, but isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> The particles do not dissolve quickly, and many stick to my skin.</li>
            <li> It smells really good and makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> but it smells great and leaves your skin super soft.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge improvement in just over a month.</li>
            <li> I love to use it on legs and feet to keep them nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really great coarse scrub.  </li>
            <li> Great product, especially for couples in the shower.</li>
            <li> It keeps all my skin looking fresh and lovely.</li>
            <li> and it makes my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> I use it once or twice a week in my entire body and works great.</li>
            <li> Fine quality ingredients, amazing selection, large size for a great price compared to similar products, and the texture was just right.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> My new favorite scrub!</li>
            <li> so excited to have found this.</li>
            <li> My skin is much softer after use, but I would say it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> But still, I wish the details for this product had listed the full ingredients.  </li>
            <li> but it definitely feels good on my body.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used it in the shower this morning all over, and at first it was fine.  </li>
            <li> But seriously, it smells super great - COFFEEEEEE!!!!</li>
            <li> The scent is fantastic, absolutely mouthwatering and the scrub leaves my skin feeling so smooth.</li>
            <li> I cant stop touching my skin because its just ridiculously smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Scrub isn&#x27;t fine and have a coarse texture which i really love and does the job leaving skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> Tree hut is definitely my new favorite scrub brand.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd Tree Hut scrub I&#x27;ve tried, and I love it!</li>
            <li> This is the first sugar scrub I&#x27;ve tried &amp; I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> In many instances, ingredients lists are written in descending amount order, so if a product has a large amount of &amp;#34;Ingredient A&amp;#34; and a tiny amount of &amp;#34;Ingredient X&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Ingredient A&amp;#34; will be at the top of the ingredients list while &amp;#34;Ingredient X&amp;#34; will be at the bottom.  </li>
            <li> Really make your skin feel smooth</li>
            <li> This is a great scrub for sloughing off dead skin.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> My teen daughter really likes this product and sometimes can be overzealous during the rubbing stage (since it smells so good)</li>
            <li> The  price is so affordable and the amount of product makes it worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Packaging is nice enough to keep out.</li>
            <li> For less than $10 you can enjoy a spa time at home love it!</li>
            <li> If interested in this product, please check out this link first for the full list of ingredients:  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now the sugar is a great exfoliator and so gentle with your skin, you can feel the all those dead cells gone</li>
            <li> Hello smooth soft skin!</li>
            <li> smells nice but very dry and  cakes up</li>
            <li> I purchased the Almond Sugar Scrub from this company about 2 months ago  and was so  pleased that I decided to try a different flavor.</li>
            <li> If you are an individual who enjoys scented fragrances then you will fall in love with the mocha scent.</li>
            <li> the first ingredient is Sucrose</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy a citrus fragrance next time :)</li>
            <li> The firming scrub works wonders on my skin firming and making it feel baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I opened up my scrub for the first time yesterday to take a bath.</li>
            <li> Makes skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably a good exfoliant and isn&#x27;t too harsh on my skin</li>
            <li> Product does smell good, however doesn&#x27;t firm, hasn&#x27;t done anything but smotoh my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The skin on my right upper arm is almost completely smooth and bump-free.</li>
            <li> My left arm has improved greatly as well, but I figure it will take a bit more time to work since it was in worse shape.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling so smooth and soft, really enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> Finally, it has diminished the appearance of cellulite in my body very quickly.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have to buy every single one to see which is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It smells great in the jar, but I just used it and for some reason when I actually started to rub it on it developed this strange odor, sort of a musty smell.</li>
            <li> Wow, it&#x27;s exactly a mocha frappuccino smell!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really notice any firming..</li>
            <li> I really like the scrub itself.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Works very well, would have given 5 stars, but the smell can be overpowering</li>
            <li> I have used this scrub twice and my skin feels so much smoother.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m done with it, I absolutely will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> and I really feel this helps.</li>
            <li> The smell is absolutely intoxicating...</li>
            <li> giving this product two stars for the following reason:  I have sensitive skin and allergies to many things, including the ingredient &amp;#34;Fragrance&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other scents from them and like them better.</li>
            <li> I just found this at Walmart for $6 bucks, along with the Body Lotion in the same scent - also rich and luxurious skin soothing -</li>
            <li> I would love to try other things from this brand.</li>
            <li> but I was willing to risk that in hopes that at least the scrub factor would be nice and I could then just return it for another scent</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;After the first use the scrub made my skin so soft-baby skin soft.</li>
            <li> The wide mouth jar makes it easy to scoop up what you need.  </li>
            <li> The older</li>
            <li> This scrub definitely does the job, sincw the very first time it gives u a very soft skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and exfoliates very well.</li>
            <li> I have had keratosis pilaris on my upper arms for most of my life which gets better for a while then gets worse.</li>
            <li> Not so sure about the firming claims, but it certainly keeps skin smooth &amp;, unless you have some serious dry skin issues, you may not even need lotion after using it.</li>
            <li> I try to shower every other day in the winter and this stuff is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I use it every day, let me very soft skin.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works on firming the skin but my favorite scent and consistency of all the Tree Hut Sugar Scrubs.</li>
            <li> , it makes my skin incredibly soft!</li>
            <li> The result is better than the very expensive brands and the sugar is better for sensitive skin than salt scrubs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different products and while some helped reduce the appearance of the bumps a little, nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li> Did leave my skin soft.</li>
            <li> action going on from this scrub that I&#x27;ve been using for two weeks now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Advertisement -3&lt;br /&gt;Smell &amp; Soft Skin</li>
            <li> Now, I found this product when I searched for &amp;#34;all natural sugar scrubs&amp;#34; here and checked the details of the product to see the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I had to use my shower pouf with soap meant for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Granted, I should have searched for the product online to find a complete ingredients list for the scrub, so</li>
            <li> Its too early to say that it has been firming my skin</li>
            <li> Leaves skin really soft</li>
            <li> but it totaly works to get a soft skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty gritty not rough on the skin</li>
            <li> , many uses for a small price!</li>
            <li> The details apparently only list the main ingredients of the product instead of listing all of them, and nowhere in the details was the ingredient &amp;#34;Fragrance&amp;#34; listed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;ONLY way to get my money back or a new product is to send in the old one...</li>
            <li> Smells AMAZING, works nicely as a body scrub in general, but it leaves an unpleasant sting on the skin - not sure what ingredient it is that has that effect.  </li>
            <li> The scrub is very thick and the smell is so good-almost like you are drinking coffee while showering :)</li>
            <li> So, based on that general knowledge I decided to try out the product anyway and hope I wouldn&#x27;t have a reaction.  </li>
            <li> but when i use it on my face it burns not real bad but bad enough to where i&#x27;ll rinse it off with cool water quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nearly finished with my second tub and will buy a third.</li>
            <li> Thick enough so it is easy to work with and liquid enough</li>
            <li> I like the scrub itself, it leaves my skin feeling so soft and doesn&#x27;t dry it out, BUT the smell is horrendous.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure it did much for firming.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works to firm anything yet, but I like it so far.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I thought the coffee one was going to have a strong, gross, artificial coffee scent</li>
            <li> Gets my skin soft and smoorh without irritating my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use my scrubs on dry skin then rinse off and use a moisturizing wash followed by a body oil.</li>
            <li> Previously I had purchased the L&#x27;Oreal Paris 360 Scrub and actually saw my stomach firming.</li>
            <li> I only wish the scent lingered on my skin a little longer.</li>
            <li> I must warn you that these jar do not come with a plastic seal so be careful when removing the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t it actually makes your skin firm</li>
            <li> I get the harder</li>
            <li> Works wonders on rough hands and feet.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates all the dead skin and moisturizes at the same time.</li>
            <li> From the other room, with the door closed to the bathroom of course</li>
            <li> but I still like it for the other reasons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it actually does anything, but I like using it in the shower a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> No where to msg the seller, like on other products ive bought on here...</li>
            <li> i won&#x27;t be purchasing it again due to the burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the other scrubs before and this has never happened..</li>
            <li> but I ad a little coconut oil since me skin is dry</li>
            <li> Smells like coffee a little lumpy and difficult to apply right out of the jar.</li>
            <li> it spilt out and the half the tube ran out onto other products I had</li>
            <li> I will never go back to the more expensive scrub brands ever!!!!</li>
            <li> It exfoliated well, however, the grainy particles that exfoliate leave a mess in the tub.</li>
            <li> I put a little in my hand and rubbed the palms of my hands together then applied to my face..</li>
            <li> Smells a little like dirt and haven&#x27;t noticed my skin looking or feeling firmer.</li>
            <li> It will take a little longer to evaluate the firming value.  </li>
            <li> I was trying to firm my post baby tummy, and purchased this scrub and the lotion as well to hope to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Totally a waste of money and time and stress....</li>
            <li> will update in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> As any other coffee addict, the fact that this scrub will help firming and toning my body was secondary.</li>
            <li> i ws sent sha butter instead of crub, too difficult to send back.  </li>
            <li> I like it because it the exfoliating granules are not so small.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not exactly my favorite thing to wake up to.</li>
            <li> not sure if its one or not</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that it work with the cellulite</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t let my husband use it because the smell on him would get me sick (nor would he use it), and I&#x27;ve wasted money on it essentially.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s getting two stars for doing the job it&#x27;s supposed to, but no more than that because it made me sick and wasn&#x27;t properly advertised.</li>
            <li> My skin was not happy and I felt like I had road rash on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, throughout the day I could still smell the scrub on my skin and became increasingly nauseated.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am an espresso obsessed &amp;#34;coffee snob&amp;#34; but this doesn&#x27;t smell like espresso, it smells like a sugary coffee drink.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product does not work for &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; as it is stated.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I just wasn&#x27;t crazy about the coffee smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crazy about Coffee Mocha</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that bad.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m stuck with a product I cannot use without getting sick</li>
            <li> the smell transforms into something patently terrible.  </li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

            <li> i ws sent sha butter instead of crub, too difficult to send back.  please sent out a complementary scrub</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works to firm anything yet, but I like it so far. Really strong smell of coffee though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful and smell very good I feel my skin very smooth and clean after I use it</li>
            <li> Very nice scrub and smells really good!</li>
            <li> smells great and exfoliates my skin but as far as &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; my skin I did not see where it did that but I still like it for the other reasons.</li>
            <li> Really make your skin feel smooth</li>
            <li> Yummy scent and excellent exfoliater.</li>
            <li> Wow! This is the 2nd Tree Hut scrub I&#x27;ve tried, and I love it! It smells SO good, and it makes skin SO smooth, and it&#x27;s SO reasonably priced! Now that I&#x27;ve found this, I&#x27;ll never use Body Scrub scrubs again because this is so much better bang-for-your-buck! Thank you for selling this great product!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Almond Sugar Scrub from this company about 2 months ago  and was so  pleased that I decided to try a different flavor. If you are an individual who enjoys scented fragrances then you will fall in love with the mocha scent. I must warn you that these jar do not come with a plastic seal so be careful when removing the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS the first ingredient is Sucrose</li>
            <li> Very nice scrub with a great coffee scent.</li>
            <li> Loved it. It exfoliates and moisturize at the same time. Definitely worth it. Buying more.</li>
            <li> Awesome, I feel good after using it.</li>
            <li> My teen daughter really likes this product and sometimes can be overzealous during the rubbing stage (since it smells so good)</li>
            <li> I have had keratosis pilaris on my upper arms for most of my life which gets better for a while then gets worse. I&#x27;ve tried many different products and while some helped reduce the appearance of the bumps a little, nothing compares to this. I use it about twice a week while showering and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge improvement in just over a month. The skin on my right upper arm is almost completely smooth and bump-free. My left arm has improved greatly as well, but I figure it will take a bit more time to work since it was in worse shape. Keratosis pilaris can be tricky to manage and you have to keep trying different products until you find something that helps, but if you haven&#x27;t tried this yet, I recommend it. The scrub itself has a pretty strong coffee smell, but I find it pleasant. It is rather coarse though, so I would not use this scrub daily to avoid any irritation.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works great.</li>
            <li> its a great scrub. I don&#x27;t it actually makes your skin firm but it smells great and leaves your skin super soft.</li>
            <li> Very good scrub! I use it every day, let me very soft skin. It has a pleasant aroma of coffee. I like it because it the exfoliating granules are not so small.</li>
            <li> Skin feels amazing after this scrub. It&#x27;s pretty gritty not rough on the skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nearly finished with my second tub and will buy a third. Smells wonderful and leaves skin soft and smooth. Doesn&#x27;t do anything for &amp;#34;firming,&amp;#34; but I didn&#x27;t expect it to.</li>
            <li> Love it and it smells so good! Leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Eh. This was ok.  Kind of smelled like a cigar to me.. didn&#x27;t really notice any firming.. but I wasn&#x27;t expecting to.  Did leave my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I really like the scrub itself. I&#x27;ve tried other scents from them and like them better. The Coconut Lime and Shea Sugar Scrub are amazing. I just wasn&#x27;t crazy about the coffee smell. I knooooow. I should have known it&#x27;d smell like coffee but it&#x27;s like BAM in your face coffee. But I&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s empty because the scrub is amazing and makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li> Really good exfoliant!!! You definitely feel that helps your skin to feel tighter and smoother. I&#x27;m crazy about Coffee Mocha so I love this product even more for it&#x27;s smell!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; action going on from this scrub that I&#x27;ve been using for two weeks now. It does smell delicious and has a good softening effect on my skin, though. I just wouldn&#x27;t claim any of the firming effects. Didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, my skin felt smooth after one use. Haven&#x27;t noticed firming yet...</li>
            <li> Smells nice but as a scrub - nothing special.</li>
            <li> This has a very strong coffee odor.  Some may love it. I find it overpowering.</li>
            <li> I am on my 4th tub of srubs from Tree Hut. Scrub isn&#x27;t fine and have a coarse texture which i really love and does the job leaving skin really smooth. As for the firming, i don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin though. Still its a good scrub! Gave 4stars cos it didnt gave me firming effects.</li>
            <li> Wow, it&#x27;s exactly a mocha frappuccino smell! I read the reviews so I was kind of expecting it but it&#x27;s not exactly my favorite thing to wake up to. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am an espresso obsessed &amp;#34;coffee snob&amp;#34; but this doesn&#x27;t smell like espresso, it smells like a sugary coffee drink. But I like it enough to use it up. I&#x27;ll buy a citrus fragrance next time :)</li>
            <li> Great smell and consistency, and you get many, many uses for a small price! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Works very well, would have given 5 stars, but the smell can be overpowering</li>
            <li> Will buy it again and again</li>
            <li> As any other coffee addict, the fact that this scrub will help firming and toning my body was secondary. The scent is scrumptious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the sugar is a great exfoliator and so gentle with your skin, you can feel the all those dead cells gone and yet it&#x27;s quite moisturizing, Tree Hut Sugar Scrub Italian Mocha delivers quality and self-indulgence. The  price is so affordable and the amount of product makes it worth every cent. Used to think I would be a Tropical Mango Girl Forever, but even y husband finds the Mocha smell delicious. For less than $10 you can enjoy a spa time at home love it!</li>
            <li> This scrub smells good, but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate that well. The particles do not dissolve quickly, and many stick to my skin. My skin is much softer after use, but I would say it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product does not work for &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; as it is stated. I purchased (3) tubs and made sure to use them all before writing my review. I was trying to firm my post baby tummy, and purchased this scrub and the lotion as well to hope to get the job done. Previously I had purchased the L&#x27;Oreal Paris 360 Scrub and actually saw my stomach firming. When I switched to this scrub after reading reviews I thought it would get the job done even better but it did not. It smells really nice, leaves my skin feeling smooth and is Vegan but aside from that no &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; here. I decided not to purchase this item again nor the cream, I went back to using L&#x27;Oreal Paris 360 Scrub and Palmer&#x27;s firming lotion instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advertisement -3&lt;br /&gt;Smell &amp; Soft Skin +1&lt;br /&gt;Vegan +1</li>
            <li> Smells like coffee a little lumpy and difficult to apply right out of the jar. I put a little in my hand and rubbed the palms of my hands together then applied to my face..great stuff! i rubbed it in a circular motion and let it rest on my face for about a minute or two and rinsed. My skin was so smooth! The older I get the harder it seems to be to get that &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;. This did it! I love Tree Hut products and this product is no exception. I will be using this on my elbows and knees as well..so excited to have found this.</li>
            <li> I recently stayed at a hotel in Vegas and used their bath products by Gilchrist and Soames. My skin was not happy and I felt like I had road rash on my arms and legs. I have used this scrub twice and my skin feels so much smoother. And the scent is great. It smells like wonderful coffee while in the shower, but it does not linger on the skin.</li>
            <li> I smell wonderful and my skin is so soft. Gave the 2nd one as a gift she loves it too.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! The firming scrub works wonders on my skin firming and making it feel baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Smells a little like dirt and haven&#x27;t noticed my skin looking or feeling firmer. Great exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on rough hands and feet. Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for exfoliating.would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Funny smell, but works great.</li>
            <li> Smells great! I&#x27;m not sure if it actually does anything, but I like using it in the shower a couple times a week. It&#x27;s probably a good exfoliant and isn&#x27;t too harsh on my skin</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and works like a charm ! Best friend if you self tan !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really great coarse scrub.  It smells amazing inside the jar.  However, when you take it out of the jar and spread it onto your body... the smell transforms into something patently terrible.  My BF swears it smells like vomit.  It&#x27;s that bad.  I&#x27;m keeping it and using it because, as I said, the scrub itself is great.  It&#x27;s just got a foul odor that I don&#x27;t think most people either could or would tolerate.  When I&#x27;m done with it, I absolutely will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this scrub!  Smells fantastic!!</li>
            <li> Product does smell good, however doesn&#x27;t firm, hasn&#x27;t done anything but smotoh my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Product was shipped with it spilt out and the half the tube ran out onto other products I had bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONLY way to get my money back or a new product is to send in the old one...&lt;br /&gt;Don;t feel I should spend my money and time to send it back.&lt;br /&gt;I have photos to prove it... No where to msg the seller, like on other products ive bought on here...</li>
            <li> (Christina Sauser):  If interested in this product, please check out this link first for the full list of ingredients:  http://www.treehutshea.com/product/sugar-body-scrub-firming-italian-mocha/.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this product two stars for the following reason:  I have sensitive skin and allergies to many things, including the ingredient &amp;#34;Fragrance&amp;#34;.  Now, I found this product when I searched for &amp;#34;all natural sugar scrubs&amp;#34; here and checked the details of the product to see the ingredients.  The details apparently only list the main ingredients of the product instead of listing all of them, and nowhere in the details was the ingredient &amp;#34;Fragrance&amp;#34; listed.  However upon receipt of the product, when I checked the label, there it was towards the end of the ingredients list.  In many instances, ingredients lists are written in descending amount order, so if a product has a large amount of &amp;#34;Ingredient A&amp;#34; and a tiny amount of &amp;#34;Ingredient X&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Ingredient A&amp;#34; will be at the top of the ingredients list while &amp;#34;Ingredient X&amp;#34; will be at the bottom.  So, based on that general knowledge I decided to try out the product anyway and hope I wouldn&#x27;t have a reaction.  I used it in the shower this morning all over, and at first it was fine.  It smelled ok while using it and the sugar/essential oils combo worked well to exfoliate my skin without drying it out.  I thankfully did not have any topical reactions (like hives, or itching, or bumps, etc...) to the scrub.  HOWEVER, throughout the day I could still smell the scrub on my skin and became increasingly nauseated.  I eventually had to take a second shower to get rid of the smell so I would stop feeling like I needed to puke.  I had to use my shower pouf with soap meant for sensitive skin and I scrubbed all over twice just to make sure all of the product was gone.  Granted, I should have searched for the product online to find a complete ingredients list for the scrub, so shame on me for not doing that.  But still, I wish the details for this product had listed the full ingredients.  Now I&#x27;m stuck with a product I cannot use without getting sick, I can&#x27;t let my husband use it because the smell on him would get me sick (nor would he use it), and I&#x27;ve wasted money on it essentially.  I don&#x27;t want to throw this away and obviously can&#x27;t return it, so I&#x27;ll find someone else to take it, but still...Totally a waste of money and time and stress....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s getting two stars for doing the job it&#x27;s supposed to, but no more than that because it made me sick and wasn&#x27;t properly advertised.</li>
            <li> i bought this item cause i needed a facial scrub.  not sure if its one or not but when i use it on my face it burns not real bad but bad enough to where i&#x27;ll rinse it off with cool water quickly.  it doesn&#x27;t leave my face red from the burn but it&#x27;s uncomfortable.  it does have a mocha smell which i like.  i won&#x27;t be purchasing it again due to the burn.</li>
            <li> smells nice but very dry and  cakes up</li>
            <li> This is the second jar that I have gotten and I have had great results. I have fair skin (redhead) and over the years of being in the sun, have done some damage to my skin. This sugar scrub keeps my skin baby soft and in great condition. Don&#x27;t ever what to be without it and what can be better first thing in the morning but the smell of coffee!!!</li>
            <li> This product is great.  It smells wonderful and leaves my skin super soft without any drying.  It lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li> Great product, especially for couples in the shower.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is a beautiful scrub... delivers soft, smooth skin and an delightful aroma.  It&#x27;s like a spa dessert for your skin!  I just found this at Walmart for $6 bucks, along with the Body Lotion in the same scent - also rich and luxurious skin soothing - so while they carry it, I&#x27;ll probably get it there to save myself 40% on every jar.</li>
            <li> I try to shower every other day in the winter and this stuff is fabulous. I am over 45 and I need all the firming I can get and I really feel this helps. It exfoliates all the dead skin and moisturizes at the same time. So no lotion step! Love it!</li>
            <li> love this body scrub.  It left my skin feeling so smooth and soft, really enjoy using it. Will recommend.</li>
            <li> love this!!!!!!!!! I will never go back to the more expensive scrub brands ever!!!! Tree hut is definitely my new favorite scrub brand.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and works .. very happy with this product</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and exfoliates very well. I prefer a citrus scent, but that&#x27;s just my preference</li>
            <li> I love this scrub! I was telling my friend about how much I loved it and she had just recently purchased it as well and loves it too! It keeps all my skin looking fresh and lovely. Also this scent is really nice smells like Starbucks!</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time. Gets my skin soft and smoorh without irritating my very sensitive skin. A great purchase.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the first sugar scrub I&#x27;ve tried &amp; I was not disappointed.  Not so sure about the firming claims, but it certainly keeps skin smooth &amp;, unless you have some serious dry skin issues, you may not even need lotion after using it.</li>
            <li> Love it. Smells great</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!! First of all, it smells amazing, but isn&#x27;t overpowering. Second, my skin felt smoother and tighter after just a couple of uses. Finally, it has diminished the appearance of cellulite in my body very quickly. Better than any cellulite cream I&#x27;ve ever tried (awesome plus).</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells and feels great on skin. My new favorite scrub!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for two weeks now and have used it about 6 times. The scrub is very thick and the smell is so good-almost like you are drinking coffee while showering :)&lt;br /&gt;After the first use the scrub made my skin so soft-baby skin soft. Its too early to say that it has been firming my skin but it definitely feels good on my body.&lt;br /&gt;I will update in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I love it!!  The smell just like coffee.. Makes me wanna eat it :)</li>
            <li> Smells so yummy and it makes my skin so smooth. I use my scrubs on dry skin then rinse off and use a moisturizing wash followed by a body oil. Hello smooth soft skin!</li>
            <li> Smells AMAZING, works nicely as a body scrub in general, but it leaves an unpleasant sting on the skin - not sure what ingredient it is that has that effect.  But seriously, it smells super great - COFFEEEEEE!!!!</li>
            <li> I opened up my scrub for the first time yesterday to take a bath. From the other room, with the door closed to the bathroom of course, I heard my boyfriend say &amp;#34;g******, what are you doing in there?!&amp;#34; He could smell it from the bathroom and in the kitchen where he was cooking. No complaints, though. The scent is fantastic, absolutely mouthwatering and the scrub leaves my skin feeling so smooth. I only wish the scent lingered on my skin a little longer. Just remember, if you grab this scrub for yourself, the coffee grounds do not dissolve! You&#x27;ll have to rinse the tub when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> Loved everything!! Awesome smell!!!</li>
            <li> This caused my skin to break out in a rash.  I threw it away.</li>
            <li> Such a great product! It smells really good and makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works on firming the skin but my favorite scent and consistency of all the Tree Hut Sugar Scrubs.</li>
            <li> I like the scrub itself, it leaves my skin feeling so soft and doesn&#x27;t dry it out, BUT the smell is horrendous. It smells great in the jar, but I just used it and for some reason when I actually started to rub it on it developed this strange odor, sort of a musty smell. Horrible. I tried to wash it off and I still smell it!! I&#x27;ve used the other scrubs before and this has never happened..</li>
            <li> This is a really good product!  It makes my skin so soft and smooth, smells great, too!  It will take a little longer to evaluate the firming value.  At this point I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> love this stuff during summer and winter months! Makes skin smooth!!!</li>
            <li> This scrub is AMAZING. Bought it to try and keep my skin looking good during pregnancy, and it really does the trick. After 1 use my skin was more soft and supple - it is an awesome exfoliator, and it smells like coffee! I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> This scrub smells soooooo good, like fragrant, freshly ground coffee beans.  It lingers nicely on the skin. It exfoliated well, however, the grainy particles that exfoliate leave a mess in the tub.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! The smell is absolutely intoxicating... I love to use it on legs and feet to keep them nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted! I was looking for a scrub that wouldn&#x27;t dry out my skin from soap or salt and this one is perfect! Being a coffee lover, the smell is great to wake up to!</li>
            <li> This is a great scrub for sloughing off dead skin.  I don&#x27;t think it does anything for &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34;.  If it did I didn&#x27;t see any difference.  I didn&#x27;t buy it for the firming benefit, I bought it for the scrubbing benefit and it leaves my skin soft and smelling great!</li>
            <li> OMG I want to try ALLLLLLLLLLLLLL of them! I wish they had a set with smaller sizes so I didn&#x27;t have to buy every single one to see which is my favorite. I thought the coffee one was going to have a strong, gross, artificial coffee scent but I was willing to risk that in hopes that at least the scrub factor would be nice and I could then just return it for another scent but thankfully it was amazing in every way! Fine quality ingredients, amazing selection, large size for a great price compared to similar products, and the texture was just right. Thick enough so it is easy to work with and liquid enough so it doesn&#x27;t all fall and crumble to the bathtub floor before I get a chance to rub it in. Pleasant smell of coffee brewing in the morning. Not overpowering. Not too abrasive. Packaging is nice enough to keep out. I would love to try other things from this brand. They won themselves a devoted customer with this stuff.</li>
            <li> nice smell, great softness</li>
            <li> Smells like mocha! Leaves skin really soft but I&#x27;m not sure it did much for firming. Still liked it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My skin feels revitalized after using it.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after I use this scrub. I cant stop touching my skin because its just ridiculously smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious, but chunks do not dissolve.</li>
            <li> Works well and smells like Mocha - what could be better.  Makes skin smooth and soft.  Would use again.</li>
            <li> Improvements were seen in the firmness and texture of my skin...It also smells great! If you like the coffee scent.  Will definitely re purchase.</li>
            <li> OMG! This smells so amazing, this brand is so good and their scrubs are top notch. The result is better than the very expensive brands and the sugar is better for sensitive skin than salt scrubs. I use this ones a week, it is great by itself but I ad a little coconut oil since me skin is dry, it makes my skin incredibly soft!</li>
            <li> a luxurious thing to do once a week to keep your skin exfoliated and polished.  The wide mouth jar makes it easy to scoop up what you need.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I loved it!!! This scrub definitely does the job, sincw the very first time it gives u a very soft skin. I use it once or twice a week in my entire body and works great. I&#x27;m not sure that it work with the cellulite but it totaly works to get a soft skin. I will definitely get it again.</li>
            <li> not as good smell as the brazil nut scrub - also rate of 3 stars is because i did not see any firming anywhere - it does leave your skin smoooooth</li>
