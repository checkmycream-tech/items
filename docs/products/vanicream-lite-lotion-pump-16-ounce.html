            <li>I had been using the original Vanicream Moisturizing Skin Cream and loved it, but I wanted to try the lite version for daytime use.</li>

            <li>This same brand makes an awesome moisturizing skin cream.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this product and I am SO glad that I listened to her.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews, I bought Vanicream and Vanicream Lite Lotion.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found it - now lets hope they will not stop making it.</li>
            <li>so his eczema is treated more.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have allergies to many lotions and the ingredients they use in them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfumed like most women</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for all skin types, especially sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>so guess it is ok</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li>This product is light and still proves to be a great moisturizer for the skin.</li>
            <li>I love the fact it has a pump.</li>
            <li>All are great products and I am really grateful for the lack of perfumes, masking fragrances, and unneeded botanical ingredients that could cause allergies.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE ONLINE VS RETAIL STORE.</li>
            <li>MANY PRODUCTS HAVE IN THEM.</li>
            <li>This cream is light and moisturizing!  </li>
            <li>I love the pump because I can share it with my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>most importantly IT WORKS!  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product because my skin is like velvet after use.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This was recommended for my atopic dermatitis which never got better when applying 2x a day as recommended.</li>
            <li>Nice light cream.</li>
            <li>This is making me type more words to submit it</li>
            <li>i absolutely love all vanicream products.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this cream.  </li>
            <li>It is lighter than the regular Vanicream, so it was perfect for the summer.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is non-greasy.</li>
            <li>I had no idea where to begin to find a replacement because so many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; products either contain DMDM or almond oil, which I am also allergic to.</li>
            <li>I love the way this lite lotion makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>The top and pump broke off and lotion was on everything.  </li>
            <li>I just love all the Vanicream products.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice smooth feel on your skin, not at all greasy.</li>
            <li>The price was much better than I could find elsewhere.</li>
            <li>The Vanicream lite lotion literally saved my skin after  changing  products so many times.</li>
            <li>I love about this product</li>
            <li>and I love those products also.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite lite lotion.</li>
            <li>These products are the best, but this skin lotion continued to make my face itch and turn red.  </li>
            <li>I love the products</li>
            <li>I feel refreshed without feeling greasy and love that I don&#x27;t have any allergic reactions to the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice, light.</li>
            <li>but I use the thicker cream for my legs because shaving them dries them out more.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for sensitive skin and it has no smell, which is good.</li>
            <li>Really a great product and got fast delivery</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad that amazon carries it.  </li>
            <li>One good thing is that i used to not be able to put lotion on my skin right out of the shower without having a reaction.</li>
            <li>This is the first lotion I have consistently loved that stands up to the elements but</li>
            <li>My skin looks 10 years younger and the difference is just amazing!!</li>
            <li>perfect for combination or dry skin.</li>
            <li>The shipping is fast!&lt;br /&gt;The product is safe and sound:)</li>
            <li>Small win but so happy.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>It really is light and non-greasy, much better than anything labeled &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; at the store.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin, helps with controlling/healing eczema.</li>
            <li>great lotion my husband has used on his sensitive skin for 4 years.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Most important, no headaches or burning eyes.  </li>
            <li>Cetaphil is quite good, but still leaves too much greasy residue.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and good price.</li>
            <li>Very nice lotion for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great, light product for those of us that have sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This &#x27;light lotion&#x27; feels more like the sample of the heavier cream sample I received than the light lotion.</li>
            <li>The lotion is not oily or greasy at all and spreads easily.</li>
            <li>Product is now fine and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is light, not greasy, and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>Rather than drive all over town burning up many dollars of gas, I came to Amazon &amp; found it quickly.</li>
            <li>This was recommended by my dermatologist for me as I have mild rosacea &amp; wasn&#x27;t finding anything that I was satisfied with.  </li>
            <li>Quick to absorb and moisturizes well!  </li>
            <li>Simple, effective, affordable and SAFE!</li>
            <li>What a huge help.</li>
            <li>On the great big plus side, it does not irritate my face, it does not clog the pores, it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>like it is free of dyes, fragrance free, and free of toxins.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth under my make up and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores</li>
            <li>This lotion is free of dyes, lanolin, fragrance, parabens and formaldehyde.  </li>
            <li>It feels so light and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have to use a lot of it (more than the non-lite version of this) to keep my skin moist, but with this, my skin rarely gets irritated.</li>
            <li>I keep feeling my arms in disbelief at how smooth they feel now.  </li>
            <li>This is equally smooth and works fabulously.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light lotion with  no scent, and does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>Fragrance free, light in texture.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist gave me samples of this light lotion, the cream and the ointment.</li>
            <li>ITEM WAS SUGGESTED BY MY DERMATOLOGIST FOR A LIGHT MOISTURIZER.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who likes non-fragrant light moisturizers.</li>
            <li>goes on smooth. &#x27;lite&#x27; as labeled.</li>
            <li>I had heard fantastic things about it and it was recommended by my father&#x27;s dermatologist</li>
            <li>It truly is fragrance free -</li>
            <li>Keeps her skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Vanicreme is NOT CRUELTY FREE.</li>
            <li>Cruelty free means they do not test on animals.</li>
            <li>skin has improved greatly in the texture, softness, redness reduction, moisturization, and overall comfort of my skin.</li>
            <li>It is not as light as the samples I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>The only lotion I can use for my super-sensitive skin, works great on the face too.</li>
            <li>This lotion feels so light</li>
            <li>Really good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast absorbing formula makes it great for picky children or anyone who needs to get dressed and out the door quickly.</li>
            <li>I am really so excited at how well it works</li>
            <li>Vanicream Lite Lotion has saved me from the debacle caused by Nutraderm Original Lotion having been taken off the market.</li>
            <li>I originally got it for my father who had just finished radiation and was having adverse reactions on his skin with burns and rashes.</li>
            <li>Once we started using Vanicream, we noticed a significant improvement in his eczema.  </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for something to soothe and protect irritated and cracked skin, stick to the original Vanicream.</li>
            <li>I even use it to clean any leftover mascara from around my eyes after my morning shower.</li>
            <li>This soaks right in without a greasy residue!</li>
            <li>It gives great moisture to my skin, even in the super dry winter months!  </li>
            <li>What a hassle it would be to have to unscrew the top and remove the whole stem to access the cream every time.</li>
            <li>It rubs in nicely and I apply it frequently to combat scaly, peeling skin on my hands.  </li>
            <li>But be sure that lotion, whether it be for arms, face, legs, or whatever...is a very personalized thing.</li>
            <li>Good for skin conditions such as psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is better for me to use under my makeup than the cream since the cream is much thicker.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have to use often if want full affect.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good about Vanicream.  </li>
            <li>its perfect for dry sensitive skin (i put it on my face and its not greasy).</li>
            <li>My boyfriend&#x27;s mild eczema has improved using this as well.  </li>
            <li>It might be that the lotion is more fluid or that the straw is longer than most.  </li>
            <li>product arrived quickly and was as described</li>
            <li>Vanicream lotion absorbs quickly without leaving any residue or shine.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>Thankfully, Amazon had it and could deliver quickly.  </li>
            <li>Very fast delivery!</li>
            <li>This is good lotion for those who are sensitive, and I like the pump - it&#x27;s also a much better deal than getting the smaller non-pump bottle.  </li>
            <li>Provides good level of moisturizing for someone with dry skin; recommended by my dermatologist and it works well.  </li>
            <li>Lotion is very good, but my skin is extremely dry and it does not fill the bill completely.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion for my reactive, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I tried everything available, before finally I asked a pharmacist if there was anything that would work better.</li>
            <li>I liked it enough to order this.</li>
            <li>it leaves more of a natural effect</li>
            <li>totally worth it.</li>
            <li>This is, by far, my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>The price is great, the feel is good for the first few minutes, and then for my own skin, no good.  </li>
            <li>AND the price is right.  </li>
            <li>only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a version with SPF 15 (or higher) and that would be spectacular.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and makes my skin feel very soft and the acne has disappeared.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive, dry skin.  </li>
            <li>The original Vanicream keeps my skin moisturized all day long, and as a result, my body does not produce more oil because the skin is already protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and protects the skin very well.  </li>
            <li>I find the Vanicream leaves a very soft, smooth feeling to my skin.  </li>
            <li>Feel nice on my very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I was a big fan of Pacquin Plus with Aloe and since it&#x27;s not available any more, I was searching for a good replacement.</li>
            <li>the only lotion that has been able to do that for me.  </li>
            <li>Have used this lotion for years in a smaller squeeze bottle and liked it, but have never been able to get the pump on this bottle to release despite carefully turning the spigot part while holding the lower part still, for literally hundreds of turns counterclockwise.</li>
            <li>I have tried SO MANY products and this is the ONLY moisturizer I have found that does not break me out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve struggled with eczema for many years, until finally I found this.</li>
            <li>So much so that people are asking me if I am using Botox!</li>
            <li>Years ago, I paid $7.50 for my first 8oz bottle</li>
            <li>Since the first application, I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using the LITE edition</li>
            <li>very absorbent!</li>
            <li>This was first recommended to me by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>Overall, pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li>this is expensive, but the best moisturizer in the market</li>
            <li>No irritation, no scent, skin very hydrated but not oily!</li>
            <li>I have eczema and this really helped to calm my skin.  </li>
            <li>the top will not open</li>
            <li>Good moisture without being heavy.</li>
            <li>Not greasy but just light enough to absorb into the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>She raved about the scope of the company&#x27;s products and their effectiveness, and I&#x27;ve come to agree with her positive assessment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fantastic lotion, will definitely buy more in the future!</li>
            <li>Light and scent is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>I had to throw out pretty much every hair product, moisturizer, soap, etc.</li>
            <li>Our son has had eczema pretty much since he came home from the hospital (and that was 2.5 years ago).  </li>
            <li>I used to bring back multiple bottles of lotion whenever I was in Europe for work, because I liked the texture so much more than American lotion.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say that Vanicream cured my rash because I fid change my eating habits since lots of allergies and autoimmune disorders run in my family, but since that time my skin is super sensitive to anything with chemicals, phalates, parabens, etc.</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would be less concentarted and also easy to apply than the original one.</li>
            <li>But for sensitive, acne-prone skin and/or eczematous skin like mine, I would highly recommend the original Vanicream.</li>
            <li>I ended up taking the remainder of the product to use at home because I figured it should be fine on regular skin.</li>
            <li>Great for anyone who has dry skin and does not like the weight and heaviness of some of the other moisturizer products on the market.</li>
            <li>It is not irritating, and is not scented.  </li>
            <li>I would really prefer for a working pump to be shipped to me</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It really helps to control and heal my eczema flare ups.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Really Fragrance-Free and it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also have the cream and prefer it for really hydrating my face.  </li>
            <li>Vanicream is a very product.</li>
            <li>and it is not helping too much with it,</li>
            <li>The pump works really well, all the way to the bottom.</li>
            <li>Plus really does keep skin moisturized</li>
            <li>It has really helped her skin.</li>
            <li>Love the lotion but when delivery the top was broken so had to put the lotion in another bottle</li>
            <li>The best buy for Vanicream, at my local store they only have small bottles.</li>
            <li>I have used other moisturizing lotions and this works much better than the mass market &amp;#34;off the shelf&amp;#34; products carried by grocers and pharmacies.</li>
            <li>which is more than I can say for other \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Vanicream to me, is much better than Cetaphil, Cerave because it has no parades or other ingredients to upset the skin.</li>
            <li>particularly like the Lite Lotion for its soothing and gentle hydration.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive facial skin that tends to turn bright red from contact with nearly anything, even water.  </li>
            <li>I used this cream and light lotion for a long time.</li>
            <li>I have used  this product in the past and use it in warm weather.</li>
            <li>I have tried several lotions for keeping my skin look healthy especially  in the winter.  </li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;lite,&amp;#34; the pump doesn&#x27;t clog and I can coax the last smidgen out of the bottle by heating it quickly in the microwave and pouring it into my hands or another container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i believe that in part thanks to vanicream my skin looks very young like teens/</li>
            <li>Nice lotion, goes right in, non irritating</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended by dermo at Mayo clinic for my husband and anyone else with skin issues and dont want all the junk added to it</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li>As someone who&#x27;s had a skin reaction to every moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried - from drugstore to high end - vanicream has been a life saver.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend to all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m highly allergic to everything.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Vanicream lite lotion.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>husband also likes this Lite Lotion a little more than the cream because it is lighter</li>
            <li>I have real sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t help it at all.</li>
            <li>For those who don&#x27;t know, DMDM is a preservative found in a ton of products, including that hand soap in pretty much every public restroom.</li>
            <li>This lite version has a gel-like consistency which would work well for people who have oily skin (not acne-prone) or normal skin.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy when you apply it to your skin.  </li>
            <li>Most I&#x27;ve tried have been so heavy and gooey, I would not use them&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and more fluid, like european lotions, which makes it feel less waxy and sticky when you put it on your body.  </li>
            <li>The lotion isn&#x27;t extremely moisturizing, but sometimes you just want something light to put on.  </li>
            <li>price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is great, but I&#x27;ve noticed sometimes the pump can be a bit difficult to twist open the first time.  </li>
            <li>Vanicream was recommended to me by my dermatologist in New York.  </li>
            <li>After a while my clothes, sheets, and brand new bath towels started getting orange streaks and bleach spots on them.</li>
            <li>Had to call manufacturer for new pump.  </li>
            <li>I have also found lighter products that evaporate quickly and leave my face dry within minutes.</li>
            <li>Actual lotion is great but poor packaging can ruin a product.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and develop rash and skin irritations on my arms and face with almost every lotion I use.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to fragrances and I appreciate that there is no scent.</li>
            <li>If I learned this lotion cured cancer, I wouldn&#x27;t even be surprised!</li>
            <li>For anyone with sensitive skin, this product is for you!</li>
            <li>the only skin care i can use due to sensitive skin...had to buy this Lite Lotion for the summer as the Lite Cream feels heavy, but works great in the winter season...</li>
            <li>His skin looks like a little one&#x27;s should - clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>early twenties</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive, combination acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>Buy the same product from myotcstore.com or walgreens.com for MUCH less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This lotion has made my skin look and feel soft and &#x27;repaired&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>(it reacts to nearly anything with chemicals in it).  </li>
            <li>So Far I&#x27;ve Tried</li>
            <li>If you were looking for a lotion for sensitive skin, this is the brand.  </li>
            <li>My dermotologist recommended Vanicream for my sensitive skin and and adult acne.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE SKIN AND HAVE NOT HAD ANY ISSUES SINCE USING IT.</li>
            <li>Just holds natural moisture in.  </li>
            <li>This lotion goes on smoothly and  does not feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since I found I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances and formaldehyde.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and severe allergy to fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m highly sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>My skin is so so soft now.</li>
            <li>you have roscea, excema, or sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My daughter has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s sensitive on lotions that give her sting.  </li>
            <li>The lite version seemed to evaporate like water leaving my skin irritated with an oily sheen by early afternoon.</li>
            <li>My skin is oily and sensitive.  </li>
            <li>It keeps face soft and moistened without feeling sticky or gooey.</li>
            <li>We use this on twins who are one years old.</li>
            <li>Vanicream Lite works well for sensitive skin and can use it on my face.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a problem for me because I&#x27;m old and my skin is pretty dry.</li>
            <li>This makes my hands feel &#x27;normal&#x27; - not dry or greasy.</li>
            <li>It looks young and healthy all the time, no more itchy red blots!</li>
            <li>I really want to try this cream, however my bottle had a blue pump, not white as pictured.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok - was looking for something for my face similar to complex 15</li>
            <li>I will only use the thick vanicream in a pump that one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I usually use the original pump of vanicream with no issues.</li>
            <li>In the absence of Nutraderm Lotion, I will stick with this product line which I can at least live with comfortably.</li>
            <li>My efforts to reinstall the nozzle was unsuccessful, since there was only a small slot to fit it, but no locking mechanism.  </li>
            <li>and this is the only cream that works for my face so far.  </li>
            <li>Definitely recommend for those with sensitive, acne prone, ruddy skin.  </li>
            <li>I have severe allergies and sensitive Irish skin.</li>
            <li>Naturally, I was told to keep my face moisturized (which I do, but I wanted to see if they had any recommendations to replace my current moisturizer).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve discovered that Vanicream isn&#x27;t widely carried in stores, so finding it on Amazon--at a reasonable price--is a bonus.</li>
            <li>you have normal skin and are looking for a basic moisturizer, definitely give this lotion a try.</li>
            <li>It kind of has a weird smell though</li>
            <li>Due to allergies I have to use certain things</li>
            <li>It treats your dry  areas gently, with no singing or burning, even on cracked open places.</li>
            <li>I recommend this one for normal to slightly dry skin</li>
            <li>At the first sign of any dryness or scratchiness/itchiness due to some irritation, I apply VaniCream and it provides instant relief.</li>
            <li>Much preferred over any other product we have tried.</li>
            <li>Have very sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive,  dry skin that is prone to redness.  </li>
            <li>Great lotion to combat the dry skin that develops over the cold dry winter.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin, and I have to put lotion on my hands multiple times a day.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to find a lighter lotion that isn&#x27;t a prescription, and you are able to use it on little ones.  </li>
            <li>I find it very useful in the areas that can become exceedingly dry - such as around the sides of the nose which, at least on me, needs the extra protection.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t imagine if it bleaches fabric that bad that it&#x27;s good for my skin.</li>

            <li> I am glad I found it - now lets hope they will not stop making it.</li>
            <li> so his eczema is treated more.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I have allergies to many lotions and the ingredients they use in them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfumed like most women</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for all skin types, especially sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> so guess it is ok</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li> This product is light and still proves to be a great moisturizer for the skin.</li>
            <li> I love the fact it has a pump.</li>
            <li> All are great products and I am really grateful for the lack of perfumes, masking fragrances, and unneeded botanical ingredients that could cause allergies.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE ONLINE VS RETAIL STORE.</li>
            <li> MANY PRODUCTS HAVE IN THEM.</li>
            <li> This cream is light and moisturizing!  </li>
            <li> I love the pump because I can share it with my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> most importantly IT WORKS!  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product because my skin is like velvet after use.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> This was recommended for my atopic dermatitis which never got better when applying 2x a day as recommended.</li>
            <li> Nice light cream.</li>
            <li> This is making me type more words to submit it</li>
            <li> i absolutely love all vanicream products.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream.  </li>
            <li> It is lighter than the regular Vanicream, so it was perfect for the summer.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I had no idea where to begin to find a replacement because so many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; products either contain DMDM or almond oil, which I am also allergic to.</li>
            <li> I love the way this lite lotion makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> The top and pump broke off and lotion was on everything.  </li>
            <li> I just love all the Vanicream products.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice smooth feel on your skin, not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> The price was much better than I could find elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The Vanicream lite lotion literally saved my skin after  changing  products so many times.</li>
            <li> I love about this product</li>
            <li> and I love those products also.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorite lite lotion.</li>
            <li> These products are the best, but this skin lotion continued to make my face itch and turn red.  </li>
            <li> I love the products</li>
            <li> I feel refreshed without feeling greasy and love that I don&#x27;t have any allergic reactions to the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice, light.</li>
            <li> but I use the thicker cream for my legs because shaving them dries them out more.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for sensitive skin and it has no smell, which is good.</li>
            <li> Really a great product and got fast delivery</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad that amazon carries it.  </li>
            <li> One good thing is that i used to not be able to put lotion on my skin right out of the shower without having a reaction.</li>
            <li> This is the first lotion I have consistently loved that stands up to the elements but</li>
            <li> My skin looks 10 years younger and the difference is just amazing!!</li>
            <li> perfect for combination or dry skin.</li>
            <li> The shipping is fast!&lt;br /&gt;The product is safe and sound:)</li>
            <li> Small win but so happy.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> It really is light and non-greasy, much better than anything labeled &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; at the store.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin, helps with controlling/healing eczema.</li>
            <li> great lotion my husband has used on his sensitive skin for 4 years.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Most important, no headaches or burning eyes.  </li>
            <li> Cetaphil is quite good, but still leaves too much greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good price.</li>
            <li> Very nice lotion for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great, light product for those of us that have sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This &#x27;light lotion&#x27; feels more like the sample of the heavier cream sample I received than the light lotion.</li>
            <li> The lotion is not oily or greasy at all and spreads easily.</li>
            <li> Product is now fine and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is light, not greasy, and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> Rather than drive all over town burning up many dollars of gas, I came to Amazon &amp; found it quickly.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist for me as I have mild rosacea &amp; wasn&#x27;t finding anything that I was satisfied with.  </li>
            <li> Quick to absorb and moisturizes well!  </li>
            <li> Simple, effective, affordable and SAFE!</li>
            <li> What a huge help.</li>
            <li> On the great big plus side, it does not irritate my face, it does not clog the pores, it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> like it is free of dyes, fragrance free, and free of toxins.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth under my make up and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores</li>
            <li> This lotion is free of dyes, lanolin, fragrance, parabens and formaldehyde.  </li>
            <li> It feels so light and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have to use a lot of it (more than the non-lite version of this) to keep my skin moist, but with this, my skin rarely gets irritated.</li>
            <li> I keep feeling my arms in disbelief at how smooth they feel now.  </li>
            <li> This is equally smooth and works fabulously.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light lotion with  no scent, and does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> Fragrance free, light in texture.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist gave me samples of this light lotion, the cream and the ointment.</li>
            <li> ITEM WAS SUGGESTED BY MY DERMATOLOGIST FOR A LIGHT MOISTURIZER.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who likes non-fragrant light moisturizers.</li>
            <li> goes on smooth. &#x27;lite&#x27; as labeled.</li>
            <li> I had heard fantastic things about it and it was recommended by my father&#x27;s dermatologist</li>
            <li> It truly is fragrance free -</li>
            <li> Keeps her skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Vanicreme is NOT CRUELTY FREE.</li>
            <li> Cruelty free means they do not test on animals.</li>
            <li> skin has improved greatly in the texture, softness, redness reduction, moisturization, and overall comfort of my skin.</li>
            <li> It is not as light as the samples I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> The only lotion I can use for my super-sensitive skin, works great on the face too.</li>
            <li> This lotion feels so light</li>
            <li> Really good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast absorbing formula makes it great for picky children or anyone who needs to get dressed and out the door quickly.</li>
            <li> I am really so excited at how well it works</li>
            <li> Vanicream Lite Lotion has saved me from the debacle caused by Nutraderm Original Lotion having been taken off the market.</li>
            <li> I originally got it for my father who had just finished radiation and was having adverse reactions on his skin with burns and rashes.</li>
            <li> Once we started using Vanicream, we noticed a significant improvement in his eczema.  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for something to soothe and protect irritated and cracked skin, stick to the original Vanicream.</li>
            <li> I even use it to clean any leftover mascara from around my eyes after my morning shower.</li>
            <li> This soaks right in without a greasy residue!</li>
            <li> It gives great moisture to my skin, even in the super dry winter months!  </li>
            <li> What a hassle it would be to have to unscrew the top and remove the whole stem to access the cream every time.</li>
            <li> It rubs in nicely and I apply it frequently to combat scaly, peeling skin on my hands.  </li>
            <li> But be sure that lotion, whether it be for arms, face, legs, or whatever...is a very personalized thing.</li>
            <li> Good for skin conditions such as psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is better for me to use under my makeup than the cream since the cream is much thicker.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have to use often if want full affect.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good about Vanicream.  </li>
            <li> its perfect for dry sensitive skin (i put it on my face and its not greasy).</li>
            <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s mild eczema has improved using this as well.  </li>
            <li> It might be that the lotion is more fluid or that the straw is longer than most.  </li>
            <li> product arrived quickly and was as described</li>
            <li> Vanicream lotion absorbs quickly without leaving any residue or shine.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> Thankfully, Amazon had it and could deliver quickly.  </li>
            <li> Very fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This is good lotion for those who are sensitive, and I like the pump - it&#x27;s also a much better deal than getting the smaller non-pump bottle.  </li>
            <li> Provides good level of moisturizing for someone with dry skin; recommended by my dermatologist and it works well.  </li>
            <li> Lotion is very good, but my skin is extremely dry and it does not fill the bill completely.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion for my reactive, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I tried everything available, before finally I asked a pharmacist if there was anything that would work better.</li>
            <li> I liked it enough to order this.</li>
            <li> it leaves more of a natural effect</li>
            <li> totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> The price is great, the feel is good for the first few minutes, and then for my own skin, no good.  </li>
            <li> AND the price is right.  </li>
            <li> only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a version with SPF 15 (or higher) and that would be spectacular.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and makes my skin feel very soft and the acne has disappeared.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive, dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The original Vanicream keeps my skin moisturized all day long, and as a result, my body does not produce more oil because the skin is already protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and protects the skin very well.  </li>
            <li> I find the Vanicream leaves a very soft, smooth feeling to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Feel nice on my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was a big fan of Pacquin Plus with Aloe and since it&#x27;s not available any more, I was searching for a good replacement.</li>
            <li> the only lotion that has been able to do that for me.  </li>
            <li> Have used this lotion for years in a smaller squeeze bottle and liked it, but have never been able to get the pump on this bottle to release despite carefully turning the spigot part while holding the lower part still, for literally hundreds of turns counterclockwise.</li>
            <li> I have tried SO MANY products and this is the ONLY moisturizer I have found that does not break me out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve struggled with eczema for many years, until finally I found this.</li>
            <li> So much so that people are asking me if I am using Botox!</li>
            <li> Years ago, I paid $7.50 for my first 8oz bottle</li>
            <li> Since the first application, I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using the LITE edition</li>
            <li> very absorbent!</li>
            <li> This was first recommended to me by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> Overall, pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> this is expensive, but the best moisturizer in the market</li>
            <li> No irritation, no scent, skin very hydrated but not oily!</li>
            <li> I have eczema and this really helped to calm my skin.  </li>
            <li> the top will not open</li>
            <li> Good moisture without being heavy.</li>
            <li> Not greasy but just light enough to absorb into the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> She raved about the scope of the company&#x27;s products and their effectiveness, and I&#x27;ve come to agree with her positive assessment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Fantastic lotion, will definitely buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> Light and scent is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I had to throw out pretty much every hair product, moisturizer, soap, etc.</li>
            <li> Our son has had eczema pretty much since he came home from the hospital (and that was 2.5 years ago).  </li>
            <li> I used to bring back multiple bottles of lotion whenever I was in Europe for work, because I liked the texture so much more than American lotion.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say that Vanicream cured my rash because I fid change my eating habits since lots of allergies and autoimmune disorders run in my family, but since that time my skin is super sensitive to anything with chemicals, phalates, parabens, etc.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be less concentarted and also easy to apply than the original one.</li>
            <li> But for sensitive, acne-prone skin and/or eczematous skin like mine, I would highly recommend the original Vanicream.</li>
            <li> I ended up taking the remainder of the product to use at home because I figured it should be fine on regular skin.</li>
            <li> Great for anyone who has dry skin and does not like the weight and heaviness of some of the other moisturizer products on the market.</li>
            <li> It is not irritating, and is not scented.  </li>
            <li> I would really prefer for a working pump to be shipped to me</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It really helps to control and heal my eczema flare ups.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Really Fragrance-Free and it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have the cream and prefer it for really hydrating my face.  </li>
            <li> Vanicream is a very product.</li>
            <li> and it is not helping too much with it,</li>
            <li> The pump works really well, all the way to the bottom.</li>
            <li> Plus really does keep skin moisturized</li>
            <li> It has really helped her skin.</li>
            <li> Love the lotion but when delivery the top was broken so had to put the lotion in another bottle</li>
            <li> The best buy for Vanicream, at my local store they only have small bottles.</li>
            <li> I have used other moisturizing lotions and this works much better than the mass market &amp;#34;off the shelf&amp;#34; products carried by grocers and pharmacies.</li>
            <li> which is more than I can say for other \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Vanicream to me, is much better than Cetaphil, Cerave because it has no parades or other ingredients to upset the skin.</li>
            <li> particularly like the Lite Lotion for its soothing and gentle hydration.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive facial skin that tends to turn bright red from contact with nearly anything, even water.  </li>
            <li> I used this cream and light lotion for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have used  this product in the past and use it in warm weather.</li>
            <li> I have tried several lotions for keeping my skin look healthy especially  in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;lite,&amp;#34; the pump doesn&#x27;t clog and I can coax the last smidgen out of the bottle by heating it quickly in the microwave and pouring it into my hands or another container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i believe that in part thanks to vanicream my skin looks very young like teens/</li>
            <li> Nice lotion, goes right in, non irritating</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended by dermo at Mayo clinic for my husband and anyone else with skin issues and dont want all the junk added to it</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> As someone who&#x27;s had a skin reaction to every moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried - from drugstore to high end - vanicream has been a life saver.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend to all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly allergic to everything.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Vanicream lite lotion.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> husband also likes this Lite Lotion a little more than the cream because it is lighter</li>
            <li> I have real sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t help it at all.</li>
            <li> For those who don&#x27;t know, DMDM is a preservative found in a ton of products, including that hand soap in pretty much every public restroom.</li>
            <li> This lite version has a gel-like consistency which would work well for people who have oily skin (not acne-prone) or normal skin.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy when you apply it to your skin.  </li>
            <li> Most I&#x27;ve tried have been so heavy and gooey, I would not use them&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and more fluid, like european lotions, which makes it feel less waxy and sticky when you put it on your body.  </li>
            <li> The lotion isn&#x27;t extremely moisturizing, but sometimes you just want something light to put on.  </li>
            <li> price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is great, but I&#x27;ve noticed sometimes the pump can be a bit difficult to twist open the first time.  </li>
            <li> Vanicream was recommended to me by my dermatologist in New York.  </li>
            <li> After a while my clothes, sheets, and brand new bath towels started getting orange streaks and bleach spots on them.</li>
            <li> Had to call manufacturer for new pump.  </li>
            <li> I have also found lighter products that evaporate quickly and leave my face dry within minutes.</li>
            <li> Actual lotion is great but poor packaging can ruin a product.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and develop rash and skin irritations on my arms and face with almost every lotion I use.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to fragrances and I appreciate that there is no scent.</li>
            <li> If I learned this lotion cured cancer, I wouldn&#x27;t even be surprised!</li>
            <li> For anyone with sensitive skin, this product is for you!</li>
            <li> the only skin care i can use due to sensitive skin...had to buy this Lite Lotion for the summer as the Lite Cream feels heavy, but works great in the winter season...</li>
            <li> His skin looks like a little one&#x27;s should - clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> early twenties</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive, combination acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> Buy the same product from myotcstore.com or walgreens.com for MUCH less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lotion has made my skin look and feel soft and &#x27;repaired&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> (it reacts to nearly anything with chemicals in it).  </li>
            <li> So Far I&#x27;ve Tried</li>
            <li> If you were looking for a lotion for sensitive skin, this is the brand.  </li>
            <li> My dermotologist recommended Vanicream for my sensitive skin and and adult acne.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE SKIN AND HAVE NOT HAD ANY ISSUES SINCE USING IT.</li>
            <li> Just holds natural moisture in.  </li>
            <li> This lotion goes on smoothly and  does not feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I found I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances and formaldehyde.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and severe allergy to fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> My skin is so so soft now.</li>
            <li> you have roscea, excema, or sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My daughter has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s sensitive on lotions that give her sting.  </li>
            <li> The lite version seemed to evaporate like water leaving my skin irritated with an oily sheen by early afternoon.</li>
            <li> My skin is oily and sensitive.  </li>
            <li> It keeps face soft and moistened without feeling sticky or gooey.</li>
            <li> We use this on twins who are one years old.</li>
            <li> Vanicream Lite works well for sensitive skin and can use it on my face.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a problem for me because I&#x27;m old and my skin is pretty dry.</li>
            <li> This makes my hands feel &#x27;normal&#x27; - not dry or greasy.</li>
            <li> It looks young and healthy all the time, no more itchy red blots!</li>
            <li> I really want to try this cream, however my bottle had a blue pump, not white as pictured.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok - was looking for something for my face similar to complex 15</li>
            <li> I will only use the thick vanicream in a pump that one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I usually use the original pump of vanicream with no issues.</li>
            <li> In the absence of Nutraderm Lotion, I will stick with this product line which I can at least live with comfortably.</li>
            <li> My efforts to reinstall the nozzle was unsuccessful, since there was only a small slot to fit it, but no locking mechanism.  </li>
            <li> and this is the only cream that works for my face so far.  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for those with sensitive, acne prone, ruddy skin.  </li>
            <li> I have severe allergies and sensitive Irish skin.</li>
            <li> Naturally, I was told to keep my face moisturized (which I do, but I wanted to see if they had any recommendations to replace my current moisturizer).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve discovered that Vanicream isn&#x27;t widely carried in stores, so finding it on Amazon--at a reasonable price--is a bonus.</li>
            <li> you have normal skin and are looking for a basic moisturizer, definitely give this lotion a try.</li>
            <li> It kind of has a weird smell though</li>
            <li> Due to allergies I have to use certain things</li>
            <li> It treats your dry  areas gently, with no singing or burning, even on cracked open places.</li>
            <li> I recommend this one for normal to slightly dry skin</li>
            <li> At the first sign of any dryness or scratchiness/itchiness due to some irritation, I apply VaniCream and it provides instant relief.</li>
            <li> Much preferred over any other product we have tried.</li>
            <li> Have very sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive,  dry skin that is prone to redness.  </li>
            <li> Great lotion to combat the dry skin that develops over the cold dry winter.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin, and I have to put lotion on my hands multiple times a day.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find a lighter lotion that isn&#x27;t a prescription, and you are able to use it on little ones.  </li>
            <li> I find it very useful in the areas that can become exceedingly dry - such as around the sides of the nose which, at least on me, needs the extra protection.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine if it bleaches fabric that bad that it&#x27;s good for my skin.</li>
            <li> It improves the skin so much, plus there&#x27;s no strong smell.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it does NOT moisturize nearly as well as its original counterpart.</li>
            <li> I prefer the lite over the normal formulation only because it doesnt feel heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li> He said that all of the high end creams are a waste and this is the one he always gives samples of in his office.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs nicely, isn&#x27;t greasy and has no smell (sometimes unscented products have an unpleasant smell).</li>
            <li> Non scented, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of problems with my skin and vanicream products are so mild they help instead of making it worse.</li>
            <li> This brand was strongly recommended by my baby granddaughter&#x27;s dermatologist but is difficult to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I use the regular vanicream with a little argan oil in winter and the lite in summer since it is much less sticky but very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> he only thing is my baby has a very very dry skin</li>
            <li> This was after I spent 20 minutes trying to open it with just my hands.</li>
            <li> (It also is cheaper than the other lotion I was using before this so that is a big plus!)</li>
            <li> Just started using this and the thicker one due to recent skin allergies.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lite lotion being told from my dermatologist to use a lighter cream on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It has also helped my husband dry skin.</li>
            <li> Not too oily or too dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had skin cancer twice and have to have monthly laser appointments and my face gets extremely dry.</li>
            <li> Our immunoligists recommended this lotion, it has done wonders for my daughter&#x27;s dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> I used to get dry patches on my legs but since using this, I haven&#x27;t had any dry spots.  </li>
            <li> And, it made my face look dry and was peeling out.</li>
            <li> I used this after shoulder surgery as my arm became  dry.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend you at least give the product a shot.</li>
            <li> I live in a climate that is dry and cold in the winter and hot and sticky in the summer.  </li>
            <li> The Pump arrived in the plastic bag with the pump nozzle loose inside.  </li>
            <li> Not for those with dry skin as this is not very emollient.</li>
            <li> This is extremely similar to a Clinique moisturizer I was using that cost $38.50 for less than 1.7 oz.</li>
            <li> I tend to have very dry and scaley looking skin.  </li>
            <li> Dermatologist recommended this product because my skin gets very dry in the winter.  </li>
            <li> This is very concentrated so you only need a small amount..Does not feel heavy and absorbs well!!</li>
            <li> My chemo causes extreme dry skin all over my body.  </li>
            <li> I hardly know I have it on, though it makes my skin soft</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the ones who see the bad stuff that needs a better solution.</li>
            <li> who have serious dry-skin problems; my skin has become dry only in the last year or two.</li>
            <li> Sticking with the regular, heavy vanicream.  </li>
            <li> They have minimal ingredients, so fewer things to be allergic to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few lotions I can use on my face as well as my entire body</li>
            <li> My problem was very bad, mostly because my leg had been broken badly 4 different times below the knee and would never be healed enough to be normal.</li>
            <li> I know that they say it&#x27;s the same product, just a little less concentrated for a lighter application with the Lite.  </li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> Everyone is right about the pump, it was very difficult to open.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after reading other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> This one is the thinner version of the regular one I bought usually.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it, after I was having eczema problems with other products.  </li>
            <li> I even tried the recommendation of one post  of using a pair of pliers to hold one area while twisting the other, but I still couldn&#x27;t get it to work.  </li>
            <li> as expected!</li>
            <li> Bought due to severe allergic reaction upon rec from my derm....</li>
            <li> I suffer from severe hormonal acne and extremely senstivie skin.</li>
            <li> It was recommended for me to use due to allergies.</li>
            <li> My eyes were watering from other moisturizers I used.</li>
            <li> I tried other lotions and they did not work as well.  </li>
            <li> Usually with other lotions they end up with a ton that the pump just can&#x27;t suck up and you have to sit them upside down hoping gravity will help release the last 15% you paid for.  </li>
            <li> However, so far I have been unable to open the pump attachment.</li>
            <li> Takes care of my dry scaly skin as long as I use it at least every other day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to perfumes, so it&#x27;s hard for me to find a skin cream that doesn&#x27;t leave my hands all greasy and gross.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Using it for 2 weeks slowly allowed my skin to heal enough for the itching to stop &amp; scratching hasn&#x27;t returned but once.</li>
            <li> I have always had to moisturize multiple times a day, though a filter shower head does mean I have to moisturize less.</li>
            <li> For me, sinking into the skin typically translates as dryness.</li>
            <li> and MUCH less money.</li>
            <li> Less chemicals too.</li>
            <li> I lost half of the bottle of lotion before I even got to use it.</li>
            <li> The state of our personal care and cosmetics has gotten to such a state that we are literally a rubbing toxic carcinogins into our skin, among other dangerous chemicals.</li>
            <li> I changed to this with a little vanicream skin cream (for a little thickener).  </li>
            <li> Wish the bottle was a little nicer</li>
            <li> but it is a little thicker and takes longer to put on.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s one of the few products that I can use on my face.</li>
            <li> I prefer, for my son, to lather him heavily</li>
            <li> The moisturizing creams I was using were too harsh.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance and does not feel heavy.  </li>
            <li> and this was too heavy.</li>
            <li> We do spot treat a few areas (the backs of his arms and knees) with an over the counter hydrocortisone cream (per our pediatrician&#x27;s approval), but we continue to use the Vanicream all over - including his face.</li>
            <li> Ifor heavy duty</li>
            <li> I had to use a wrench to hold it under the cap firmly</li>
            <li> Only issue with this is that the pump was broken when it was delivered</li>
            <li> I tried skads of products, some very expensive, and have found that this really works well.  </li>
            <li> Ever since I have been using it, my heels have healed and I have no more problems.</li>
            <li> I think ill go back to buying it at the pharmacy though</li>
            <li> I was ill for months and chemical finally discovered to culprit.</li>
            <li> It has no fragrances, lanolins, and whatever else is added too typical lotions that make then irritating to your skin.  </li>
            <li> this is the only one thing that works on hard elbows and hills skin!!!</li>
            <li> I also replaced my make up remover with this stuff (used with little cotton pads) because the face wipes were killing my face, drying it out and irritating it.</li>
            <li> My father was so disappointed because it was highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and it does not clog pores (at least not for us).  </li>
            <li> Also purchased the bars of soap and the thick cream in a jar.  </li>
            <li> but when he put it on his legs, the next day his legs broke out in a horrible red rash that felt raw.</li>
            <li> No more irritation, redness or flaking on my face!...</li>
            <li> No more!  </li>
            <li> And not good.  </li>
            <li> I have moderate eczema and painful since on fingers.</li>
            <li> Even my husband who hates all things mosturizers uses this with out complaint!</li>
            <li> making her rashes worse either.  </li>
            <li> In my young twenties I had a terrible scaly rash on my lower face that I &#x27;benevolently&#x27; deemed my face rot, went to dermatologist who diagnosed &#x27;dermatitis&#x27;, basically the dermatologist didn&#x27;t know what it was an antibiotics and</li>
            <li> will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> You can not go wrong with this lotion or cream.</li>
            <li> So I have to combat dryness and oiliness which can be extraordinarily difficult.</li>
            <li> A weird, unscented bad smell.  </li>
            <li> In cold weather I use the cream.</li>
            <li> This pump on this bottle was impossible to release.  </li>
            <li> It itched so bad</li>
            <li> and it gave bad eczema on my todller.</li>
            <li> Just grip the base of where the pump comes out of the cap and it should release.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great for sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li> In my young twenties I had a terrible scaly rash on my lower face that I &#x27;benevolently&#x27; deemed my face rot, went to dermatologist who diagnosed &#x27;dermatitis&#x27;, basically the dermatologist didn&#x27;t know what it was an antibiotics and steroids did nothing to rid it. I was plagued with this on two separate occasions for six months each time. I won&#x27;t say that Vanicream cured my rash because I fid change my eating habits since lots of allergies and autoimmune disorders run in my family, but since that time my skin is super sensitive to anything with chemicals, phalates, parabens, etc. in it and this is the only stuff I will use. It goes on smooth under my make up and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and i believe that in part thanks to vanicream my skin looks very young like teens/early twenties and I&#x27;m crossing the 30 line this year. Small win but so happy.</li>
            <li> Great price! Great Quality!</li>
            <li> Vanicream Lite Lotion is amazing.....non-greasy so soothing. I work for an allergist who suggests patients use Vanicream all the time.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> This is a great, light product for those of us that have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one of the few products that I can use on my face.</li>
            <li> This is very concentrated so you only need a small amount..Does not feel heavy and absorbs well!! I love these products that are good for your skin with no harmful chemicals or dyes in them!!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin.  This lotion is free of dyes, lanolin, fragrance, parabens and formaldehyde.  This lotion is my go to face lotion.  I put it on under my makeup.  This same brand makes an awesome moisturizing skin cream.  That cream is what I use on my hands in the winter.  You can not go wrong with this lotion or cream.</li>
            <li> This lotion is absolutely amazing!! It feels so light and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts on my skin. My dermatologist recommended this product and I am SO glad that I listened to her. I also purchased the sunscreen and regular lotion!</li>
            <li> Best cream for my children&#x27;s sensitive skin and eczema.</li>
            <li> I was a big fan of Pacquin Plus with Aloe and since it&#x27;s not available any more, I was searching for a good replacement. After reading many reviews, I bought Vanicream and Vanicream Lite Lotion. Both are great, I could not be happier. The lite lotion is great as a handcream, I keep one bottle at work. It absorbs very quickly and feels great on your hands. I am glad I found it - now lets hope they will not stop making it.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist, it is amazing!!! Keeps ezcema away ... the only lotion that has been able to do that for me.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Have used this lotion for years in a smaller squeeze bottle and liked it, but have never been able to get the pump on this bottle to release despite carefully turning the spigot part while holding the lower part still, for literally hundreds of turns counterclockwise. I&#x27;ll never order this bottle again!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive, combination acne-prone skin. I have tried SO MANY products and this is the ONLY moisturizer I have found that does not break me out. It is light, not greasy, and absorbs very quickly. This is a great product, and I am so happy I found something that works!</li>
            <li> I know that they say it&#x27;s the same product, just a little less concentrated for a lighter application with the Lite.  It IS lighter.  Some may like that.  I prefer, for my son, to lather him heavily so his eczema is treated more.  Not to mention that for an unscented product, this lite lotion SMELLS.  And not good.  A weird, unscented bad smell.  Sticking with the regular, heavy vanicream.  (Which we LOVE!)</li>
            <li> It rescued my skin from all variety of horribleness.  This stuff is like magic! It has no fragrances, lanolins, and whatever else is added too typical lotions that make then irritating to your skin.  It treats your dry  areas gently, with no singing or burning, even on cracked open places. I also replaced my make up remover with this stuff (used with little cotton pads) because the face wipes were killing my face, drying it out and irritating it. If I learned this lotion cured cancer, I wouldn&#x27;t even be surprised! I use this one for my face, and the regular (thicker) Vanicream four my body. I haven&#x27;t had a skin problem since.</li>
            <li> Buy the same product from myotcstore.com or walgreens.com for MUCH less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve struggled with eczema for many years, until finally I found this. I have to use a lot of it (more than the non-lite version of this) to keep my skin moist, but with this, my skin rarely gets irritated. It looks young and healthy all the time, no more itchy red blots!</li>
            <li> I tried this product after reading other reviews.  I have very sensitive skin, and develop rash and skin irritations on my arms and face with almost every lotion I use. I tend to have very dry and scaley looking skin.  This lotion has made my skin look and feel soft and &#x27;repaired&#x27;.  I keep feeling my arms in disbelief at how smooth they feel now.  I use this product twice a day, in the morning and again before bed.  I have been using it for about 2 weeks. I am really so excited at how well it works I wanted to submit a review.  I will purchase this in bulk next time - I do not want to run out.</li>
            <li> I got this because my dermatologist gave me a sample of it and I love it.  It moisturizes without leaving a greasy, lotion-y feeling.  I have dry sensitive skin, and I have to put lotion on my hands multiple times a day.  This makes my hands feel &#x27;normal&#x27; - not dry or greasy.</li>
            <li> This is good lotion for those who are sensitive, and I like the pump - it&#x27;s also a much better deal than getting the smaller non-pump bottle.  The lotion isn&#x27;t extremely moisturizing, but sometimes you just want something light to put on.  It is not irritating, and is not scented.  I even use it to clean any leftover mascara from around my eyes after my morning shower.</li>
            <li> I have allergies to many lotions and the ingredients they use in them.  The Vanicream lite is great for hand lotion and I use a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I really want to try this cream, however my bottle had a blue pump, not white as pictured.  There is no way for the pump to open.  The pump is fused to the section (one piece) below it.  When you turn towards the arrow, the entire stem just spins.  I would really prefer for a working pump to be shipped to me so I can use this product.  I will do an update on this review if my problem gets resolved.  What a hassle it would be to have to unscrew the top and remove the whole stem to access the cream every time.</li>
            <li> Worked in the beginning. Doesn&#x27;t work anumore</li>
            <li> This product works great!</li>
            <li> Love the lotion but when delivery the top was broken so had to put the lotion in another bottle</li>
            <li> Since using the VaniCream line (recommended by my Dermatologist) I have seen an amazing difference in my skin. So much so that people are asking me if I am using Botox! No more irritation, redness or flaking on my face!...my skin is smooth and looks flawless (this is a 360 turn from what it looked like before using this product!) Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion and abosrbs well with no residue. Great for sensitive or acne prone skin. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Great for hands, leg, and even face. It has stopped the aging process for me.</li>
            <li> The shipping is fast!&lt;br /&gt;The product is safe and sound:)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion for my reactive, sensitive skin. It&#x27;s fast absorbing formula makes it great for picky children or anyone who needs to get dressed and out the door quickly. This also comes in a heavier formula which is good for winter use. It really helps to control and heal my eczema flare ups.</li>
            <li> good &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; lotion</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for 15 years. I tried everything available, before finally I asked a pharmacist if there was anything that would work better. This stuff works... and it works great for me! It&#x27;s not perfumed like most women like &amp; my wife refuses to use it for this reason. Some people are fools. My problem was very bad, mostly because my leg had been broken badly 4 different times below the knee and would never be healed enough to be normal. It itched so bad I&#x27;d scratch until it would bleed at times. Using it for 2 weeks slowly allowed my skin to heal enough for the itching to stop &amp; scratching hasn&#x27;t returned but once. That was my fault. But if I use it every 3-4 days religiously, I never have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;If this stuff doesn&#x27;t work for you, for God sakes, talk to a pharmacist or a doctor. They&#x27;re the ones who see the bad stuff that needs a better solution. My pharmacy was bought out by Walgreens &amp; they don&#x27;t cary it anymore. Rather than drive all over town burning up many dollars of gas, I came to Amazon &amp; found it quickly. I just ordered a 16 oz bottle. If you find it in a pharmacy I suspect it&#x27;ll cost 20-30 dollars. Years ago, I paid $7.50 for my first 8oz bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it works for others as well as it has for me.</li>
            <li> Vanicream was recommended to me by my dermatologist in New York.  He said that all of the high end creams are a waste and this is the one he always gives samples of in his office.  It&#x27;s light and more fluid, like european lotions, which makes it feel less waxy and sticky when you put it on your body.  I use this on my body and my face.  It gives great moisture to my skin, even in the super dry winter months!  I used to bring back multiple bottles of lotion whenever I was in Europe for work, because I liked the texture so much more than American lotion.  No more!  This is equally smooth and works fabulously.  It&#x27;s great for all skin types, especially sensitive skin.  My boyfriend&#x27;s mild eczema has improved using this as well.  Definitely a really good lotion, even more so for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is great, but I&#x27;ve noticed sometimes the pump can be a bit difficult to twist open the first time.  It&#x27;s happened on three bottles for me now.  Just grip the base of where the pump comes out of the cap and it should release.  Other than that, the packaging works well and I find the pump gets almost all of the lotion out so that you arent left at the end trying to shake out the remaining 15% at the bottom of the bottle.  Usually with other lotions they end up with a ton that the pump just can&#x27;t suck up and you have to sit them upside down hoping gravity will help release the last 15% you paid for.  Not with this lotion.  It might be that the lotion is more fluid or that the straw is longer than most.  I don&#x27;t know the specifics as to why, but I appreciate it.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for my sensitive skin.  It does not irritate or cause rashes.  It was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I discovered VaniCream earlier this year when my skin was suffering from a tornado of disturbances. In desperation, I turned to the one product I&#x27;d never tried but that my mother kept trying to introduce me to. Since the first application, I&#x27;ll never use anything else. This is my first time using the LITE edition and it&#x27;s even more perfectly engineered for faces.</li>
            <li> the only skin care i can use due to sensitive skin...had to buy this Lite Lotion for the summer as the Lite Cream feels heavy, but works great in the winter season...Vanicream shave cream and sunscreen SPF 50+ are part of my skin care too...</li>
            <li> greates ever1 this is the only one thing that works on hard elbows and hills skin!!! no smell at all! very absorbent! bht is the only one thing i do not like about this lotion, but bht is in the food...so guess it is ok</li>
            <li> Very nice lotion for sensitive skin. Not for those with dry skin as this is not very emollient. Works best for normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li> It helped my son and his eczema. This one is the thinner version of the regular one I bought usually. non greasy and stays on the skin without having any buildup. So far, this is the best cream for my son.</li>
            <li> The Pump arrived in the plastic bag with the pump nozzle loose inside.  My efforts to reinstall the nozzle was unsuccessful, since there was only a small slot to fit it, but no locking mechanism.  Likely the nozzle snapped off.  Rather then fuss with getting a replacement and extra postage penalties, I emptied the lotion into another pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> This has been a life saver for my skin. I have suffered chronic hives for 2 years before finding this. What a huge help.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Not greasy but just light enough to absorb into the skin quickly.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this lite lotion being told from my dermatologist to use a lighter cream on my dry skin. I have skin lupus and rosacea. I usually use the original pump of vanicream with no issues. I have to say I will not be buying the lite lotion again. It&#x27;s too watery and never settles into skin to apply makeup. I will only use the thick vanicream in a pump that one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> This was first recommended to me by my dermatologist.  I have very sensitive skin (it reacts to nearly anything with chemicals in it).  But, this is 100% safe and effective with my skin.  At the first sign of any dryness or scratchiness/itchiness due to some irritation, I apply VaniCream and it provides instant relief.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Best So Far I&#x27;ve Tried</li>
            <li> I used DML for years but my face started reacting to it.  I changed to this with a little vanicream skin cream (for a little thickener).  I would highly recommend it.  So does my dermo MD.</li>
            <li> If you were looking for a lotion for sensitive skin, this is the brand.  It was recommended by my allergist and it works.</li>
            <li> Wonderful lotion for eczema psoriasis and skin problems. The doctor recommended it for my husband&#x27;s psoriasis, but I have been using it on my cracked heels. Ever since I have been using it, my heels have healed and I have no more problems. It has also helped my husband dry skin.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist.  It&#x27;s a light lotion with  no scent, and does not cause breakouts. I will order again.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband because he has skin allergies.  A doctor recommended it for him because he also has skin allergies.  My husband tried it and said that he does like it.  It&#x27;s not greasy nor is watery.  It has no scent which he likes</li>
            <li> I use this lotion as a daytime companion to Vaniply Ointment.  It rubs in nicely and I apply it frequently to combat scaly, peeling skin on my hands.  it is free of the chemicals and compounds that can contribute to skin problems experienced by those with sensitive/allergic skin.</li>
            <li> This product is light and still proves to be a great moisturizer for the skin. Great for anyone who has dry skin and does not like the weight and heaviness of some of the other moisturizer products on the market.</li>
            <li> Fragrance free, light in texture.  Dries quickly and protects the skin very well.  Great for sensitive, dry skin.  Perfect to keep near the kitchen sink.</li>
            <li> Remember Matthew 7:21</li>
            <li> Product was just as described.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This seems to be working well.  My dermatologist recommended it, after I was having eczema problems with other products.  It is a very light cream and I have had no issues with it.  I do agree with the majority of the posts that the pump wouldn&#x27;t work.  I even tried the recommendation of one post  of using a pair of pliers to hold one area while twisting the other, but I still couldn&#x27;t get it to work.  I&#x27;m just going to put it in a smaller pump to make it easier to use.  Overall, pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my Dermatologist for chronic eczema...  He also recommended Aveeno.  I find the Vanicream leaves a very soft, smooth feeling to my skin.  I can use it all over my body-everywhere.</li>
            <li> I have tried a variety of facial moisturizers. As a male, I have to shave and I also am prone to oiliness, acne, and dryness. So I have to combat dryness and oiliness which can be extraordinarily difficult. This is the best lotion out there for doing that. Cetaphil is quite good, but still leaves too much greasy residue. I have also found lighter products that evaporate quickly and leave my face dry within minutes. This does neither. It dries non-greasy, but leaves my face moisturized. I highly recommend you at least give the product a shot. But be sure that lotion, whether it be for arms, face, legs, or whatever...is a very personalized thing. It may not work for you! Keep trying.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my Dermatologist.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist gave me samples of this light lotion, the cream and the ointment. I liked it enough to order this. It absorbs nicely, isn&#x27;t greasy and has no smell (sometimes unscented products have an unpleasant smell). This &#x27;light lotion&#x27; feels more like the sample of the heavier cream sample I received than the light lotion. It wasn&#x27;t a problem for me because I&#x27;m old and my skin is pretty dry. Might be a problem for someone with younger skin.</li>
            <li> Good for skin conditions such as psoriasis.  Doesn&#x27;t have the harmful additives and absorbs well.  Much preferred over any other product we have tried.</li>
            <li> This was highly recommended by my dermatologist and is excellent quality.  I am looking forward to ordering another bottle soon.  I love the fact it has a pump.</li>
            <li> I use the regular vanicream with a little argan oil in winter and the lite in summer since it is much less sticky but very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful for eczema. I have had a lot of problems with my skin and vanicream products are so mild they help instead of making it worse. So glad to find this!</li>
            <li> My dermotologist recommended Vanicream for my sensitive skin and and adult acne.  It goes on easily and makes my skin feel very soft and the acne has disappeared.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Vanicream from my dermatologist.  It is very light, doesn&#x27;t make me break out, not greasy, and no odor.</li>
            <li> I have severe allergies, so purchased this for my wife.  I don&#x27;t smell anything and there&#x27;s no reaction.&lt;br /&gt;AND she likes it!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended by dermo at Mayo clinic for my husband and anyone else with skin issues and dont want all the junk added to it</li>
            <li> My daughter had some infant acne and our pediatrician recommended Vanicream.  It works great.  Her skin cleared up within just a couple days and has been great ever since (about two months).</li>
            <li> Very good, just like the original. Non scented, and long lasting. this is expensive, but the best moisturizer in the market</li>
            <li> The best buy for Vanicream, at my local store they only have small bottles.</li>
            <li> I live in a climate that is dry and cold in the winter and hot and sticky in the summer.  And I&#x27;ve always been prone to &amp;#34;combination skin&amp;#34; issues.  This is the first lotion I have consistently loved that stands up to the elements but doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy.  Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a version with SPF 15 (or higher) and that would be spectacular.</li>
            <li> I loveeeee it!! It kind of has a weird smell though</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  Very light yet does well in keeping my skin lubricated.  Not oily. Despite the price increase, I would order this item again</li>
            <li> use this daily on my face.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> This too was recommended by my doctor.  The moisturizing creams I was using were too harsh.  This lotion doesn&#x27;t give me a red face or make me sneeze.</li>
            <li> Really Fragrance-Free and it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free&amp;Clear and Vanicream products are perfect for me because I&#x27;m allergic to most fragrances. They have minimal ingredients, so fewer things to be allergic to. And they work well. I use the Hair Gel, Shampoo, Conditioner, Skin Cream, Lite Lotion, Vaniply Ointment, and Liquid Cleanser. All are great products and I am really grateful for the lack of perfumes, masking fragrances, and unneeded botanical ingredients that could cause allergies.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Not too oily or too dry. perfect for combination or dry skin. Been using for years.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this...and I&#x27;ve purchased it at the doctor&#x27;s office.  However, this was the BEST DEAL!  Thank you!  Great service, too.</li>
            <li> as expected! And I didn&#x27;t have to drive anywhere!</li>
            <li> ITEM WAS SUGGESTED BY MY DERMATOLOGIST FOR A LIGHT MOISTURIZER. I HAVE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE SKIN AND HAVE NOT HAD ANY ISSUES SINCE USING IT. PRODUCT IS SHEER AND CAN BE WORN ALONE OR UNDER MAKEUP. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY SO PRODUCT LASTS QUITE AWHILE. MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE ONLINE VS RETAIL STORE. GREAT LINE OF ITEMS FOR THOSE OF US WHO CAN&#x27;T TOLERATE THE LANOLINS AND PARABANS THAT MANY PRODUCTS HAVE IN THEM. HAVE BEEN USING ITEM NOW FOR &amp;#62; A YEAR. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> This cream is light and moisturizing!  I have sensitive dry skin and this is the only cream that works for my face so far.  It doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance and does not feel heavy.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes non-fragrant light moisturizers.</li>
            <li> the pump doesn&#x27;t work. The lotion is still my favorite! its perfect for dry sensitive skin (i put it on my face and its not greasy). I think ill go back to buying it at the pharmacy though</li>
            <li> Have very sensitive and dry skin. Bought this to use as a face lotion. Didn&#x27;t quite work out for that but still use it as a body lotion.</li>
            <li> Fantastic lotion, will definitely buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> This lotion was recommended by my Dermatologist.  She gave me samples and when I used them I ordered this bottle on Amazon. I love the pump because I can share it with my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;This IS the lotion so it is lighter weight than the cream.  I also have the cream and prefer it for really hydrating my face.  I wear this Lite Lotion when I want to hydrate my face but I&#x27;m going to be wearing makeup. This lotion is better for me to use under my makeup than the cream since the cream is much thicker.&lt;br /&gt;My husband also likes this Lite Lotion a little more than the cream because it is lighter weight.&lt;br /&gt;There is no smell, I don&#x27;t feel sticky or oily, it doesn&#x27;t break me out, and most importantly IT WORKS!  I love it. I&#x27;ve had skin cancer twice and have to have monthly laser appointments and my face gets extremely dry. The cream was amazing and worked overnight. I loved it.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer lotion with no fragrance and very light so it doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  Just holds natural moisture in.  Good to use after showering.</li>
            <li> I love this product because my skin is like velvet after use.  It&#x27;s not greasy and just disappears in the skin.</li>
            <li> My daughter suggested this. I love it I have moderate eczema and painful since on fingers. This works great. Very fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Really good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> As someone who&#x27;s had a skin reaction to every moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried - from drugstore to high end - vanicream has been a life saver. Works good, no reactions even after months of use. Wish the bottle was a little nicer so I could have it on the counter, but I definitely recommend the product.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended I use this moisturizer because every thing else I tried irritated my rosacea.  It&#x27;s the best moisturizer I have ever tried.  It moisturizes and never irritates.  AND the price is right.  This one&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on smoothly and  does not feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I found I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances and formaldehyde. Vanicream is a very product.</li>
            <li> Vanicream Lite Lotion has saved me from the debacle caused by Nutraderm Original Lotion having been taken off the market. I have been using it now for over a month. On the great big plus side, it does not irritate my face, it does not clog the pores, it goes on smoothly. It does seem to sink into the skin and not leave a sheen. For me, sinking into the skin typically translates as dryness. My preference is for somewhat of a sheen, but in the case of this product, sinking into the skin does not equal dryness - it leaves more of a natural effect and I have to assume that the moisture actually protects the inner layer of the skin, and results in continued comfort. I have also used the Vanicream Moisturizing Skin Cream, which provides a thicker feel. I find it very useful in the areas that can become exceedingly dry - such as around the sides of the nose which, at least on me, needs the extra protection. In the absence of Nutraderm Lotion, I will stick with this product line which I can at least live with comfortably.</li>
            <li> I used this cream and light lotion for a long time. After a while my clothes, sheets, and brand new bath towels started getting orange streaks and bleach spots on them. Finally discovered it was the lotion and cream. This was recommended for my atopic dermatitis which never got better when applying 2x a day as recommended. Can&#x27;t imagine if it bleaches fabric that bad that it&#x27;s good for my skin. Returned all unopened products and threw the rest away!</li>
            <li> Light and scent is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and super-sensitive skin  and this is the only lotion I can use when my skin is acting up.</li>
            <li> This is *still* being sold with a defective pump (the pump and the ring under are fused as one piece). Any seller who knowingly sells defective pieces should be ashamed of themselves.</li>
            <li> Our immunoligists recommended this lotion, it has done wonders for my daughter&#x27;s dry itchy skin.  She doens&#x27;t have problems with it making her rashes worse either.  We will order again.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE ECZEMA !</li>
            <li> I have sensitive facial skin that tends to turn bright red from contact with nearly anything, even water.  I use this lotion on my face in combination with Elta MD sunscreen, and it helps protect my skin without causing irritation or breakouts.  Definitely recommend for those with sensitive, acne prone, ruddy skin.  It really is light and non-greasy, much better than anything labeled &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; at the store.</li>
            <li> Nice light cream. Only one I use. I am very sensitive to fragrances and I appreciate that there is no scent.</li>
            <li> However, so far I have been unable to open the pump attachment. Any suggestions? I have used  this product in the past and use it in warm weather. In cold weather I use the cream.</li>
            <li> This pump on this bottle was impossible to release.  Had to call manufacturer for new pump.  Product is now fine and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Bought due to severe allergic reaction upon rec from my derm....totally worth it. Good moisture without being heavy. This is making me type more words to submit it</li>
            <li> Our favorite lotion, goes on great and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy or shiny.</li>
            <li> product arrived quickly and was as described</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended me purchase this lotion for my face. I suffer from severe hormonal acne and extremely senstivie skin. It seems I am allergic to almost everything. Bought this, and my skin has never felt better! No irritation, no scent, skin very hydrated but not oily! I recommend it to anyone! (It also is cheaper than the other lotion I was using before this so that is a big plus!)</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist for me as I have mild rosacea &amp; wasn&#x27;t finding anything that I was satisfied with.  I tried skads of products, some very expensive, and have found that this really works well.  My skin feels &amp; looks younger, and even friends have said this, too.  I hope it continues to work well.</li>
            <li> great lotion. goes on smooth. &#x27;lite&#x27; as labeled. i use this on my body while using vanicream and vitec on my face. i absolutely love all vanicream products.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream.  It is lighter than the regular Vanicream, so it was perfect for the summer.  I have eczema and this really helped to calm my skin.  I also used in on my face and it didn&#x27;t clog my pores!  The price is cheaper than retail stores!</li>
            <li> For anyone with sensitive skin, this product is for you! This is, by far, my favorite lotion. In fact, I&#x27;ve ordered it for several family members.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and severe allergy to fragrance.  This product works great for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried several lotions for keeping my skin look healthy especially  in the winter.  This by far is the BEST I have found.&lt;br /&gt;I like it is free of dyes, fragrance free, and free of toxins.  I love that it is non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I have severe allergies and sensitive Irish skin. I have always had to moisturize multiple times a day, though a filter shower head does mean I have to moisturize less. My big issue with health and beauty products, however, is an allergy to formaldehyde. For those who don&#x27;t know, DMDM is a preservative found in a ton of products, including that hand soap in pretty much every public restroom. DMDM contains formaldehyde. I was ill for months and chemical finally discovered to culprit. I had to throw out pretty much every hair product, moisturizer, soap, etc. I had no idea where to begin to find a replacement because so many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; products either contain DMDM or almond oil, which I am also allergic to. Then I found Vanicream products. Simple, effective, affordable and SAFE! The state of our personal care and cosmetics has gotten to such a state that we are literally a rubbing toxic carcinogins into our skin, among other dangerous chemicals.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product. I had heard fantastic things about it and it was recommended by my father&#x27;s dermatologist so I wasn&#x27;t too bothered by the price if it was going to work. I originally got it for my father who had just finished radiation and was having adverse reactions on his skin with burns and rashes. This is a very light lotion but when he put it on his legs, the next day his legs broke out in a horrible red rash that felt raw. My father was so disappointed because it was highly recommended. I ended up taking the remainder of the product to use at home because I figured it should be fine on regular skin. I use it every so often but I prefer a cream over a lotion, this lotion doesn&#x27;t seem to make my skin feel any different or softer....Very Disappointed.</li>
            <li> wife loves this stuff</li>
            <li> I use this as recommended by my Dermatologist.  I like it but wish it lasted longer.  Have to use often if want full affect.  Feel nice on my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Provides good level of moisturizing for someone with dry skin; recommended by my dermatologist and it works well.  I have used other moisturizing lotions and this works much better than the mass market &amp;#34;off the shelf&amp;#34; products carried by grocers and pharmacies.</li>
            <li> I love the way this lite lotion makes my skin feel.  It is not to creamy &amp; lite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lotion was packaged with two books.  The top and pump broke off and lotion was on everything.  The seller replaced all items with no problem.</li>
            <li> I recently visited the dermatologist who prescribed me Tretinoin cream. Naturally, I was told to keep my face moisturized (which I do, but I wanted to see if they had any recommendations to replace my current moisturizer). I tried out this one, which broke me out! I have combination acne prone skin and this was too heavy. I think it&#x27;s just better for the body!</li>
            <li> I just love all the Vanicream products.  I&#x27;m highly sensitive to smells and my allergist gave me a bunch of samples of all different Vanicream products about 2 years ago and I&#x27;ve been buying them ever since.  I used to get dry patches on my legs but since using this, I haven&#x27;t had any dry spots.  It truly is fragrance free - which is more than I can say for other \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li> This is great for skin conditions.  I try to use all the time when I remember.  Highly reccomend to all.</li>
            <li> It was recommended for me to use due to allergies. Very light feeling. Works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly allergic to everything.  It&#x27;s one of the few lotions I can use on my face as well as my entire body and I like that I don&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> My wife, not me, should be writing these reviews. She likes it and uses it every day. Keeps her skin smooth.</li>
            <li> This is extremely similar to a Clinique moisturizer I was using that cost $38.50 for less than 1.7 oz. This is 16 oz. and MUCH less money. Less chemicals too. A small amount goes a long way. This might be a 1 year supply.  John&#x27;s wife</li>
            <li> Our son has had eczema pretty much since he came home from the hospital (and that was 2.5 years ago).  It is hard to find a lighter lotion that isn&#x27;t a prescription, and you are able to use it on little ones.  A friend recommended Vanicream and we haven&#x27;t gone a day without it since 2010.  Once we started using Vanicream, we noticed a significant improvement in his eczema.  We do spot treat a few areas (the backs of his arms and knees) with an over the counter hydrocortisone cream (per our pediatrician&#x27;s approval), but we continue to use the Vanicream all over - including his face. His skin looks like a little one&#x27;s should - clear and smooth. It is not greasy and it does not clog pores (at least not for us).  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok - was looking for something for my face similar to complex 15</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good about Vanicream.  This is the best moisturizer for sensitive allergic skin.  My skin is so so soft now.</li>
            <li> Perfect product for my rosacea! This soaks right in without a greasy residue! Even my husband who hates all things mosturizers uses this with out complaint!</li>
            <li> I bought this by mistake.  It is not Sunscreen!  I was recommended the  sunscreen by my dermatologist which, I like but not this one as its not sunscreen!!</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin, helps with controlling/healing eczema. Lotion can be used on face and overall body.  I use it as a facial lotion for myself and a body lotion for my toddler.</li>
            <li> Great product, recomended by my dermatologist. This is a really good buy and nice to have it in a pump.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion, goes right in, non irritating</li>
            <li> Vanicreme is NOT CRUELTY FREE. Go with a different product/manufacturer like Cetaphyl. Cruelty free means they do not test on animals.</li>
            <li> I choose this lotion because it was suggested by  Dr. My eyes were watering from other moisturizers I used. Voila when I started using this watery eyes stopped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to perfumes, so it&#x27;s hard for me to find a skin cream that doesn&#x27;t leave my hands all greasy and gross. My dermotologist recommended this, and I have to say it fits the bill. I will only use this on my hands.</li>
            <li> I like this product he only thing is my baby has a very very dry skin and it is not helping too much with it, but Ihave used it for myself and it is good!</li>
            <li> My skin burned after using this. I have real sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t help it at all. Maybe I just have different allergies that I don&#x27;t know about yet...</li>
            <li> Rgis was just what the wife needed, Vanicram works great, and we found out she can&#x27;t use products that are found with parabins and this works great for her and yes the Dr recomended it.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermotologist. It has a nice smooth feel on your skin, not at all greasy. The price was much better than I could find elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I prefer the lite over the normal formulation only because it doesnt feel heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li> Great lotion to combat the dry skin that develops over the cold dry winter.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  I&#x27;ve been using it several years and will continue.  Good buy.  The pump works really well, all the way to the bottom.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion. Good for sensitive skin. Will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> the top will not open</li>
            <li> This is about my third 16 ounce dispenser of Vanicream Lite.  Great product!  Moistens skin without being gooey or bothering my eyes.  Goes on best if you apply after wiping your skin lightly with a damp bath clothe.  Dermatologist recommended this product because my skin gets very dry in the winter.  It works.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive,  dry skin that is prone to redness.  The Vanicream lite lotion literally saved my skin after  changing  products so many times. The lotion is not oily or greasy at all and spreads easily. I use the lotion in am and the cream in the jar at pm. Vanicream lotion absorbs quickly without leaving any residue or shine.&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this product is it is so versatile in it&#x27;s use. I also use this for my eye moisturizer. Wonderful for that too. It has no fragrance or parades and comes in a big 1 oz pump bottle that pumps quite well. No mees, no extra lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I think this lotion would also benefit rose a and excel a skin types as well as sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;My skin has improved greatly in the texture, softness, redness reduction, moisturization, and overall comfort of my skin. I do use the soap, and cream in the pump jar as well and I love those products also.&lt;br /&gt;Vanicream to me, is much better than Cetaphil, Cerave because it has no parades or other ingredients to upset the skin. I was along time Cerave user until I got a Vanicream sample at the dermatologist. After using that, and seeing the difference in my skin, I changed to Vanicream and it has proven to be the best for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;If you have roscea, excema, or sensitive skin I highly recommend Vanicream lite lotion.</li>
            <li> My chemo causes extreme dry skin all over my body.  My oncologist recommended Vanicream.  I was using the moisturizing cream which works great but it is a little thicker and takes longer to put on.  This Lite Lotion is perfect.  Takes care of my dry scaly skin as long as I use it at least every other day.  A little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> My daughter has sensitive skin and she&#x27;s sensitive on lotions that give her sting.  I&#x27;ve tried all lotions already.  The best one is Udderly Smooth and this Vanicream.  It improves the skin so much, plus there&#x27;s no strong smell.  Perfect for my kid and my hubby too.</li>
            <li> My favorite lite lotion. Ifor heavy duty I like the Vanicream cream</li>
            <li> great lotion my husband has used on his sensitive skin for 4 years.</li>
            <li> I had been using the original Vanicream Moisturizing Skin Cream and loved it, but I wanted to try the lite version for daytime use. Unfortunately, it does NOT moisturize nearly as well as its original counterpart. This lite version has a gel-like consistency which would work well for people who have oily skin (not acne-prone) or normal skin. But for sensitive, acne-prone skin and/or eczematous skin like mine, I would highly recommend the original Vanicream. The lite version seemed to evaporate like water leaving my skin irritated with an oily sheen by early afternoon. The original Vanicream keeps my skin moisturized all day long, and as a result, my body does not produce more oil because the skin is already protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have normal skin and are looking for a basic moisturizer, definitely give this lotion a try. But if you&#x27;re looking for something to soothe and protect irritated and cracked skin, stick to the original Vanicream.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for sensitive skin. It helps me a lot!!!</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this and it works great. Its light and non-greasy which is good. Plus really does keep skin moisturized</li>
            <li> Purchased this from my wife and she loves it.</li>
            <li> great product and it works when nothing else would.</li>
            <li> These products are the best, but this skin lotion continued to make my face itch and turn red.  The price is great, the feel is good for the first few minutes, and then for my own skin, no good.  But, it was the step to the next lotions by vanicream that have been terrific.</li>
            <li> contains BHT a preservative</li>
            <li> Excellent and light cream, which was recommended by dermatologist.  My skin is oily and sensitive.  This product works beautifully to moisturizer without adding oils.</li>
            <li> delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> It works, take awhile to absorb into your skin. It isn&#x27;t great lotion but it does the job. One good thing is that i used to not be able to put lotion on my skin right out of the shower without having a reaction. This product doesn&#x27;t cause any reaction, so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> I meant to order the moisturizing cream but I mistakenly ordered the lite lotion&lt;br /&gt;I was told I could not return it.</li>
            <li> This brand was strongly recommended by my baby granddaughter&#x27;s dermatologist but is difficult to find in stores.  Thankfully, Amazon had it and could deliver quickly.  Also purchased the bars of soap and the thick cream in a jar.  It has really helped her skin.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. I love the products but I can&#x27;t trust that they will be delivered without being damaged. I lost half of the bottle of lotion before I even got to use it.</li>
            <li> very light moisturizer for the face. You only need about a finger tip amount for the face.</li>
            <li> too greasy feeling. takes awhile to absorb.</li>
            <li> It is not as light as the samples I&#x27;ve used.  And, it made my face look dry and was peeling out.</li>
            <li> I have used Vanicream for a couple of years since my Dermotoligst recommended it.  It keeps face soft and moistened without feeling sticky or gooey.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Lotion is very good, but my skin is extremely dry and it does not fill the bill completely.  Need something creamier and greasier.</li>
            <li> My daughter introduced me to Vanicream products. She raved about the scope of the company&#x27;s products and their effectiveness, and I&#x27;ve come to agree with her positive assessment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly like the Lite Lotion for its soothing and gentle hydration. I use it as an all-round body lotion. It&#x27;s not at all sticky and absorbs quickly, which makes it especially pleasant to use on my hands. Because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;lite,&amp;#34; the pump doesn&#x27;t clog and I can coax the last smidgen out of the bottle by heating it quickly in the microwave and pouring it into my hands or another container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve discovered that Vanicream isn&#x27;t widely carried in stores, so finding it on Amazon--at a reasonable price--is a bonus.</li>
            <li> The pump does not work so i have to unscrew it and wipe the tube on my hand.. Actual lotion is great but poor packaging can ruin a product.</li>
            <li> This is their lite lotion that I like, however my wife likes the same lotion made by Vanicream but not the lite version which is alot thicker.</li>
            <li> Vanicream lite lotion is great for my skin.  I feel refreshed without feeling greasy and love that I don&#x27;t have any allergic reactions to the product.</li>
            <li> Just started using this and the thicker one due to recent skin allergies. It&#x27;s really nice, light. I recommend this one for normal to slightly dry skin but I use the thicker cream for my legs because shaving them dries them out more. Everyone is right about the pump, it was very difficult to open. I had to use a wrench to hold it under the cap firmly and then twisted the top and it opened. This was after I spent 20 minutes trying to open it with just my hands. This is a good product for sensitive skin and it has no smell, which is good.</li>
            <li> I just love this lite lotion it feels great on your skin.  Due to allergies I have to use certain things so I don&#x27;t break out and this lotion I can use without any problems.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy when you apply it to your skin.  I will continue to use the Vanicream lite lotion and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> We use this on twins who are one years old. They are allergic to everything, but this seems to help Their skin out. This is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> Really a great product and got fast delivery</li>
            <li> I like this product.  Very light on my skin but does a great job.</li>
            <li> Good chemical-free lotion</li>
            <li> The pump is terrible. The product is nice, but equally effective in cream form.</li>
            <li> Vanicream Lite works well for sensitive skin and can use it on my face. I&#x27;ve bought two bottles and will buy again. Fast delivery and good price.</li>
            <li> I found this product by accident at my local grocery store on clearance.  I was looking for a lotion that didn&#x27;t have all of the harmful chemicals and fragrances in it, but still felt moisturizing without feeling greasy.  I absolutely love this stuff and I&#x27;m so glad that amazon carries it.  My skin looks 10 years younger and the difference is just amazing!!</li>
            <li> Quick to absorb and moisturizes well!  And no problems with the ingredients either.  Definitely try if you have allergies! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The only lotion I can use for my super-sensitive skin, works great on the face too.</li>
            <li> Only issue with this is that the pump was broken when it was delivered so I had to use another bottle.</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful.  Most I&#x27;ve tried have been so heavy and gooey, I would not use them&lt;br /&gt;Many triggered migraine headaches, especially if I used the product on a regular basis and close&lt;br /&gt;to my face.  This lotion feels so light I hardly know I have it on, though it makes my skin soft&lt;br /&gt;and non-flaky. Most important, no headaches or burning eyes.  I don&#x27;t know if it would work for&lt;br /&gt;people who have serious dry-skin problems; my skin has become dry only in the last year or two.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be less concentarted and also easy to apply than the original one. Treid for 2 days and it gave bad eczema on my todller. stopped using this for 2 days and its all gone.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for rehydrating your skin.  I used this after shoulder surgery as my arm became  dry.  I tried other lotions and they did not work as well.  Vanicream was suggested to me so I tried it.  Worked great!!</li>
