            <li>Also, my eyes water fairly often, and this stays put.  </li>

            <li>The viscosity is perfect for smooth,  consistent application.</li>
            <li>and it comes off just as easy!  </li>
            <li>The tip on this eyeliner is very fine.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold, and looks nice.  </li>

            <li>This type of liner works so much better than pencils.</li>

            <li>I love this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>, I was glad to find that Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li>Love this liner.  </li>
            <li>I am sure you can widen it, too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like writing with a marker for the most part.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>do I love it?  </li>
            <li>Yay for auto-piloting :)</li>
            <li>so this does ok:)  </li>
            <li>Love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many eyeliners.......</li>
            <li>I love how smooth it goes on</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is easy to apply, but I wish it was water proof.  </li>
            <li>I like how easy this eyeliner is to apply.</li>
            <li>It stays on all day but washes off easily.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Cat eyes are easy with this liner.</li>
            <li>As far as I was concerned, there was no way I was ever going to be able to do eyeliner and make it look good.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and easily</li>
            <li>The tip is fine and you can apply the thinnest line or build up to the thickness you like.  </li>
            <li>Goes On smooth.</li>
            <li>This goes on easily and cleanly.  </li>
            <li>EVERYTHING smudges on me because when I smile my top lid disappears (and I smile alot).  </li>
            <li>Sure, I could have used a more expensive liquid liner, but honestly this one was so good I never saw the need.  </li>
            <li>I used this eyeliner several years ago, loved it</li>
            <li>It also looks like there is more in it than there really is because of the size, but it still lasts for months.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly so there&#x27;s no smudging</li>
            <li>I love the browns available, but seem much harder to find.</li>
            <li>This is my first liquid eyeliner</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love this product.  </li>
            <li>After I received the first one, I ordered two more--one for my gym bag and one for my travel kit.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t start wearing mascara until after my first year of college.</li>
            <li>Then I decided to try liquid liner and this was my first choice.</li>
            <li>No other eyeliner I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried plenty) is so easy to control and to get the size line you want.  </li>
            <li>and now I wonder why I ever tried to use any other kind of eyeliner.</li>
            <li>short, it&#x27;s my holy grail of eyeliners - easy to draw whatever liner shape I want,</li>
            <li>I really like this product and will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>I find using the felt tip rather than a brush tip is much easier and neater.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the whole story.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite eyeliner, hands down.  </li>
            <li>flattering color, inexpensive, wears well, and easy to remove, all in a classy, simple, airtight package.  </li>
            <li>I get a couple of those sample subscriptions and they send me eyeliners pretty frequently-</li>
            <li>The color is good, not too stark against my pale skin and light eyes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I chose &amp;#34;Earthen Rock Brown&amp;#34; and am pleased with the color which is dark and defining and a sensible replacement for my black eyeliner as I am moving towards a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>But it really does wear like iron for me on a typical day, and it&#x27;s easy to remove with eye-makeup remover at the end of the day without having to rub my eyes raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The felt tip is VERY easy to control, so I make very few mistakes.  </li>
            <li>The applicator makes it easy to make any kind of line that you want from thick to thin, the liquid formula goes on smoothly with no pulling.</li>
            <li>it is lighter and warmer, and much more flattering on my pale</li>
            <li>I should note that I am super particular about replacing this, along with my mascara, every three months, so it may dry out over longer periods than that...</li>
            <li>Bonus for subscribe and save because I just have Amazon deliver it every three months - when a new one shows up at my door</li>
            <li>It is easy to control and get a narrow line, which I like.</li>
            <li>This is dark enough that most people are going to assume it&#x27;s black, but it&#x27;s most definitely brown -</li>
            <li>Thos is a product I have a hard time finding in stores, but am able to find at Amazon.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really compare to a different one.</li>
            <li>But I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I prefer liquid eyeliners to pencil but many liquid liners have a thick tip.</li>
            <li>Not too warm and red, but not as cool and harsh as a black or grey would be.  </li>
            <li>It is fast drying and long wearing.</li>
            <li>I use Loreal products only because I am sensitive to chemicals and this brand hasn&#x27;t caused problems so far.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not cheap feeling at all - it&#x27;s not a fluorescent color, it doesn&#x27;t have branding slathered all over it, and the packaging is nice and air-tight so you won&#x27;t have dried out liner or spillage all over your bag.  </li>
            <li>The Earthen Rock color is a dark brown, matches my eyelashes, and I like it much better than black.</li>
            <li>This color is natural looking and enhances my blue eyes.</li>
            <li>a small cat-eye and a bold lip are my go-</li>
            <li>I get about 10 hours of good solid wear from this if I use an eyeshadow base first.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a longer, flexible felt tip that makes getting a thin line really easy.  </li>

            <li> I rarely have to go back and try to reapply because it didn&#x27;t go on as thick as I want</li>
            <li> I have really small, really oily Asian eyelids.  </li>
            <li> If they ever discontinue this I will cry (but hey, at least I know my liner will stay put as long as I don&#x27;t wipe, right?).</li>
            <li> The pigment is saturated, the color looks natural on my brown eyes with dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long in wear.</li>
            <li> It also can be built up to be thicker, and is easy to get right at the base of your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> even if you were makeup illiterate like I was not too long ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to control the line to make it thick or thin, depending on the look you want.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on smoothly, helping you determine whether you want a thin line or a thick one.</li>
            <li> As a rather pale complected person with dark hair, black can be a little harsh looking on me, especially with a red lip.  </li>
            <li> Took dark for me.</li>
            <li> The color is just right for me; I&#x27;m a dirty blond.</li>
            <li> It is a really dark, slightly greyed out chocolate brown.  </li>
            <li> That said, I haven&#x27;t tried the black one in years so they might have improved the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They always carry black.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one drawback is that sometimes it tends to get a little blurry during the day and sometimes I&#x27;ll have a little bit of brown goop in the corner of my eye.</li>
            <li> This review is for the color &amp;#34;earthen rock brown&amp;#34; - I tried one of the several black versions years ago and didn&#x27;t like it nearly as much (poor color payoff, flaking, etc.).  </li>
            <li> If only they knew my secret was just in a little gold</li>
            <li> The matte gold is classy looking without being cheesy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little clumsy with liquid liners, but had no issues with this one.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> Black liners are harsh and fake looking.</li>
            <li> The liner lasts  for at least 5 or six hours before needing to touch up.  </li>
            <li> Stores usually don&#x27;t have this color tho, so I had to order online!</li>
            <li> I like how you can control how thin or thick the line is.</li>
            <li> Thin or thick - no problem.  </li>
            <li> Non irritating.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Long lasting. Goes On smooth. No flaking. This is my first liquid eyeliner so I can&#x27;t really compare to a different one. But I like it so far.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is easy to apply, but I wish it was water proof.  It can smudge so you may need to remove some of it that goes on your crease, but for the price, I like it.</li>
            <li> Thos is a product I have a hard time finding in stores, but am able to find at Amazon. I like how easy this eyeliner is to apply. It is fast drying and long wearing. I like the color.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite eyeliner, hands down.  I get about 10 hours of good solid wear from this if I use an eyeshadow base first.  The felt tip is VERY easy to control, so I make very few mistakes.  It&#x27;s easy to control the line to make it thick or thin, depending on the look you want.  I swear by it!</li>
            <li> I find using the felt tip rather than a brush tip is much easier and neater.  The color is good, not too stark against my pale skin and light eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner. Stores usually don&#x27;t have this color tho, so I had to order online! It stays on all day but washes off easily.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner I have ever tried! And believe me I have tried a ton of different brands and styles, but nothing compares to this one! I love how smooth it goes on and it comes off just as easy!  I like how you can control how thin or thick the line is. Simply an amazing product!</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner I have used. I use Loreal products only because I am sensitive to chemicals and this brand hasn&#x27;t caused problems so far. This type of liner works so much better than pencils.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the quality of this product.  I chose &amp;#34;Earthen Rock Brown&amp;#34; and am pleased with the color which is dark and defining and a sensible replacement for my black eyeliner as I am moving towards a more natural look.  It goes on smoothly and easily and I&#x27;m no make-up pro.  The tip is fine and you can apply the thinnest line or build up to the thickness you like.  I&#x27;m really happy with it and I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I used this eyeliner several years ago, loved it and now I wonder why I ever tried to use any other kind of eyeliner. The applicator makes it easy to make any kind of line that you want from thick to thin, the liquid formula goes on smoothly with no pulling. The pigment is saturated, the color looks natural on my brown eyes with dark brown hair. It dries quickly so there&#x27;s no smudging and it lasts all day. I get a couple of those sample subscriptions and they send me eyeliners pretty frequently- I&#x27;ve never come across one as good as this. Now that I&#x27;ve come back to it, I&#x27;ll never leave it again.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.  It is so easy to apply. No other eyeliner I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried plenty) is so easy to control and to get the size line you want.  Thin or thick - no problem.  The liner lasts  for at least 5 or six hours before needing to touch up.  I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love this product.  My only problem is finding it in my shade so, I was glad to find that Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> Love this liner.  Stays in place, Great applicator. Easy to apply. Started using after some cosmetic surgery an have received numerous compliments.</li>
            <li> I prefer liquid eyeliners to pencil but many liquid liners have a thick tip. The tip on this eyeliner is very fine. It is easy to control and get a narrow line, which I like. I am sure you can widen it, too. The Earthen Rock color is a dark brown, matches my eyelashes, and I like it much better than black. After I received the first one, I ordered two more--one for my gym bag and one for my travel kit. I could not find the same thing in my local stores, thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t repeat purchase. Not satisfied with product. Underwhelming in performance &amp; color. Doesn&#x27;t last long in wear.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, easy application. I&#x27;m a little clumsy with liquid liners, but had no issues with this one. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup novice. I didn&#x27;t start wearing mascara until after my first year of college. As far as I was concerned, there was no way I was ever going to be able to do eyeliner and make it look good. Then I decided to try liquid liner and this was my first choice. Five years later, I&#x27;m using this product every day. More than one person has told me that my eyeliner is always flawless. If only they knew my secret was just in a little gold tube!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly, helping you determine whether you want a thin line or a thick one. Cat eyes are easy with this liner. It&#x27;s like writing with a marker for the most part. I rarely have to go back and try to reapply because it didn&#x27;t go on as thick as I want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one drawback is that sometimes it tends to get a little blurry during the day and sometimes I&#x27;ll have a little bit of brown goop in the corner of my eye. It also looks like there is more in it than there really is because of the size, but it still lasts for months. If you want to have beautifully lined eyes, try this product... even if you were makeup illiterate like I was not too long ago.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.  I was a makeup artist for years, and this was ALWAYS in my kit.  Sure, I could have used a more expensive liquid liner, but honestly this one was so good I never saw the need.  I also use this on myself every day - a small cat-eye and a bold lip are my go-to look - so I have literally years of experience with this baby.  NOTE: This review is for the color &amp;#34;earthen rock brown&amp;#34; - I tried one of the several black versions years ago and didn&#x27;t like it nearly as much (poor color payoff, flaking, etc.).  That said, I haven&#x27;t tried the black one in years so they might have improved the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do I love it?  First of all, the applicator is great.  It&#x27;s a longer, flexible felt tip that makes getting a thin line really easy.  It also can be built up to be thicker, and is easy to get right at the base of your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the formula/color.  I wear this in the color &amp;#34;Earthen Rock Brown,&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s perfect.  It is a really dark, slightly greyed out chocolate brown.  Not too warm and red, but not as cool and harsh as a black or grey would be.  As a rather pale complected person with dark hair, black can be a little harsh looking on me, especially with a red lip.  This is dark enough that most people are going to assume it&#x27;s black, but it&#x27;s most definitely brown - it is lighter and warmer, and much more flattering on my pale skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third - the packaging.  It&#x27;s easy to hold, and looks nice.  The matte gold is classy looking without being cheesy.  Does it feel like a fifty dollar eyeliner from YSL?  No.  But it&#x27;s not cheap feeling at all - it&#x27;s not a fluorescent color, it doesn&#x27;t have branding slathered all over it, and the packaging is nice and air-tight so you won&#x27;t have dried out liner or spillage all over your bag.  I should note that I am super particular about replacing this, along with my mascara, every three months, so it may dry out over longer periods than that...I wouldn&#x27;t know.  Oh!  Bonus for subscribe and save because I just have Amazon deliver it every three months - when a new one shows up at my door, it&#x27;s time to replace!  Yay for auto-piloting :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth - the wear time.  This liner doesn&#x27;t flake, and it doesn&#x27;t smudge on me.  I have really small, really oily Asian eyelids.  EVERYTHING smudges on me because when I smile my top lid disappears (and I smile alot).  Also, my eyes water fairly often, and this stays put.  Now, if I cry or something, and then wipe my eyes, this is going to move - it&#x27;s not marketed as waterproof, and it&#x27;s not.  But it really does wear like iron for me on a typical day, and it&#x27;s easy to remove with eye-makeup remover at the end of the day without having to rub my eyes raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it&#x27;s my holy grail of eyeliners - easy to draw whatever liner shape I want, flattering color, inexpensive, wears well, and easy to remove, all in a classy, simple, airtight package.  If they ever discontinue this I will cry (but hey, at least I know my liner will stay put as long as I don&#x27;t wipe, right?).</li>
            <li> I wish it came in brown.  It&#x27;s everything you&#x27;d want in a great liner.  I gave it to my daughter, tho.  Took dark for me.</li>
            <li> Easiest tip to use to frame eyes. Non irritating. I just wish the same tip came with a waterproof liner. However, the tip would probably not hold up well with a different liquid so this does ok:)  I love the browns available, but seem much harder to find.</li>
            <li> Finally found what I was looking for. Love this eyeliner. Can never find this color in store anymore. They always carry black.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many eyeliners.......some much more expensive.  This goes on easily and cleanly.  It&#x27;s great.  That&#x27;s the whole story. S.F.</li>
            <li> This is the only smudge proof liner I&#x27;ve found.  Lasts all day &amp; each tube lasts around 2 months.</li>
            <li> The only eyeliner I buy.  The viscosity is perfect for smooth,  consistent application. The color is just right for me; I&#x27;m a dirty blond. Black liners are harsh and fake looking. This color is natural looking and enhances my blue eyes.</li>
