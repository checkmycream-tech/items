            <li>I love multifunctional products in bulk!</li>
            <li>I collect oils and formulate my own serums.</li>
            <li>you can mix it in with face creams or use on its own.</li>
            <li>I struggle with hormonal acne and read that a lot of people use primrose oil to keep their skin looking nice.</li>
            <li>Just right - fresh, unspoiled, and perfect for the recipe it is included in.</li>
            <li>As before, I was totally satisfied with the immediate results of Dr. Adorables product.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product and service.</li>

            <li>His skin looks better.</li>
            <li>I love the oil, but found the scent bothered me a bit...</li>
            <li>But I love to add it to stuff for friends and family.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use  :)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the product, but not the packaging.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this bottle by Dr. Adorable.</li>
            <li>you if you do have oil-prone skin you may want to research skin types and evening primrose oil to be sure it won&#x27;t over-moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used many types of lotions and oils, but this allows for no friction and doesn&#x27;t need to be reapplied over and over again.</li>
            <li>Many women have heard of or used evening primrose oil, as it is anecdotally famous for alleviating PMS and menopause symptoms, though most clinical trials have shown no scientific evidence of this.</li>
            <li>I love the way this oil feels on my skin and will purchase this again.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try a new oil and am so happy I tried evening primrose oil.</li>
            <li>love it, light and dissolvable...</li>
            <li>This primrose oil is clean and silky and I love how it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li>NO  super nice smell for this oil -there is no smell at all!!!</li>
            <li>I have not tried to use this when making capsules but have read that it would be a fine addition to that as well.</li>
            <li>But the bottle is cheap, flimsy and prone to leak.  </li>
            <li>, they showed attentive and courteous care during the delivery process that I appreciated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered many times and probably will continue to use this company because I like the quality of the oil, but would really appreciate a better bottle.</li>
            <li>Oil is like massage oil, after first application skin was noticable more hydrated</li>
            <li>I was excited about using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and my skin is so nice and soft by morning.  </li>
            <li>I ordered Evening Primrose and Sweet Almond Oil.</li>
            <li>I did some research and Sweet Almond and</li>
            <li>It  does wonders to keep my hair and skin nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>Both of these have anti-inflammatory properties and are quickly and easily absorbed into the skin, so your face does not feel or look oily or shiny.</li>
            <li>I bought this to make my own oil blend facial oil.</li>
            <li>But if i were you I&#x27;d get the gel capsules because they stay fresh.</li>
            <li>With this oil it has to be fresh to work.</li>
            <li>This bottle didn&#x27;t keep it fresh</li>
            <li>Its not the oil or the seller its just having it in any bottle like this won&#x27;t keep it fresh.</li>
            <li>Early Native Americans recognized and utilized the healing properties of the plant for many ailments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For those people who say it doesn&#x27;t smell right because it doesn&#x27;t smell like roses  - please do your research first.  </li>
            <li>have used Evening Primrose before and am well aware of its benefits for my acneic skin.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more from Dr. Adorable.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I used to use Eucerin cream for that, and I thought that was the only thing I&#x27;d ever be able to use on my neck.</li>
            <li>I love that this is a local seller.</li>
            <li>I use on my face after hot towels</li>
            <li>It has been said to also be an effective treatment for psoriasis, eczema, and arthritis, among other things.</li>
            <li>If you already use a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; facial moisturizer, you can easily just add a couple drops of evening primrose oil and mix it in your palm.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, and it seems to be regulating the oil production in my very oily skin.</li>
            <li>It soothes hormone balance and really benefits women.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t naturally very oily, though, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very affordable for the amount you get, not to mention high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After finally receiving my product, through no fault of Dr. Adorable (they shipped same day but the USPS caused delivery delay)</li>
            <li>besides hemp and high linoleic acid safflower.</li>
            <li>Oils high in linoleic acid are beneficial for oily and acneic skin....</li>
            <li>I have ordered Dr. Adorable products in the past and this measures up with the rest.  </li>
            <li>Not sure why there are so many 5 star reviews??</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a slightly greasy oil (all primrose oil is) and doesn&#x27;t soak into my skin super fast, but it hasn&#x27;t irritated my face at all.</li>
            <li>Your skin produces sebum and oil in an attempt to moisturize itself and correct imbalances, so using oil as a moisturizer tells your skin that it is already hydrated and doesn&#x27;t need to produce any more oil, thus your skin actually becomes less oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Natural stuff</li>
            <li>Both look like vegetable oil and are completely odorless.</li>
            <li>So far I have been using this oil on my problem areas (chin/jawline and nose)</li>
            <li>also sensitive skin with inflammation.</li>
            <li>Friction and further application is really distracting when you are in labor.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll know when it&#x27;s not fresh because primrose oil has a particular smell and it won&#x27;t smell like anything really after the freshness is gone.</li>
            <li>The skin there is extremely dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li>Not only does it absorb right away and not feel greasy but just a small teaspoon taken internally gives you your daily dose of GLA.</li>

            <li> In the mornings, I use it by washing my face, patting it dry, then taking a cotton ball with a few drops of primrose oil on it and gently rubbing it into my skin.</li>
            <li> so I did not apply anything else to see how long it would last.</li>
            <li> weird as it may sound if you are not familiar with the idea, using oil as a moisturizer works very well for dry, oily, acne-prone skin, or any type of skin for that matter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nowadays people like to focus on the importance of the almighty omega-3 fatty acids, but oft-forgotten are omega-6 fatty acids, which are what evening primrose oil provides as a natural highly concentrated source of GLA (gamma-linolenic acid).</li>
            <li> These essential fatty acids are required, but are not produced by the human body.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to other expectant mothers, coaches, doulas, masseurs, etc.</li>
            <li> I wanted to cut down on the gel pills due to what I have been reading about the casings in your system.</li>
            <li> Luxurious for your skincare, I use this to make body and face creams with a little bit of organic beeswax and other oils.</li>
            <li> The oil is odorless and tasteless - which exactly how it&#x27;s supposed to be.  </li>
            <li> I live in an area where it is cold and dry and have also been using it as a moisturizer at night.</li>
            <li> not too oily, soaks in within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> My son suffers from acne, I mix  1tsp of Organic Evening Primrose Oil in his smothie made of wheat germ, sunflower lecitin powder and juice.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing...</li>
    </ol>

            <li> A delightful oil for the skin with prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my own oil blend facial oil. This is a good quality organic oil. I would order again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself as I regularly take evening primrose pills. I wanted to cut down on the gel pills due to what I have been reading about the casings in your system. I rub this on my neck nightly after a shower.  It has worked wonders on my teenaged daughters acne. She uses this nightly to cleanse her face. Natural stuff and it is working wonders!</li>
            <li> Just right - fresh, unspoiled, and perfect for the recipe it is included in.</li>
            <li> love it, light and dissolvable...I use it on face and body!</li>
            <li> I have ordered Dr. Adorable products in the past and this measures up with the rest.  This primrose oil is clean and silky and I love how it feels on my skin.  Great price for a great product.  Packaging was intact and no leaking.</li>
            <li> Oil is like massage oil, after first application skin was noticable more hydrated so I did not apply anything else to see how long it would last. I do not use lotions or oils on any type of regular basis cause I don&#x27;t like the oily feel but with this that feel went away after an hour or so and skin kept hydrated for a day.</li>
            <li> After finally receiving my product, through no fault of Dr. Adorable (they shipped same day but the USPS caused delivery delay) I was excited about using it.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Evening Primrose before and am well aware of its benefits for my acneic skin.

I will definitely be ordering more from Dr. Adorable.&lt;br /&gt;Also, they showed attentive and courteous care during the delivery process that I appreciated. Thanks for the great product and service. Five star service for me.....could not ask for more!</li>
            <li> best evening primrose oil brand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using evening primrose oil for oil cleansing my face, and as a moisturizer afterward. It&#x27;s great. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, and it seems to be regulating the oil production in my very oily skin. It fades skin discoloration/dark spots left by pimples too. I also use it to moisturize my neck daily. The skin there is extremely dry and sensitive. I used to use Eucerin cream for that, and I thought that was the only thing I&#x27;d ever be able to use on my neck. But evening primrose oil works beautifully. I haven&#x27;t touched my jar of Eucerin cream since the beginning of January. This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the acne again. Great product, I will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li> I use it on my skin as a moisturizer and anti-inflammotory for acne, after bath it is great as well. NO  super nice smell for this oil -there is no smell at all!!!</li>
            <li> I love this....put it on my face before I go to bed and my skin is so nice and soft by morning.  I have even worn it during the day under my makeup....love it</li>
            <li> Love this oil. It is excellent for eliminating wrinkles. I have actually seen my eye winkles virtually disappear!</li>
            <li> Ugh! Very disappointing...I ordered Evening Primrose and Sweet Almond Oil. Both look like vegetable oil and are completely odorless. I did some research and Sweet Almond and Evening Primrose are supposed to have a scent. Not sure why there are so many 5 star reviews?? I DO NOT recommend buying this oil at all. Spend the extra and get good quality!!</li>
            <li> great benefits for your skin. not too oily, soaks in within a few minutes. you can mix it in with face creams or use on its own. doesn&#x27;t smell</li>
            <li> My son suffers from acne, I mix  1tsp of Organic Evening Primrose Oil in his smothie made of wheat germ, sunflower lecitin powder and juice. His skin looks better.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Excellent remedy for any and all skin issues.</li>
            <li> I love the oil, but found the scent bothered me a bit... but I have asthema and allergies... so I may not be a great judge.  But I love to add it to stuff for friends and family.</li>
            <li> There is no scent to this at all, something tells me it has vegetable oil in it!!!</li>
            <li> Nice! I love that this is a local seller. They do give you a lot for the price. Primrose oil has a ton of benefits! I use it to apply to my skin for TLC and also especially during period-pre period time. It soothes hormone balance and really benefits women.</li>
            <li> I use this oil in combination of Vitamin E and Olive Oil for wrinkles under my eyes. I have seen an improvement. I am going to assume it works. I will continue to use  :)</li>
            <li> Primrose oil is god for just about everything on the body. Just a dab will do ti. No frills, no odor.</li>
            <li> Very good oil. I use on my face after hot towels</li>
            <li> I love it. I mix this oil and caster and coconut oil as eye serum and it works great for me.</li>
            <li> came on time and am so happy to have it</li>
            <li> Good for spot treatment for acne and good for hormones. But if i were you I&#x27;d get the gel capsules because they stay fresh. With this oil it has to be fresh to work. This bottle didn&#x27;t keep it fresh it turned into some regular oil after a while. Its not the oil or the seller its just having it in any bottle like this won&#x27;t keep it fresh. Get the oil capsules from like Wal-Mart they&#x27;re like $5. And just poke a hole and squeeze out and pat where needed. You&#x27;ll know when it&#x27;s not fresh because primrose oil has a particular smell and it won&#x27;t smell like anything really after the freshness is gone.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but not the packaging.  The oil is most important, it&#x27;s very good quality organic oil, sourced in the US, not China, and is very effective.  But the bottle is cheap, flimsy and prone to leak.  I had no results from taking the oil in gelcaps, but I have excellent results from take a spoonful or two a day.  It  does wonders to keep my hair and skin nice and soft.  For those people who say it doesn&#x27;t smell right because it doesn&#x27;t smell like roses  - please do your research first.  Evening primrose oil is not supposed to smell like roses - it has nothing to do with roses.  The oil is odorless and tasteless - which exactly how it&#x27;s supposed to be.  I&#x27;ve ordered many times and probably will continue to use this company because I like the quality of the oil, but would really appreciate a better bottle.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this oil.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> I struggle with hormonal acne and read that a lot of people use primrose oil to keep their skin looking nice. So far I have been using this oil on my problem areas (chin/jawline and nose) and I can already see an improvement. In the mornings, I use it by washing my face, patting it dry, then taking a cotton ball with a few drops of primrose oil on it and gently rubbing it into my skin. I then wipe it off. I live in an area where it is cold and dry and have also been using it as a moisturizer at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with hormone acne during my pregnancy and no face-washing regime would solve the root of my issues. Evening Primrose Oil does just that - it helps tackle hormone imbalance and instantly cleared up my skin. I also started taking it in capsule form, so that may have contributed as well. I LOVE this bottle by Dr. Adorable. It&#x27;s very affordable for the amount you get, not to mention high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face-washing regime: Wash initial face with &amp;#34;Yes to Cucumber&amp;#34;. Scrub face with &amp;#34;Olay Regenerist Daily Thermal Mini-Peel&amp;#34;. Apply Evening Primrose Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a slightly greasy oil (all primrose oil is) and doesn&#x27;t soak into my skin super fast, but it hasn&#x27;t irritated my face at all. My skin isn&#x27;t naturally very oily, though, so you if you do have oil-prone skin you may want to research skin types and evening primrose oil to be sure it won&#x27;t over-moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this often!</li>
            <li> The bottle I received doesn&#x27;t look anything like the advertisement. Also the label stated only 9% of primrose oil and it don&#x27;t have any smell. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> Luxurious for your skincare, I use this to make body and face creams with a little bit of organic beeswax and other oils. Very nice product. Primrose is known to help with some hormone balancing so there are benefits to using this as a moisturizer in skin care.</li>
            <li> Thank you, everything was excellent!</li>
            <li> I was terrified of using another oil on my skin....besides hemp and high linoleic acid safflower. Oils high in linoleic acid are beneficial for oily and acneic skin....also sensitive skin with inflammation. I wanted to try a new oil and am so happy I tried evening primrose oil. Not only does it absorb right away and not feel greasy but just a small teaspoon taken internally gives you your daily dose of GLA. I love multifunctional products in bulk!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but I prefer for it to come in glass.</li>
            <li> We have used this brand for the last two pregnancies and labor and deliveries as a massage oil. We&#x27;ve used many types of lotions and oils, but this allows for no friction and doesn&#x27;t need to be reapplied over and over again. Friction and further application is really distracting when you are in labor. I would recommend this to other expectant mothers, coaches, doulas, masseurs, etc.</li>
            <li> Evening primrose oil (EPO for short) does not get the attention it rightfully deserves. Many women have heard of or used evening primrose oil, as it is anecdotally famous for alleviating PMS and menopause symptoms, though most clinical trials have shown no scientific evidence of this. Evening primrose oil, as it sounds, is the oil that comes from the seed of the evening primrose plant, which is native to Europe and North America. It has been said to also be an effective treatment for psoriasis, eczema, and arthritis, among other things. Early Native Americans recognized and utilized the healing properties of the plant for many ailments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nowadays people like to focus on the importance of the almighty omega-3 fatty acids, but oft-forgotten are omega-6 fatty acids, which are what evening primrose oil provides as a natural highly concentrated source of GLA (gamma-linolenic acid). These essential fatty acids are required, but are not produced by the human body. Moreover, evening primrose oil is anti-inflammatory in nature. This makes EPO a great acne treatment. Evening primrose oil can be taken orally in gel capsule form or applied topically as a moisturizing oil, and there are no known adverse side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As weird as it may sound if you are not familiar with the idea, using oil as a moisturizer works very well for dry, oily, acne-prone skin, or any type of skin for that matter. Your skin produces sebum and oil in an attempt to moisturize itself and correct imbalances, so using oil as a moisturizer tells your skin that it is already hydrated and doesn&#x27;t need to produce any more oil, thus your skin actually becomes less oily throughout the day. I like to use 2 drops of evening primrose oil combined with 2 drops of almond oil topically as a morning moisturizer. Both of these have anti-inflammatory properties and are quickly and easily absorbed into the skin, so your face does not feel or look oily or shiny. At night before bed, I do the same thing combined with an additional 2 drops of tea tree oil and 2 drops of sea buckthorn oil. If you already use a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; facial moisturizer, you can easily just add a couple drops of evening primrose oil and mix it in your palm.</li>
            <li> I use this for mixing different essential oil blends for specific issues.  I love the way this oil feels on my skin and will purchase this again.  I have not tried to use this when making capsules but have read that it would be a fine addition to that as well.</li>
