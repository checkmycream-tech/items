            <li>and it smells nice</li>
            <li>it is a rich lotion that makes your skin feel so amazing!</li>

            <li>If you like very light scents this is for you.  </li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite body cream.</li>
            <li>Was expecting it to have more scent.  </li>
            <li>I took a sniff, and I couldn&#x27;t believe it - the scent is almost identical to Laura Mercier&#x27;s, with a bit more sweetness.  </li>
            <li>Do I ever LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this lotion.</li>
            <li>and you want others to love the smell of you</li>
            <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve bought 2 more.  </li>
            <li>Love it but never bought it.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy it!</li>
            <li>my wife love it</li>
            <li>When I first put the lotion on I can smell the warm, amazing smell</li>
            <li>this is ridiculously amazingly beautiful, leaves your skin baby soft, and the scent lasts all day long, i&#x27;ve never received so many compliments or inquiries as to what i&#x27;m wearing EVERY time i&#x27;m wearing this, it will DEF be on my registry&lt;br /&gt;the best scent, texture ever,</li>
            <li>wonderful scents lasts a long time</li>
            <li>We were at lunch the other day and the girl who seated us told her how wonderful her fragrance was.</li>
            <li>The scent is incredible, and it&#x27;s not marred by an over-sweetness like many other lotions.  </li>
            <li>Laura Mercier Almond Coconut creme is hands down the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>Its texture is so smooth and non greasy.</li>
            <li>It goes on light but is anything</li>
            <li>I would definitely say that the almond is most prevalent, and the undertones of coconut makes me think of the summer and the ocean, and that always puts me in a good mood.  </li>
            <li>Is exactly what her senses enjoy the most.</li>
            <li>I use this lotion on special occasion and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I save it for special occasions.  </li>
            <li>My absolute favorite lotion of all time.</li>
            <li>I love her products and would highly recommend this product as well.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and is long lasting-</li>
            <li>At first, I thought this lotion was too sweet but</li>
            <li>Beside being an excellent body creme, It makes me feel &amp; smell pretty, but still soft, not overwhelming !</li>
            <li>My first jar lasted forever.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is sweet, but not too sweet and lasts through the entire day.</li>
            <li>but it actually absorbs very quickly into your skin.  </li>
            <li>expensive but very good</li>
            <li>I will marry this stuff real soon.</li>
            <li>my coconut scent addiction is real.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>much as I love this cream, I don&#x27;t use it every day, due to the cost.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I do prefer Laura Mercier&#x27;s cream, but for less than half the price, Bella Il Fiore is a great alternative.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>and then it quickly goes away; HOWEVER, everyone else around me can smell it all day long!</li>
            <li>As an added bonus, the glass jar is pretty enough to leave out on my bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this lotion to everyone, especially this scent.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this stuff and all you have to do is use very little and the smell will carry a long way.</li>
            <li>Oddly, I never cared for the taste or smell of actual almonds or coconuts, but for some reason, this combination in a cream works for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick, rich, and absorbs well, without any greasiness.  </li>
            <li>Super thick</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a wonderful product. Have given as a gift and the person was very happy.</li>
            <li> My favorite body cream. It smells yummy. People always ask what I&#x27;m wearing. I don&#x27;t have to wear perfume because the smell is so nice.</li>
            <li> Was expecting it to have more scent.  If you like very light scents this is for you.  Nice and creamy though.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite lotion of all time. Highly recommend this lotion to everyone, especially this scent.</li>

Oddly, I never cared for the taste or smell of actual almonds or coconuts, but for some reason, this combination in a cream works for me.

I would definitely say that the almond is most prevalent, and the undertones of coconut makes me think of the summer and the ocean, and that always puts me in a good mood.  As an added bonus, the glass jar is pretty enough to leave out on my bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I love this cream, I don&#x27;t use it every day, due to the cost.  I save it for special occasions.  A couple of years ago, I found [[ASIN:B004LT3NHS Bella Il Fiore Happily Ever After Whipped Body Creme, Almond Coconut, 12 Ounce]] in a local shop.  I took a sniff, and I couldn&#x27;t believe it - the scent is almost identical to Laura Mercier&#x27;s, with a bit more sweetness.  (I&#x27;ve got both jars open in front of me as I write this review.)  I now have both products in my lotion rotation.  I do prefer Laura Mercier&#x27;s cream, but for less than half the price, Bella Il Fiore is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! It is a bit pricey but a little goes a long way. Its texture is so smooth and non greasy. The fragrance is sweet, but not too sweet and lasts through the entire day. I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments on this fragrance. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Man O Man!! Do I ever LOVE this stuff. I will marry this stuff real soon. Shout out to Laura for making such a thing. When I wear this you can believe that I get compliments from total strangers telling me that I smell like a beachy coconut ocean or something. I am in love with this stuff and all you have to do is use very little and the smell will carry a long way.</li>
            <li> this is ridiculously amazingly beautiful, leaves your skin baby soft, and the scent lasts all day long, i&#x27;ve never received so many compliments or inquiries as to what i&#x27;m wearing EVERY time i&#x27;m wearing this, it will DEF be on my registry&lt;br /&gt;the best scent, texture ever, my coconut scent addiction is real. i&#x27;ve ran out and will be ordering sooon&lt;br /&gt;100 STARS LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it. I&#x27;m on my second purchase. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and a little goes a long way.  My first jar lasted forever.</li>
            <li> Laura Mercier products register with my wife every time. she loves the company&#x27;s quality and the arouma Is exactly what her senses enjoy the most. Will continue to purchase these items.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion. It goes on light but is anything but...it is a rich lotion that makes your skin feel so amazing! When I first put the lotion on I can smell the warm, amazing smell and then it quickly goes away; HOWEVER, everyone else around me can smell it all day long! I get so many compliments and have had to bring in samples for co-workers or friends because they say that every time I walk by it just smells so good. If you have to smell something all day this may not be for you but if you like to have great glowing, smooth, healthy, sexy, skin and you want others to love the smell of you, this is 100% the item for you!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with the fragrance! Beautiful.....subtle....skins feels great afterward. I love her products and would highly recommend this product as well.</li>
            <li> Beside being an excellent body creme, It makes me feel &amp; smell pretty, but still soft, not overwhelming ! My 1st jar of Laura Merier, was given to me as a gift. Since then, I&#x27;ve bought 2 more.  LOVE IT !</li>
            <li> At first, I thought this lotion was too sweet but honestly, this product is amazing.  It&#x27;s seemingly thick but it actually absorbs very quickly into your skin.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing.  The scent also lasts along time.  I&#x27;m not kidding when I say that I&#x27;ll shower and I still feel like the scent is with me, in a good way.  I use this lotion on special occasion and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Love it but never bought it.</li>
            <li> My daughter-in- law and I both are addicted to this cream. She is a nurse and her patients always tell her how nice she smells.&lt;br /&gt;It is moisturizing as well. We were at lunch the other day and the girl who seated us told her how wonderful her fragrance was. She looked at me and said \\&quot;See what I mean?!\\&quot;. Enough said.</li>
            <li> For a number of years I enjoyed Laura Mercier&#x27;s Clementine Body Cream and was sad when I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore. But I finally settled on the Almond Coconut and I really enjoy it! Smell&#x27;s great, feels good too! And the price has not changed for a number of years, so I&#x27;m happy about that!</li>
            <li> wonderful scents lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and is long lasting- Super thick and you can tell its a quality cream.</li>
            <li> my wife love it and she use it occasunaly and it smells nice</li>
            <li> expensive but very good</li>
            <li> a touch of heaven.......</li>
