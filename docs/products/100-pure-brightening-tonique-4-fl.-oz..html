            <li>I always conclude when it comes to this whole brightening series from 100% Pure, it works (sticking to brightening purpose over the time), just need a bit add-on stuff such as serum to make it perfectly work on my skin to be clean, softened and moistened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I have tried many high dollar products on the market, and none of them have worked.</li>
            <li>And since becoming a nursing mother, I have phased out products with hormone disrupters and known carcinogens, because I want to prevent as much exposure to my child.&lt;br</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!!!</li>
            <li>It is soothing and helps calm my skin.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this line with amazingly natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I use this with Dr. Haushka&#x27;s Translucent Bronze Concentrate for a fresh, youthful summery, dewy glow.  </li>
            <li>I love how everything is natural too.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>It smells good, tingles a little bit, but doesn&#x27;t burn, and it cleans well.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would be a bit more moisturizing as a tonique, but it is actually a bit drying.</li>
            <li>This is able to add an extra step to cleansing without feeling like my skin is being stripped.</li>
            <li>After my makeup is on (all natural), I put a light mist of this over my face and it sets it and gives me a very dewy glow.  </li>
            <li>The quality is superb - love that there&#x27;s nothing harsh or artificial and contains all natural fruits acids, aloe, rose water and hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li>I was first introduced to 100% Pure by my aunt</li>
            <li>I should note I have very stubborn hormonal acne and very oily skin, like baby oil greasy skin!</li>
            <li>Pure&#x27;s Brightening series I have written as I use whole</li>
            <li>it is very temporary.  </li>
            <li>I like this product because it really refreshes my skin.</li>
            <li>It really does seem to brighten.</li>
            <li>It does  brightens as advertised (whole series works )&lt;</li>
            <li>I expected more so,</li>
            <li>A cotton ball just soaks up the product and doesn&#x27;t get much on my skin..  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for brightening I would say there are other products on the market that will give a more \\&quot;permanent\\&quot; effect.</li>
            <li>Not harsh but very gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nothing spectacular, yet so far I haven&#x27;t found yet products for strictly brightening purpose that don&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals &amp; any alcohol (some alcohol is not helping my rosacea)for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>highly recommend the Skin Brightening Tonique and feel that it has enhanced the over condition and appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>Pure Nourishing Facial Oil and add the 100% Pure Jasmine Green Tea Moisturizer, a very rich cream, to hydrate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t appreciate any product that doesn&#x27;t live up to its claim.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact opposite of drying, as there are no drying ingredients in it.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong or harsh on skin, but leaves face feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>Despite my diligence in upkeep and frequent facials, I needed something to help cleanse my skin after my daily exfoliation, and because of the positive reviews, I decided to give this toner</li>
            <li>I used to use an astringent with witch hazel and alcohol, which was nice, but I think it dried out my skin a little too much.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for an all natural product then you might want to try this one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and has tremendously helped my pores and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li>This product is crazy amazing!</li>
            <li>The reason above it may not work for dry skin (I have very oily T-zone and normal everywhere  &#x3D;</li>
            <li>I have tired so many and nothing compares to this</li>

            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry and acne-prone skin and am in my mid 30s.</li>
            <li> I mentioned earlier, I have dry skin</li>
            <li> However, I have used it regularly for a while now, and I see absolutely no brightening effect whatsoever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a little disappointed upon opening the product, as a good deal had leaked out, but I will definitely be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> they had one specifically for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I have had health issues for the last few years, which have caused hormonal imbalances with my skin and its overall appearance.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is intense without being irritating like Clinique.</li>
            <li> See other my reviews about 100%</li>
            <li> I have seen no difference while using this product and even noticed a few blemishes.</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this brand here on Amazon and decided to try a few of their products.</li>
            <li> I put this tonic into a misting bottle and keep it in my purse, as it is hard to get out of the bottle and dribbles out.  </li>
            <li> Product 5 stars, packaging 3.  Lots of wasteful packaging, pretty glass bottle but horrible seal</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this one.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like it . It refreshes you and althoug it feels like you only apply watr on your face it does actually do something. Not harsh but very gentle to the skin. Leave it feeling smooth. Im sure that over time it can fade acne scars.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to 100% Pure by my aunt and I have fallen in love. And since becoming a nursing mother, I have phased out products with hormone disrupters and known carcinogens, because I want to prevent as much exposure to my child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry and acne-prone skin and am in my mid 30s. Despite my diligence in upkeep and frequent facials, I needed something to help cleanse my skin after my daily exfoliation, and because of the positive reviews, I decided to give this toner a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What strikes you first is that it smells very pleasant and isn&#x27;t astringent or strong at all. It smooths into the skin very nicely and leaves my face feeling clean. It does a great job of getting additional dirt and grime off of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I mentioned earlier, I have dry skin so I use 100% Pure Nourishing Facial Oil and add the 100% Pure Jasmine Green Tea Moisturizer, a very rich cream, to hydrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Skin Brightening Tonique and feel that it has enhanced the over condition and appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> Refreshing. That&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this one. Doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an all natural product then you might want to try this one.  It does brighten up the skin HOWEVER it does not last it is very temporary.  It smells nice so if you are buying it for its toning qualities go for it.  If you are looking for brightening I would say there are other products on the market that will give a more \\&quot;permanent\\&quot; effect.</li>
            <li> Does nothing for the skin. Total waste of money in my opinion. I have seen no difference while using this product and even noticed a few blemishes.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite toner! I have tired so many and nothing compares to this, others toners would break me out or were too drying, this seems to hydrate my skin while giving me a clearer more even toned complexion. I should note I have very stubborn hormonal acne and very oily skin, like baby oil greasy skin! Yikes!!! so if I say something works, IT WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product because it really refreshes my skin. However I did not notice much &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34;, but the scent is very nice</li>
            <li> I LOVE this line with amazingly natural ingredients.  I would give them 5 stars but i think their price point could be better.</li>
            <li> It really does seem to brighten. I saw a difference the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be a bit more moisturizing as a tonique, but it is actually a bit drying. This would be great in the warm weather months, but during the winter, I don&#x27;t use it due to the drying effect. I need my moisture!&lt;br /&gt;Wish they had one specifically for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;But otherwise, it smells very faintly wonderful, refreshing to use.</li>
            <li> See other my reviews about 100% Pure&#x27;s Brightening series I have written as I use whole series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It does  brightens as advertised (whole series works )&lt;br /&gt;- Good sent&lt;br /&gt;- Since it&#x27;s lemony (Lemon peel extract is part of the ingredients), feels like very refreshing&lt;br /&gt;- It does tightens pores (in the ingredients)at some level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- To wipe off residue from the wash is great, but gets a bit dry-ish&lt;br /&gt;(make sure to moisturize after that)&lt;br /&gt;- The reason above it may not work for dry skin (I have very oily T-zone and normal everywhere  &#x3D; combination skin with a mild rosacea).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I always conclude when it comes to this whole brightening series from 100% Pure, it works (sticking to brightening purpose over the time), just need a bit add-on stuff such as serum to make it perfectly work on my skin to be clean, softened and moistened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing spectacular, yet so far I haven&#x27;t found yet products for strictly brightening purpose that don&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals &amp; any alcohol (some alcohol is not helping my rosacea)for a reasonable price.</li>

            <li> This product was okay. I expected more so, It was not bad, not good. ok product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a little too early for me to tell if it works, but the smell, feeling, ingredients are all excellent and I will buy more of this product line. I&#x27;m glad the bottle contains so much of the tonique.</li>
            <li> Product 5 stars, packaging 3.  Lots of wasteful packaging, pretty glass bottle but horrible seal and it leaks.  I put this tonic into a misting bottle and keep it in my purse, as it is hard to get out of the bottle and dribbles out.  A cotton ball just soaks up the product and doesn&#x27;t get much on my skin..  After my makeup is on (all natural), I put a light mist of this over my face and it sets it and gives me a very dewy glow.  I&#x27;m all for that at 46.  The quality is superb - love that there&#x27;s nothing harsh or artificial and contains all natural fruits acids, aloe, rose water and hyaluronic acid.  It does what it says, makes your skin bright and refreshed.  I will definitely repurchase this when it runs out.  I have no idea what the reviewer who said it was drying is talking about.  It&#x27;s the exact opposite of drying, as there are no drying ingredients in it.  I use this with Dr. Haushka&#x27;s Translucent Bronze Concentrate for a fresh, youthful summery, dewy glow.  Love love love.</li>
            <li> This toner is amazing!!! It&#x27;s all natural and has tremendously helped my pores and uneven skin tone. HIGHLY recommend!!! Use it before putting lotion on and it will help spread the lotion and make the skin look awesome!</li>
            <li> I used to use an astringent with witch hazel and alcohol, which was nice, but I think it dried out my skin a little too much. I switched to this and love it. It smells good, tingles a little bit, but doesn&#x27;t burn, and it cleans well. No breakouts. I love how everything is natural too. I love this brand:)</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this brand here on Amazon and decided to try a few of their products. I have had health issues for the last few years, which have caused hormonal imbalances with my skin and its overall appearance. I have tried many high dollar products on the market, and none of them have worked. I saw that this was a vegan product, (I myself am a happy carnivore), and thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl. I&#x27;m so glad I did because this stuff is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little disappointed upon opening the product, as a good deal had leaked out, but I will definitely be ordering it again. I have used this in conjunction with 2 of their other products, and my skin looks great. It has drawn out so many of the impurities, and literally shrunk my pores. I can honestly say this is the best stuff I have ever used for skin care, and I will not be using anything else. I truly recommend this brand!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural. The ingredients are actually very impressive and this was actually what drove me to buy this tonique.  As a toner, it feels really nice. The scent is kinda citrusy, but it&#x27;s mild, so even that is okay.  However, I have used it regularly for a while now, and I see absolutely no brightening effect whatsoever. If they didn&#x27;t claim it will brighten my complexion, I would have given it 4 or even 5 stars. I just don&#x27;t appreciate any product that doesn&#x27;t live up to its claim.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Not too strong or harsh on skin, but leaves face feeling very soft. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is crazy amazing! It is all natural, which is great for your skin becuase it will react positively to it. This contains someone of my favourite skin care ingredients: bearberry, kojic acid, sake, fruit acids, licorice root extract, vitamin c, lemon juice and strawberries! Your skin will thank you! These will help your skin look brighter, and have a more even skin tone all year around. There is hydrating organic rose and soothing aloe which your skin will lock in the moisture.</li>
            <li> Great product  and shipping</li>
