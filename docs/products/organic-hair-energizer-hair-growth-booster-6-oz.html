            <li> Seriously, in the last 6 months of me using this product my hair has grown so much.</li>
            <li> is long as I can</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product from amazon after recommendation in a black hair magazine and I have to say already its amazing!!!my hair texture feels completely different as opposed to dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Instead of dry brittle hair I now have silky shiny hair.</li>
            <li> But my hair would get really dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the longest it&#x27;s been in the last 10 years( like half way down my back long) .</li>
            <li> how your product works and if I can get a complete refund if i&#x27;m not satisfied</li>
            <li> First off there&#x27;s the false advertising of being organic ..</li>
            <li> My hair was dry, brittle, thinning.&lt;br /&gt;After 3 days of using this product I was amazed!  </li>
            <li> I saw absolutely NO results from this product.  </li>
            <li> Also my edges came back within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> In less than 2 weeks I saw the loss of hair.  </li>
            <li> Glycerin causes my hair to come out in small patches along my hairline and the nape of my neck.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find at beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair at least twice a week with Mizani Scalp Care shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> I thought the other ingredients would overpower the negative effects of the glycerin - wrong!</li>
            <li> Approximately between three to four weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find this product in any beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> my sad story and the guy gave me a sample of this hair energizer and of course I&#x27;m skeptical!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I recently bought this product from amazon after recommendation in a black hair magazine and I have to say already its amazing!!!my hair texture feels completely different as opposed to dry and brittle.It has been a week of using but I have to say I have noticed a great difference so I will give another review much later to see if the results that I am expecting is as mentioned in the magazine.This is my very first product review and I am amazed</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product, my edges are growing back so quickly!</li>
            <li> this prouct helps my hair grow and it keeps it soft. Plus the price is right for the amount in the bottle. I have been unable to find this product in any beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> If anyone asked me about this product I would say it a wonderful product., But it needs some time to prove its effectiveness. Approximately between three to four weeks. Thank you</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely NO results from this product.  It is a good moisturizer though. I will not be ordering another.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for the hair. Great DHT blocker. Apply not only on the scalp but also on the hair. It will immediately strengthen the hair. Hard to find at beauty supply stores. Very happy I was able to order from Amazon when I ran out and at a great price!</li>
            <li> First off there&#x27;s the false advertising of being organic ..&lt;br /&gt;Nothing is actually organic in the &amp;#34;Organic Hair Energizer&amp;#34; ..and it says this on the package once you get&lt;br /&gt; it in fine print on the bottom?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please tell why you&#x27;re tricking customers right out of gates?&lt;br /&gt;and how your product works and if I can get a complete refund if i&#x27;m not satisfied</li>
            <li> A good product that lives up to the advertising</li>
            <li> Amazing product.keeps my hair soft.  Also my edges came back within a few weeks. I love it.</li>
            <li> If you have adverse reactions to hair products containing glycerin as I do, you may not want to use this product.  Glycerin causes my hair to come out in small patches along my hairline and the nape of my neck.  It also causes shedding overall.  Glycerin is listed as the second ingredient on the packaging.  I thought the other ingredients would overpower the negative effects of the glycerin - wrong! In less than 2 weeks I saw the loss of hair.  The good side of this product is that it does moisturize the hair, gives it sheen, and makes the hair more manageable.  I have medium kinky natural hair.</li>
            <li> Works for my 4a hair...my has grown where it was shedding and it keeps my hair moist and feels health! !</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product. First off, it says it&#x27;s organic but it is not. In fact in the label it states that it is not made from organic ingredients. Also contains gluten. Could not use it for both these reasons so I have no idea if it grows hair.</li>
            <li> It works for me!!!  I bought this product twice and now my hair is growing back!!  I was going bald,but the DHT reversal in this ingredient is apparently working!  It&#x27;s much cheaper than using a laser comb that may or may not work.</li>
            <li> I love this product ....organic hair  energizer hair growth booster does exactly that ...i kid you not ..my hair has grown within a week of using the product ... I just went to the store today and brought another bottle ... To each his own ...</li>
            <li> This is absolutely great! my edges where getting bald and i used everything but no progress till i came across this  product abd used it religiously with pepermint oil and rose oil. This is my 3rd week and my edges are back.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product it really lives to my expectations I can see my hair growing very fast since I started using this product right now I am trying to grow my hair is long as I can and I cannot believe how fast new hair is crawling out!!</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft and curly</li>
            <li> This really work.If you are losing your hair this is the product for me. My sister recommenced it to me ,so have given it a try and it really working..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to sound like a commercial but this product is amazing?  My hair was dry, brittle, thinning.&lt;br /&gt;After 3 days of using this product I was amazed!  Change #1 texture - I noticed my hair looked and felt healthier.  Instead of dry brittle hair I now have silky shiny hair. Change #2- thickness.  This is the most noticed change.  Before you could clearly see my scalp. Now I have a thick full head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;What I love the most is the fact that this product is lightweight, non-greasy and smells great</li>
            <li> First off I have never reviewed any product before, but I had to share how amazing this product is!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have very curly hair but it&#x27;s the type that gets really knotted and frizzy.  I have used every single product to try and tame my hair and still keep it healthy. But my hair would get really dry an my ends would just break. So after my hair would grow to my shoulders it would stop growing and get stringy. So back to the hair supply store I went in search of another product to try. I told the guy my sad story and the guy gave me a sample of this hair energizer and of course I&#x27;m skeptical!! But my hair curled so nicely and I didn&#x27;t have to put anything else in my hair! I was like omG this is a miracle!! But seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me it took me 23 years to find 1 product and I will not use anything but organic hair energizer in my hair anymore! Seriously, in the last 6 months of me using this product my hair has grown so much. It&#x27;s the longest it&#x27;s been in the last 10 years( like half way down my back long) . I get compliments all the time on how great my hair looks. And my hair just feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s my story, I hope it helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps: Hair energizer when are you coming out with shampoo and conditioner???</li>
            <li> Great product.  really helped with stubborn hair growth especially around temples.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After using this product my hair Looks more shining, and bright black colour&lt;br /&gt;Control to hair falling&lt;br /&gt;New hairs are growing&lt;br /&gt;Money wroth product</li>
            <li> I returned the product because it is not organic and has parabens in it which are connected to breast cancer. The company misrepresents themselves and is misleading. This product is NOT organic in any way.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is the best product that I have found yet for my hair and scalp.  It moisturizes my hair and scalp without causing me any outbreaks of pimples and the itching has subsided almost to no itch at all.  The DHT Blocker is my highlight of this product; I love it and will order again and again.  I wash my hair at least twice a week with Mizani Scalp Care shampoo and conditioner and I also use a product for working on the DHT Blocker from the inside called SeaNUHair.  I will post again after I have been taking and using these for 6 months.  I am on my 3rd bottle and I feel very confident about it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good item</li>
    </ol>
