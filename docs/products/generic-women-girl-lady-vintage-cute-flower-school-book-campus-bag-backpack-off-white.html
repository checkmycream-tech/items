            <li>/&gt;Though, I&#x27;ve seen reviews about it not being strong, so I suggest you don&#x27;t by it if you&#x27;re looking for a school bag! ðŸ˜Œ</li>
            <li>Also very cheap.</li>
            <li>CHEAP!</li>

            <li>the first day my daughter took it too school when she came back</li>

            <li> My daughter just used it for a day at school and both straps are broken.  Even the zippers broke off.  It&#x27;s a toy, not a usable, sturdy backpack. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to return it since I had to pay for the returning postage, which is about $10.</li>
            <li> CHEAP! And I am NOT referring to the cost! All of the straps ripped off the bag within 2 weeks. Not good for books! Great to carry cotton balls....maybe! Never again!</li>
            <li> I really do not recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a reliable back pack esp to a college student. I bought it because it looked cute and despite the other negative reviews it got, i just didnt believe it. I got it way early than the estimated shipping time which was great and the backpack looked exactly like how it was in the description but its obvious that its cheaply made, the straps are so flimsy that literally they ripped after 2 weeks of using it in college and now i literally had to sew it back on just so at least i can use it whenever i go somewhere that doesnt include heavy things.  Overall though, if youre looking for a backpack you can rely on especially for college, THIS IS NOT THE ONE.</li>
            <li> I Loved It Its Super Cute And Very Nice. Just As Expected. Just As The Picture Shows. Nice Quality. The Pocket In The Front Is Nice And Roomy. The Main Pocket Is Nice And Big Fits A Lot Of Things.&lt;br /&gt;It Looks A Bit Small But Its The Perfect Size It Fits All My Things . I&#x27;m Very Happy With This. Comes On Time Mine Came In 1 week . I&#x27;m Really Excited To Use It This School Year. I Will Do An Update Once I start The School Year. It was A Great buy For The Price. Really Happy With It (:</li>
            <li> The strap broke to easily and it  feels to flimsy. I&#x27;m almost scared to use it. But other than that I loved it</li>
            <li> Where straps meet bag, workmanship was shoddy, needed additional sewing and adhesive, fell apart as soon as normal load of books was inserted. I would not recommend back pack.</li>
            <li> Poor quality. Daughter used it for week and zipper pulled away from bag leaving a hole. Next week strap completely tore out of seam. Very poor quality. Color of &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; is generic bright orange, not like photo. Shipping took multiple weeks and product is very cheaply made. Would not recommend</li>
            <li> I dont know what the other review is talking about my bookbag got here in a week !! Its coming from China people!! Ive had items from China take up to 3 weeks!! The bookbag seems sturdy enough for the type of books i carry ( mostly paperbacks and one binder) I wouldnt fill it up with textbooks that weigh alot though. Its beautiful and all the zippers work. The leather is more on the orange side than tan but since i got the white one it matches the color of the fabric.</li>
            <li> I like the color and the style, a 5 star for those. I purchased this thinking I had just made a great choice getting a cheap backpack that would get a lot of compliments at school. When it came it did look like the picture just not as big and bulky. I&#x27;ve used it for carrying binders, computers, etc. It still hasn&#x27;t shown any signs of snapping like some predicted, the straps are super adjustable and comfortable on your back. The thing is, I don&#x27;t know if it will last all school year or not. If your using it for lightweight items, then this is a perfect backpack.</li>
            <li> the first day my daughter took it too school when she came back it was already ripped from the shoulder straps</li>
            <li> I just reviewed my bag and its nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It kind of looks better in the picture, but I&#x27;m still in love with it! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though, I&#x27;ve seen reviews about it not being strong, so I suggest you don&#x27;t by it if you&#x27;re looking for a school bag! ðŸ˜Œ</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this for school.  It doesn&#x27;t quite fit all her books, but she loves to tote it around when she can.</li>
            <li> This backpack looked pretty online, but we were very disappointed with it.  The backpack ripped within 2 weeks; this is the cheapest quality item I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time.</li>
            <li> Cheap material, poor quality, and stunk horrible. After the first day I used it the straps ripped off and where unable to be sewed back together. The smell reeked like melted plastic and a skunk mixed. It&#x27;s a don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I liked it but both straps broke like a week after having it. Really cute but not sturdy at all.</li>
            <li> It smelled like fish and the zippers broke as soon as I closed the bag. Even after I fixed the zippers and had it cleaned,the bag didnt close. The only good thing about it was that is was pretty. Other than that , it sucked. and I hate it.</li>
            <li> It broke after two weeks of regular use. The zipper tabs broke on the first day. The faux leather straps broke soon after.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased for my teenage daughter for school. The straps on both sides of the back pac completely ripped off within two days of use... Very poor quality! I would never purchase another from supplier.</li>
            <li> Looks pretty.  But after one day of use at school (I should add, there weren&#x27;t too many books in here either), the straps and even the seams ripped!! I will be returning this, if at all possible.  It was $25 with shipping.</li>
            <li> My daughter really wanted this bag so I got it loved the bag she was a huge hit at school.however the shipping took a very long time didn&#x27;t realize it was from china</li>
            <li> Well hand-made bag, usefull and trendy. Also very cheap. Exactly what I expected: really a good choice for me !</li>
            <li> Everything broke, The strap broke off the bookbag ripped why why why why it sucks you need to get that together</li>
            <li> This backpack is good for high schoolers it&#x27;s very stylish and girly.&lt;br /&gt;It comes as the image as you pick from!</li>
            <li> WARNING WARNING!!!! NOBODY BUY THIS PRODUCT! ABSOLUTELY TERRRIBLE QUALITY, THE STRAPS COMPLETELY RIPPED OFF IN TWO DAYS OF USE. &amp;#34;PERFECT FOR STUDENTS&amp;#34; IS WHAT THE DESCRIPTION SAID HOWEVER WHAT KIND OF STUDENT USES A BACKPACK WITH NO STRAPS. I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS BAG AND I WARN EVERYONE TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS ACCOUNT AND THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> cute but didn&#x27;t last very long. couldn&#x27;t put much in it because the straps started tearing at the seam.</li>
            <li> Cute but not meant to cary heavy books.</li>
            <li> It is beautiful but it broke way to easy it broke 2 weeks after I got it. But still nice</li>
            <li> Great backpack-really cute</li>
            <li> I got this item in hopes of finally getting a new backpack. Instead, I got a factory defected poor quality one. I had great expectations for this product due to previous reviews, but this did not make the cut. One of the black straps was accidentally sewn into the front of the backpack. Now I have to cut that strap off and burn the edge. The color of the vinyl is very orangey, not tan like shown in the picture. The straps feel like they are going to rip off if there is too much weight in the backpack. I know I&#x27;m not going to be able to carry many books in here. The product is cheap, but the quality is even poorer. Overall, I am very unhappy with this, and I don&#x27;t think it is going to last any longer than 2 weeks at most. I don&#x27;t plan on buying from this seller ever again.</li>
            <li> This backpack is very nice and very very cheap. it comes out with varius pocket for your supplies and very well designed</li>
            <li> It was good at first. Then it started breaking and I had to sew the straps back on. Im lucky I make it through the school year with this piece of crap. It was cute though.</li>
            <li> After one week using it handles started to come off, nothing heavy in it can not be worn. It&#x27;s nice color, but weak material.</li>
