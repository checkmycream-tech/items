            <li>I never use any kind of shave gel or cream.</li>
            <li>It gives me a great, clean shave with no nicks or missed spots.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t cut myself while shaving, it glides wonderfully across my skin and leaves my legs feeling amazingly soft!!</li>
            <li>i got try  this razor  and discover my new best friend before i used to shave every day</li>
            <li>If you can afford to purchase a new cartridge after every two or three shaves, this might be the perfect razor for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Packaging: Very easy to work with.</li>
            <li>This razor has been the best I&#x27;ve used thus far and hasn&#x27;t knicked me once, and i haven&#x27;t had to replace the head yet!</li>
            <li>I received it from Venus to try and I am so glad they did because I am in love with Venus again!  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The ball really helps the head rotate and get an incredibly close shave.</li>
            <li>I opened the packaging immediately and loved how lightweight and comfortable the grip was.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best razor Gillette has come out with.  </li>

            <li>I absolutely love this razor.</li>
            <li>I got this gillette swirl womens razor for free from buzzagent and was asked for my honest opinion</li>
            <li>by disposables, hello Venus swirl :)</li>
            <li>Used the Venus Swirl for over two weeks, instead of &amp;#34;borrowing&amp;#34; my husbands Schick (because men&#x27;s razors always seem better than women&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li>I got this product free from Venus to try in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always thought that 3 blades was all you need, and any more is just a way to make you pay more money.</li>
            <li>-I will be getting more of these blades since I got a coupon.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed :)</li>
            <li>and I am in love.</li>
            <li>I love these blades and razors.</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of the best razors I have used before!  </li>
            <li>I was able to try this razor free thanks to Venus, but I would have bought this without getting it free because I am always on the hunt for the best razor.</li>
            <li>I was happy to get these refills with a coupon thanks to buzz agent and Venus.</li>
            <li>received this sample for free and agreed to give an honest opinion</li>
            <li>Even though the swivel ball doesn&#x27;t move as much as i thought it would it still makes the shaving experience more pleasant.</li>
            <li>The packaging was very easy to open and the grip of the razor is very good and easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it was the best shave I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li>It means I can get the benefits of the Swirl razor heads, and still use my preferred original razor handle!</li>
            <li>This has been the best shave experience I have had in a LONG time!</li>
            <li>I am trying this product for free, thanks to Gillette, and it has been a great experience.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product free from Gillette for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I just got this razor in a bzzkit as a promotional free be and let me just say I love everything about this razor.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth it glides over your skin and how it contours when you move from side to side.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free from Gillette Venus through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>Gillette gave me this product for free, so here&#x27;s my review :)&lt;</li>
            <li>I love how smooth my legs are.</li>
            <li>I got to try these free from the company which makes this even better.</li>
            <li>For the first time in years, I was able to shave and received on nicks or cuts on my legs!</li>
            <li>I especially love the microcomb on the razor head, it helps guide those longer hairs towards the blades rather than just making it lay the other way.</li>
            <li>This razor makes shaving quick and easy!</li>
            <li>Overall, I think it is a good product!</li>
            <li>The MoistureGlide™ Serum, as they call it, is true to its word, and provided a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>The easy grip handle made it easy to glide over legs without leaving a nick on my legs.</li>
            <li>Water activated serum makes shaving easy and painless.</li>
            <li>It makes things so easy because it turns/moves with the contour of your body while shaving, instead of being stuck in one direction.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite features is the MoistureGlide serum which makes the blade effortlessly glide over your skin for a smooth moisturized silky smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I thought it would work better the second use, it was better, but not as good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>The flexball handle is comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It easily maneuvers around knee and ankle bones, which was important to me when looking to review this razor.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Venus and Bzzagent for letting me try this for free!!</li>
            <li>Alright, so at first I was excited to learn what this flexiball technology was all about and honestly</li>
            <li>/&gt;Trying this new 5 blade Venus Swirl razor has opened my eyes to the fact that, although the original 3 blade Venus razor is great, there is so much more available in the world of Venus razors that have the potential to be even better!</li>
            <li>The dryness can be easily gone with lotion, but it&#x27;s way worth it after the close shave you get after using these blades!</li>
            <li>happy to have the extra blades around when I need them.</li>
            <li>I was sent this product free by BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>Happy with the product and will buy again in the future!</li>
            <li>I was able to try it for free thanks to Gillette, and I honestly love it.</li>

            <li>Gillette gave me this razor to try for free</li>
            <li>I have always purchased the cheap disposable razors.</li>
            <li>It glides so smoothly on my skin without any shaving cream at all; I can&#x27;t even feel that I am shaving.</li>
            <li>I have tried many of their different models and have liked some more than others.</li>

            <li>The packaging looks nice, and the razor has that classic feminine Venus</li>
            <li>So it is deffinitly worth it to give it a try!</li>
            <li>I honestly have always used the cheapest women&#x27;s razors that are 3 or 4 blades with a normal moisturizer strip.  </li>
            <li>The other reason why I loved this razor was the design on it!</li>
            <li>When asked to review this I was already using the original Venus razor &amp; that is my go to razor.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you again to Gillette for the complimentary razor!</li>
            <li>/&gt;-5 blade razor head outperforms original 3 blade Venus razor head</li>
            <li>I use electric one, disposables never give me a clean shave</li>
            <li>This razor glides super smooth and doesn&#x27;t &amp;</li>
            <li>I was able to try this razor free thanks to Gillette and Bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Close, smooth, quick shave&lt;br /&gt;-Water</li>
            <li>Love this razor it works magic love how it leaves my legs smooth and very easy to get in the hard places like by your ankles</li>
            <li>I like that the Venus Swirl razors have 5 blades and that they are very smooth and gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>I honesty didn&#x27;t notice the roller ball to do anything special, besides look cool.</li>
            <li>The blade on this Venus product is also great because I don&#x27;t need to go back over any spots - it gets it all the first time</li>
            <li>I was able to save much faster</li>
            <li>All in all, it was a good product that I could see myself buying in the future.</li>
            <li>I knew that the Gillette Venus brand was good, the only product in the line I do not like is the Venus throw away razor disposables.  </li>
            <li>Full disclosure...</li>
            <li>First, let me say that I was able to try this product for free thanks to Gillette!</li>
            <li>Overall I loved the razor</li>
            <li>This product made shaving so much easier and enjoyable for me.</li>
            <li>It really does make it easy to getting the shaving done quick and easy while reaching all the areas needed.</li>
            <li>but it does have a nice feel and leaves my legs feeling soft</li>
            <li>Thanks to Gillette for the free product trial!</li>
            <li>Thanks to Gillette for giving me the opportunity to try this product for free!</li>
            <li>The Venus swirl refills slide on just as easy as the first razor that comes with the product.</li>
            <li>: It is a very nice razor, but does not really cater to me.</li>
            <li>It left my legs so soft and perfect, ready to go!</li>
            <li>Having the blades not miss a hair keeps you from having to shave so quick again.</li>
            <li>and it gets a super close shave.</li>
            <li>I am 8 months pregnant-</li>
            <li>You get a super close shave with no knicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>Btw guys, I got this free thanks to Gillette and bzzagent!</li>
            <li>I got this product free thanks to gillette!</li>
            <li>I normally use bic soleil razors, which do get the job done, however, the Venus swirl just does a better job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The razor arrived in a very pretty and feminine package.</li>
            <li>The thing I was most surprised about was the flexiball, I thought it would move more with your body and go with the curves, but it didn&#x27;t as much as I thought it would</li>
            <li>I will use them on my old original Venus handle for better stability.</li>
            <li>After the first couple uses, the shave isn&#x27;t quite as close as it was originally</li>
            <li>ball that this razor is designed around is pretty special as well.</li>
            <li>It adds something pretty and special to my shaving routine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really sharp and it makes my legs really smooth, I love how it swivels easily in my hands.</li>
            <li>I was very honored to try this product free from Gillette.</li>
            <li>I got this product for free thanks to Gillette...</li>
            <li>I tried it for free thanks to a promotion from Gillette.</li>

            <li>I actually got an amazing shave without having to stretch and pull at my skin to get every hair.</li>
            <li>thanks to gillette for letting me try it for free</li>
            <li>It has five blades and a water activated serum around the whole razor head for and smooth moisturizing shave with out getting all slimy.</li>
            <li>I have had the chance to try the razor free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li>I got to try this razor free thanks to Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>I got the chance to try this product free thanks to Gillette through Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>Gillette very graciously gave me a free razor to try out and review, so here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks to Gillette, I was given the product free to review.</li>
            <li>It is a nice product overall and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t see that the &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34; really does that much for getting a better shave.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I will never go back to disposables again.</li>
            <li>I will add that I have sensitive skin, so most razors give me razor bumps.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>The blades were great, but the ball feature, ( i was thinking dyson vacuum cleaner) doesn&#x27;t really give a whole lot of movement.</li>
            <li>The best feature is the moisture bar on the razor its self, i normally nick myself multiple times with a basic razor if i don&#x27;t use a load of shaving cream, so to test this product I used it without and managed to get no nicks</li>
            <li>I was so excited to be picked for this freeie thanks to Gillette and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>Besides that irritation, just like my other razors, I got a good shave and didn&#x27;t have any cuts.</li>
            <li>With my other razor I was shaving a good 4 to 5 times a week.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>right there on my front porch</li>
            <li>It was very sharp and definitely one of the best razors I have used in a while.</li>
            <li>I have to say I don&#x27;t think there is really anything special about this razor.</li>
            <li>Previously I would purchase men&#x27;s razors to get that nice, close, smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>The past from other companies and loved them, but this Gillette swirl I LOVE!!</li>
            <li>I received this new Venus Swirl razor from the brand for free.</li>
            <li>I can’t apply exactly the right pressure because it moves.</li>
            <li>i think this razor is the only one ive tried that gives me the closest shave i dont really think it gives a nice smell</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get that &amp;#34;tugging&amp;#34; feeling like with other razors, it was very smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try the new one.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li>But it got me interested into trying it</li>
            <li>At first, I was quite intrigued with this razor and was eager to get it in the mail.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of razors</li>
            <li>I feel they always cut closer, do a better job, and last longer.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying Gillette brands more often.</li>
            <li>And, this is the first time that I have ever tried a Venus razor.</li>
            <li>I was able to use the same cartridge for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li>It also contours really nicely, so I have not cut myself at all (I normally nick a knee or ankle pretty regularly).</li>
            <li>I received one to test and my first thought was,</li>
            <li>mens razors always provided the closest smoothest shave for me without cuts and now that I&#x27;ve gotten to try this razor, I am in love and never going back to men&#x27;s razors</li>
            <li>My legs were so smooth and soft like silk when I was done.</li>
            <li>I received this razor as a promotion from Venus, and I must say I was pretty impressed.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I noticed that this razor was bigger than most razors, but it&#x27;s because of the 5 blade head.</li>
            <li>I received the Venus swirl razor over the weekend and figures what better time than now to open it up and try it out!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li>So much moisture!</li>
            <li>The 5 blades make shaving an absolute breeze!</li>
            <li>The 5 blades on this razor head make shaving so much faster and simpler!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in the future. :0)</li>
            <li>It leaves my legs feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised by how smooth the razor felt and how there wasn&#x27;t any tug on my legs.  </li>
            <li>The MoistureGlide serum was really what made this razor for me!</li>
            <li>I was excited as anyone else would be to try a new razor, but the new features seemed pretty cool, so I immediately went to try it.</li>
            <li>Up and down would make more sense I think, but I still wouldn’t want that either-as I prefer precise control.</li>
            <li>While I loved the fact that the head moves with the curves of my legs, I wouldn&#x27;t rate this much higher than other razors because of the high (and ongoing) price.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to try free of charge.</li>
            <li>They get every hair, never missing and it gets close enough where you don&#x27;t have to shave more than 2 times a week!</li>
            <li>If you use basic razors normally, I would give this a try for sure, and even if you use electric like myself, it was still worth it.</li>
            <li>However, even just that little extra flex was awesome compared to most other razors I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>far as the Swirl razor head/blade is concerned, it is one step to success!</li>
            <li>I love that it has 5 sharp blades and get a super close shave.</li>
            <li>Not only was the package visually appealing, it was was incredibly easy to open.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally splurge on razors, but this one is really worth the money.</li>
            <li>It turns an amazing shave into a luxury item and leaves me having to settle with another product, having to choose between half a tank of gas or a silky shave.</li>
            <li>I wish all razors (and plastic packages) were that easy to open.</li>
            <li>I received the package, it was easy to open.</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue to use it as long as the cartridges&#x27; are with in a good price.</li>
            <li>It feels super smooth while shaving and I haven&#x27;t cut myself a single time (even my knees and ankles!).  </li>
            <li>If it holds up to the test of time I will certainly buy it from now on.</li>
            <li>Found my new razor!!</li>
            <li>The major difference of the Flexiball did not have a huge impact on me since I primarily used it to shave my legs and armpits, however, I can see how this would be very useful in more difficult to reach areas like the bikini</li>
            <li>Seriously such an amazing product and I will be a constant supporter.</li>
            <li>I actually got to try this product for free thanks to Gillette.  </li>
            <li>I found that even without shaving cream I got a smooth shave that left my legs feeling silky.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to bzzagent</li>
            <li>thanks to Gillette Venus</li>
            <li>I will absolutely be continuing to use this product.</li>
            <li>so shaving has become quite the task, and with this razor I can do it much easier.</li>
            <li>However, I WAS much happier with it when I tried it on my armpits.</li>
            <li>I recently had the opportunity to try these free in a promotion from Gillette.  </li>
            <li>I received a $4.00 off coupon thanks to Venus through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I don’t feel like I have to apply too much pressure to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>This is really helpful to someone like me with disability and chronic pain.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Venus I got to try this razor as a test product</li>
            <li>Gets very close and no nicks,cuts, or razor burn.</li>
            <li>Thanks Venus.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is so much the ball</li>
            <li>True Product, exactly the same as sold in stores.</li>
            <li>I did notice that after my shave, I would be left kind of dry, but I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have already bought refills because I am so excited to make this my one and only razor. .</li>
            <li>I love how it just glides on skin ( compared to other disposable razors) and it didn&#x27;t leave any leftover hair.</li>
            <li>#34;catch&amp;#34; like other razors, leaving no nasty bumps or razor burn.  </li>
            <li>Venus Swirl is an amazing razor when it comes to a close shave, but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>I have used tons of razors and this little beauty has been BY FAR my favorite razor!</li>
            <li>far as the handle is concerned, I like my original Venus handle with the hard plastic where you place your index finger better than the Swirl handle-makes me feel like I have firmer control.</li>
            <li>Pick this as your new go to razor!</li>
            <li>The MoistureGlide Serum was too high during the first use and ended up keeping the blades too far from the skin.  </li>
            <li>However, when you use this on a part that traditional razors have a hard time conforming to, it&#x27;s great at doing so.</li>
            <li>This was the area I was really checking to see if the Swirl would live up to its marketing....</li>
            <li>This razor gives such a smooth easy shave and i will definitely purchase in the future!</li>
            <li>Up next is my quick pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried this razor through a promotion and had high hopes.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend anyone with pain or disability consider getting a 5 blade razor for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bonus that it has such a pretty design!</li>
            <li>This razor left me with super soft legs, just in time time for summer!</li>
            <li>I only have to go over each area once to remove hairs (compared to twice with my old 3 blade original Venus) and if I want a super close shave, I only have to go over each area twice (compared to 3 or 4 times with my old 3 blade razor).</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t use disposable razors because of cost and time.</li>
            <li>It does seem to get those areas that I had a bit more trouble shaving with the traditional/original venus shaver.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t last long and they hurt sometimes, but I couldn&#x27;t see spending any more money on razors.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t last me quite as long as the packaging said it would, but I also shave more than 2 times a week like the packaging uses for their life time estimations.</li>
            <li>I found these do pretty much the same job.</li>
            <li>It was a close shave, my legs were smooth, and the swivel of the handle really helped to cut down on nicks where you normally would worry.</li>
            <li>But as much as I love thw flexibility, the 5 blades and how easy it is to use, I was not impressed with the quality of the blades.</li>
            <li>It left my legs feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>Not only does it become less effective, but the gel becomes sticky.</li>
            <li>It moves ever so slightly left and right</li>
            <li>Superior to other razors, hands down.</li>
            <li>Once I tried this razor, my skin was never cut and never irritated and it provided a super close shave that I have not experience in a long time!  </li>
            <li>(its lasted a decent amount of time so far) and</li>
            <li>Wow this product blew my socks off!</li>
            <li>No more cheap throwaway razors for me!</li>
            <li>The razor handle itself seemed simple as first glace.</li>
            <li>When you first try to see the flexibility of the ball portion of the razor it seems that it only moves about three millimeters each way.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and the disposable razors I normally get</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Razor head is good for the disabled and those with chronic pain due to its efficiency</li>
            <li>It only really flexs left and right.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I received the Venus Swirl &amp; it has a unique design due to the silver roller ball in the middle of the razor, it is suggested that the razor can pivot into hard to reach, more curvy, sensitive areas &amp; do a better job than the other razors in the line or that are available from other manufacturers.  </li>
            <li>And will continue to use this product, leaves your legs soft and smooth and keeps them that way for far longer than any other product I have used.</li>
            <li>So dry shaving is not new to me, I am also very familiar with razor burn</li>
            <li>Frankly, it just makes me feel like I have less precise control over the razor.</li>
            <li>I was actually quite pleasantly surprised that it worked on my ankle on the first pass of the area.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much longer 5 blades last than just a normal 3 blade razor.  </li>
            <li>I am also excited to try other Venus razor blades now!</li>
            <li>a one pass operation for my underarms, no more passing and passing over my underarms to assure a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;No con&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>Overall I think this is a very well designed product</li>
            <li>I went, razor in hand and all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later after being bit by a million mosquitos, I realized how soft my legs were.</li>
            <li>the moisture serum helped protect sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I was so pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>I really like the extra moisture bar to keep things silky.</li>
            <li>I had completely gotten used to it until I tried the Swirl.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and sometimes end up with irritation.</li>
            <li>The ball really helps to get all those curvy places easily, especially under the arms.</li>
            <li>The water activated moisture strip left my skin very silky without gel or cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m my own worse enemy in that sense &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
            <li>The Flexiball was a nice feature moving over my knee cap and behind the bend of my knee, no nicks, cuts, or pulling hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for my arm pits since it markets itself as a good razor for curvy areas and my arm pits are really hard for me to get a complete shave due to</li>
            <li>The 5 blades provided such a close shave, and it was a closer shave than I&#x27;ve tried with the normal 3 blades!</li>
            <li>Scroll down to my quick pros and cons list!):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this razor for all women, especially those looking who want smooth legs and long lasting shaving results.</li>
            <li>I think most women would actually find that they need to shave less often with such a close shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for just under a month now, and it is definitely time for a new blade, so</li>
            <li>Next area to test it on was the underarm area, again it worked quite effortlessly without much manipulation or extra attention needing to be paid to this area.  </li>
            <li>Before trying this Venus razor, I used individual razors (such as the Schick quattro), which are much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I just wish they wouldn&#x27;t have dried out so quickly.</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this razor a full five stars is because I got a little skin irritation one of the times I used it, but I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I usually use the original Venus razor</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommendation: I would recommend this razor for anyone wanting to shave their bikini area, but for other bodily locations, a normal razor would do just fine (maybe even a little better/</li>
            <li>When I used it I barely felt a thing</li>
            <li>After shaving, it left my skin feeling smooth, not feeling dry or itchy like my previous razor.</li>
            <li>Simple to open, simple to take out, and overall very user-friendly.</li>
            <li>I received this razor for free through Gillette to try and seriously couldn&#x27;t be happier about it.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, I&#x27;m surprised it took so long to get a flexible woman&#x27;s razor.</li>
            <li>The only downfall to this razor is that the blades didn&#x27;t last as long as I thought they would have, especially for their high price tag.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I will most likely recommend this shaver to family &amp; friends that need a razor &amp; I shall be ordering the blade refills when my other is dull &amp; will update this review if it does not continue to fulfill my needs.  </li>
            <li>As well, the way it moves (slight rotation from side to side) doesn’t really make sense to me for the areas I shave (legs and underarms).</li>
            <li>But I have to shave mine every day, this one not really long - lasting shave</li>
            <li>I got a close shave, with the 5 blades and the micro comb, and it left my skin soft and silky, not at all dry.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love the Gillette Venus swirl!</li>

            <li> I absolutely LOVE this razor!</li>
            <li> Love this razor!</li>
            <li> I am also happy to report that with the special head and blade design there were no nicks or cuts even while shaving hurriedly in the morning before work!</li>
            <li> i was amazing been 3 days and no hair show  ..</li>
            <li> However it makes up for that with an amazingly close shave.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing all around</li>
            <li> The ball didn&#x27;t make a huge difference when shaving my legs, but the razor itself was great on my legs.</li>
            <li> Venus Swirl Razors are amazing...</li>
            <li> I loved how this worked better over my knees and bikini lines compared to the BIC.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice smith shave and moves witch</li>
            <li> thanks to Gillette for this awesome product!</li>
            <li> As a razor I really liked the Gillette Swirl.</li>
            <li> but in no way was I influenced, this is my own review and experience with the Gillette Venus swirl razor heads</li>
            <li> I never use any kind of shave gel or cream.</li>
            <li> It gives me a great, clean shave with no nicks or missed spots.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t cut myself while shaving, it glides wonderfully across my skin and leaves my legs feeling amazingly soft!!</li>
            <li> i got try  this razor  and discover my new best friend before i used to shave every day</li>
            <li> If you can afford to purchase a new cartridge after every two or three shaves, this might be the perfect razor for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging: Very easy to work with.</li>
            <li> This razor has been the best I&#x27;ve used thus far and hasn&#x27;t knicked me once, and i haven&#x27;t had to replace the head yet!</li>
            <li> I received it from Venus to try and I am so glad they did because I am in love with Venus again!  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The ball really helps the head rotate and get an incredibly close shave.</li>
            <li> I opened the packaging immediately and loved how lightweight and comfortable the grip was.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best razor Gillette has come out with.  </li>
            <li> I received this razor and a blade for free from BzzAgent.com about a month ago and have to say it&#x27;s a good razor.</li>
            <li> I loved this razor, it glided smoothly over my skin</li>
            <li> I received an his product to try for free from Gillette and I was pretty impressed.</li>

            <li> I was able to try this product for free thanks to Gillette, and it&#x27;s a great razor!</li>
            <li> The moisture bands make for a very smooth shave as well.</li>
            <li> The moisture bar on the razor head leaves your skin feeling very smooth even if you don&#x27;t use shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Also, I am not scared with the razor to shave my armpits, knees, ankles and bikini area, and it does not get irritated, which is a huge relief for me!  </li>
            <li> and I got better results.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product free by BzzAgent in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s my favorite razor</li>
            <li> For more of my product reviews and buying guides, visit: http://melindalongoria.hubpages.com/</li>
            <li> I would def recommend to others :)</li>
            <li> I love the 5 blade design.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor.</li>
            <li> I got this gillette swirl womens razor for free from buzzagent and was asked for my honest opinion</li>
            <li> by disposables, hello Venus swirl :)</li>
            <li> Used the Venus Swirl for over two weeks, instead of &amp;#34;borrowing&amp;#34; my husbands Schick (because men&#x27;s razors always seem better than women&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li> I got this product free from Venus to try in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always thought that 3 blades was all you need, and any more is just a way to make you pay more money.</li>
            <li> -I will be getting more of these blades since I got a coupon.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed :)</li>
            <li> and I am in love.</li>
            <li> I love these blades and razors.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the best razors I have used before!  </li>
            <li> I was able to try this razor free thanks to Venus, but I would have bought this without getting it free because I am always on the hunt for the best razor.</li>
            <li> I was happy to get these refills with a coupon thanks to buzz agent and Venus.</li>
            <li> received this sample for free and agreed to give an honest opinion</li>
            <li> Even though the swivel ball doesn&#x27;t move as much as i thought it would it still makes the shaving experience more pleasant.</li>
            <li> The packaging was very easy to open and the grip of the razor is very good and easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it was the best shave I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li> It means I can get the benefits of the Swirl razor heads, and still use my preferred original razor handle!</li>
            <li> This has been the best shave experience I have had in a LONG time!</li>
            <li> I am trying this product for free, thanks to Gillette, and it has been a great experience.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product free from Gillette for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I just got this razor in a bzzkit as a promotional free be and let me just say I love everything about this razor.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth it glides over your skin and how it contours when you move from side to side.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free from Gillette Venus through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Gillette gave me this product for free, so here&#x27;s my review :)&lt;</li>
            <li> I love how smooth my legs are.</li>
            <li> I got to try these free from the company which makes this even better.</li>
            <li> For the first time in years, I was able to shave and received on nicks or cuts on my legs!</li>
            <li> I especially love the microcomb on the razor head, it helps guide those longer hairs towards the blades rather than just making it lay the other way.</li>
            <li> This razor makes shaving quick and easy!</li>
            <li> Overall, I think it is a good product!</li>
            <li> The MoistureGlide™ Serum, as they call it, is true to its word, and provided a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> The easy grip handle made it easy to glide over legs without leaving a nick on my legs.</li>
            <li> Water activated serum makes shaving easy and painless.</li>
            <li> It makes things so easy because it turns/moves with the contour of your body while shaving, instead of being stuck in one direction.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite features is the MoistureGlide serum which makes the blade effortlessly glide over your skin for a smooth moisturized silky smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I thought it would work better the second use, it was better, but not as good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> The flexball handle is comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It easily maneuvers around knee and ankle bones, which was important to me when looking to review this razor.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Venus and Bzzagent for letting me try this for free!!</li>
            <li> Alright, so at first I was excited to learn what this flexiball technology was all about and honestly</li>
            <li> /&gt;Trying this new 5 blade Venus Swirl razor has opened my eyes to the fact that, although the original 3 blade Venus razor is great, there is so much more available in the world of Venus razors that have the potential to be even better!</li>
            <li> The dryness can be easily gone with lotion, but it&#x27;s way worth it after the close shave you get after using these blades!</li>
            <li> happy to have the extra blades around when I need them.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product free by BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Happy with the product and will buy again in the future!</li>
            <li> I was able to try it for free thanks to Gillette, and I honestly love it.</li>

            <li> /&gt;*I received this razor as a free promotion from Gilette, but I did not let this become a bias that affected my review</li>
            <li> I would buy this razor if I hadn&#x27;t received it for free</li>
            <li> Gillette gave me this razor to try for free</li>
            <li> I have always purchased the cheap disposable razors.</li>
            <li> It glides so smoothly on my skin without any shaving cream at all; I can&#x27;t even feel that I am shaving.</li>
            <li> I have tried many of their different models and have liked some more than others.</li>
            <li> I enjoy Gillette products.</li>
            <li> smooth.</li>

            <li> I was able to try this product for free thanks to Gillette!</li>
            <li> The packaging looks nice, and the razor has that classic feminine Venus</li>
            <li> So it is deffinitly worth it to give it a try!</li>
            <li> I honestly have always used the cheapest women&#x27;s razors that are 3 or 4 blades with a normal moisturizer strip.  </li>
            <li> The other reason why I loved this razor was the design on it!</li>
            <li> When asked to review this I was already using the original Venus razor &amp; that is my go to razor.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you again to Gillette for the complimentary razor!</li>
            <li> /&gt;-5 blade razor head outperforms original 3 blade Venus razor head</li>
            <li> I use electric one, disposables never give me a clean shave</li>
            <li> This razor glides super smooth and doesn&#x27;t &amp;</li>
            <li> I was able to try this razor free thanks to Gillette and Bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Close, smooth, quick shave&lt;br /&gt;-Water</li>
            <li> Love this razor it works magic love how it leaves my legs smooth and very easy to get in the hard places like by your ankles</li>
            <li> I like that the Venus Swirl razors have 5 blades and that they are very smooth and gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> I honesty didn&#x27;t notice the roller ball to do anything special, besides look cool.</li>
            <li> The blade on this Venus product is also great because I don&#x27;t need to go back over any spots - it gets it all the first time</li>
            <li> I was able to save much faster</li>
            <li> All in all, it was a good product that I could see myself buying in the future.</li>
            <li> I knew that the Gillette Venus brand was good, the only product in the line I do not like is the Venus throw away razor disposables.  </li>
            <li> Full disclosure...</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I was able to try this product for free thanks to Gillette!</li>
            <li> Overall I loved the razor</li>
            <li> This product made shaving so much easier and enjoyable for me.</li>
            <li> It really does make it easy to getting the shaving done quick and easy while reaching all the areas needed.</li>
            <li> but it does have a nice feel and leaves my legs feeling soft</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette for the free product trial!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette for giving me the opportunity to try this product for free!</li>
            <li> The Venus swirl refills slide on just as easy as the first razor that comes with the product.</li>
            <li> : It is a very nice razor, but does not really cater to me.</li>
            <li> It left my legs so soft and perfect, ready to go!</li>
            <li> Having the blades not miss a hair keeps you from having to shave so quick again.</li>
            <li> and it gets a super close shave.</li>
            <li> I am 8 months pregnant-</li>
            <li> You get a super close shave with no knicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> Btw guys, I got this free thanks to Gillette and bzzagent!</li>
            <li> I got this product free thanks to gillette!</li>
            <li> I normally use bic soleil razors, which do get the job done, however, the Venus swirl just does a better job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The razor arrived in a very pretty and feminine package.</li>
            <li> The thing I was most surprised about was the flexiball, I thought it would move more with your body and go with the curves, but it didn&#x27;t as much as I thought it would</li>
            <li> I will use them on my old original Venus handle for better stability.</li>
            <li> After the first couple uses, the shave isn&#x27;t quite as close as it was originally</li>
            <li> ball that this razor is designed around is pretty special as well.</li>
            <li> It adds something pretty and special to my shaving routine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really sharp and it makes my legs really smooth, I love how it swivels easily in my hands.</li>
            <li> I was very honored to try this product free from Gillette.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free thanks to Gillette...</li>
            <li> I tried it for free thanks to a promotion from Gillette.</li>
            <li> I am trying the product for free thanks to Gillette.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually got an amazing shave without having to stretch and pull at my skin to get every hair.</li>
            <li> thanks to gillette for letting me try it for free</li>
            <li> It has five blades and a water activated serum around the whole razor head for and smooth moisturizing shave with out getting all slimy.</li>
            <li> I have had the chance to try the razor free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li> I got to try this razor free thanks to Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I got the chance to try this product free thanks to Gillette through Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> Gillette very graciously gave me a free razor to try out and review, so here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette, I was given the product free to review.</li>
            <li> It is a nice product overall and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t see that the &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34; really does that much for getting a better shave.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I will never go back to disposables again.</li>
            <li> I will add that I have sensitive skin, so most razors give me razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> The blades were great, but the ball feature, ( i was thinking dyson vacuum cleaner) doesn&#x27;t really give a whole lot of movement.</li>
            <li> The best feature is the moisture bar on the razor its self, i normally nick myself multiple times with a basic razor if i don&#x27;t use a load of shaving cream, so to test this product I used it without and managed to get no nicks</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be picked for this freeie thanks to Gillette and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Besides that irritation, just like my other razors, I got a good shave and didn&#x27;t have any cuts.</li>
            <li> With my other razor I was shaving a good 4 to 5 times a week.</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> right there on my front porch</li>
            <li> It was very sharp and definitely one of the best razors I have used in a while.</li>
            <li> I have to say I don&#x27;t think there is really anything special about this razor.</li>
            <li> Previously I would purchase men&#x27;s razors to get that nice, close, smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> The past from other companies and loved them, but this Gillette swirl I LOVE!!</li>
            <li> I received this new Venus Swirl razor from the brand for free.</li>
            <li> I can’t apply exactly the right pressure because it moves.</li>
            <li> i think this razor is the only one ive tried that gives me the closest shave i dont really think it gives a nice smell</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get that &amp;#34;tugging&amp;#34; feeling like with other razors, it was very smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try the new one.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li> But it got me interested into trying it</li>
            <li> At first, I was quite intrigued with this razor and was eager to get it in the mail.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of razors</li>
            <li> I feel they always cut closer, do a better job, and last longer.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying Gillette brands more often.</li>
            <li> And, this is the first time that I have ever tried a Venus razor.</li>
            <li> I was able to use the same cartridge for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li> It also contours really nicely, so I have not cut myself at all (I normally nick a knee or ankle pretty regularly).</li>
            <li> I received one to test and my first thought was,</li>
            <li> mens razors always provided the closest smoothest shave for me without cuts and now that I&#x27;ve gotten to try this razor, I am in love and never going back to men&#x27;s razors</li>
            <li> My legs were so smooth and soft like silk when I was done.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as a promotion from Venus, and I must say I was pretty impressed.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I noticed that this razor was bigger than most razors, but it&#x27;s because of the 5 blade head.</li>
            <li> I received the Venus swirl razor over the weekend and figures what better time than now to open it up and try it out!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li> So much moisture!</li>
            <li> The 5 blades make shaving an absolute breeze!</li>
            <li> The 5 blades on this razor head make shaving so much faster and simpler!</li>
            <li> I will be buying more in the future. :0)</li>
            <li> It leaves my legs feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised by how smooth the razor felt and how there wasn&#x27;t any tug on my legs.  </li>
            <li> The MoistureGlide serum was really what made this razor for me!</li>
            <li> I was excited as anyone else would be to try a new razor, but the new features seemed pretty cool, so I immediately went to try it.</li>
            <li> Up and down would make more sense I think, but I still wouldn’t want that either-as I prefer precise control.</li>
            <li> While I loved the fact that the head moves with the curves of my legs, I wouldn&#x27;t rate this much higher than other razors because of the high (and ongoing) price.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try free of charge.</li>
            <li> They get every hair, never missing and it gets close enough where you don&#x27;t have to shave more than 2 times a week!</li>
            <li> If you use basic razors normally, I would give this a try for sure, and even if you use electric like myself, it was still worth it.</li>
            <li> However, even just that little extra flex was awesome compared to most other razors I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> far as the Swirl razor head/blade is concerned, it is one step to success!</li>
            <li> I love that it has 5 sharp blades and get a super close shave.</li>
            <li> Not only was the package visually appealing, it was was incredibly easy to open.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally splurge on razors, but this one is really worth the money.</li>
            <li> It turns an amazing shave into a luxury item and leaves me having to settle with another product, having to choose between half a tank of gas or a silky shave.</li>
            <li> I wish all razors (and plastic packages) were that easy to open.</li>
            <li> I received the package, it was easy to open.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to use it as long as the cartridges&#x27; are with in a good price.</li>
            <li> It feels super smooth while shaving and I haven&#x27;t cut myself a single time (even my knees and ankles!).  </li>
            <li> If it holds up to the test of time I will certainly buy it from now on.</li>
            <li> Found my new razor!!</li>
            <li> The major difference of the Flexiball did not have a huge impact on me since I primarily used it to shave my legs and armpits, however, I can see how this would be very useful in more difficult to reach areas like the bikini</li>
            <li> Seriously such an amazing product and I will be a constant supporter.</li>
            <li> I actually got to try this product for free thanks to Gillette.  </li>
            <li> I found that even without shaving cream I got a smooth shave that left my legs feeling silky.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to bzzagent</li>
            <li> thanks to Gillette Venus</li>
            <li> I will absolutely be continuing to use this product.</li>
            <li> so shaving has become quite the task, and with this razor I can do it much easier.</li>
            <li> However, I WAS much happier with it when I tried it on my armpits.</li>
            <li> I recently had the opportunity to try these free in a promotion from Gillette.  </li>
            <li> I received a $4.00 off coupon thanks to Venus through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I don’t feel like I have to apply too much pressure to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> This is really helpful to someone like me with disability and chronic pain.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Venus I got to try this razor as a test product</li>
            <li> Gets very close and no nicks,cuts, or razor burn.</li>
            <li> Thanks Venus.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is so much the ball</li>
            <li> True Product, exactly the same as sold in stores.</li>
            <li> I did notice that after my shave, I would be left kind of dry, but I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have already bought refills because I am so excited to make this my one and only razor. .</li>
            <li> I love how it just glides on skin ( compared to other disposable razors) and it didn&#x27;t leave any leftover hair.</li>
            <li> #34;catch&amp;#34; like other razors, leaving no nasty bumps or razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Venus Swirl is an amazing razor when it comes to a close shave, but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I have used tons of razors and this little beauty has been BY FAR my favorite razor!</li>
            <li> far as the handle is concerned, I like my original Venus handle with the hard plastic where you place your index finger better than the Swirl handle-makes me feel like I have firmer control.</li>
            <li> Pick this as your new go to razor!</li>
            <li> The MoistureGlide Serum was too high during the first use and ended up keeping the blades too far from the skin.  </li>
            <li> However, when you use this on a part that traditional razors have a hard time conforming to, it&#x27;s great at doing so.</li>
            <li> This was the area I was really checking to see if the Swirl would live up to its marketing....</li>
            <li> This razor gives such a smooth easy shave and i will definitely purchase in the future!</li>
            <li> Up next is my quick pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried this razor through a promotion and had high hopes.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend anyone with pain or disability consider getting a 5 blade razor for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bonus that it has such a pretty design!</li>
            <li> This razor left me with super soft legs, just in time time for summer!</li>
            <li> I only have to go over each area once to remove hairs (compared to twice with my old 3 blade original Venus) and if I want a super close shave, I only have to go over each area twice (compared to 3 or 4 times with my old 3 blade razor).</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t use disposable razors because of cost and time.</li>
            <li> It does seem to get those areas that I had a bit more trouble shaving with the traditional/original venus shaver.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last long and they hurt sometimes, but I couldn&#x27;t see spending any more money on razors.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t last me quite as long as the packaging said it would, but I also shave more than 2 times a week like the packaging uses for their life time estimations.</li>
            <li> I found these do pretty much the same job.</li>
            <li> It was a close shave, my legs were smooth, and the swivel of the handle really helped to cut down on nicks where you normally would worry.</li>
            <li> But as much as I love thw flexibility, the 5 blades and how easy it is to use, I was not impressed with the quality of the blades.</li>
            <li> It left my legs feeling super soft.</li>
            <li> Not only does it become less effective, but the gel becomes sticky.</li>
            <li> It moves ever so slightly left and right</li>
            <li> Superior to other razors, hands down.</li>
            <li> Once I tried this razor, my skin was never cut and never irritated and it provided a super close shave that I have not experience in a long time!  </li>
            <li> (its lasted a decent amount of time so far) and</li>
            <li> Wow this product blew my socks off!</li>
            <li> No more cheap throwaway razors for me!</li>
            <li> The razor handle itself seemed simple as first glace.</li>
            <li> When you first try to see the flexibility of the ball portion of the razor it seems that it only moves about three millimeters each way.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and the disposable razors I normally get</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Razor head is good for the disabled and those with chronic pain due to its efficiency</li>
            <li> It only really flexs left and right.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I received the Venus Swirl &amp; it has a unique design due to the silver roller ball in the middle of the razor, it is suggested that the razor can pivot into hard to reach, more curvy, sensitive areas &amp; do a better job than the other razors in the line or that are available from other manufacturers.  </li>
            <li> And will continue to use this product, leaves your legs soft and smooth and keeps them that way for far longer than any other product I have used.</li>
            <li> So dry shaving is not new to me, I am also very familiar with razor burn</li>
            <li> Frankly, it just makes me feel like I have less precise control over the razor.</li>
            <li> I was actually quite pleasantly surprised that it worked on my ankle on the first pass of the area.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much longer 5 blades last than just a normal 3 blade razor.  </li>
            <li> I am also excited to try other Venus razor blades now!</li>
            <li> a one pass operation for my underarms, no more passing and passing over my underarms to assure a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;No con&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Overall I think this is a very well designed product</li>
            <li> I went, razor in hand and all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later after being bit by a million mosquitos, I realized how soft my legs were.</li>
            <li> the moisture serum helped protect sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I was so pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> I really like the extra moisture bar to keep things silky.</li>
            <li> I had completely gotten used to it until I tried the Swirl.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and sometimes end up with irritation.</li>
            <li> The ball really helps to get all those curvy places easily, especially under the arms.</li>
            <li> The water activated moisture strip left my skin very silky without gel or cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m my own worse enemy in that sense &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> The Flexiball was a nice feature moving over my knee cap and behind the bend of my knee, no nicks, cuts, or pulling hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for my arm pits since it markets itself as a good razor for curvy areas and my arm pits are really hard for me to get a complete shave due to</li>
            <li> The 5 blades provided such a close shave, and it was a closer shave than I&#x27;ve tried with the normal 3 blades!</li>
            <li> Scroll down to my quick pros and cons list!):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor for all women, especially those looking who want smooth legs and long lasting shaving results.</li>
            <li> I think most women would actually find that they need to shave less often with such a close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for just under a month now, and it is definitely time for a new blade, so</li>
            <li> Next area to test it on was the underarm area, again it worked quite effortlessly without much manipulation or extra attention needing to be paid to this area.  </li>
            <li> Before trying this Venus razor, I used individual razors (such as the Schick quattro), which are much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I just wish they wouldn&#x27;t have dried out so quickly.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this razor a full five stars is because I got a little skin irritation one of the times I used it, but I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I usually use the original Venus razor</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommendation: I would recommend this razor for anyone wanting to shave their bikini area, but for other bodily locations, a normal razor would do just fine (maybe even a little better/</li>
            <li> When I used it I barely felt a thing</li>
            <li> After shaving, it left my skin feeling smooth, not feeling dry or itchy like my previous razor.</li>
            <li> Simple to open, simple to take out, and overall very user-friendly.</li>
            <li> I received this razor for free through Gillette to try and seriously couldn&#x27;t be happier about it.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, I&#x27;m surprised it took so long to get a flexible woman&#x27;s razor.</li>
            <li> The only downfall to this razor is that the blades didn&#x27;t last as long as I thought they would have, especially for their high price tag.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I will most likely recommend this shaver to family &amp; friends that need a razor &amp; I shall be ordering the blade refills when my other is dull &amp; will update this review if it does not continue to fulfill my needs.  </li>
            <li> As well, the way it moves (slight rotation from side to side) doesn’t really make sense to me for the areas I shave (legs and underarms).</li>
            <li> But I have to shave mine every day, this one not really long - lasting shave</li>
            <li> I got a close shave, with the 5 blades and the micro comb, and it left my skin soft and silky, not at all dry.</li>
            <li> I often find with other lower quality razors that I have to push hard on my skin to get the silky smooth result I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> I also love the price and the fact that there is much less waste then my disposable razors i was using previously.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t last long enough</li>
            <li> I usually go with the mens razors because I feel like they give a smoother shave, but this one really did the trick.</li>
            <li> The swirl handle has soft rubber where you place your index finger, and I feel like I have less control as it wiggles under my finger.</li>
            <li> I have not been shaving much these past few years because of sensitive skin &amp; what not.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the blades will dull or become a real strain on your wallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Value: About the same as any other Venus razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I may also try other Venus razor heads, especially ones with serums and/or 5 blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the added smoothness that the stuff around the razor adds, but like any other it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> The swivel ball noticeably helped in more tedious areas like underarms and bikini to still get a close shave without nicking and/or missing spots.  </li>
            <li> I was using a different brand but was getting annoyed by the closeness of the shave, and my skin was very irritated.  </li>
            <li> With 5 blades and a thick moisture bar that surrounds them, I highly recommend these to any woman for the closest shave yet.</li>
            <li> When I used it on my legs, I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a different from my regular Gillette Venus razor, except that I found the &amp;#34;microfine comb&amp;#34; to be a little irritating and</li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;ve had it about 3 weeks and the head is starting to wear down.</li>
            <li> Other razors that I have tried in the past aren&#x27;t easy to go around those tough to shave places</li>
            <li> It easily around the knee and ankle without cutting or nicking your skin.</li>
            <li> My previous blades were also by Venus, however they were only 3 blades.</li>
            <li> so I wish it would last a little longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other Venus razors in the past and I was not impressed with the look and feel of this razor.</li>
            <li> I shaved Saturday morning, and today is Tuesday (3 days later), and all I have is a little stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually had a difficult time shaving my legs with it because the Flexiball made the razor veer from side to side instead of going straight up the leg.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time as expected.</li>
            <li> , it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> After only a few uses, the MoistureGlide Serum wears off.</li>
            <li> Men have had this technology for a while now (which does make sense, considering that the beard area is harder to navigate than something like the leg area.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No thanks</li>
            <li> still have a few shaves left after using every other day for two weeks.  </li>
            <li> The blades stay sharp longer than I expected as well.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to say how long each head will last</li>
            <li> Not sure how long the serum will last, I have seen it decreasing and the shave quality degrades slightly.</li>
            <li> all due to the moisture bar.  </li>
            <li> It may not seem rough to you at all!</li>
            <li> I had never even considered trying any other blades, I just figured the ones I was using were doing their job.</li>
            <li> Due to the flexible head, the razor works wonders around the contours of your body (knees, ankles, etc.); ensuring that you won&#x27;t cut yourself--or even worry about doing so.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can use any other Gillette Venus refill on this .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Utility: To me, this seemed to be on par with other Venus razors I have tried.</li>
            <li> I felt like I did not get as close a shave as I do with other razors.</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotion from the brand and was pretty skeptical because I have used men&#x27;s razors for years to get a closer shave.</li>
            <li> It would take me a little getting used to as I have used the same refillable razor for 4-5 years that feels a little smoother against my skin when I shave.</li>
            <li> it is on, which only moves a small amount, but has everything to do with the water-activated MoistureGlide serum.</li>
            <li> It felt a little rough to shave with although it gave a close shave with no nicks or scratching.</li>
            <li> However, I believe this one shaves a little closer which could explain the rough feeling.</li>
            <li> but I feel it should last at least a month.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a cover to protect the blades once you take them out of the package.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about the refills is the price.</li>
            <li> although it&#x27;s really sharp!</li>
            <li> I typically use disposables and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Which happens sometimes with my previous brands.</li>
            <li> (previously every darn day)</li>
            <li> And I found myself having to shave less often because how close of a shave</li>
            <li> I usually have trouble getting some hairs by my ankle area &amp; it is next to impossible to get them all in this area unless I really work on it.  </li>
            <li> The moisturizer lasts even when it comes in contact with a little water, I don&#x27;t have to worry about razor burn because it keeps my skin</li>
            <li> It did not seem as &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; as the other venus razors I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Bending over to shave my legs is difficult and painful, so the quicker the process goes, and the fewer strokes I have to make, the better!</li>
            <li> Overall, I was not very impressed with this razor.</li>
            <li> I have received a few razors</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize what I was missing.</li>
            <li> I not an everyday user</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have any problems with hair left behind on nicks.</li>
            <li> Well now I know on what I was missing out on!</li>
            <li> I usually use the BIC Soliel disposable style razors.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to shave for a few days!  </li>
            <li> I honestly usually use men&#x27;s razors, but these blades get the job done as well as any man&#x27;s razor.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s uneven shaving surface, my pits form crevasses in itself when I try to get them hair-free!</li>
            <li> I usually use a shave club for my razors</li>
            <li> I feel like the blade is really manageable and the control you have is crazy!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on purchasing a refiller package when my cartridge goes dull</li>
            <li> but I would hardly describe as a swirl.</li>
            <li> ; on and it hardly even moves on the ball.</li>
            <li> The flexiball itself was plastic and seemed really hard to move.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my G/F, she said these were at least 12 dollars cheaper than any store she goes to.</li>
            <li> and I have thick course hair.</li>
            <li> No more Knicks or cuts around my ankles, Achilles or behind the knee.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> shave gel to use with this product, but found it unnecessary, especially due to the MoistureGlide serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now I know why people do, and I definitely will not go back to those awful disposable razors.</li>
            <li> With that said, it also seems to be an absurd amount of plastic for just one razor, so it also seems a little wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aesthetics:</li>
            <li> They didnt pull the hair or cut me or anything bad like that they just seemed really rough to me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a game changer</li>
            <li> is unnecessary</li>
            <li> so I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that it was a bit slippery towards the end of the handle, so you had to hold it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not work well with the contour of my knee.</li>
            <li> I was definitely not impressed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, even the expensive ones do.</li>
            <li> If anything the little swivel ball is annoying!</li>
            <li> I kept thinking that I was cutting myself</li>
            <li> I am here to tell you how wrong I was!</li>
            <li> /&gt;-FLEXIBALL handle makes precision control impossible</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed, but I wasn&#x27;t &#x27;wowed&#x27; either.</li>
            <li> However, the swirl part was very disappointing to me.</li>
            <li> As well, the way the rubber is shaped, it digs up under my fingernail-which I find painful!</li>

            <li> happy to have the extra blades around when I need them. Arrived on time as expected.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product free by BzzAgent. It is a nice product overall and gets the job done. Happy with the product and will buy again in the future!</li>
            <li> I just got this razor in a bzzkit as a promotional free be and let me just say I love everything about this razor. I got a close shave, with the 5 blades and the micro comb, and it left my skin soft and silky, not at all dry. Also, with the swivel on it it made it effortless to get around every nook and curve. I also love the price and the fact that there is much less waste then my disposable razors i was using previously. I have already bought refills because I am so excited to make this my one and only razor. . Have only been using the razor for about a couple weeks so it&#x27;s hard to say how long each head will last but I feel it should last at least a month. I am very happy to have had the chance to sample this razor because otherwise I never would have known the difference this razor would make. Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li> I was very honored to try this product free from Gillette. I normally don&#x27;t use disposable razors because of cost and time. I use electric one, disposables never give me a clean shave and they don&#x27;t last long enough or they just break. This razor has me second guessing my opinion on basic razors. The best feature is the moisture bar on the razor its self, i normally nick myself multiple times with a basic razor if i don&#x27;t use a load of shaving cream, so to test this product I used it without and managed to get no nicks all due to the moisture bar.  If you use basic razors normally, I would give this a try for sure, and even if you use electric like myself, it was still worth it. I honesty didn&#x27;t notice the roller ball to do anything special, besides look cool. But it got me interested into trying it so it works! Give this razor a try. I&#x27;m planning on purchasing a refiller package when my cartridge goes dull (its lasted a decent amount of time so far) and I&#x27;ve never done that with an razor before!</li>
            <li> best razor I have ever tried love the feel of my skin after shaving</li>
            <li> At first, I was quite intrigued with this razor and was eager to get it in the mail. Btw guys, I got this free thanks to Gillette and bzzagent! Alright, so at first I was excited to learn what this flexiball technology was all about and honestly, it wasn&#x27;t what I expected. It only really flexs left and right. However, even just that little extra flex was awesome compared to most other razors I&#x27;ve ever used. It flows very smoothly any where you need to shave, YES even your knees! Lol I also really liked the fact that it has 5 blade. I only buy razors with 5 blades! But as much as I love thw flexibility, the 5 blades and how easy it is to use, I was not impressed with the quality of the blades. They didnt pull the hair or cut me or anything bad like that they just seemed really rough to me. iif the blade quality and the price for the refills were changed I will deffinitly buy again and dont be discouraged about that because we all have different skin! It may not seem rough to you at all! So it is deffinitly worth it to give it a try!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!! I was able to try it for free thanks to Gillette, and I honestly love it. Both legs are completely smooth after one pass. I was able to save much faster and I got better results. I didn&#x27;t get that &amp;#34;tugging&amp;#34; feeling like with other razors, it was very smooth and comfortable. Only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a cover to protect the blades once you take them out of the package.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product free by BzzAgent in exchange for my honest opinion. I have tried many different types of razors but I prefer men&#x27;s razors. I feel they always cut closer, do a better job, and last longer. Wow this product blew my socks off! It&#x27;s the smoothest shave I have ever gotten. I love that it&#x27;s flexible which I feel helps with the closer shave. If it holds up to the test of time I will certainly buy it from now on.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free thanks to Gillette... I have to say I don&#x27;t think there is really anything special about this razor. I typically use disposables and will continue to do so. I got the same results with the Venus Swirl. Also, I don&#x27;t see that the &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34; really does that much for getting a better shave.</li>
            <li> I received these razor blades to test out from Venus. It&#x27;s been a couple of months that I have been using them now and There is no going back for me! My previous blades were also by Venus, however they were only 3 blades. I had never even considered trying any other blades, I just figured the ones I was using were doing their job. Well now I know on what I was missing out on! Closer shave &#x3D; smooth legs for days! This 5 blade razor refill is a must have if you are like me and your legs start to feel poky by the end of the night. I&#x27;m in love with my smooth legs tonight!</li>
            <li> I got this razor sent for a review. I honestly have always used the cheapest women&#x27;s razors that are 3 or 4 blades with a normal moisturizer strip.  But this razor is amazing! I have used it 3 times now and I don&#x27;t notice the swivel effect on it but the amount of moisture strips on it make you feel like your not even shaving. This is an amazing razor! Only downside is that it does not come with a cap so when you set it on the shower area it sticks because of all the moisturizers on it but it does come off. Honestly a great razor!</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with this product. When I used it I barely felt a thing and it got the job done perfectly. I will definitely be buying Gillette brands more often. I also got this product free from Gillette.</li>
            <li> I got this product free thanks to gillette! I actually am NOT a fan of this razor! Didn&#x27;t think it got any better of a shave. If anything the little swivel ball is annoying!</li>
            <li> I received an his product to try for free from Gillette and I was pretty impressed. I usually use the BIC Soliel disposable style razors. I loved how this worked better over my knees and bikini lines compared to the BIC. I didn&#x27;t feel that it got as close a shave as I do with the BIC but I did feel a lot softer on my legs because of it. I will definitely continue to use it as long as the cartridges&#x27; are with in a good price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the Gillette Venus Swirl!  I got to try a sample free through BzzAgent and I am definitely glad I accepted the campaign.  I found that even without shaving cream I got a smooth shave that left my legs feeling silky.  I am also happy to report that with the special head and blade design there were no nicks or cuts even while shaving hurriedly in the morning before work!</li>
            <li> I tried this razor through a promotion and had high hopes.  Unfortunately, it did not work well with the contour of my knee. The MoistureGlide Serum was too high during the first use and ended up keeping the blades too far from the skin.  I thought it would work better the second use, it was better, but not as good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I loved this razor! It left my legs feeling super soft. The easy grip handle made it easy to glide over legs without leaving a nick on my legs. Which happens sometimes with my previous brands. Having the blades not miss a hair keeps you from having to shave so quick again. This is the razor for me!</li>
            <li> Awesome product i actually was going to go buy one but every time I went to the store they was sold out!!!! Thanks to bzzagent i finally got one!!! Go venus for making the perfect razor for women!!!</li>
            <li> This razor was amazing!!! I was lucky enough to try free of charge. 5 contour blades don&#x27;t miss a hair, I shaved once no second strokes. It gets all the unwanted hairs the 1st time. Water activated serum makes shaving easy and painless. Found my new razor!!</li>
            <li> thanks to Gillette Venus i got try  this razor  and discover my new best friend before i used to shave every day so i don&#x27;t get the pump hair on my legs after i try this i was amazing been 3 days and no hair show  ..the 5 blades and the moisture serum slide to your skin .</li>
            <li> I tried this product for free from buzz agent and I love this product very much it&#x27;s a nice smith shave and moves witch is awesome.</li>
            <li> The Venus Swirl results in an incredibly close shave and keeps your legs feeling silky smooth for hours. Due to the flexible head, the razor works wonders around the contours of your body (knees, ankles, etc.); ensuring that you won&#x27;t cut yourself--or even worry about doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Venus Swirl is an amazing razor when it comes to a close shave, but it doesn&#x27;t last long. After only a few uses, the MoistureGlide Serum wears off. Not only does it become less effective, but the gel becomes sticky. If you can afford to purchase a new cartridge after every two or three shaves, this might be the perfect razor for you. Otherwise, the blades will dull or become a real strain on your wallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this razor as a free promotion from Gilette, but I did not let this become a bias that affected my review*</li>
            <li> I like these blades a lot.</li>
            <li> I got the Gillette Venus swirl free from Gillette and asked my honest opinion on how I liked the razor.  I have received a few razors I. The past from other companies and loved them, but this Gillette swirl I LOVE!! I love how smooth it glides over your skin and how it contours when you move from side to side. I love that it has 5 sharp blades and get a super close shave. I would buy this razor if I hadn&#x27;t received it for free, I will def be purchasing the refills for this razor.</li>
            <li> I got my Gillette swirl by being a BzzAgent!! I have used tons of razors and this little beauty has been BY FAR my favorite razor! I don&#x27;t cut myself while shaving, it glides wonderfully across my skin and leaves my legs feeling amazingly soft!! I will absolutely be continuing to use this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor! It&#x27;s amazing! It makes things so easy because it turns/moves with the contour of your body while shaving, instead of being stuck in one direction. It&#x27;s 5 blades get every hair in one glide. It&#x27;s truly an amazing razor, the best I&#x27;ve tried! I was able to try it for free thanks to Gillette!</li>
            <li> So Ive used this for several weeks now. I have to say i wasn&#x27;t that impress with it. The blades were great, but the ball feature, ( i was thinking dyson vacuum cleaner) doesn&#x27;t really give a whole lot of movement. Unless mine was tampered with but i didn&#x27;t think it allowed for it to cut edges so to speak.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free thanks to Gillette, and it&#x27;s a great razor! It gives me a great, clean shave with no nicks or missed spots. The only downfall to this razor is that the blades didn&#x27;t last as long as I thought they would have, especially for their high price tag.&lt;br /&gt;One thing is for sure, this razor will give you a great shave, but it will come at a steep price.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be picked for this freeie thanks to Gillette and BzzAgent. I like the roller ball handle but I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the blades . I do like that I can use any other Gillette Venus refill on this . I don&#x27;t think this is a game changer and  I wouldn&#x27;t go run out and buy this.</li>
            <li> This razor has to be one of my favorite razors that I have ever used. And, this is the first time that I have ever tried a Venus razor. I love how it just glides on skin ( compared to other disposable razors) and it didn&#x27;t leave any leftover hair. It left my legs so soft and perfect, ready to go! The packaging was very easy to open and the grip of the razor is very good and easy to use. The other reason why I loved this razor was the design on it! I would totally recommend this to someone and make them go and buy one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And thanks to Gillette for this awesome product!</li>
            <li> Gillette gave me this razor to try for free so I am writing this review to share my thoughts. Great product! The flexball handle is comfortable and easy to use. I was able to use the same cartridge for about 3 weeks. After the first couple uses, the shave isn&#x27;t quite as close as it was originally so I wish it would last a little longer. All in all, it was a good product that I could see myself buying in the future. Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li> I received this razor to try &amp; review from Gillette Venus.  When asked to review this I was already using the original Venus razor &amp; that is my go to razor.  I knew that the Gillette Venus brand was good, the only product in the line I do not like is the Venus throw away razor disposables.  Anyway, I received the Venus Swirl &amp; it has a unique design due to the silver roller ball in the middle of the razor, it is suggested that the razor can pivot into hard to reach, more curvy, sensitive areas &amp; do a better job than the other razors in the line or that are available from other manufacturers.  I like the design &amp; tested it out. It does seem to get those areas that I had a bit more trouble shaving with the traditional/original venus shaver.  I usually have trouble getting some hairs by my ankle area &amp; it is next to impossible to get them all in this area unless I really work on it.  This was the area I was really checking to see if the Swirl would live up to its marketing....I was actually quite pleasantly surprised that it worked on my ankle on the first pass of the area.  Next area to test it on was the underarm area, again it worked quite effortlessly without much manipulation or extra attention needing to be paid to this area.  I will most likely recommend this shaver to family &amp; friends that need a razor &amp; I shall be ordering the blade refills when my other is dull &amp; will update this review if it does not continue to fulfill my needs.  Thank you Gillette for another well designed product for women :)</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I am trying this product for free, thanks to Gillette, and it has been a great experience.  This razor glides super smooth and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; like other razors, leaving no nasty bumps or razor burn.  It easily maneuvers around knee and ankle bones, which was important to me when looking to review this razor.  Other razors that I have tried in the past aren&#x27;t easy to go around those tough to shave places and I tended to &amp;#34;nick&amp;#34; my skin.  The blade on this Venus product is also great because I don&#x27;t need to go back over any spots - it gets it all the first time and I don&#x27;t have to shave for a few days!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Definitely my favorite razors. No nicks or cuts, no razor burn, and no shave gel needed!</li>
            <li> I love this razor! I tried it for free thanks to a promotion from Gillette. I have always purchased the cheap disposable razors. They don&#x27;t last long and they hurt sometimes, but I couldn&#x27;t see spending any more money on razors. Now I know why people do, and I definitely will not go back to those awful disposable razors. I will be refilling cartridges for this razor instead. It glides so smoothly on my skin without any shaving cream at all; I can&#x27;t even feel that I am shaving. It also contours really nicely, so I have not cut myself at all (I normally nick a knee or ankle pretty regularly). Love this razor!</li>
            <li> Full disclosure... I am trying the product for free thanks to Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;The Venus swirl razor is a great product. I normally use bic soleil razors, which do get the job done, however, the Venus swirl just does a better job.&lt;br /&gt;I really love the moisturizing strip that comes with these blades. The moisturizer lasts even when it comes in contact with a little water, I don&#x27;t have to worry about razor burn because it keeps my skin so hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;The ball that this razor is designed around is pretty special as well. This allows a better, safer shave, IMHO. No more Knicks or cuts around my ankles, Achilles or behind the knee.&lt;br /&gt;Also a one pass operation for my underarms, no more passing and passing over my underarms to assure a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;No con&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I received this from Gillette to try and give my opinion. This is by far the best razor I have ever used. I have been using the Gillette Venus Brand for years- in fact probably over 10 years. I have tried many of their different models and have liked some more than others. This is the best one that i have used yet! I feel like it glides super easily- and it gets a super close shave. I am 8 months pregnant- so shaving has become quite the task, and with this razor I can do it much easier. I feel like the blade is really manageable and the control you have is crazy!</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I was able to try this product for free thanks to Gillette! I was excited as anyone else would be to try a new razor, but the new features seemed pretty cool, so I immediately went to try it. When I used it on my legs, I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a different from my regular Gillette Venus razor, except that I found the &amp;#34;microfine comb&amp;#34; to be a little irritating and I kept thinking that I was cutting myself (I wasn&#x27;t). Besides that irritation, just like my other razors, I got a good shave and didn&#x27;t have any cuts. However, I WAS much happier with it when I tried it on my armpits. They are usually my most difficult shave because of the divots and just simply having stubborn hair. I actually got an amazing shave without having to stretch and pull at my skin to get every hair. That function alone is going to get me to buy this razor again.</li>
            <li> These razor blades when combined with the Venus Swirl razor are amazing!  I recently had the opportunity to try these free in a promotion from Gillette.  I honestly usually use men&#x27;s razors, but these blades get the job done as well as any man&#x27;s razor.  With 5 blades and a thick moisture bar that surrounds them, I highly recommend these to any woman for the closest shave yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit. I enjoy Gillette products. I&#x27;m also a razor snob. This product lived up to my expectations. I received one to test and my first thought was, oh... another razor. What&#x27;s the difference? Well. Let me tell you. I didn&#x27;t realize what I was missing. The ball really helps the head rotate and get an incredibly close shave. Arms, lwga, bikini area.... smooth. That being said, I&#x27;ve had it about 3 weeks and the head is starting to wear down. I not an everyday user so I was a little disappointed. However it makes up for that with an amazingly close shave. Get it. I really don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> As a razor I really liked the Gillette Swirl. It was very sharp and definitely one of the best razors I have used in a while. However, the swirl part was very disappointing to me. From the commercials and the advertisements I have seen I was expecting the head of the razor to actually swivel and that is not the case. It moves ever so slightly left and right but I would hardly describe as a swirl. Overall I loved the razor but I dont like that its advertised to have this ball it &amp;#34;swirls&amp;#34; on and it hardly even moves on the ball.</li>
            <li> Best razor EVER. I got this for free but now for life I will pay money for them. Superior to other razors, hands down. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Love this razor it works magic love how it leaves my legs smooth and very easy to get in the hard places like by your ankles it&#x27;s my favorite razor thanks to gillette for letting me try it for free</li>
            <li> I like that the Venus Swirl razors have 5 blades and that they are very smooth and gentle on your skin. This product made shaving so much easier and enjoyable for me. I would recommend this product to anyone and will purchase for myself. I was able to try this product for free from Gillette Venus through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I am a woman but I&#x27;ve never been into using woman&#x27;s razors in my opinion mens razors always provided the closest smoothest shave for me without cuts and now that I&#x27;ve gotten to try this razor, I am in love and never going back to men&#x27;s razors it has everything I look for in a razor. It has five blades and a water activated serum around the whole razor head for and smooth moisturizing shave with out getting all slimy. My legs were so smooth and soft like silk when I was done.This razor is amazing all around I did receive it free from Venus and buzz agent along with the The Venus violet swirl with the touch of a Olay shave gel to review and give my option and experience but in no way was I influenced, this is my own review and experience with the Gillette Venus swirl razor heads</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally splurge on razors, but this one is really worth the money. BuzzAgent and Venus sent this product for me to try &amp; I love it! No more cheap throwaway razors for me! I&#x27;m a Venus Swirl girl now. This razor makes shaving feel like a spa treat. It adds something pretty and special to my shaving routine. One of my favorite features is the MoistureGlide serum which makes the blade effortlessly glide over your skin for a smooth moisturized silky smooth shave. For the first time in years, I was able to shave and received on nicks or cuts on my legs! For more of my product reviews and buying guides, visit: http://melindalongoria.hubpages.com/</li>
            <li> The Venus swirl is fabulous. I have had the chance to try the razor free thanks to Gillette. It really does make it easy to getting the shaving done quick and easy while reaching all the areas needed. I would def recommend to others :)&lt;br /&gt;JB from PA</li>
            <li> Bought these for my G/F, she said these were at least 12 dollars cheaper than any store she goes to. True Product, exactly the same as sold in stores.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive the Venus Swirl razor free to try and review from Gillette, and I must say that I was not disappointed. The razor arrived in a very pretty and feminine package. Not only was the package visually appealing, it was was incredibly easy to open. I wish all razors (and plastic packages) were that easy to open. However, I may never need to buy another razor again. The Swirl has so many great characteristics. I love the 5 blade design. Along with the MoistureGlide Serum it captures every hair for a close shave. The FlexiBall is terrific for tricky spots like the bikini area. The ball didn&#x27;t make a huge difference when shaving my legs, but the razor itself was great on my legs. I think most women would actually find that they need to shave less often with such a close shave. I would recommend this razor for all women, especially those looking who want smooth legs and long lasting shaving results.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as a promotion from Venus, and I must say I was pretty impressed.&lt;br /&gt;When I received the package, it was easy to open. I noticed that this razor was bigger than most razors, but it&#x27;s because of the 5 blade head. The 5 blades provided such a close shave, and it was a closer shave than I&#x27;ve tried with the normal 3 blades! I was really happy and most impressed about that. The razor handle itself seemed simple as first glace. The thing I was most surprised about was the flexiball, I thought it would move more with your body and go with the curves, but it didn&#x27;t as much as I thought it would which was kind of disappointing. There&#x27;s nothing that was really different about the handle than any others, but it gets the job done. I did notice that after my shave, I would be left kind of dry, but I have super sensitive skin. The dryness can be easily gone with lotion, but it&#x27;s way worth it after the close shave you get after using these blades!</li>
            <li> When I received the Venus Swirl in the mail as part of a promotion from Gillette I was ecstatic to try it out. I opened the packaging immediately and loved how lightweight and comfortable the grip was. I was a little disappointed that it was a bit slippery towards the end of the handle, so you had to hold it just right or your razor would slip when shaving. When I used this razor, I paired it with the Gillette with Olay Violet Swirl shave gel and it was the best shave I have had in a long time. It was a close shave, my legs were smooth, and the swivel of the handle really helped to cut down on nicks where you normally would worry. (Ankles, knees, etc.)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor! The refills are a great value. Previously I would purchase men&#x27;s razors to get that nice, close, smooth feeling. Now I no longer have to do that. I got to try this razor free thanks to Bzzagent. I&#x27;ll never go back to a men&#x27;s razor again.</li>
            <li> I received a $4.00 off coupon thanks to Venus through BzzAgent. I absolutely love this razor. You get a super close shave with no knicks or cuts. The moisture bands make for a very smooth shave as well. I just wish they wouldn&#x27;t have dried out so quickly. The blades stay sharp longer than I expected as well. Pick this as your new go to razor!</li>
            <li> Venus Swirl Razors are amazing...Best I have ever used!  And will continue to use this product, leaves your legs soft and smooth and keeps them that way for far longer than any other product I have used.</li>
            <li> I love the Gillette Venus swirl! It&#x27;s really sharp and it makes my legs really smooth, I love how it swivels easily in my hands. It&#x27;s a bonus that it has such a pretty design! I got this product from bzzagent as part of a promotion from the brand to try and I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I got this gillette swirl womens razor for free from buzzagent and was asked for my honest opinion i think this razor is the only one ive tried that gives me the closest shave i dont really think it gives a nice smell like ive hurd but it does have a nice feel and leaves my legs feeling soft so i would recommend this to all my friends</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good razor and I would by it again</li>
            <li> I was able to try this razor free thanks to Gillette and Bzzagent.com. I was really excited to try this razor. Once I received the razor I immediately tried it out. I was definitely not impressed. The flexiball itself was plastic and seemed really hard to move. I&#x27;ve used many other Venus razors in the past and I was not impressed with the look and feel of this razor. The razor felt cheap and poorly made. It did not seem as &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; as the other venus razors I have used in the past. The razor did not &amp;#34;swirl&amp;#34; like I would expect it to. As for the blades, I felt as though I get a closer shave with my husband&#x27;s razors that we order from dollar shave club. Overall, I was not very impressed with this razor.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product free by the courtesy of BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great! When you first try to see the flexibility of the ball portion of the razor it seems that it only moves about three millimeters each way. However, when you use this on a part that traditional razors have a hard time conforming to, it&#x27;s great at doing so. It easily around the knee and ankle without cutting or nicking your skin. The moisture bar on the razor head leaves your skin feeling very smooth even if you don&#x27;t use shaving cream. I especially love the microcomb on the razor head, it helps guide those longer hairs towards the blades rather than just making it lay the other way. Overall I think this is a very well designed product and I would get it again. It may just replace my Schick razor!</li>
            <li> I got this free to review from bzzagent but I will definetly be buying it in the future! I looove this razor! I use to think -shrug- what&#x27;s the big deal a razor is a razor....soooo not the case my legs are sooooo smooth and I didn&#x27;t cut myself!!! Or have to go over and over the same nspots!!</li>
            <li> Gillette gave me this product for free, so here&#x27;s my review :)&lt;br /&gt;I am known for putting everything off until the last second. So dry shaving is not new to me, I am also very familiar with razor burn&lt;br /&gt;Monday I had an appointment and went to walk out the door in my shorts, until I noticed the jungle of hair on my legs!! I received the Venus swirl razor over the weekend and figures what better time than now to open it up and try it out!&lt;br /&gt;So right there on my front porch I rushed to shave and off I went, razor in hand and all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later after being bit by a million mosquitos, I realized how soft my legs were. And NO razor burn!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since used this razor in the shower like it was probably intended to do, and it&#x27;s just a fabulous!! No complaints here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good by disposables, hello Venus swirl :)</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free thanks to Gillette! I absolutely LOVE this razor! I love that not a lot of pressure is required to get great results. I often find with other lower quality razors that I have to push hard on my skin to get the silky smooth result I&#x27;m looking for. That is definitely not the case with the Venus Swirl! After shaving, my legs were silky smooth and I was very impressed with the results. Will definitely recommend and will definitely continue to purchase! Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li> The blades are great. I have not been cut by them not 1 time. It curve to your legs and underarms. Perfect for shaving.</li>
            <li> Used the Venus Swirl for over two weeks, instead of &amp;#34;borrowing&amp;#34; my husbands Schick (because men&#x27;s razors always seem better than women&#x27;s).  The five blades are great for a close, even shave and the moisture serum helped protect sensitive skin.  The swivel ball noticeably helped in more tedious areas like underarms and bikini to still get a close shave without nicking and/or missing spots.  I&#x27;ll be picking up some replacement blades to continue use once this one wears out...still have a few shaves left after using every other day for two weeks.  Thanks to Gillette for the free product trial!</li>
            <li> I got the chance to try this product free thanks to Gillette through Bzzagent. I was so pleasantly surprised by this product. Even though the swivel ball doesn&#x27;t move as much as i thought it would it still makes the shaving experience more pleasant. This razor gives such a smooth easy shave and i will definitely purchase in the future!</li>
            <li> Gillette very graciously gave me a free razor to try out and review, so here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: Very easy to work with. Simple to open, simple to take out, and overall very user-friendly. With that said, it also seems to be an absurd amount of plastic for just one razor, so it also seems a little wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aesthetics: The packaging looks nice, and the razor has that classic feminine Venus feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Utility: To me, this seemed to be on par with other Venus razors I have tried. The major difference of the Flexiball did not have a huge impact on me since I primarily used it to shave my legs and armpits, however, I can see how this would be very useful in more difficult to reach areas like the bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value: About the same as any other Venus razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall thoughts: It is a very nice razor, but does not really cater to me. I actually had a difficult time shaving my legs with it because the Flexiball made the razor veer from side to side instead of going straight up the leg. I felt like I did not get as close a shave as I do with other razors. Additionally, I&#x27;m surprised it took so long to get a flexible woman&#x27;s razor. Men have had this technology for a while now (which does make sense, considering that the beard area is harder to navigate than something like the leg area.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: I would recommend this razor for anyone wanting to shave their bikini area, but for other bodily locations, a normal razor would do just fine (maybe even a little better/closer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again to Gillette for the complimentary razor!</li>
            <li> These things are amazing! So much moisture! The shave is so close I dont have an armpit shadow and I can go 3 days without shaving! (previously every darn day) I am hooked. I received this as a promotion from the brand and was pretty skeptical because I have used men&#x27;s razors for years to get a closer shave. But now i get that wonderful shave PLUS moisture that we women love.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Venus for allowing me to try out this product!!! The 5 blades make shaving an absolute breeze! They get every hair, never missing and it gets close enough where you don&#x27;t have to shave more than 2 times a week! With my other razor I was shaving a good 4 to 5 times a week. This razor makes shaving quick and easy!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best razor Gillette has come out with.  It glides smooth over your legs and I also do not hAve to replace them as often.</li>
            <li> I got this product free from Venus to try in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying this new 5 blade Venus Swirl razor has opened my eyes to the fact that, although the original 3 blade Venus razor is great, there is so much more available in the world of Venus razors that have the potential to be even better! My review is as follows (In a hurry? Scroll down to my quick pros and cons list!):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the handle is concerned, I like my original Venus handle with the hard plastic where you place your index finger better than the Swirl handle-makes me feel like I have firmer control. The swirl handle has soft rubber where you place your index finger, and I feel like I have less control as it wiggles under my finger. As well, the way the rubber is shaped, it digs up under my fingernail-which I find painful! The FLEXIBALL on the handle of the Swirl doesn’t impress me either. Frankly, it just makes me feel like I have less precise control over the razor. I can’t apply exactly the right pressure because it moves. As well, the way it moves (slight rotation from side to side) doesn’t really make sense to me for the areas I shave (legs and underarms). Up and down would make more sense I think, but I still wouldn’t want that either-as I prefer precise control. As it stands-I fell like the FLEXIBALL might allow the razor head to slip sideways and cause a slice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor head on the Venus Swirl is AH-MAZING! I always thought that 3 blades was all you need, and any more is just a way to make you pay more money. I am here to tell you how wrong I was! The 5 blades on this razor head make shaving so much faster and simpler! I only have to go over each area once to remove hairs (compared to twice with my old 3 blade original Venus) and if I want a super close shave, I only have to go over each area twice (compared to 3 or 4 times with my old 3 blade razor). I don’t feel like I have to apply too much pressure to get a close shave. The MoistureGlide serum on the head is also amazing! When I shave, I do so by simply running water over my legs. I never use any kind of shave gel or cream. Since the MoistureGlide serum is water activated, this is perfect for someone like me. Not sure how long the serum will last, I have seen it decreasing and the shave quality degrades slightly. As a warning, don’t wrap the razor in a towel, it ends up soaking up some of the serum if you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the Swirl razor head/blade is concerned, it is one step to success! This is really helpful to someone like me with disability and chronic pain. Bending over to shave my legs is difficult and painful, so the quicker the process goes, and the fewer strokes I have to make, the better! I highly recommend anyone with pain or disability consider getting a 5 blade razor for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also given Violet swirl shave gel to use with this product, but found it unnecessary, especially due to the MoistureGlide serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found out that all Venus razor heads are compatible with all Venus razor handles, except that the Swirl head isn’t compatible with the Simply Venus handle. This is great news! It means I can get the benefits of the Swirl razor heads, and still use my preferred original razor handle! I am also excited to try other Venus razor blades now! Up next is my quick pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Close, smooth, quick shave&lt;br /&gt;-Water activated MoistureGlide serum on razor head means shave gel is unnecessary&lt;br /&gt;-Razor head is good for the disabled and those with chronic pain due to its efficiency&lt;br /&gt;-Swirl razor heads may be used on all Venus razor handles except the Simply Venus handle&lt;br /&gt;-5 blade razor head outperforms original 3 blade Venus razor head&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-FLEXIBALL handle makes precision control impossible&lt;br /&gt;-FLEXIBALL doesn’t move in a way that is intuitive for a woman’s curves&lt;br /&gt;-The rubber grip for the index finger position on the handlewiggles as you shave, further reducing precision. It also pokes under the fingernail painfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict-I will be getting more of these blades since I got a coupon. I will use them on my old original Venus handle for better stability. I may also try other Venus razor heads, especially ones with serums and/or 5 blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swirl razor head/blade&#x3D;YES!&lt;br /&gt;Swirl razor handle&#x3D;No thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks to Venus I got to try this razor as a test product and I absolutely love it. Gets very close and no nicks,cuts, or razor burn.</li>
            <li> I received this new Venus Swirl razor from the brand for free. After shaving, it left my skin feeling smooth, not feeling dry or itchy like my previous razor. But I have to shave mine every day, this one not really long - lasting shave although it&#x27;s really sharp!</li>
            <li> I received this razor and a blade for free from BzzAgent.com about a month ago and have to say it&#x27;s a good razor. I&#x27;ve been using it for my arm pits since it markets itself as a good razor for curvy areas and my arm pits are really hard for me to get a complete shave due to it&#x27;s uneven shaving surface, my pits form crevasses in itself when I try to get them hair-free! This razor has been the best I&#x27;ve used thus far and hasn&#x27;t knicked me once, and i haven&#x27;t had to replace the head yet! The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this razor a full five stars is because I got a little skin irritation one of the times I used it, but I have really sensitive skin and I didn&#x27;t use any shaving cream or gel... I&#x27;m my own worse enemy in that sense &amp;#62;.&amp;#60; However, all in all, I like this razor and will continue to use it as my go to pit razor. I recommend it to others to try for themselves.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette, I was given the product free to review. I&#x27;ve used it 3 or 4 times now. Generally, it&#x27;s a good razor - I would have given it five stars except for the way it felt on my skin. It felt a little rough to shave with although it gave a close shave with no nicks or scratching. It would take me a little getting used to as I have used the same refillable razor for 4-5 years that feels a little smoother against my skin when I shave. However, I believe this one shaves a little closer which could explain the rough feeling. I shaved Saturday morning, and today is Tuesday (3 days later), and all I have is a little stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Flexes well&lt;br /&gt;Shaves well around knees and ankles&lt;br /&gt;Gave a good close shave with no nicking or skin bumps/irritation afterwards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t like the way it felt against my skin as I shaved even though it didn&#x27;t give me any cuts</li>
            <li> This razor left me with super soft legs, just in time time for summer! And I found myself having to shave less often because how close of a shave I was getting so that&#x27;s always an added bonus! Thanks to Gillette for giving me the opportunity to try this product for free!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette, I was able to try this razor out for free! I have not been shaving much these past few years because of sensitive skin &amp; what not. I usually go with the mens razors because I feel like they give a smoother shave, but this one really did the trick. My skin was not irritated after using it, and it felt almost as smooth as the mens razor. I really like the extra moisture bar to keep things silky.</li>
            <li> I received this razor for free through Gillette to try and seriously couldn&#x27;t be happier about it.  I have really sensitive skin and the disposable razors I normally get will constantly leave me with nicks or irritation. I had completely gotten used to it until I tried the Swirl. I can honestly say I will never go back to disposables again. The Swirl gets such a close shave and the blade doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. The swivel in it allows you to shave your knees or bikini area without having to worry about nicking yourself. Seriously such an amazing product and I will be a constant supporter.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough about this razor! This has been the best shave experience I have had in a LONG time! I love how smooth my legs are. I have sensitive skin and sometimes end up with irritation. My experience with this razor as changed my pick on my regular razor. This razor has lasted me a while and I have thick course hair. I will be buying more in the future. :0)</li>
            <li> Just what I needed :)</li>
            <li> Love this razor! The ball really helps to get all those curvy places easily, especially under the arms. It leaves my legs feeling so soft and smooth. Thanks Venus and Bzzagent for letting me try this for free!!</li>
            <li> I actually got to try this product for free thanks to Gillette.  I had used Gillette razors before and had good results, but I had always used their men&#x27;s products.  I was happily surprised by how smooth the razor felt and how there wasn&#x27;t any tug on my legs.  The MoistureGlide™ Serum, as they call it, is true to its word, and provided a very smooth shave.  However, I felt that it wasn&#x27;t quite as close of a shave that I was used to. I&#x27;ve been using it for just under a month now, and it is definitely time for a new blade, so it didn&#x27;t last me quite as long as the packaging said it would, but I also shave more than 2 times a week like the packaging uses for their life time estimations. Overall, I think it is a good product!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product free from Gillette for my honest opinion. While I loved the fact that the head moves with the curves of my legs, I wouldn&#x27;t rate this much higher than other razors because of the high (and ongoing) price. Before trying this Venus razor, I used individual razors (such as the Schick quattro), which are much cheaper. I found these do pretty much the same job. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed, but I wasn&#x27;t &#x27;wowed&#x27; either. I think I&#x27;ll go back to my cheaper, simpler razors.  I will add that I have sensitive skin, so most razors give me razor bumps. Unfortunately, even the expensive ones do.</li>
            <li> Awesome blades for an awesome razor! A close shave with no discomfort. Highly recommended.  I received this free from venus.</li>
            <li> I usually use a shave club for my razors but I got to try these free and I am in love. The five blades combined with the moisture serum surround the razor head make for a smooth effortlessly shave. For the best shave I paired it with the violet swirl shave cream. I love these blades and razors.I got to try these free from the company which makes this even better. Thanks Venus.</li>
            <li> I received this  item for free using bzzagent and i thought this would sell me on a more expensive razor blade.However, i dont find  it to be that close of a shave compared to the razor i currently use.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the best razors I have used before!  I received it from Venus to try and I am so glad they did because I am in love with Venus again!  I was using a different brand but was getting annoyed by the closeness of the shave, and my skin was very irritated.  Once I tried this razor, my skin was never cut and never irritated and it provided a super close shave that I have not experience in a long time!  Also, I am not scared with the razor to shave my armpits, knees, ankles and bikini area, and it does not get irritated, which is a huge relief for me!  I will definitely be purchasing this from now on!  Thank you Venus!</li>
            <li> I received one of these razors free and decided to try it out.  I usually use the original Venus razor so I was excited to try the new one.  I&#x27;ve been using the same razor for about a month now and it&#x27;s still amazing!  I can&#x27;t believe how much longer 5 blades last than just a normal 3 blade razor.  It feels super smooth while shaving and I haven&#x27;t cut myself a single time (even my knees and ankles!).  Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I received these as a promotion from Venus. I was very happy with how my legs felt after shaving. I used with and without the Violet Swirl shave gel. The blades provided a close, smooth shave with both. The water activated moisture strip left my skin very silky without gel or cream. The Flexiball was a nice feature moving over my knee cap and behind the bend of my knee, no nicks, cuts, or pulling hair. My only complaint about the refills is the price. It turns an amazing shave into a luxury item and leaves me having to settle with another product, having to choose between half a tank of gas or a silky shave.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this razor free thanks to Venus, but I would have bought this without getting it free because I am always on the hunt for the best razor. I loved this razor, it glided smoothly over my skin and I didn&#x27;t have any problems with hair left behind on nicks. I don&#x27;t think it is so much the ball it is on, which only moves a small amount, but has everything to do with the water-activated MoistureGlide serum. The MoistureGlide serum was really what made this razor for me!</li>
            <li> The Venus swirl refills slide on just as easy as the first razor that comes with the product. They offer a close shave that is painless with no cuts or discomfort. I was happy to get these refills with a coupon thanks to buzz agent and Venus.</li>
            <li> I like the added smoothness that the stuff around the razor adds, but like any other it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I&#x27;d say the blade quality is the same as any venus brand razors. It does its job, but it&#x27;s nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;I received this sample for free and agreed to give an honest opinion</li>
