            <li>this stuff smells so good ,,,it smells just like a orange Julius drink smoothie  </li>

            <li>Good sunscreen for the money.</li>
            <li>Smells great and goes on nice.</li>
            <li>Our family has loved this stuff ever since it came out.  </li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>Even my dermotologist said I am using a good product.</li>
            <li>......have been very pleased with the replacement product.</li>
            <li>When I needed more, I searched Amazon, and to my amazement they had it at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love!</li>
            <li>I love the smell!</li>
            <li>Glad to find a lotion that works!</li>
            <li>We love this product!</li>
            <li>Love Ocean Potion!</li>
            <li>My favorite suntanning lotion!</li>
            <li>It goes on easy without being sticky and has a great smell.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance and feels just like a lotion going on.  </li>
            <li>Price is nice too.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy which I love and it smells good.</li>
            <li>but it smells like orange candy and rubber which might be nice for some but not for me.</li>
            <li>this is the best stuff, smells nice rubs in completely, moisturizes..</li>
            <li>Most importantly it does a great job of preventing sunburn.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the smell is very strong at all.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought we&#x27;d bought a scam product until I saw more reviews here-</li>
            <li>It offers excellent sun protection .</li>
            <li>The smell is that strong!</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and so need sun screen - this is an excellent cream not expensive - I have used it all around the world from the Great Barrier Reef to the Dallas back yard pool - it is my favorite and love their products</li>
            <li>The fragrance is mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li>I generally avoid skin care products with fragrance anyway, but I was so impressed with the rest of the ingredient list</li>
            <li>Furthermore, it doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen, which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d buy two or more</li>
            <li>Ocean potion is such a great brand!  </li>
            <li>Always a favorite love the smell and never greasy</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m buying more from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love that it isn&#x27;t greasy or chalky</li>
            <li>I found this last summer, and it works the best.</li>
            <li>:) .. :)</li>
            <li>I love Ocean Potion and the dreamsickle scent</li>
            <li>If you like to smell overwhelmingly like an orange creamcicle, you might like this.</li>
            <li>Ocean Potion fit that need!  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite sunblock.  </li>
            <li>It works well, dries fast, and smells great.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite sunscreens and it smells like Johnson&#x27;s Baby Aspirin.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The best and only tanning lotion that I will use.</li>
            <li>Seven more needed, what&#x27;s up with that.</li>
            <li>we were in Maui and found out from the scuba instructor the lotion is better than the spray.  </li>
            <li>My favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Definitely age defiant and a wonderful sunscreen</li>
            <li>Our favorite sunlotion.</li>
            <li>I love what it doesn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>Wish this had been more truthful.</li>
            <li>and they work better than many others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>love the smell of it</li>
            <li>My favorite Sunblock.</li>
            <li>I love it and it kept us both from burning on vacation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While I found the fragrance pleasant at first, it overpowered even my high-sillage perfume.  </li>
            <li>It provides high sun protection coverage but still allows a great tan.</li>
            <li>Lotion goes on smoothly, dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and smells good too.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s not quite as nice as the $50 per 3 oz type, but it&#x27;s awesome for an everyday sunscreen if you don&#x27;t want anything too fancy.</li>
            <li>used to be able to buy it, cannot seem to find it in stores in the area, glad it was available online.</li>
            <li>This means you&#x27;ll use it more often, and that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
            <li>The orange spots were on the parts of the shirts on the shoulders,the elbow areas, and parts of the front of the shirt that hit the stomach area,&lt;br /&gt;Other than the orange issue, this product works great as far as protecting peoples skin from getting a sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading this.  </li>
            <li>Good price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>so much is that I know it&#x27;s really good, but it&#x27;s also very creamy and the consistency is like a good face cream, so it blends into my skin easily.</li>
            <li>4 stars to Ocean Potion to protect from sunburn, will continue to use it and buy in the future, really good for you!</li>
            <li>Lathers on easy, not oily.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easily.</li>
            <li>It does a good job preventing sunburns/tans and is decently water resistant.</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on pretty nicely over it.</li>
            <li>Works fine, but the scent is really strong.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and goes on like normal lotion instead of greasy sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It offers very good broad-spectrum protection, and the formulation includes some very skin-friendly ingredients.  </li>
            <li>wife was a dermatology nurse for 30 years and knows how important sunscreen is to preventing skin cancer and premature aging of the skin.</li>
            <li>Fantastic coverage &amp; protection.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, Amazon does.</li>
            <li>Goes on light and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy.  </li>
            <li>The added bonus is that my husband will wear it since it is oxybenzone free (oxybenzone is proven to reduce virility is men).</li>
            <li>All Ocean Potion products are fantastic.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have Oxyclean, I am sure that almost any good, name brand laundry detergent, like \\&quot; Tide, Purex, Cheer, Wisk or ALL \\&quot;, would help if you used them to pre-treat the orange areas, rub it in,and then put the clothes in the washing machine with a capful or 2 of the same laundry detergent.  </li>
            <li>Either my tastes have developed, or they&#x27;ve adjusted the formula, because I really love it now!</li>
            <li>Being able to get it so quick and inexpensive is a real plus!</li>
            <li>and they are very light skinned and don&#x27;t really get a suntan at all</li>
            <li>Although not as important as the stinging issue, the 30 SPF sunblock also seems to be absorbed well by the skin.</li>
            <li>As a a fair skinned red head, with a heavily-tattooed spouse, we&#x27;ve tried everything to keep from getting sunburnt.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I have found some react with my skin  - over the last 3 years I have only been buying ocean potion - my skin loves it - the rest of family and friends love it - it smells pleasant - goes on easily stays on jumping in and out of the pool .</li>
            <li>Soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the &amp;#34;Scent of Sunshine&amp;#34; but my 4-year-old daughter quite likes the smell.</li>
            <li>I buy Ocean Potion skin care products because they smell so fresh</li>
            <li>Imagaine my joy when I discovered I could buy it through Amazon at half the price I&#x27;d been paying!  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen has broad coverage and is very smooth going on.</li>
            <li>Smells great and no more burning.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-greasy (really!) and smells like mangoes which always reminds me of our trip to Hawaii (where I horded sunscreen).  </li>
            <li>I have used this brand for years after first finding it at Myrtle Beach.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thick and something about it saying, &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; makes you feel good about putting on the lotion while basking in the sun!</li>
            <li>There are not a ton of good cruelty-free sunscreens on the market, and many of them are on the expensive side.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind putting it on, and I can&#x27;t really think of higher praise than that for a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I found this sunscreen at a small sundry shop at a lake, and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Make sure it is completely dry on your skin before you put your clothes on</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and never feels greasy like other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>The Ocean Potion suncare products are by far the best - but they&#x27;re hard to find locally.  </li>
            <li>Makes skin very moist.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Her sister is a flight attendant and recommended it to her.  </li>
            <li>+ and really like the product since they do not put perfume in it</li>
            <li>I really like Ocean Potion products and have used them for years.</li>
            <li>had no issues with getting too much sun.  </li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I am 73 years old and have used many different products but \\&quot;hands down\\</li>
            <li>First of all it is made in Florida so that had me very interested in it, second,</li>
            <li>This smells and feels so much better than the other brands we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>was able to get the \\&quot; stains\\&quot; out from using a laundry spot pre-treater and then also I soaked them in the washing machine in hot water with a few scoops of OXYCLEAN and I let the washing machine run for 2 minutes to get a lather going</li>
            <li>The sun is extremely strong there, especially since it is near the equator.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kept me sunburn free all over the place, so as long as they continue to  make it I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li>The main reason I like it</li>
            <li>Got it because it was highly reviewed by Consumer&#x27;s Reports.</li>
            <li>You never find high quality ingredients for a body product at this price point.  </li>
            <li>I live in Canada and you cannot buy it here,</li>
            <li>My wife had a new bathing suit and noticed that it began to deteriorate in spots.</li>
            <li>This brand of sunscreen has been our favorite for several years, but it&#x27;s become harder to find lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter is unable to use other sunscreens and this one worked and smelled wonderful with no allergic reaction!</li>
            <li>Not sure why you need so many words.</li>
            <li>For that wi was disappointed but the priduct is excellent.</li>
            <li>thought I might be able to get past the fragrance, but in truth, I didn&#x27;t finish the tube.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen has all the necessary active ingredients, as most of today&#x27;s sunscreen products do.</li>
            <li>OR if you sweat while you are wearing the lotion, that ingredient ( Avobenzone ) will turn your clothes orange in spots where the clothes touch the skin where it is wet from sweating, especially if the clothes are cotton and light colored or white.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>Was really surprised how well this worked in the sun and water.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly; not greasy; and has mild fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Since it is my first time using similar product, I do not have a standard so can not help about its function.</li>
            <li>It is particularly outstanding in that it stings one&#x27;s eyes a couple of hours after using it much, much less than other sunblocks tried.</li>
            <li>I will never again use another sunscreen, unless no other choice.  </li>
            <li>Buy no other sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Unless you want to spend the big bucks on &amp;#34;all natural ingredient&amp;#34; sunscreens -</li>
            <li>A very faint scent that&#x27;s quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this to every one that  I know due to the fact that it really keeps me protected.  </li>
            <li>&quot; For some reason, depending on where you live, (because of the differences in the water of different regions) Avobenzone can cause a yellow discoloration on white cotton clothing.</li>
            <li>At least now you know there is a way to get rid of the orange stains off a cotton white or light colored shirt.  </li>
            <li>Recently was fishing in wilderness Canada where only one early morning application was an option prior to fishing in the water all day....</li>
            <li>Fill the washing machine with hot water and let it run for a few minutes to work up a lather then turn it off and let soak over night</li>
            <li>The reason I like this brand so much better is the \\&quot;secret sauce,\\&quot; the creamy base that has a great effect on the desirability of the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looks like they have changed packaging now as the new bottles/tubes are Yellow for the 30 spf and they have added other lines (anti-aging, sport etc).</li>

            <li> Nice fragrance and feels just like a lotion going on.  </li>
            <li> Price is nice too.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy which I love and it smells good.</li>
            <li> but it smells like orange candy and rubber which might be nice for some but not for me.</li>
            <li> this is the best stuff, smells nice rubs in completely, moisturizes..</li>
            <li> Most importantly it does a great job of preventing sunburn.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the smell is very strong at all.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought we&#x27;d bought a scam product until I saw more reviews here-</li>
            <li> It offers excellent sun protection .</li>
            <li> The smell is that strong!</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and so need sun screen - this is an excellent cream not expensive - I have used it all around the world from the Great Barrier Reef to the Dallas back yard pool - it is my favorite and love their products</li>
            <li> The fragrance is mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li> I generally avoid skin care products with fragrance anyway, but I was so impressed with the rest of the ingredient list</li>
            <li> Furthermore, it doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen, which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d buy two or more</li>
            <li> Ocean potion is such a great brand!  </li>
            <li> Always a favorite love the smell and never greasy</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m buying more from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love that it isn&#x27;t greasy or chalky</li>
            <li> I found this last summer, and it works the best.</li>
            <li> :) .. :)</li>
            <li> I love Ocean Potion and the dreamsickle scent</li>
            <li> If you like to smell overwhelmingly like an orange creamcicle, you might like this.</li>
            <li> Ocean Potion fit that need!  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunblock.  </li>
            <li> It works well, dries fast, and smells great.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite sunscreens and it smells like Johnson&#x27;s Baby Aspirin.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> The best and only tanning lotion that I will use.</li>
            <li> Seven more needed, what&#x27;s up with that.</li>
            <li> we were in Maui and found out from the scuba instructor the lotion is better than the spray.  </li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Definitely age defiant and a wonderful sunscreen</li>
            <li> Our favorite sunlotion.</li>
            <li> I love what it doesn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> Wish this had been more truthful.</li>
            <li> and they work better than many others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> love the smell of it</li>
            <li> My favorite Sunblock.</li>
            <li> I love it and it kept us both from burning on vacation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I found the fragrance pleasant at first, it overpowered even my high-sillage perfume.  </li>
            <li> It provides high sun protection coverage but still allows a great tan.</li>
            <li> Lotion goes on smoothly, dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and smells good too.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s not quite as nice as the $50 per 3 oz type, but it&#x27;s awesome for an everyday sunscreen if you don&#x27;t want anything too fancy.</li>
            <li> used to be able to buy it, cannot seem to find it in stores in the area, glad it was available online.</li>
            <li> This means you&#x27;ll use it more often, and that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
            <li> The orange spots were on the parts of the shirts on the shoulders,the elbow areas, and parts of the front of the shirt that hit the stomach area,&lt;br /&gt;Other than the orange issue, this product works great as far as protecting peoples skin from getting a sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading this.  </li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> so much is that I know it&#x27;s really good, but it&#x27;s also very creamy and the consistency is like a good face cream, so it blends into my skin easily.</li>
            <li> 4 stars to Ocean Potion to protect from sunburn, will continue to use it and buy in the future, really good for you!</li>
            <li> Lathers on easy, not oily.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easily.</li>
            <li> It does a good job preventing sunburns/tans and is decently water resistant.</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on pretty nicely over it.</li>
            <li> Works fine, but the scent is really strong.  </li>
            <li> It smells good and goes on like normal lotion instead of greasy sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It offers very good broad-spectrum protection, and the formulation includes some very skin-friendly ingredients.  </li>
            <li> wife was a dermatology nurse for 30 years and knows how important sunscreen is to preventing skin cancer and premature aging of the skin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic coverage &amp; protection.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, Amazon does.</li>
            <li> Goes on light and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy.  </li>
            <li> The added bonus is that my husband will wear it since it is oxybenzone free (oxybenzone is proven to reduce virility is men).</li>
            <li> All Ocean Potion products are fantastic.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have Oxyclean, I am sure that almost any good, name brand laundry detergent, like \\&quot; Tide, Purex, Cheer, Wisk or ALL \\&quot;, would help if you used them to pre-treat the orange areas, rub it in,and then put the clothes in the washing machine with a capful or 2 of the same laundry detergent.  </li>
            <li> Either my tastes have developed, or they&#x27;ve adjusted the formula, because I really love it now!</li>
            <li> Being able to get it so quick and inexpensive is a real plus!</li>
            <li> and they are very light skinned and don&#x27;t really get a suntan at all</li>
            <li> Although not as important as the stinging issue, the 30 SPF sunblock also seems to be absorbed well by the skin.</li>
            <li> As a a fair skinned red head, with a heavily-tattooed spouse, we&#x27;ve tried everything to keep from getting sunburnt.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I have found some react with my skin  - over the last 3 years I have only been buying ocean potion - my skin loves it - the rest of family and friends love it - it smells pleasant - goes on easily stays on jumping in and out of the pool .</li>
            <li> Soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the &amp;#34;Scent of Sunshine&amp;#34; but my 4-year-old daughter quite likes the smell.</li>
            <li> I buy Ocean Potion skin care products because they smell so fresh</li>
            <li> Imagaine my joy when I discovered I could buy it through Amazon at half the price I&#x27;d been paying!  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen has broad coverage and is very smooth going on.</li>
            <li> Smells great and no more burning.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-greasy (really!) and smells like mangoes which always reminds me of our trip to Hawaii (where I horded sunscreen).  </li>
            <li> I have used this brand for years after first finding it at Myrtle Beach.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and something about it saying, &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; makes you feel good about putting on the lotion while basking in the sun!</li>
            <li> There are not a ton of good cruelty-free sunscreens on the market, and many of them are on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind putting it on, and I can&#x27;t really think of higher praise than that for a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I found this sunscreen at a small sundry shop at a lake, and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Make sure it is completely dry on your skin before you put your clothes on</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and never feels greasy like other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> The Ocean Potion suncare products are by far the best - but they&#x27;re hard to find locally.  </li>
            <li> Makes skin very moist.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Her sister is a flight attendant and recommended it to her.  </li>
            <li> + and really like the product since they do not put perfume in it</li>
            <li> I really like Ocean Potion products and have used them for years.</li>
            <li> had no issues with getting too much sun.  </li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I am 73 years old and have used many different products but \\&quot;hands down\\</li>
            <li> First of all it is made in Florida so that had me very interested in it, second,</li>
            <li> This smells and feels so much better than the other brands we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> was able to get the \\&quot; stains\\&quot; out from using a laundry spot pre-treater and then also I soaked them in the washing machine in hot water with a few scoops of OXYCLEAN and I let the washing machine run for 2 minutes to get a lather going</li>
            <li> The sun is extremely strong there, especially since it is near the equator.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kept me sunburn free all over the place, so as long as they continue to  make it I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> The main reason I like it</li>
            <li> Got it because it was highly reviewed by Consumer&#x27;s Reports.</li>
            <li> You never find high quality ingredients for a body product at this price point.  </li>
            <li> I live in Canada and you cannot buy it here,</li>
            <li> My wife had a new bathing suit and noticed that it began to deteriorate in spots.</li>
            <li> This brand of sunscreen has been our favorite for several years, but it&#x27;s become harder to find lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter is unable to use other sunscreens and this one worked and smelled wonderful with no allergic reaction!</li>
            <li> Not sure why you need so many words.</li>
            <li> For that wi was disappointed but the priduct is excellent.</li>
            <li> thought I might be able to get past the fragrance, but in truth, I didn&#x27;t finish the tube.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen has all the necessary active ingredients, as most of today&#x27;s sunscreen products do.</li>
            <li> OR if you sweat while you are wearing the lotion, that ingredient ( Avobenzone ) will turn your clothes orange in spots where the clothes touch the skin where it is wet from sweating, especially if the clothes are cotton and light colored or white.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> Was really surprised how well this worked in the sun and water.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly; not greasy; and has mild fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Since it is my first time using similar product, I do not have a standard so can not help about its function.</li>
            <li> It is particularly outstanding in that it stings one&#x27;s eyes a couple of hours after using it much, much less than other sunblocks tried.</li>
            <li> I will never again use another sunscreen, unless no other choice.  </li>
            <li> Buy no other sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Unless you want to spend the big bucks on &amp;#34;all natural ingredient&amp;#34; sunscreens -</li>
            <li> A very faint scent that&#x27;s quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this to every one that  I know due to the fact that it really keeps me protected.  </li>
            <li> &quot; For some reason, depending on where you live, (because of the differences in the water of different regions) Avobenzone can cause a yellow discoloration on white cotton clothing.</li>
            <li> At least now you know there is a way to get rid of the orange stains off a cotton white or light colored shirt.  </li>
            <li> Recently was fishing in wilderness Canada where only one early morning application was an option prior to fishing in the water all day....</li>
            <li> Fill the washing machine with hot water and let it run for a few minutes to work up a lather then turn it off and let soak over night</li>
            <li> The reason I like this brand so much better is the \\&quot;secret sauce,\\&quot; the creamy base that has a great effect on the desirability of the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looks like they have changed packaging now as the new bottles/tubes are Yellow for the 30 spf and they have added other lines (anti-aging, sport etc).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the fragrance is strong enough to knock your socks off, and it lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This stuff stays on through out long runs and bike rides.  </li>
            <li> I use this sunscreen all year long  to keep the suns rays from causing me problems.  </li>
            <li> When I started to run out I would seek out other pasty Canucks travelling to sun drenched destinations to coerce them in to picking me up a couple of bottles, converting them in to believers at the same time.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t let the lotion completely dry before putting on your clothes</li>
            <li> It is not too oily and not too dry.</li>
            <li> I used it a few weekends ago when I&#x27;d be outside all day in the sun, which actually turned to pouring rain as well.</li>
            <li> She gave me half a bottle from her private reserve</li>
            <li> feels a lot less gross than other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So be careful when using this product.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is stronger than I expected.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, not leaving you all white.</li>
            <li> Not for a moisturizer, and certainly not for a moisturizing sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> First time using a sunscreen since I was seriously sunburnt after rafting about 4 hours under hot sun :(.</li>
            <li> The fragrance was driving me so crazy, it just wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li> ( I hate greasy sunscreens, as most men do, so I avoided using them.)</li>
            <li> I am very careful with my sun sense and always coverup in lotions!</li>
            <li> It smells like an orangesicle, not the typical sunscreen scent.</li>
            <li> Less chemicals than others I have found.  </li>
            <li> We reapplied half way through the day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my mother and brother because they went to Jamaica a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> they are greasy and heavy and I feel slimy when I have it on</li>
            <li> The photo of the bottle is missing the text that says &amp;#34;sunshine scent&amp;#34; and the description says you &amp;#34;won&#x27;t find&amp;#34; fragrance, and yet the bottle shipped is scented.</li>
            <li> It is not easy to find, so stock up when you can.</li>
            <li> I could not get past the smell.....</li>
            <li> I live in Phoenix where it&#x27;s almost impossible to not be in the sun.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat weird and confusing since you may not go toward south and north at the same time.</li>
            <li> The Ocean Potion base goes into the skin very rapidly and leaves hardly a trace.</li>
            <li> I bought into that ridiculous assertion.  </li>
            <li> They sell an unscented version that I prefer that has a faint typical sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li> I often put it on in two thin layers about 20 minutes apart to limit the \\&quot;goop factor\\&quot;, common with virtually all sunblocks.</li>
            <li> One of the few sunscreens that doesn&#x27;t have a sunscreen smell that makes me uncomfortable wearing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find in drug stores in the winter</li>
            <li> Those folks would be wrong.</li>
            <li> Faint smell that deters insect bites when I&#x27;m in the garden.</li>
            <li> The base in this product is sweat and water resistant, and yet is so \\&quot;un-greasy.</li>
            <li> I hate sunscreen..</li>
            <li> I hated it then because of the smell.</li>
            <li> and I did not want them to get a nasty sunburn being in Jamaica in the summer.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this product for my mother and brother because they went to Jamaica a few weeks ago and they are very light skinned and don&#x27;t really get a suntan at all and I did not want them to get a nasty sunburn being in Jamaica in the summer.  The sun is extremely strong there, especially since it is near the equator.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway they used it and did not get a sunburn and they did get some color from being in the sun.  There was one problem though.  There is an ingredient in this Ocean Potion Anti-Aging SPF 30 lotion. It is one of the sunscreen ingredients called \\&quot; Avobenzone \\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t let the lotion completely dry before putting on your clothes OR if you sweat while you are wearing the lotion, that ingredient ( Avobenzone ) will turn your clothes orange in spots where the clothes touch the skin where it is wet from sweating, especially if the clothes are cotton and light colored or white.&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I found out about it on Google...&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot; For some reason, depending on where you live, (because of the differences in the water of different regions) Avobenzone can cause a yellow discoloration on white cotton clothing. \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;This happened to 3 of my mom&#x27;s blouses and 4 of my brothers T-shirts and a dress shirt.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to get the \\&quot; stains\\&quot; out from using a laundry spot pre-treater and then also I soaked them in the washing machine in hot water with a few scoops of OXYCLEAN and I let the washing machine run for 2 minutes to get a lather going and then I stopped it and I let the clothes sit in the washing machine with Oxyclean overnight.  Then the next morning ( 8 hours of soaking ) I added laundry detergent ( the brand \\&quot; ALL \\&quot; ) and let the washing cycle continue and finish and then I put the clothes in the dryer and the stains were gone.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have Oxyclean, I am sure that almost any good, name brand laundry detergent, like \\&quot; Tide, Purex, Cheer, Wisk or ALL \\&quot;, would help if you used them to pre-treat the orange areas, rub it in,and then put the clothes in the washing machine with a capful or 2 of the same laundry detergent.  Fill the washing machine with hot water and let it run for a few minutes to work up a lather then turn it off and let soak over night and you should get the same results I had from using Oxyclean.&lt;br /&gt;So be careful when using this product.  Make sure it is completely dry on your skin before you put your clothes on and if you start to sweat, well I guess you will just have to take a chance. At least now you know there is a way to get rid of the orange stains off a cotton white or light colored shirt.  The orange spots were on the parts of the shirts on the shoulders,the elbow areas, and parts of the front of the shirt that hit the stomach area,&lt;br /&gt;Other than the orange issue, this product works great as far as protecting peoples skin from getting a sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading this.  Have a great summer !&lt;br /&gt;Ricky&lt;br /&gt;[...].</li>
            <li> Wonderful \\&quot;Stuff\\&quot;. I use it daily as an aftershave, it provides sun protection and a terrific smelling skin lotion.   It&#x27;s difficult to find in drug stores in the winter so I&#x27;d buy two or more so you don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> This brand of sunscreen has been our favorite for several years, but it&#x27;s become harder to find lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife was a dermatology nurse for 30 years and knows how important sunscreen is to preventing skin cancer and premature aging of the skin. This sunscreen has all the necessary active ingredients, as most of today&#x27;s sunscreen products do. The reason I like this brand so much better is the \\&quot;secret sauce,\\&quot; the creamy base that has a great effect on the desirability of the product. The base in this product is sweat and water resistant, and yet is so \\&quot;un-greasy. \\&quot; ( I hate greasy sunscreens, as most men do, so I avoided using them.) The Ocean Potion base goes into the skin very rapidly and leaves hardly a trace. This means you&#x27;ll use it more often, and that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Ocean potion is such a great brand!  The sunscreen works great, after sun does too.  And all their products smell amazing!</li>
            <li> Always a favorite love the smell and never greasy</li>
            <li> Been using for years.  Fair skin.  It is the one sunscreen that does not give me facial blemishes.  I use it 12 months a year.</li>
            <li> I live in Phoenix where it&#x27;s almost impossible to not be in the sun.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of sunscreens but found this in a store on the beach in North Carolina.  I had brought L&#x27;Oreal Sunscreen Oil Spray which promised to not be oily.  I bought into that ridiculous assertion.  It WAS so oily that I threw it out.  Went to the store and bought this product.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  Dries quickly; not greasy; and has mild fragrance.  I tried finding it here in Phoenix at a local CVS but they didn&#x27;t have it so I&#x27;m buying more from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The fact that I purchased anti-aging sunscreen would have some folks thinking that I don&#x27;t have to worry about breakouts. Those folks would be wrong. At the ripe age of 26, I must be concerned with both wrinkles AND pimples... Not to worry, this stuff takes care of both and sun damage to boot. Plus, it&#x27;s not tested on animals!</li>
            <li> I remember this sunscreen from when I was a kid--my mom was into it for a while. I hated it then because of the smell. Either my tastes have developed, or they&#x27;ve adjusted the formula, because I really love it now! I rediscovered it after deciding to use only cruelty-free cosmetics. There are not a ton of good cruelty-free sunscreens on the market, and many of them are on the expensive side. This one is fairly inexpensive, and a great product. I wear this sunscreen every day on my face and neck, and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, nor is it sticky. My makeup goes on pretty nicely over it. Sure, it&#x27;s not quite as nice as the $50 per 3 oz type, but it&#x27;s awesome for an everyday sunscreen if you don&#x27;t want anything too fancy. Great protection, too, and no animal testing!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic coverage &amp; protection. Faint smell that deters insect bites when I&#x27;m in the garden.</li>
            <li> We bought this at st Thomas, uvi.  We diligently reapplied every hour as we were boating. I honestly thought we&#x27;d bought a scam product until I saw more reviews here- we have NEVER been so burnt. Both my boyfriend and I are completely red and immobile. Don&#x27;t use this if you want to so anything the rest of your vacation.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is the best 30 SPF sunblock out there. It is particularly outstanding in that it stings one&#x27;s eyes a couple of hours after using it much, much less than other sunblocks tried. Let me add, however, that the 50 SPF Ocean Potion Sunblock does sting the eyes. Although not as important as the stinging issue, the 30 SPF sunblock also seems to be absorbed well by the skin. I often put it on in two thin layers about 20 minutes apart to limit the \\&quot;goop factor\\&quot;, common with virtually all sunblocks. I had never used this sunblock before my wife brought some home from a Big Lots store. Run-of-the-mill stores do not seem to stock it. Fortunately, Amazon does. I do recommend 30 SPF Ocean Potion Sunblock.</li>
            <li> The Ocean Potion suncare products are by far the best - but they&#x27;re hard to find locally.  They work great, and the fragrance is nice - not overpowering.  The only brand I&#x27;ll buy!</li>
            <li> Soaks in quickly. I don&#x27;t think the smell is very strong at all. I love that it isn&#x27;t greasy or chalky and it does the trick in terms of sun protection. I don&#x27;t mind putting it on, and I can&#x27;t really think of higher praise than that for a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> As a a fair skinned red head, with a heavily-tattooed spouse, we&#x27;ve tried everything to keep from getting sunburnt. I found this last summer, and it works the best. Smells delicious (like an orange creamsicle) and stays on. The only places I have gotten burned since discovering it were places I hadn&#x27;t put the sunscreen. It is not easy to find, so stock up when you can. It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Smells great, like a 50/50 bar.  Lathers on easy, not oily.  Makes skin very moist.  Apply 15 - 30 minutes before sun exposure.  I wish this sunscreen was easier to find for sale in retail stores.  I will never again use another sunscreen, unless no other choice.  Works great outdoors, like hiking, or playing volleyball.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and as advertised.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite sunscreen.  Smells wonderful and never feels greasy like other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> A fair-skinned, strawberry blonde haired-friend recommended Ocean Potion to me.  Her sister is a flight attendant and recommended it to her.  She gave me half a bottle from her private reserve and I was forever hooked.  I live in Canada and you cannot buy it here, so when we went to Hawaii, some years back, I bought several bottles.  When I started to run out I would seek out other pasty Canucks travelling to sun drenched destinations to coerce them in to picking me up a couple of bottles, converting them in to believers at the same time.  Imagaine my joy when I discovered I could buy it through Amazon at half the price I&#x27;d been paying!  It&#x27;s non-greasy (really!) and smells like mangoes which always reminds me of our trip to Hawaii (where I horded sunscreen).  It&#x27;s kept me sunburn free all over the place, so as long as they continue to  make it I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I could not get past the smell.....my wife uses this product and loves it.....I reordered the sport 50+ and really like the product since they do not put perfume in it......have been very pleased with the replacement product.</li>
            <li> The best sunscreen ever. We have been using it for 18 years.</li>
            <li> I found this sunscreen at a small sundry shop at a lake, and loved it.  When I needed more, I searched Amazon, and to my amazement they had it at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great, works perfectly, and great price.  What&#x27;s not to love!</li>
            <li> this stuff smells so good ,,,it smells just like a orange Julius drink smoothie  works really good :) :D :) .. :)</li>
            <li> This smells and feels so much better than the other brands we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love the smell! It smells like an orangesicle, not the typical sunscreen scent. It does a good job preventing sunburns/tans and is decently water resistant.</li>
            <li> the best there is - smells great and works all day</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist, great product!!</li>
            <li> I love Ocean Potion and the dreamsickle scent but I used this bottle religiously on my last time out boating and still got burned.  Check your expiration date.</li>
            <li> Works fine, but the scent is really strong.  They sell an unscented version that I prefer that has a faint typical sunscreen smell. If you like to smell overwhelmingly like an orange creamcicle, you might like this.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen has broad coverage and is very smooth going on. It is not too oily and not too dry.</li>
            <li> I switched my family to Ocean Potion about 2 years ago after reading about it in a magazine as being &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;.  I hate sunscreen..they are greasy and heavy and I feel slimy when I have it on so I needed something that would not make me feel like I was wearing vaseline all over if I was going to keep using it.  Ocean Potion fit that need!  Goes on light and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy.  Added bonus..it&#x27;s smells like Orange Creamsicle!  YUM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like they have changed packaging now as the new bottles/tubes are Yellow for the 30 spf and they have added other lines (anti-aging, sport etc).</li>
            <li> First time using a sunscreen since I was seriously sunburnt after rafting about 4 hours under hot sun :(. Since it is my first time using similar product, I do not have a standard so can not help about its function. However I do have a question about this: the front bottle says waterproof but the back says rinse with water to remove. It&#x27;s somewhat weird and confusing since you may not go toward south and north at the same time.</li>
            <li> Unless you want to spend the big bucks on &amp;#34;all natural ingredient&amp;#34; sunscreens - this seems to be the best one available.  Less chemicals than others I have found.  Nice fragrance and feels just like a lotion going on.  Dries without feeling greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li> Great sun lotion.  Smells great and no more burning.  This was recommended by a friend and she has used it for 7 years without any issues.  Glad to find a lotion that works!</li>
            <li> This stuff stays on through out long runs and bike rides.  It smells good and goes on like normal lotion instead of greasy sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Product is different than picture and description. Yellow bottle was shipped.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and I also have Lupus. I use this sunscreen all year long  to keep the suns rays from causing me problems.  I have recommended this to every one that  I know due to the fact that it really keeps me protected.  And, it smells good too!~</li>
            <li> My daughter is unable to use other sunscreens and this one worked and smelled wonderful with no allergic reaction! Awesome product!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time &amp; as described.  We love this product!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunblock.  It works well, dries fast, and smells great.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite sunscreens and it smells like Johnson&#x27;s Baby Aspirin.  I did notice that it doesn&#x27;t seem to have Parsol 1789 anymore which concerns me some.</li>
            <li> Great smell, works the way 30 should.</li>
            <li> Does a good job protecting us from the sun.</li>
            <li> I hope the manufacturers consider making this product without fragrance. The fragrance is stronger than I expected. This product was rated well by Consumer Reports and ewg.org, but I hope to find another sunscreen that meets these criteria, but without fragrance the next time I order.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is the only sun tan lotion I will use. It provides high sun protection coverage but still allows a great tan. It goes on easy without being sticky and has a great smell. The best and only tanning lotion that I will use.</li>
            <li> Good sunscreen for the money. Not sure why you need so many words. Seven more needed, what&#x27;s up with that.</li>
            <li> Got it because it was highly reviewed by Consumer&#x27;s Reports. Goes on easily. I&#x27;m not crazy about the &amp;#34;Scent of Sunshine&amp;#34; but my 4-year-old daughter quite likes the smell.</li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping. Love Ocean Potion! Smells great and goes on nice.</li>
            <li> I am very careful with my sun sense and always coverup in lotions! I have found some react with my skin  - over the last 3 years I have only been buying ocean potion - my skin loves it - the rest of family and friends love it - it smells pleasant - goes on easily stays on jumping in and out of the pool . I am fair skinned and so need sun screen - this is an excellent cream not expensive - I have used it all around the world from the Great Barrier Reef to the Dallas back yard pool - it is my favorite and love their products</li>
            <li> This is one heck of a sunblock! Felt great on my skin as others have not. It felt like silk after going on and was not greasy or sticky at all. Was really surprised how well this worked in the sun and water. Will totally buy this again!</li>
            <li> this is the best stuff, smells nice rubs in completely, moisturizes.. used to be able to buy it, cannot seem to find it in stores in the area, glad it was available online.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  we were in Maui and found out from the scuba instructor the lotion is better than the spray.  It will deteriorate the rubber on their equipment (goggles).  My wife had a new bathing suit and noticed that it began to deteriorate in spots. they told us it was being effectied by the spray. we have switched to the lotion. Putz</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for years after first finding it at Myrtle Beach.  Love the way it feels on my skin, and the smell is wonderful</li>
            <li> product was not as seen, packaging was yellow, may have been slighty different product</li>
            <li> Our family has loved this stuff ever since it came out.  Being able to get it so quick and inexpensive is a real plus!</li>
            <li> I work outside in the sun 5 days a week and this sunblock has kept me from frying. The added bonus is that my husband will wear it since it is oxybenzone free (oxybenzone is proven to reduce virility is men).</li>
            <li> Definitely age defiant and a wonderful sunscreen I am 73 years old and have used many different products but \\&quot;hands down\\&quot; this is THE BEST . Price is nice too.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the blue 30 ocean potion but received the yellow. For that wi was disappointed but the priduct is excellent.</li>
            <li> Our favorite sunlotion. It is not greasy, smells wonderful and does not contain Oxybenzone. If you get the 50 SPF that does contain Oxybenzone.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I will use, so I&#x27;m grateful that Amazon carries it because I&#x27;m having a devil of a time finding it out here in California. The main reason I like it so much is that I know it&#x27;s really good, but it&#x27;s also very creamy and the consistency is like a good face cream, so it blends into my skin easily. Furthermore, it doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen, which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> Have not used it yet, but I can&#x27;t but think it will be great.  All Ocean Potion products are fantastic.</li>
            <li> First of all it is made in Florida so that had me very interested in it, second, people who surf in Cocoa Beach swear by it so I started looking into it. I love what it doesn&#x27;t have. Yes, doesn&#x27;t have. Read the label. I used it a few weekends ago when I&#x27;d be outside all day in the sun, which actually turned to pouring rain as well. It goes on smoothly, not leaving you all white. It is not greasy which I love and it smells good. But during the day and in the rain I never knew I was wearing sunscreen. No residue. Plus the anti-aging part helps too when you are always in the sun. We reapplied half way through the day. Loved it. Not buying the spray cans anymore which don&#x27;t work unless you rub it in anyways so why not use this?</li>
            <li> The photo of the bottle is missing the text that says &amp;#34;sunshine scent&amp;#34; and the description says you &amp;#34;won&#x27;t find&amp;#34; fragrance, and yet the bottle shipped is scented. It is the same yellow bottle pictured, just with the scent text on the label. Maybe the item listing pic was photoshopped? I dunno, but it smells like orange candy and rubber which might be nice for some but not for me. Wish this had been more truthful. I thought about returning it but that seems like such a hassle for a $10 tube of sunscreen so I suppose the ruse worked.</li>
            <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t test on animals! Would buy this again, once I&#x27;ve run out.</li>
            <li> I buy Ocean Potion skin care products because they smell so fresh and they work better than many others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> One of the few sunscreens that doesn&#x27;t have a sunscreen smell that makes me uncomfortable wearing.  A very faint scent that&#x27;s quite pleasant. Not greasy feeling at all.</li>
            <li> I really like Ocean Potion products and have used them for years. We were vacationing as a family and I ordered the SPF 30 for the younger family members to use (I use the 70 SPF ).  However, I cannot review it, because I was sent a bottle of the 15 SPF instead. There was no time to rectify this as we were leaving. Therefore the low rating .</li>
            <li> 4 stars to Ocean Potion to protect from sunburn, will continue to use it and buy in the future, really good for you!</li>
            <li> Best smelling sun screen.  Thirty is good, 50 is the best.  Buy no other sunscreen.  Also great if you get heat rashes.  It&#x27;s not greasy either.</li>
            <li> Best suntan lotion I have used.  Very effective in limiting sun exposure.  Recently was fishing in wilderness Canada where only one early morning application was an option prior to fishing in the water all day....had no issues with getting too much sun.  Lotion goes on smoothly, dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and smells good too.</li>
            <li> feels a lot less gross than other sunscreens. i can tolerate this one</li>
            <li> best sunscreen. love the smell of it</li>
            <li> I have been using this product about 3 years. It offers excellent sun protection . Even my dermotologist said I am using a good product.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is emollient, yet not greasy.  It offers very good broad-spectrum protection, and the formulation includes some very skin-friendly ingredients.  Another plus  is the unbelievably low price.  You never find high quality ingredients for a body product at this price point.  Not for a moisturizer, and certainly not for a moisturizing sunscreen.  In short, it was a pleasure to use, except for one thing:  the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I found the fragrance pleasant at first, it overpowered even my high-sillage perfume.  I generally avoid skin care products with fragrance anyway, but I was so impressed with the rest of the ingredient list, I went ahead and bought it.  Unfortunately, the fragrance is strong enough to knock your socks off, and it lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I might be able to get past the fragrance, but in truth, I didn&#x27;t finish the tube.  The fragrance was driving me so crazy, it just wasn&#x27;t worth it.  This product without fragrance would be five stars.  The smell is that strong!</li>
            <li> My favorite Sunblock.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen. The fragrance is mild and pleasant. It does not burn my eyes. Most importantly it does a great job of preventing sunburn.</li>
            <li> My favorite suntanning lotion! It&#x27;s has a great smell! It&#x27;s very thick and something about it saying, &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; makes you feel good about putting on the lotion while basking in the sun!</li>
            <li> This is what I ordered but received a different tube! It was 30 SPF but in a yellow tube and water resistant not waterproof!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the only sunscreens that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy to me. I love it and it kept us both from burning on vacation.  Will definitely purchase again and again.</li>
