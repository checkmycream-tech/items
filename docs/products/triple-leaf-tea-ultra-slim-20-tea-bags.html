    <ol>
            <li> Will Clean you out ASAP. better save for a weekend off!</li>
            <li> Great tea.  I love the taste.</li>
            <li> As someone already said snaking the pipes...</li>
            <li> So i have only had one cup of this tea, earlier today, and i had pain on the left side of my mid-section. Then i had diarrhea shortly after. I guess it does do what it is supposed to though, it certainly got out everything, it just so happens it was very painful for me.</li>
            <li> My cousin told me about how well this tea worked for her. I bought it based on her experience. This tea had my stomach in knots and I was going to the bathroom often. I DID NOT like the unpredictability of when I would need to use the restroom. I told my cousin about my experience and it seems like it works different for everyone.</li>
            <li> Well today I didn&#x27;t eat that healthy, but since I am only on day 3 no results yet (wasn&#x27;t expecting any). This tea does exactly what it say it does. It make you go more often than you normally would, well for me at least. I didn&#x27;t really feel any cramping, nothing painful. My stomach did make noise, but it wasn&#x27;t too annoying. This tea will get everything you eat out! I normally drink 2 cups a day. One after lunch &amp; one at night around 7pm to about 8pm. I&#x27;ll do an update after a month (with better dieting). I&#x27;m already very physically active. I workout at the gym about 4-5 times a week religiously. I&#x27;m not in the best shape in the WORLD but I am able to do physically challenging exercises. I&#x27;m just doing this to get an extra boost on some weight loss to get rid of a couple inches from my waist line.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for medical reasons and was pleased, I don&#x27;t know what your expectations are?</li>
            <li> The taste of this tea is like heaven on earth. I buy this type of tea a lot and its just amazing. I get something different every time. The shipment is always great on this tea, about 3 or 4 days tops not bad. It does clean you out after 24 hours of drinking it I will warn you it cleans you out. Also it does make you have small patches of break out on your face, but don&#x27;t worry it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> This tea works more like a laxative loosening up your bowels. So just make sure that you are near a bathroom after you drink it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this tea from Natural Grocers in Colorado. If you&#x27;re looking a tea that will clean you out, this will do the trick. I don&#x27;t recommend it for actual weight loss because it is not intended for long-term use. The taste is mild and it really does work to &amp;#34;clean-out the pipes&amp;#34;. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this tea is that it gave me stomach cramping, which I guess is to be expected with any sort of diarrhetic. Be sure to read &amp; follow the directions on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is meant to be informative of the product I have personally tried, and is not reflective of the seller distributing this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> If you already have regular bowel movements but are looking to drop weight of any sort, use caution. I had one cup steeped for 2 minutes 2 days ago and I have had diarrhea, gas, severe cramping, and nausea since. Not knocking it, but if you are regular this will probably mess you up!</li>
            <li> Not only can I drink this and not worry about messing up my diet (because I am on a weight watchers eating plan) but I helps me regulate my colon as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well if all you want to do is go to the bathroom...&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t taste bad either so, over all its a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Tastes Good... Don&#x27;t know if it helped me with my weight loss and then again there is no miracle to weight loss now is there... !!!</li>
            <li> This tea did not work at all for me . It knoted my stomach up but I didnt go to the bathroom 😒</li>
            <li> i have tried it just once was semi satisfied.  Im not a tea drinker which may be the reason why i&#x27;m ok with it.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well but you need to be careful with it and it does cause cramps, not vicious ones, but it works.</li>
            <li> It is tasty and gently helps elimination!</li>
            <li> Triple leaf makes me go to the bathroom I lost weight just by eating right and drinking the tea and I had it for 2 weeks I lost 5 pounds it&#x27;s not allot but I love it</li>
            <li> Great product and it definitely cleans out your system. Follow the directions and you will see the best results. I actually prefer using the Super Slimming version that Triple Leaf offers. I have seen better results from using that instead.</li>
            <li> Love this tea! Mild flavor but good. I really feel that it helps.</li>
