            <li>It really seems too good to be true, but unless you try it for yourself, you&#x27;ll never know!</li>
            <li>, It is strong so please follow the instructions for use.</li>

            <li>I have been using it regularly and have been really happy with this product.</li>
            <li>but since I&#x27;ve learned that it is useful for allergies and migraines!</li>
            <li>It is super concentrated - if you want to apply it to your skin you&#x27;ll want to dilute it with a carrier oil like fractionated coconut oil or almond oil.  </li>
            <li>The scent is amazing at reducing congestion and also at relieving general stress and tension.  </li>
            <li>This is a great company and their oils are high quality and pure, I definitely recommend trying this oil.</li>

            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried Eucalyptus oil. I&#x27;ve been getting over being sick and my nose has been a little stuffy here and there and I&#x27;ve had a headache for most of the day. I just remembered that I bought this and decided to give it a try. I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly it worked for me! My nose opened up and my headache is already gone! It really seems too good to be true, but unless you try it for yourself, you&#x27;ll never know! I love the smell! It smells like vapor rub, which makes sense since I&#x27;ve used that in the past to open up my nose. I can&#x27;t wait to put this in the diffuser. I received a discount for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to try Eucalyptus oil.  I wanted to know if it really did work good for clearing up a stuffy nose.  I put a diffuser in the bedroom and within a few minutes my nose opened up.  What relief.  I did put a few drops and it was on a table near my bed.  I&#x27;ve since put them through out the house and it&#x27;s just helping the whole family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  I received this product  at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for sinus issues, common colds and illness. Very nice potent quality oil. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase. Great oil for a great price!</li>
            <li> Smells delightful and awakens your senses. Not over whelming, very pleasant to the nose. I was pretty sick from allergies last week that ended up in a nasty head and chest &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34;, I boiled some water and added 3 drops and sat on the coffee table. It helped to open my sinuses.&lt;br /&gt;What I do like about this is the fact is does not smell soapy. This is a very nice pure quality oil!</li>
            <li> I got this to help my kids sleep at night. Ive used it in both my humidifier and defuser, it works like a charm! I love using essential oils because its so much safer and chemical free.</li>
            <li> A drop or two in the bath or just a sniff of the fragrance for the open bottle, or look up uses on the Internet. There are plenty of them. A little bottle of pure eucalyptus oil comes in quite handy, especially during cold and flu season. Just don&#x27;t use it undiluted without proper care, and test for any allergy.</li>
            <li> my favorite oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i been wanting this oil and finally have it, my mother in law told me that this is one of the best oil and a must have oil inside our house just put a few drops in your difuser and boom your house will smell minty and very relaxing and also spider hates the smell of this oil..i love love this eucalyptus oil!</li>
            <li> I mixed this oil with argan oil and peppermint and really enjoyed the results. Clear head, easier breathing, very happy with this oil.</li>
            <li> A good quality and Exellent Product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a sample for review and evaluation and I love it. I use this in my diffuser and it works great! The scent is wonderful and I feel like I&#x27;m at the spa. Sometimes if I am not feeling well I run the diffuser in the bathroom while I shower and the combination is so soothing. The other thing I do with this is put a bit on a cotton ball and then tuck it the closet next to my wash rags and bath towels so they have a bit of the scent. This compares well with other eucalyptus oils I have tried and I love it!</li>
            <li> When I was in college, there were several ancient eucalyptus trees on campus.  I learned that I could gather the fallen leaves from the ground when I had a bad cold, crush them up and place them under my nose while I breathed in.  The released oils were wonderful - instantly made my nose feel less stuffed up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;m a bit older and no longer live in a climate where eucalyptus trees thrive, I am so happy to have found this wonderful essential oil!  It is super concentrated - if you want to apply it to your skin you&#x27;ll want to dilute it with a carrier oil like fractionated coconut oil or almond oil.  The scent is amazing at reducing congestion and also at relieving general stress and tension.  I&#x27;ve ordered an oil diffuser as well and am really looking forward to being able to use it with my eucalyptus oil to spread a general feeling of calm across my bedroom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad that I was able to order this at a promotional discount in order to evaluate and provide my honest review.</li>
            <li> This oil has a camphorous aroma that is slightly strong but not very long lasting. It does have a relaxing effect though &amp; helps to relieve my anxiety. I mixed it with peppermint &amp; tea tree oils &amp; rub it on my forehead &amp; throat when I have a cold &amp; it helps me feel better.This was received at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this purchase.  The seller promised a great product and that&#x27;s what I received. I have seasonal allergies and sinus issues.  I used this product in my humidifier and I also took it to the gym with me and used it in the steam room.  I promise if your nose is clogged up,  this product is the remedy. This product is wonderful.  I was offeted this product a reduced price however this is my unbiased review on this product.  I would definitely recommend it! !!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the diffuser for using with this oil.&lt;br /&gt;I filled the diffuser with water and added a couple of drops of oil and within minutes I was enjoying the scent of eucalyptus throughout my bedroom. I love the way this oil smells. I&#x27;m not an expert on essential oils but I can tell this things for sure that It makes me breathe easier and sleep better at night.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice calming effect also. If you like eucalyptus oil this will be a nice choice.&lt;br /&gt;But, It is strong so please follow the instructions for use.</li>
            <li> I generally try to use holistic home remedies before moving on to other options. Eucalyptus oil has helped me ease chronic pain, stop migraines, and get rid of stress. The one thing I have noticed between different brands of essential oils is their effectiveness and scent. Immediately upon using this product, I could tell it was pure from its concentration and scent. The bottle is somewhat small but you don&#x27;t have to use a large amount. Just a drop or two will do. An issue I have had in the past is how a bottle dispenses essential oil causing me to waste or use way too much. This bottle has a great top for dispensing that just lets out a drop at a time.</li>
            <li> Eucalyptus oil has so many uses! I got it to make my own body washes and deodorant (Mint Eucalyptus) but since I&#x27;ve learned that it is useful for allergies and migraines! I have been using it regularly and have been really happy with this product. A little goes a really long way. The smell and texture of Cleopatre&#x27;s products oil is nice. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Mixed with a little argan oil or sweet almond, it is wonderful. You never use essential oil on your skin without mixing it with something else. At this time of year with all of the colds and flu going around, a product containing eucalyptus is good to have on hand. It has that classic smell that some older folks might remember of menthol ointments that their parents might have rubbed on them when they were little and suffered stuffy noses.</li>
            <li> I love this brand. You have potent essential oils. I used this to make a vapor rub and a vapor steamer (which is something I need every winter). YES! I can breath again. Clears up congestion like a charm.  I cant wait to use this in other things. The smell is so intense, definitely have to keep this stuff stocked.</li>
            <li> I love essential oils and have tried many different brands.  Eucalyptus is one of my favorites, the smell is so invigorating and it works wonders on congestion.  I make a home made chest rub that works just as well as Vicks and its safer.  This oil is also great for diffusing, I have a little one in diapers and when there is a lingering odor for a dirty diaper, I diffuse some of my eucalyptus oil and it quickly gets rid of any unpleasant smells in my entire home.  This is a great company and their oils are high quality and pure, I definitely recommend trying this oil.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted. I got it quick, and began using it the next day.</li>
