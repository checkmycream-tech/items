    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>As for the scent it is a very attractive scent.</li>
            <li>The items smell wonderful and my husband loves it.  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>if this is the reaction you want from a girl, then it must be a good scent on a man!</li>
            <li>Great came on time</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li>lotion feels great.</li>
            <li>but instead it has a very nice smell to it...</li>
            <li>Aftershave is very nice, haven&#x27;t tried the body wash yet.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend loved the scent as well</li>
            <li>I love how he smells and that he doesn&#x27;t need to wear a ton of it!</li>
            <li>Amazing Smelling</li>
            <li>Smells really good one of my favorite parfumes</li>
            <li>This Cologne is the most amazing thing Ive ever smelled, Many girls like the smell of it (Good aspect) and the shower gel and face wash coming with it was also a good addition, Ive been a huge fan of Pitbull for many years</li>
            <li>Even my Great aunt who was cooking a turkry in the kitchen suddenly brought out a magnificent cuban sandwich pressed to perfection and filled with the finest ham and roast pork.</li>
            <li>Smells great not too strong nor to light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sexy.  </li>
            <li>The bottle design is very sleek attractive.</li>
            <li>I hope there is more to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the next time AMAZON decides to do an exclusive product, and then make a video for said product, maybe they should  make it able to be viewed on their own prducts?!?!?!</li>
            <li>Levine&#x27;s stuff will sell at 55 bucks, because women think he&#x27;s sexy and guys want to buy stuff that women think is sexy...</li>
            <li>I think it smells wonderful and even though my boyfriend isn&#x27;t a fan of Pitbull, he definitely enjoys the perks of wearing a scent I enjoy.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong.  </li>
            <li>I was thinking it will be a strong smell that you can smell from a mile away</li>
            <li>The bottle was so smooth to the touch</li>
            <li>I pressed the top and a mist like that of a freshly dew&#x27;d rain forest covered my body.</li>
            <li>As soon as I was within 10 feet of the fireplace I could sense there was somethign amazing happening in my old wool sock.</li>
            <li>Tried and True Bro.</li>
            <li>Seriously though, 20 bucks is more of a fair price for a fragrance from a top 40 dude that isn&#x27;t sexy...but even that is a stretch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam</li>
            <li>so people will actually buy your stuff and maybe find out it smells good, rather than guys like me who are gonna make fun of</li>
            <li>Since my boyfriend is actually wearing this amazing scent, I thought I&#x27;d share MY opinion.  </li>
            <li>I popped the cap and it burst upwards like a fresh bottle of Krystal.</li>
            <li>I said that I needed it right away.</li>
            <li>The base is perfect warm ending to this extraordinary fragrance.</li>
            <li>If so, it&#x27;s really funny.</li>
            <li>First of all, I noticed that 4 of the 6 reviews before me were from JEALOUS boys who hadn&#x27;t even tried this cologne.  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more likely to buy a fragrance from LMFAO</li>
            <li>Love the scent, but wish the scent was a bit stronger &amp; longer lasting.</li>
            <li>Just as I reached for my stocking a flood of lazer lights exploded from it, as it magicly transformed into a pure white silk stocking with my name embroidered in the finest 14k diamonds.</li>
            <li>Other than that, maybe try to make your own tequila or vodka or version of beats headphones.</li>
            <li>Its really pitbulls for 2 reasons, One:</li>
            <li>Pitbull really know what scent makes you a real man.</li>
            <li>Do i really want to know what this smells like?</li>
            <li>At first sprit you are hit with a woody citrus fresh scent from the bergamot, mandarin, sage and violet and woods from the middle notes.</li>
            <li>Ya&#x27;all want to smell like a star like Pitbull after a long concert and then 10 hours of partying in a smoke filled club than this be the bomb for you.  </li>
            <li>husband was looking to try a new fragrance and bought this after smelling it on someone else!</li>
            <li>It smells like old, musty, pooch with foaming mouth that listened too much rap music and went loco from all the rhythms.</li>
            <li>I could feel my feet begin to tremble as the floor began to shake from the sound of an 808 bass drum.</li>
            <li>Was surprised it was Pitbull&#x27;s cologne-</li>
            <li>me make it real clear, If you buy Pitbull&#x27;s fragrance you are one third of the way to pulling those video chicks.</li>
            <li>The box was barely taped and coming apart.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This Cologne is the most amazing thing Ive ever smelled, Many girls like the smell of it (Good aspect) and the shower gel and face wash coming with it was also a good addition, Ive been a huge fan of Pitbull for many years and when I saw his update on twitter showing the creation of this coming soon I said that I needed it right away. Its really pitbulls for 2 reasons, One: His post on Twitter proved it. Two: It says that the Cologne was made in Miami. Enough Said. If you want to smell like the party animal then I recommend purchasing this Cologne!</li>
            <li> Great came on time and I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> Smells really good one of my favorite parfumes</li>
            <li> Smells great not too strong nor to light. shave lotion feels great. Only have to put on small amount to get long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> Leaving a review about a fragrance is an idiosyncrazy.  Every person has a different taste as to whether they like musky, citrusy, fruity, etc.  In addition, fragrances smell different on different skins.  And whether you care for Pitbull&#x27;s music or not should not affect whether you like this fragrance or not, come on!  I happen to like this scent on my boyfriend.  It&#x27;s sexy.  I feel like kissing him when I smell it, so if this is the reaction you want from a girl, then it must be a good scent on a man!</li>
            <li> Amazing Smelling Cologne- my husband loves it!&lt;br /&gt;My husband was looking to try a new fragrance and bought this after smelling it on someone else! Was surprised it was Pitbull&#x27;s cologne- because I didn&#x27;t know he had one. He gets compliments all the time. I love how he smells and that he doesn&#x27;t need to wear a ton of it!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend snuck some of this into my stocking this year for Christmas. As soon as I was within 10 feet of the fireplace I could sense there was somethign amazing happening in my old wool sock. As I made my way closer I could feel my feet begin to tremble as the floor began to shake from the sound of an 808 bass drum. Just as I reached for my stocking a flood of lazer lights exploded from it, as it magicly transformed into a pure white silk stocking with my name embroidered in the finest 14k diamonds. The box of Cologne arose from the stocking. I held it in my arms like a newborn baby, I opened the box and pulled out what I can only descibe as the face of God himself. The bottle was so smooth to the touch just like Pitbulls imaculetly shaved head. I popped the cap and it burst upwards like a fresh bottle of Krystal. I pressed the top and a mist like that of a freshly dew&#x27;d rain forest covered my body. I knew that very second that I was now covered in the scent of all of Miami. Even my Great aunt who was cooking a turkry in the kitchen suddenly brought out a magnificent cuban sandwich pressed to perfection and filled with the finest ham and roast pork. My girlfriend couldn&#x27;t beleive what happened, as she sat idley by with her bottle of Taylor Swift perfume writing break up songs.</li>
            <li> I assume from the description of the three-leveled scents that this is a fake product, &amp;#34;a-la&amp;#34; one of those older SNL commercials.  If so, it&#x27;s really funny.</li>
            <li> How can you wear a scent that is comprised of 1 part made up word?  Is that like saying you can smell a little like a unicorn?  What does a unicorn smell like?</li>
            <li> It smells like old, musty, pooch with foaming mouth that listened too much rap music and went loco from all the rhythms.</li>
            <li> Ya&#x27;all want to smell like a star like Pitbull after a long concert and then 10 hours of partying in a smoke filled club than this be the bomb for you.  Pitbull really know what scent makes you a real man. This aint no Chris Brown smell, this scent makes it know u know how to treat da womenz.</li>
            <li> This fragrance has a very complex yet simple character to it. The bottle design is very sleek attractive. As for the scent it is a very attractive scent. At first sprit you are hit with a woody citrus fresh scent from the bergamot, mandarin, sage and violet and woods from the middle notes. The base is perfect warm ending to this extraordinary fragrance. I hope there is more to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shower gel: avarage smell but does its job&lt;br /&gt;After shave: minimal scent but also does the job</li>
            <li> the next time AMAZON decides to do an exclusive product, and then make a video for said product, maybe they should  make it able to be viewed on their own prducts?!?!?! i mean really its not rocket science!!</li>
            <li> The items smell wonderful and my husband loves it.  Not too strong.  The only reason to minus 1 star was the shipping packaging was terrible.  The box was barely taped and coming apart.  Shocked it got here in one piece</li>
            <li> First of all, I noticed that 4 of the 6 reviews before me were from JEALOUS boys who hadn&#x27;t even tried this cologne.  Since my boyfriend is actually wearing this amazing scent, I thought I&#x27;d share MY opinion.  I think it smells wonderful and even though my boyfriend isn&#x27;t a fan of Pitbull, he definitely enjoys the perks of wearing a scent I enjoy.  ;-)</li>
            <li> Do i really want to know what this smells like? If its anything like his music it will be awful.</li>
            <li> Seriously though, 20 bucks is more of a fair price for a fragrance from a top 40 dude that isn&#x27;t sexy...but even that is a stretch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam Levine&#x27;s stuff will sell at 55 bucks, because women think he&#x27;s sexy and guys want to buy stuff that women think is sexy...I don&#x27;t know what women think of pitbull, but I can tell ya he doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;get them going&amp;#34; like homeboy does. He does however make great music for annoying girls to get hammered too though. Other than that, maybe try to make your own tequila or vodka or version of beats headphones. Ain&#x27;t no one wanna smell like you though. Sorry dude, but it&#x27;s true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drop the price so people will actually buy your stuff and maybe find out it smells good, rather than guys like me who are gonna make fun of how retarded it is that you are trying to get in the scent game. I&#x27;m more likely to buy a fragrance from LMFAO</li>
            <li> I went to his concert yesterday in Brooklyn and got a sample...I was thinking it will be a strong smell that you can smell from a mile away but instead it has a very nice smell to it...My girlfriend loved the scent as well and I will be purchasing this in the future...</li>
            <li> Pitbull (AKA Mr. International) is three things:&lt;br /&gt;Sunglasses&lt;br /&gt;His Smell&lt;br /&gt;and his catch phrase &amp;#34;d&amp;aacute;le&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is the formula to get women. Tried and True Bro. So I won&#x27;t tell you what to do but you if you  seent the girls in &amp;#34;Bon bon&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;I know you want me&amp;#34; videos then you know what to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me make it real clear, If you buy Pitbull&#x27;s fragrance you are one third of the way to pulling those video chicks. So, after you buy this fragrance learn to say &amp;#34;d&amp;aacute;le&amp;#34; and buy a pair of sunglasses!</li>
            <li> Love the scent, but wish the scent was a bit stronger &amp; longer lasting. Usually 4-5 sprays to get the scent strength I&#x27;m looking for. Aftershave is very nice, haven&#x27;t tried the body wash yet.</li>
            <li> Great product! I had to have it.</li>
