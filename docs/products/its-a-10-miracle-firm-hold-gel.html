            <li>I would still recommend this to someone as a clean gel that holds well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best because it&#x27;s thick and doesn&#x27;t smell of alcohol.  </li>

            <li> Ahmazzzing product!  Just a dab adds volume &amp; control to my fine, thin hair.  I highly recommend this great product &amp; do to all my friends!</li>
            <li> I was able to find my favorite hair gel $4 cheaper than I can purchase at my salon.  Thank you</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty good. Not a firm hold, but really more of a soft hold. I actually prefer a crispier sort of result; this does tame the fly-aways and doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch, like some do. I use it alternately with Sebastian Potion 9, very similar hold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hair gel.  No aroma, holds without flaking. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the only gel my husband has found that gives his hair a \\&quot;spikey\\&quot; look without leftover product making his hair feel dirty all day. We searched everywhere and could only find this online. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; transaction</li>
            <li> I have used It&#x27;s A 10 products and this one does not disappoint.  No flaking and nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> I love this gel and a better price than at the salon. It has great hold without being super tacky.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I loved some of their other products.  I have fine hair and this gel made it stiff and unshiny and almost made it look stringy at times.  I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect gel/mousse.</li>
            <li> Best deal and the product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best because it&#x27;s thick and doesn&#x27;t smell of alcohol.  I recommend it to anyone needing good gel but not want to use the stuff that&#x27;s out there that works like cement.</li>
            <li> I have lots of fine hair and when I tried this gel I was sold.  It does not leave your hair gummy feeling, retains the shine and gives plenty of volume to my hair.</li>
            <li> Good gel…clean gel that won&#x27;t clump up..not as strong as some other brands but won&#x27;t flake in your hair. I would still recommend this to someone as a clean gel that holds well</li>
            <li> Great product, good price</li>
            <li> Great gel...not sticky like most gels ..firm hold and control. I weould buy this product again,fast shipping as well and a price that cant be beat.</li>
            <li> Love this for my naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li> Love It&#x27;s a 10 products.</li>
            <li> I use this product every time I shampoo my hair.  I have fine hair with natural wave and I need lots of product to give it height and volume.  This gel does that, but does not make it sticky or heavy.  I like all the &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; products and use several on my hair.</li>
            <li> Such a good product, really holds all day and even after a gym workout. My other brand product was changed and I looked for a product like the other one used to be. Glad I found this one after many tries.</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel for some time.  I have tried many others and go back to this one.  I have very fine hair, and this gel mixed with  It&#x27;s A 10 mousse provides the volume my hair needs.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair in place and it looks great</li>
            <li> No longer available at my salon (?), but thank goodness for Amazon!  Excellent hold, clean feel, non-sticky formula, priced fairly.</li>
            <li> This did noting for my hair-- more like smelly water than gel-- would not recommend!</li>
            <li> Yup, it holds very nicely but doesn&#x27;t make my hair look stiff.</li>
            <li> Very nice hair gel. Hair lays smooth and not sticky.  I&#x27;m sure I reveiwed this before because I purcahsed 2 tubes of it.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s how much I like it :-)</li>
            <li> Works great holds hair all day.</li>
            <li> Miracle Firm Hold Gel by It&#x27;s a 10 is a great product and after some comparison shopping,  I got it at a very good price from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just what I had been looking for</li>
            <li> I have curly hair.  I want my curls to curl and not frizz.  I also want a product that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls and make my hair drab.  I like that this gel doesn&#x27;t make my hair look wet unless I want it that way.  It works much better than many of the other products that I&#x27;ve tried that say they are specifically for curly hair.  I would definately recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is a great gel if you&#x27;re looking for something that isn&#x27;t sticky and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling like a porcupine.  It stays pliable and has a natural look when in your hair.  It doesn&#x27;t get all gunky in your hair when you wash it out and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on your scalp.  One of the best on the market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Ten is always good, but this works brilliantly.  Would fully recommend.</li>
            <li> Good hair gel with medium hold.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product every day and it seems to do a great job with keeping my hair where I want it, but it also doesnt flake like the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of styling gels and this by far is The Best  styling gel I have ever tried</li>
            <li> Great price and free shipping to top it off!!</li>

            <li> Works well. A little dab will do ya.</li>
            <li> Will need to use a little more to get better volume.</li>
            <li> Love all the Its a !0 products</li>
