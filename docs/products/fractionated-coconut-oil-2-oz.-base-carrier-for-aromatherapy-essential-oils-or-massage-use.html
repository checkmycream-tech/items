    <ol>
            <li>Plant Guru truly has the best products.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best carrier oils around!</li>
            <li>A spout would be awesome or medicine dropper-type device.</li>
            <li>Works great in my bath bombs.  </li>
            <li>Great for what I needed</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!!  </li>
            <li>I am happy with the FCO, it will work perfectly with my essential oils!</li>
            <li>Great carrier oil, does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Sweet almond is good.</li>
            <li>Very light and non greasy.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always sure to use the coconut oil with it to prevent the reaction.</li>
            <li>I love this because it doesn&#x27;t have any smell at all.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully with the essential oils from Doterra</li>
            <li>Fractionated Coconut oil is better and mixes well.</li>
            <li>Will buy more</li>
            <li>Love the product and the seller.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with item &amp; received quickly.</li>
            <li>It is the best in two categories: long shelf life: it doesn&#x27;t go rancid</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and it&#x27;s easy to pour.</li>
            <li>Plant Guru products (I have bought several) are consistently great in quality and value.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that the oil is unscented, but there are many benefits to that feature.</li>
            <li>and I also put it right on my skin for a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I used in roll on bottles and it is doing exactly what I need it to.</li>
            <li>Really like the quality of Plant Guru&#x27;s, however.  </li>
            <li>(I live in the tropics where it is hot, I don&#x27;t have to worry) and 2) it doesn&#x27;t stain clothing, my sheets or furniture where I go to relax after getting a massage.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the top doesn&#x27;t make it easy to pour; it spills all over.</li>
            <li>I like this oil a little better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to get off the table and walk directly into the shower.</li>
            <li>An absolute essential for overall health.</li>
            <li>Perfect base for essential oils to help prevent skin reactions.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve used this to make roller balls for my essential oils and it seems to work well.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Just as described.  Thank you</li>
            <li> This oil ROCKS as a carrier for massage oil. It is the best in two categories: long shelf life: it doesn&#x27;t go rancid (I live in the tropics where it is hot, I don&#x27;t have to worry) and 2) it doesn&#x27;t stain clothing, my sheets or furniture where I go to relax after getting a massage. I don&#x27;t have to get off the table and walk directly into the shower. Hallelujah! I&#x27;M SOLD!</li>
            <li> I have used this in all my DIY beauty products. It does the trick</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used this to make roller balls for my essential oils and it seems to work well. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and it&#x27;s easy to pour.</li>
            <li> Works great in my bath bombs.  Very light and non greasy.  Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but it is par for the price.  Really like the quality of Plant Guru&#x27;s, however.  Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the FCO, it will work perfectly with my essential oils!</li>
            <li> Whats to say, its what recipe called for.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!  I use it as a barrier oil with my essential oils and I also put it right on my skin for a moisturizer.  Plant Guru products (I have bought several) are consistently great in quality and value.</li>
            <li> An absolute essential for overall health. Plant Guru truly has the best products.</li>
            <li> Perfect base for essential oils to help prevent skin reactions. One oil that I am a little sensitive to is lemongrass so I&#x27;m always sure to use the coconut oil with it to prevent the reaction. It also extends the life of your bottles of oils, thus saving you money. Yes please!</li>
            <li> I love this because it doesn&#x27;t have any smell at all. One thing that I can complain is that it takes time for the tracking to update, wondering if the item got lost. Overall I give it 4 out of 5</li>
            <li> Very pleased with item &amp; received quickly.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully with the essential oils from Doterra</li>
            <li> This is one of the best carrier oils around! Sweet almond is good. Fractionated Coconut oil is better and mixes well. Leaves  no scent that competes with any  essential oil that you are using. I recommend you try this.Start with 30 ml of oil and 15 drops of essential oil. Work you way up to no more than 45 drops of essential oil to 30 ml of coconut oil (Fractionated). I mix 30 ml to 45 drops of essential oil.  I like this oil a little better.</li>
            <li> Great for what I needed</li>
            <li> Works well for essential oil dilutions. I used in roll on bottles and it is doing exactly what I need it to.</li>
            <li> I use this as a carrier for my essential oils. Will buy more</li>
            <li> I was surprised that the oil is unscented, but there are many benefits to that feature. I would recommend over other carrier oils.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with essential oils. It works great. My only complaint is the top doesn&#x27;t make it easy to pour; it spills all over. A spout would be awesome or medicine dropper-type device. But a funnel works and this design issue doesn&#x27;t detract from the product. Just wastes a little.</li>
            <li> Love the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> Great carrier oil, does exactly what it is supposed to do. My only complaint is the cap design, which makes it terrible for dispensing just a couple of drops. The oil gets all over the bottle and whatever surface it&#x27;s on.</li>
