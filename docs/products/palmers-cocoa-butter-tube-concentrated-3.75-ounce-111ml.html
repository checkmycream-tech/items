            <li>Great product and will continue to keep using it.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for consumers who have eczema like myself.</li>
            <li>The vita E formula is great for the skin and helps soothe the itchy patches that come as a result of having eczema.</li>
            <li>It also makes my skin glow and makes it look healthy, it also smells very good.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for a good moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Nice scent too.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and softens my hands nicely.  </li>
            <li>It is a great cream and a great buy, especially for the given price!</li>
            <li>First I was impressed with the quality of the packaging my lotion was sent in and how quickly it arrived.  </li>
            <li>A brilliant buy that not only smells amazing and chocolaty, but is also luscious and divine on my skin.</li>
            <li>one of my favorite products of all time.</li>
            <li>I love Palmer&#x27;s products, they smell delicious and work even better on dry skin areas, I use this on my feet</li>
            <li>It has worked excellent on our severe dry skin.</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job of dealing with dry hands.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great cream for hands as well as for dry heels and feet.</li>
            <li>but, it feels great on dry cracked winter skin.</li>
            <li>GREAT for stretch marks and dry skin at the knees and elbows!</li>
            <li>When I was pregnant recently I started using this concentrated version and liked it even better.  </li>
            <li>Get the concentrated cream -- the lotions are nowhere near as effective.</li>
            <li>I have been using Palmer Cocoa Butter lotion for years as I have found it to be the best to use on my extremely dry, yet sensitive, skin.  </li>
            <li>It is concentrated but absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>/&gt;This cream absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or stick residue.</li>
            <li>The cream in the tube is best for extra dry areas, hands and feet.</li>
            <li>An old favorite that needs no improvement.</li>
            <li>It works remarkably as a hand cream and, especially, as a foot treatment, leaving my feet so soft, like after a pedicure.</li>
            <li>It soaks into my skin quickly and leaves my skin soft, smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li>I would very much recommend this product to others seeking a non-prescription lotion option.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more in the upcoming future.</li>
            <li>Palmers products never fail.</li>
            <li>The scent is very chocolate-y, almost like hot cocoa mix.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a large amount</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I especially like that the scent is light and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizing product for my dry dark skin...</li>
            <li>The familiar chocolate scent is there as well - the main difference between this and the regular lotion is intensity.</li>
            <li>Use right after every shower and you will never dry out.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes very well, leaving my skin soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>My new go-to cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews that people say you just can&#x27;t prevent strech marks by applying such cream on you belly if you have the gene, though I&#x27;m not quite sure about this.</li>
            <li>Less lotion was needed to achieve that smooth feeling.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff  for my hands (and sometimes as a body lotion) -- and it&#x27;s hard to find except on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Since this cream is so rich, a small dab will go a long way - I love it for dry areas like my hands, elbows and knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> On first application the lotion has a faint cocoa scent, but it is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> My one complaint about regular Palmers is that it&#x27;s difficult to get all of the lotion out of the pump bottles.  </li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s is very thick and concentrated.  </li>
            <li> I apply a thin coat before shaving.</li>

            <li> I love this product!  The cream is smooth, not too thick and not too thin. It soaks into my skin quickly and leaves my skin soft, smooth and glowing. It&#x27;s a great cream for hands as well as for dry heels and feet. I like that it lasts a long time compared to others I have tried. Nice scent too. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It moisturizes very well, leaving my skin soft to the touch. It also makes my skin glow and makes it look healthy, it also smells very good. Great product and will continue to keep using it.</li>

            <li> This cream may not prevent stretch marks but, it feels great on dry cracked winter skin. And, it smells good too!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife to prevent strech marks from appearing.  However, in the last month, those marks came on.  I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews that people say you just can&#x27;t prevent strech marks by applying such cream on you belly if you have the gene, though I&#x27;m not quite sure about this.</li>
            <li> You get immediate, long lasting results with this cream.  The size is perfect to carry with you in your purse.</li>
            <li> This cream is very good.  I keep it in my desk drawer and use it several times a day. It is not greasy and softens my hands nicely.  I especially like that the scent is light and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I bought this for me and my husband. It has worked excellent on our severe dry skin. I will be purchasing more in the upcoming future. Thank you.</li>

            <li> An old favorite that needs no improvement. Don&#x27;t change a thing. I apply a thin coat before shaving.</li>
            <li> A brilliant buy that not only smells amazing and chocolaty, but is also luscious and divine on my skin. It is concentrated but absorbs quickly and I only need a little amount to moisturize my skin. I use Palmer&#x27;s all over the body, making an immediate effect on my skin feeling like the smoothest velvet. It works remarkably as a hand cream and, especially, as a foot treatment, leaving my feet so soft, like after a pedicure. It is a great cream and a great buy, especially for the given price!</li>
            <li> I have been using Palmer Cocoa Butter lotion for years as I have found it to be the best to use on my extremely dry, yet sensitive, skin.  When I was pregnant recently I started using this concentrated version and liked it even better.  Less lotion was needed to achieve that smooth feeling.  My one complaint about regular Palmers is that it&#x27;s difficult to get all of the lotion out of the pump bottles.  This concentrated version remedies that, however I do wish it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizing product for my dry dark skin...I recommend this for a good moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li> Works wonders for dry skin</li>
            <li> GREAT for stretch marks and dry skin at the knees and elbows! Silky, not greasy, with a deep cocoa scent to boot! My new go-to cream.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite products of all time. Been using  Palmers since i was 15 and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I love Palmer&#x27;s products, they smell delicious and work even better on dry skin areas, I use this on my feet</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s Concentrated Cream is a thicker, richer version of their regular cocoa butter lotion. The familiar chocolate scent is there as well - the main difference between this and the regular lotion is intensity. Since this cream is so rich, a small dab will go a long way - I love it for dry areas like my hands, elbows and knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or stick residue. The scent is very chocolate-y, almost like hot cocoa mix.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as expected.A great deal! Palmers products never fail. Is one of the standout names in skin creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> First I was impressed with the quality of the packaging my lotion was sent in and how quickly it arrived.  Palmer&#x27;s is very thick and concentrated.  You don&#x27;t need a large amount so I estimate this tube to last for a long time.  On first application the lotion has a faint cocoa scent, but it is not overpowering.  The lotion does not feel greasy on my skin.  I have been using it for a few days and already notice a big difference in the softness of my skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like how the product did not have a seal under cap to insure it was never used before.</li>
