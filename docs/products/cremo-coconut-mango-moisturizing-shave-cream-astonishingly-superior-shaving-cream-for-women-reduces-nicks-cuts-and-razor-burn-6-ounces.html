            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>, I used his one day and loved it.</li>
            <li>She also tried my Cremo Cream and loved it too.</li>
            <li>One star because it smells good, that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li>I tried my husbands cremo cream, and loved it, decided to get this one for ladies for my legs instead of using his.  </li>
            <li>While not using it myself of course, I&#x27;ve used the original cremocreme which is awesome.</li>
            <li>This has the smoothest, silkiest consistency I&#x27;ve experienced in a shaving cream and it&#x27;s easy to wash away - both from your skin and your blade.</li>
            <li>all thoughts and or opinions are my own</li>
            <li>I would recommend this brand,its good quality for sure.</li>
            <li>(it is kind of like if you just rubbed a bit of soap on your skin) but it protects your skin like nothing else.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the best shave ever</li>
            <li>The best shaving cream out there, by far!!!</li>
            <li>love love the smell of this shaving cream!</li>
            <li>smells better than the original, so I&#x27;m happy that I found this one.</li>
            <li>This is by far and away the best shave cream on the face of the earth.  </li>
            <li>and they love it too and want to get their own.</li>
            <li>since it is non-aerosol, good for traveling too.my legs are silky smooth too.</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for my honest review.</li>
            <li>brands which smelled good (in an herbal, organic way - not as good as this), but they either weren&#x27;t very effective (i.e. didn&#x27;t provide lubrication) or had strange, sticky consistencies that clogged up my razor blade.</li>
            <li>my legs very smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;love</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>The tube is just one more thing to fuss with and requires two hands instead of one.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This stuff takes care of both of my problems and makes my legs softer and more hairless than anything I&#x27;ve ever used for shaving before.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll stick with coochy cream :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay..</li>
            <li>(men have the Cremo Cream too), and they always ask for more.  </li>
            <li>It smells refreshing...</li>
            <li>but I switched to Cremo Cream and like it better.</li>
            <li>much better than others i have used.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find it on Amazon, and to find a women&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li>Smooth and silky legs all over the place!</li>
            <li>There is nothing better.  </li>
            <li>This is such an awesome product!  </li>
            <li>However, it leaves legs so smooth, and without razor bumps or itch!  </li>
            <li>So pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and feel of Cremo Lady.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re looking for something that lathers nicely, and is ultra rich and creamy, you should check this product out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rich, moisturizing cream that provides a nice buffer between skin and blade and allows the razor to glide smoothly with no</li>
            <li>Hopefully with more time I will be free of this problem...</li>
            <li>, USE IT FOR LIFE, IT&#x27;S REALLY THAT GOOD.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sensitive to scents and always buy unscented versions when available, but this product has a very light, pleasant scent that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>This is great shave cream, it&#x27;s not all foaming, just leaves a good layer of slick for my one blade razor and it works much better than spray on creams or gels.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far superior to the foam shaving creams most of us are used to.</li>
            <li>The cream is fine</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine otherwise.</li>
            <li>Not too light.  </li>
            <li>The shave is close and irritation free, leaving no hair bumps for someone like me.  </li>
            <li>A fantastic product in all respects.</li>
            <li>unless i run out and have to borrow my boyfriend&#x27;s regular cremo cream, lol.</li>
            <li>No in-growns, no irritation, just silky, smooth, shave.  </li>
            <li>This is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Enjoy it for Life.</li>
            <li>Not only does it work great</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this product.  </li>
            <li>oh well, it didn&#x27;t claim to be God, so smooth and bump free legs</li>
            <li>Found this stuff at a Wegmans at thought &amp;#34;Ooooh, isn&#x27;t that purity for a decent price?&amp;#34; I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>, it smells great, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>are worth it!</li>
            <li>Have been using the Original and just started using the lady.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, but honestly I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference compared to soap or regular shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I was only able to find mint flavor in stores, which isn&#x27;t nice (smells like toothpaste).</li>
            <li>In hopes of a more effective shaving cream I purchased this on a whim several years ago at Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed was the packaging which is super cute</li>
            <li>Nothing special about it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive  legs and this shaving  cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>True True True!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using the men&#x27;s version of this product for about six months with tremendous success in getting a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Both fade quickly, however, and do not linger on your skin.</li>
            <li>use a double edged razor with this cream and it does a wonderful job of protecting my skin and providing enough lubrication so that my skin doesn&#x27;t suffer from lack of moisture.</li>
            <li>To be honest, this product doesn&#x27;t allow the blades to &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; on the skin, the blades can easily slip left or right during the pass--meaning nicks.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found that it lasts so much longer and provides such great results that I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I used a new 5 blades schick system that is better than a mach3.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine for dudes who only need to apply once to their face, but us ladies have a lot of area to cover.</li>
            <li>kind of like pineapple, coconut and cream (similar to a pina colada without being obnoxious about it).  </li>
            <li>, you realize how nice it is to actually see what you are shaving!  </li>
            <li>Shave is super smooth and feels smoother longer than normal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Following all the advice on the other reviews was great, don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
            <li>This makes shaving much more enjoyable compared to the other shaving products out there.</li>
            <li>The texture is just right.  </li>
            <li>Its awesome how little cream is needed to shave, this bottle will last a while...</li>
            <li>Bought original red label to try and did not like it, passed onto wife and she enjoys the stuff for legs, says it&#x27;s moisturizing and easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>Also it leaves my legs and skin feeling very soft and smooth</li>
            <li>so you think you&#x27;ve seen all of the magic creams on the market, and nothing has ever been better than plain soap for me.</li>
            <li>I also want to mention that I love that this shaving cream is for sensitive skin because my skin is so sensitive and most products that say sensitive still break me out but not with the cremo brand.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try something new.</li>
            <li>Actually does leave skin really smooth!</li>
            <li>but if it helps keep me from bleeding all over the place I&#x27;ll gladly fork out the extra money.  </li>
            <li>Came on time exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t prevent ingrown hairs, hairs regrew just as fast,  Does leave the skin soft afterward and rinses off easily, the rest is of ad is just wishful thinking.  </li>
            <li>I would also recommend the original (male-marketed, with the red-cap) - it&#x27;s the same quality, just with a more stereotypically masculine scent.</li>
            <li>The bottle will last a long time, the scent is light and nice.  </li>
            <li>Followed directions to a T, hot water for 30 seconds and a large almond sized amount.</li>
            <li>I actually prefer the original scent...which I guess is for a man, but prefer it over the floral/baby powder fresh scent.</li>
            <li>This is great considering I am very prone to razor bumps which is very unconformable and not nice to look at.</li>
            <li>The Lady Cremo is a very sweet, sugary scent (almost like Pink Sugar perfume but not nearly as strong) and the Original Cremo is a much more citrusy, crisp, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge improvement after only using this product once.  </li>
            <li>The scent coming from the packing was very welcoming, wasn&#x27;t expecting it.</li>
            <li>The grapefruit scent is much fruitier than Cremo Cream.</li>
            <li>Much easier to do legs/pits in the shower.</li>
            <li>and I love that it’s pink.</li>
            <li>so that is very affordable if you can get it on sale</li>
            <li>only request is that they make a carry-on compatible size available.  </li>
            <li>Helps so much with shaving, makes it easier to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>My search is now over thanks to Cremo</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really that good\\&quot; and they aren&#x27;t kidding.</li>
            <li>so much a sickle?</li>
            <li>I could not wait to get back to my skintimate shaving gel which is also paraben free.</li>
            <li>conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;Especially good product for shaving delicate areas</li>
            <li>I first discovered the Men&#x27;s version at Walgreen&#x27;s, but when it came time to buy a new one, they no longer carried it.</li>
            <li>I did a comparison test  and used Dove body wash on one leg and this shaving cream on the other, and Dove leg had more slip for shaving and was smoother afterwards.</li>
            <li>It also keeps my razor lasting longer because it rinses clean out and doesn&#x27;t clog.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why I took so long buying the cheap shaving cream in a can.</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t really SEE where it is that you shaved/need to shave or rinse it off, you could buy a cheap bottle of glycerin or a bar of glycerin soap and get the same exact results and a $4 bottle of glycerin would last you about 3-4 years shaving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s usually a couple of dollars cheaper (go figure), but I love the scent of this version so much I&#x27;m willing to pay the difference.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Cremo Cream along with the Gillette Venus Embrace razor.</li>
            <li>known!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and this cream is very gentle and really protects your skin from the razor, while still getting a super-close shave - smoother than I get with the more common foamy shave</li>
            <li>I also love how little you need to use.</li>
            <li>If, however, you use a shaving brush it lathers a little better.</li>
            <li>The scent is a normal &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; smell, not too floral or musky.  </li>
            <li>still prefer the more fluffy foams.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>,i really like getting out of the shower and already feeling silky and smooth and not have to apply lotion and other stuff to get that soft skin feel.</li>
            <li>I also end up with super dry patchy skin without in shower lotion in the winter.</li>
            <li>Red label has more of an orange citrus smell, pink is piña colada.</li>
            <li>I would we willing to pay extra!  </li>
            <li>It will likely last you far longer than a cheap cream</li>
            <li>When you first put it on, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it could possibly do anything</li>
            <li>It is true that a little gets the job done, but it makes my sensitive skin very itchy after using.  </li>
            <li>The product rinses cleanly, no residue, and leaves the skin lightly moisturized.</li>
            <li>The texture is a little more creamy/liquid (prbably helps it come out of the pump), but it works just the same and comes in a pump.</li>
            <li>I get a nice shave and don’t have any razor burn after I shave,which I typically have after shaving with the other brand I use.</li>
            <li>I was really, really, really, REALLY, hoping I had finally found something to somewhat ease the pain.</li>
            <li>The skin on my legs is extremely sensitive and this has worked wonders for preventing irritation after shaving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m someone with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Each time I shave with this, it leaves my skin so soft and irritation</li>
            <li>If you use too much product, you won&#x27;t see any difference between Cremo and your regular shave gel or cream.</li>
            <li>I use it on my arm pits and don&#x27;t have near the bumps I did before.</li>
            <li>It also, leaves my skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li>The only reason for the 4 stars is because it didn&#x27;t really help the razor burn in the nether regions...</li>
            <li>It is very concentrated, one tube will last about a year.</li>
            <li>I hate having to use another shave cream when I fly!</li>
            <li>I only tired this because I read good things about it</li>
            <li>To be honest for my budget it is a bit expensive currently $10.49 on amazon for a 6oz bottle,it does work amazing but in comparison to your other drugstore brands that will only set you back about $1-$4 its a bit much.</li>
            <li>use very little, and razor glides easily.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin and even with traditional shaving gel/foam I could end up with the dreaded red bumpies.</li>
            <li>It is exactly the same as the regular version in terms of ingredients and function.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin and Cremo Cream leaves it soft and without the red bumps I used to get after shaving.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like the workhorse of shaving creams - a little goes a long way, it&#x27;s easy to spread, and it practically guarantees that your blade will glide gently over your skin with as minimal irritation as one can get away with given that you&#x27;re dragging a blade along your skin.  </li>
            <li>It has a slick texture when done right and is better than any gel or coochy cream for those delicate areas.</li>
            <li>This definitely made my legs incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>it is kind of expensive</li>
            <li>This shaving cream is not bad, but it&#x27;s not outstanding.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with a shaving cream; previously I would buy shaving foam.  </li>
            <li>In sum, even though this is a little more expensive than most other shaving creams out there, I would definitely recommend giving it a try if you have sensitive skin or get razor burn often.</li>
            <li>Definitely won&#x27;t be going back to the old stuff.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, this product didn&#x27;t work any better than any regular $3 shave cream for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells sweet and subtle.</li>
            <li>A little really is all you need.</li>

            <li> I would recommend this brand,its good quality for sure.</li>

            <li> since it is non-aerosol, good for traveling too.my legs are silky smooth too.</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for my honest review.</li>
            <li> brands which smelled good (in an herbal, organic way - not as good as this), but they either weren&#x27;t very effective (i.e. didn&#x27;t provide lubrication) or had strange, sticky consistencies that clogged up my razor blade.</li>
            <li> my legs very smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;love</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> The tube is just one more thing to fuss with and requires two hands instead of one.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff takes care of both of my problems and makes my legs softer and more hairless than anything I&#x27;ve ever used for shaving before.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll stick with coochy cream :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay..</li>
            <li> (men have the Cremo Cream too), and they always ask for more.  </li>
            <li> It smells refreshing...</li>
            <li> but I switched to Cremo Cream and like it better.</li>
            <li> much better than others i have used.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find it on Amazon, and to find a women&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li> Smooth and silky legs all over the place!</li>
            <li> There is nothing better.  </li>
            <li> This is such an awesome product!  </li>
            <li> However, it leaves legs so smooth, and without razor bumps or itch!  </li>
            <li> So pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feel of Cremo Lady.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re looking for something that lathers nicely, and is ultra rich and creamy, you should check this product out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rich, moisturizing cream that provides a nice buffer between skin and blade and allows the razor to glide smoothly with no</li>
            <li> Hopefully with more time I will be free of this problem...</li>
            <li> , USE IT FOR LIFE, IT&#x27;S REALLY THAT GOOD.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sensitive to scents and always buy unscented versions when available, but this product has a very light, pleasant scent that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> This is great shave cream, it&#x27;s not all foaming, just leaves a good layer of slick for my one blade razor and it works much better than spray on creams or gels.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far superior to the foam shaving creams most of us are used to.</li>
            <li> The cream is fine</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fine otherwise.</li>
            <li> Not too light.  </li>
            <li> The shave is close and irritation free, leaving no hair bumps for someone like me.  </li>
            <li> A fantastic product in all respects.</li>
            <li> unless i run out and have to borrow my boyfriend&#x27;s regular cremo cream, lol.</li>
            <li> No in-growns, no irritation, just silky, smooth, shave.  </li>
            <li> This is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Enjoy it for Life.</li>
            <li> Not only does it work great</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this product.  </li>
            <li> oh well, it didn&#x27;t claim to be God, so smooth and bump free legs</li>
            <li> Found this stuff at a Wegmans at thought &amp;#34;Ooooh, isn&#x27;t that purity for a decent price?&amp;#34; I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> , it smells great, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> are worth it!</li>
            <li> Have been using the Original and just started using the lady.  </li>
            <li> Smells good, but honestly I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference compared to soap or regular shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I was only able to find mint flavor in stores, which isn&#x27;t nice (smells like toothpaste).</li>
            <li> In hopes of a more effective shaving cream I purchased this on a whim several years ago at Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed was the packaging which is super cute</li>
            <li> Nothing special about it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive  legs and this shaving  cream is amazing.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> True True True!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using the men&#x27;s version of this product for about six months with tremendous success in getting a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Both fade quickly, however, and do not linger on your skin.</li>
            <li> use a double edged razor with this cream and it does a wonderful job of protecting my skin and providing enough lubrication so that my skin doesn&#x27;t suffer from lack of moisture.</li>
            <li> To be honest, this product doesn&#x27;t allow the blades to &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; on the skin, the blades can easily slip left or right during the pass--meaning nicks.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found that it lasts so much longer and provides such great results that I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I used a new 5 blades schick system that is better than a mach3.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine for dudes who only need to apply once to their face, but us ladies have a lot of area to cover.</li>
            <li> kind of like pineapple, coconut and cream (similar to a pina colada without being obnoxious about it).  </li>
            <li> , you realize how nice it is to actually see what you are shaving!  </li>
            <li> Shave is super smooth and feels smoother longer than normal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Following all the advice on the other reviews was great, don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
            <li> This makes shaving much more enjoyable compared to the other shaving products out there.</li>
            <li> The texture is just right.  </li>
            <li> Its awesome how little cream is needed to shave, this bottle will last a while...</li>
            <li> Bought original red label to try and did not like it, passed onto wife and she enjoys the stuff for legs, says it&#x27;s moisturizing and easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> Also it leaves my legs and skin feeling very soft and smooth</li>
            <li> so you think you&#x27;ve seen all of the magic creams on the market, and nothing has ever been better than plain soap for me.</li>
            <li> I also want to mention that I love that this shaving cream is for sensitive skin because my skin is so sensitive and most products that say sensitive still break me out but not with the cremo brand.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try something new.</li>
            <li> Actually does leave skin really smooth!</li>
            <li> but if it helps keep me from bleeding all over the place I&#x27;ll gladly fork out the extra money.  </li>
            <li> Came on time exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t prevent ingrown hairs, hairs regrew just as fast,  Does leave the skin soft afterward and rinses off easily, the rest is of ad is just wishful thinking.  </li>
            <li> I would also recommend the original (male-marketed, with the red-cap) - it&#x27;s the same quality, just with a more stereotypically masculine scent.</li>
            <li> The bottle will last a long time, the scent is light and nice.  </li>
            <li> Followed directions to a T, hot water for 30 seconds and a large almond sized amount.</li>
            <li> I actually prefer the original scent...which I guess is for a man, but prefer it over the floral/baby powder fresh scent.</li>
            <li> This is great considering I am very prone to razor bumps which is very unconformable and not nice to look at.</li>
            <li> The Lady Cremo is a very sweet, sugary scent (almost like Pink Sugar perfume but not nearly as strong) and the Original Cremo is a much more citrusy, crisp, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge improvement after only using this product once.  </li>
            <li> The scent coming from the packing was very welcoming, wasn&#x27;t expecting it.</li>
            <li> The grapefruit scent is much fruitier than Cremo Cream.</li>
            <li> Much easier to do legs/pits in the shower.</li>
            <li> and I love that it’s pink.</li>
            <li> so that is very affordable if you can get it on sale</li>
            <li> only request is that they make a carry-on compatible size available.  </li>
            <li> Helps so much with shaving, makes it easier to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> My search is now over thanks to Cremo</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really that good\\&quot; and they aren&#x27;t kidding.</li>
            <li> so much a sickle?</li>
            <li> I could not wait to get back to my skintimate shaving gel which is also paraben free.</li>
            <li> conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;Especially good product for shaving delicate areas</li>
            <li> I first discovered the Men&#x27;s version at Walgreen&#x27;s, but when it came time to buy a new one, they no longer carried it.</li>
            <li> I did a comparison test  and used Dove body wash on one leg and this shaving cream on the other, and Dove leg had more slip for shaving and was smoother afterwards.</li>
            <li> It also keeps my razor lasting longer because it rinses clean out and doesn&#x27;t clog.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I took so long buying the cheap shaving cream in a can.</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t really SEE where it is that you shaved/need to shave or rinse it off, you could buy a cheap bottle of glycerin or a bar of glycerin soap and get the same exact results and a $4 bottle of glycerin would last you about 3-4 years shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually a couple of dollars cheaper (go figure), but I love the scent of this version so much I&#x27;m willing to pay the difference.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Cremo Cream along with the Gillette Venus Embrace razor.</li>
            <li> known!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and this cream is very gentle and really protects your skin from the razor, while still getting a super-close shave - smoother than I get with the more common foamy shave</li>
            <li> I also love how little you need to use.</li>
            <li> If, however, you use a shaving brush it lathers a little better.</li>
            <li> The scent is a normal &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; smell, not too floral or musky.  </li>
            <li> still prefer the more fluffy foams.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ,i really like getting out of the shower and already feeling silky and smooth and not have to apply lotion and other stuff to get that soft skin feel.</li>
            <li> I also end up with super dry patchy skin without in shower lotion in the winter.</li>
            <li> Red label has more of an orange citrus smell, pink is piña colada.</li>
            <li> I would we willing to pay extra!  </li>
            <li> It will likely last you far longer than a cheap cream</li>
            <li> When you first put it on, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it could possibly do anything</li>
            <li> It is true that a little gets the job done, but it makes my sensitive skin very itchy after using.  </li>
            <li> The product rinses cleanly, no residue, and leaves the skin lightly moisturized.</li>
            <li> The texture is a little more creamy/liquid (prbably helps it come out of the pump), but it works just the same and comes in a pump.</li>
            <li> I get a nice shave and don’t have any razor burn after I shave,which I typically have after shaving with the other brand I use.</li>
            <li> I was really, really, really, REALLY, hoping I had finally found something to somewhat ease the pain.</li>
            <li> The skin on my legs is extremely sensitive and this has worked wonders for preventing irritation after shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Each time I shave with this, it leaves my skin so soft and irritation</li>
            <li> If you use too much product, you won&#x27;t see any difference between Cremo and your regular shave gel or cream.</li>
            <li> I use it on my arm pits and don&#x27;t have near the bumps I did before.</li>
            <li> It also, leaves my skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li> The only reason for the 4 stars is because it didn&#x27;t really help the razor burn in the nether regions...</li>
            <li> It is very concentrated, one tube will last about a year.</li>
            <li> I hate having to use another shave cream when I fly!</li>
            <li> I only tired this because I read good things about it</li>
            <li> To be honest for my budget it is a bit expensive currently $10.49 on amazon for a 6oz bottle,it does work amazing but in comparison to your other drugstore brands that will only set you back about $1-$4 its a bit much.</li>
            <li> use very little, and razor glides easily.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and even with traditional shaving gel/foam I could end up with the dreaded red bumpies.</li>
            <li> It is exactly the same as the regular version in terms of ingredients and function.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin and Cremo Cream leaves it soft and without the red bumps I used to get after shaving.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the workhorse of shaving creams - a little goes a long way, it&#x27;s easy to spread, and it practically guarantees that your blade will glide gently over your skin with as minimal irritation as one can get away with given that you&#x27;re dragging a blade along your skin.  </li>
            <li> It has a slick texture when done right and is better than any gel or coochy cream for those delicate areas.</li>
            <li> This definitely made my legs incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> it is kind of expensive</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is not bad, but it&#x27;s not outstanding.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with a shaving cream; previously I would buy shaving foam.  </li>
            <li> In sum, even though this is a little more expensive than most other shaving creams out there, I would definitely recommend giving it a try if you have sensitive skin or get razor burn often.</li>
            <li> Definitely won&#x27;t be going back to the old stuff.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product didn&#x27;t work any better than any regular $3 shave cream for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells sweet and subtle.</li>
            <li> A little really is all you need.</li>
            <li> It does not lather and a little really does go a long way.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t always completely eliminate it, especially if I forget to moisturize after showering, but it&#x27;s definitely leaps and bounds above your typical foam shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I normally use a small amount of product; in fact, I am still using the current tube I bought earlier this year.  </li>
            <li> but its something tropical maybe coconut,the scent is nice very faint.</li>
            <li> As far as slowing down hair growth, I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic, with the faint scent of coconut.  </li>
            <li> It was harsh on my skin (and my nose), plus it wasn&#x27;t nearly as lubricating so that I ended up with a case of itchy, irritated razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Tested it against plain old Brut shave cream.</li>
            <li> I have already used this several times and you can’t even tell,its like nothing is missing out of the bottle so its bound to last a long time.</li>
            <li> One tube lasts me about 2 months, shaving underarms daily and legs about every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> an extra plus, it doesn&#x27;t have parabens or other dicey</li>
            <li> I will be repurchasing and so long shaving gel!</li>
            <li> I noticed that while using this is I didn’t nick or cut myself which I usually do with regular brand shaving cream,but I was using a very new and sharp razor so it could be due to that.</li>
            <li> I use this with an electric shaver and there is not residual rash or dry skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I like how it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or cause razor burn.  </li>
            <li> My legs where dry and itchy after shaving, that NEVER happens.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to, as it is different from your average shaving creams.  </li>
            <li> I will probably just keep getting the regular version since it tends to be slightly cheaper.  </li>
            <li> It gets really bad in the winter, when my skin is more dry.  </li>
            <li> , I used a little added a little water this did NOT lather at all, it&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li> Even though it only takes a little bit, I need five separate applications: armpits, calves, calves, thighs, thighs.</li>
            <li> I have even spent quite a bit of money trying just about every shave cream out there.</li>
            <li> I have just used my hands to rub it on my wet legs and it works</li>
            <li> Even though I can&#x27;t tell the difference in performance, I like the pink cap.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I expected.</li>
            <li> I get bad razor burn on the back of my legs, and when I first tried this cream, no bumps!!</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> All the other reviews are spot-on -</li>
            <li> and you only have to use a small amount.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price</li>
            <li> For some reason, shaving lately has left me with razor bumps and itchy legs!</li>
            <li> In fact pert shampoo beat it hands down.</li>
            <li> And I have to set down my razor for each one.</li>
            <li> The texture makes it a little hard to spread on your skin, but everyone may react differently.</li>
            <li> , you have to keep rubbing it vigorously until you get a slight lather, it does not foam up.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin, this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make me legs itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> only bad part about this is that it is a bit more expensive than your typical drugstore shave cream</li>
            <li> I used to only get a couple uses out of each razor before they would become irritating, but now even if the moisturizing strip is worn down, the Cremo Cream still protects my legs</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have to shave everyday and</li>
            <li> It took a bit getting used to because it isn&#x27;t thick like other shaving creams</li>
            <li> A small pea size dot is all you need for one underarm.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s not better</li>
            <li> Every time I shave, I get little red, angry bumps!</li>
            <li> use very little of this before shaving, and it doesn&#x27;t go on relatively thick like shaving cream or gel.  </li>
            <li> I thought it might be hard to see</li>
            <li> razor burn and irritation are a common pain I have to deal with.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t create a thick lather which I prefer.</li>
            <li> You need very little and no razor burn!</li>
            <li> but I must be missing something here because I was NOT impressed in the least.</li>
            <li> too expensive for little results in return.</li>
            <li> Worked it in to a glaze, still not good.</li>
            <li> but this stuff did not win the battle.</li>
            <li> Something I had never experienced before.  </li>
            <li> I use this shaving cream with the Venus Embrace razor, and it is now impossible to cut myself and skin irritation is a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product, as I have always had bumps on my legs from shaving.  </li>
            <li> It is very thin.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions to the T and this just made me frustrated</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Tested it against plain old Brut shave cream. Sorry but this stuff did not win the battle. Felt like I was plucking hairs off my face. Followed directions to a T, hot water for 30 seconds and a large almond sized amount. Worked it in to a glaze, still not good. In fact pert shampoo beat it hands down. Someone should sell a Gel in a tube now that would work since gel in a can always leaks out at the valve but gives the best shave of all. FYI I used a new 5 blades schick system that is better than a mach3. Tested over 3 mornings in the shower.</li>
            <li> Came in yesterday, used it last night...my legs feel so smooth!!! Don&#x27;t know why I took so long buying the cheap shaving cream in a can.Its awesome how little cream is needed to shave, this bottle will last a while... but I  Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this stuff.  It is true that a little gets the job done, but it makes my sensitive skin very itchy after using.  I also detest the fragrance... smells like cheapo suntan lotion (coco-nutty).</li>
            <li> It was delivered on time, which is perfect! The scent coming from the packing was very welcoming, wasn&#x27;t expecting it. It smells like strawberry baby powder</li>
            <li> Cremo Cream for ladies is excellent. It smells fantastic, with the faint scent of coconut.  The texture is just right.  Not too light.  Not too heavy.  It spreads on evenly and remains in place, so there is no need to use soap.  Then when you go to shave, the cream provides the traction you need for the razor to glide effortlessly.  The shave is close and irritation free, leaving no hair bumps for someone like me.  I love it.  A fantastic product in all respects.</li>
            <li> Yep, pina colada scent. It is exactly the same as the regular version in terms of ingredients and function. I will probably just keep getting the regular version since it tends to be slightly cheaper.  I wish they would make this in a pump bottle. The tube is just one more thing to fuss with and requires two hands instead of one. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine for dudes who only need to apply once to their face, but us ladies have a lot of area to cover. Even though it only takes a little bit, I need five separate applications: armpits, calves, calves, thighs, thighs. And I have to set down my razor for each one. A pump would be the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; ladies&#x27; version and I would we willing to pay extra!  EDIT: I now use Kiss MY Face brand shave cream. The texture is a little more creamy/liquid (prbably helps it come out of the pump), but it works just the same and comes in a pump. The grapefruit scent is much fruitier than Cremo Cream. I was only able to find mint flavor in stores, which isn&#x27;t nice (smells like toothpaste). Will probably keep buying grapefruit scent on Amazon. Ladies, you should try Kiss MY Face instead just because of the pump! Much easier to do legs/pits in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have been using the men&#x27;s version of this product for about six months with tremendous success in getting a clean shave.  My wife was complaining about how her legs got irritated when she shaved them.  I told her I knew just what she needed and ordered this product for her.  She will use nothing else now.</li>
            <li> I have gone through the entire bottle.  I love it.</li>
            <li> ****Disclaimer**** I received this product for free,for review purposes,all thoughts and or opinions are my own and I was not compensated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before receiving this product I had never heard of this company so I was excited to try something new.First thing I noticed was the packaging which is super cute and I love that it’s pink.I cant quite put my finger on what it smells like but its something tropical maybe coconut,the scent is nice very faint.I noticed with this shaving cream I get a nice shave and don’t have any razor burn after I shave,which I typically have after shaving with the other brand I use.Also it leaves my legs and skin feeling very soft and smooth,i really like getting out of the shower and already feeling silky and smooth and not have to apply lotion and other stuff to get that soft skin feel.I have already used this several times and you can’t even tell,its like nothing is missing out of the bottle so its bound to last a long time.To be honest for my budget it is a bit expensive currently $10.49 on amazon for a 6oz bottle,it does work amazing but in comparison to your other drugstore brands that will only set you back about $1-$4 its a bit much.I also want to mention that I love that this shaving cream is for sensitive skin because my skin is so sensitive and most products that say sensitive still break me out but not with the cremo brand.I noticed that while using this is I didn’t nick or cut myself which I usually do with regular brand shaving cream,but I was using a very new and sharp razor so it could be due to that.Shortly after receiving this I was at a local store and did see there shaving cream but it was not the lady’s one,it was price on sale at only $5 so that is very affordable if you can get it on sale,before then I had never noticed this brand in the shaving isle and trust me I am in there a lot,with couponing and gift card deals. I would recommend this brand,its good quality for sure.I have included a photo below.</li>
            <li> i will never ever ever use anything else on my legs again! ...unless i run out and have to borrow my boyfriend&#x27;s regular cremo cream, lol. it is absolutely amazing! everyone will get one for christmas!</li>
            <li> To be honest, this product doesn&#x27;t allow the blades to &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; on the skin, the blades can easily slip left or right during the pass--meaning nicks.  Didn&#x27;t prevent ingrown hairs, hairs regrew just as fast,  Does leave the skin soft afterward and rinses off easily, the rest is of ad is just wishful thinking.  Not worth the price, you get a lot of product but it doesn&#x27;t do what it says it&#x27;ll do.  Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true. All the TRY IT ONCE TO BELIEVE IT, USE IT FOR LIFE, IT&#x27;S REALLY THAT GOOD.  True True True!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following all the advice on the other reviews was great, don&#x27;t use too much.  My legs are smoooooth.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product, as I have always had bumps on my legs from shaving.  It gets really bad in the winter, when my skin is more dry.  I have noticed a huge improvement after only using this product once.  I have no bumps, and my legs are smoother longer.  It takes some getting used to, as it is different from your average shaving creams.  It does not lather and a little really does go a long way.  A great product!  I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> The best shaving cream out there, by far!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have pretty sensitive skin and even with traditional shaving gel/foam I could end up with the dreaded red bumpies. I also end up with super dry patchy skin without in shower lotion in the winter. This stuff takes care of both of my problems and makes my legs softer and more hairless than anything I&#x27;ve ever used for shaving before. I also love how little you need to use. Definitely won&#x27;t be going back to the old stuff.</li>
            <li> Works great, helps reduce ingrown hairs and your skin stays moist.</li>
            <li> No idea what the rave reviews are all about. I have to shave everyday and razor burn and irritation are a common pain I have to deal with. I was really, really, really, REALLY, hoping I had finally found something to somewhat ease the pain. Unfortunately, this product didn&#x27;t work any better than any regular $3 shave cream for sensitive skin. I got the same amount of razor burn and irritation as I always have. The cream is fine I suppose but for $10 and zero improvement, I will go back to regular shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;(I use a 5 blade Venus Embrace).</li>
            <li> too expensive for little results in return. The texture makes it a little hard to spread on your skin, but everyone may react differently. I think I&#x27;ll stick with coochy cream :)</li>
            <li> like rotten fruit but it&#x27;s fine otherwise.</li>
            <li> In hopes of a more effective shaving cream I purchased this on a whim several years ago at Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond and I do not regret it - it&#x27;s now my go-to shaving cream. The skin on my legs is extremely sensitive and this has worked wonders for preventing irritation after shaving. It doesn&#x27;t always completely eliminate it, especially if I forget to moisturize after showering, but it&#x27;s definitely leaps and bounds above your typical foam shaving cream. In fact, I made the mistake of using a cheapo foam cream recently on vacation and regretted it immediately. It was harsh on my skin (and my nose), plus it wasn&#x27;t nearly as lubricating so that I ended up with a case of itchy, irritated razor burn.  I have tried a couple of supposedly &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands which smelled good (in an herbal, organic way - not as good as this), but they either weren&#x27;t very effective (i.e. didn&#x27;t provide lubrication) or had strange, sticky consistencies that clogged up my razor blade. This has the smoothest, silkiest consistency I&#x27;ve experienced in a shaving cream and it&#x27;s easy to wash away - both from your skin and your blade. It&#x27;s like the workhorse of shaving creams - a little goes a long way, it&#x27;s easy to spread, and it practically guarantees that your blade will glide gently over your skin with as minimal irritation as one can get away with given that you&#x27;re dragging a blade along your skin.  Plus it smells amazing! And it&#x27;s not jam-packed with a ton of chemicals!  In sum, even though this is a little more expensive than most other shaving creams out there, I would definitely recommend giving it a try if you have sensitive skin or get razor burn often. It will likely last you far longer than a cheap cream anyway. I would also recommend the original (male-marketed, with the red-cap) - it&#x27;s the same quality, just with a more stereotypically masculine scent. It&#x27;s usually a couple of dollars cheaper (go figure), but I love the scent of this version so much I&#x27;m willing to pay the difference.  However, despite my glowing review, I suppose I would have to caution: if scented products cause problems for you, I would not recommend either of these products as they do have added fragrance. It&#x27;s not heavy but it&#x27;s there. The Lady Cremo is a very sweet, sugary scent (almost like Pink Sugar perfume but not nearly as strong) and the Original Cremo is a much more citrusy, crisp, fresh scent. Both fade quickly, however, and do not linger on your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.. Nothing special about it. It didn&#x27;t create a thick lather which I prefer.</li>
            <li> All the other reviews are spot-on - this is an excellent product.  It&#x27;s far superior to the foam shaving creams most of us are used to. It&#x27;s a rich, moisturizing cream that provides a nice buffer between skin and blade and allows the razor to glide smoothly with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sensitive to scents and always buy unscented versions when available, but this product has a very light, pleasant scent that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. A little bit goes a long way.  One tube lasts me about 2 months, shaving underarms daily and legs about every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only request is that they make a carry-on compatible size available.  I hate having to use another shave cream when I fly!</li>
            <li> I like it, but not the fragrance</li>
            <li> This is by far and away the best shave cream on the face of the earth.  No in-growns, no irritation, just silky, smooth, shave.  Literally the best.  All of my houseguests get a bottle when they visit (men have the Cremo Cream too), and they always ask for more.  Even gave a bottle to each of my bridal party as part of their thank you gifts.</li>
            <li> Actually does leave skin really smooth!</li>
            <li> This is great shave cream, it&#x27;s not all foaming, just leaves a good layer of slick for my one blade razor and it works much better than spray on creams or gels.  I it is kind of expensive but if it helps keep me from bleeding all over the place I&#x27;ll gladly fork out the extra money.  Those nicks on the shin hurt!</li>
            <li> Very nice shaving cream/lotion.  It smells refreshing...kind of like pineapple, coconut and cream (similar to a pina colada without being obnoxious about it).  If you&#x27;re looking for a foaming shave gel, this is not for you.  However, if you&#x27;re looking for something that lathers nicely, and is ultra rich and creamy, you should check this product out.</li>
            <li> good product. ordered because of plastic tube.  do not like rust stains metal shaving cans leave on shower tile</li>
            <li> Not any different than if you shaved with any lotion. I was wanting that is equal to my husbands Shave Butter, I used his one day and loved it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife; she loves it!  She also tried my Cremo Cream and loved it too.</li>
            <li> I used to use Coochy cream for years but I switched to Cremo Cream and like it better. It takes some getting used to, you have to keep rubbing it vigorously until you get a slight lather, it does not foam up. It has a slick texture when done right and is better than any gel or coochy cream for those delicate areas.</li>
            <li> This definitely made my legs incredibly soft. As far as slowing down hair growth, I don&#x27;t think so. That&#x27;s just wishful thinking.</li>
            <li> very nice product! use very little, and razor glides easily. much better than others i have used.</li>
            <li> Came on time exactly as described. I have sensitive  legs and this shaving  cream is amazing. You need very little and no razor burn!</li>
            <li> This is fantastic. A little really is all you need. I use this with an electric shaver and there is not residual rash or dry skin.</li>
            <li> Amazed at how well this works.  Dramatically reduced shaves.</li>
            <li> I use this shaving cream with the Venus Embrace razor, and it is now impossible to cut myself and skin irritation is a thing of the past.  I have somewhat sensitive skin and Cremo Cream leaves it soft and without the red bumps I used to get after shaving.  It took a bit getting used to because it isn&#x27;t thick like other shaving creams and you only have to use a small amount.  When you first put it on, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it could possibly do anything (it is kind of like if you just rubbed a bit of soap on your skin) but it protects your skin like nothing else.  It also keeps my razor lasting longer because it rinses clean out and doesn&#x27;t clog.  I used to only get a couple uses out of each razor before they would become irritating, but now even if the moisturizing strip is worn down, the Cremo Cream still protects my legs and I don&#x27;t get any irritation. I highly recommend Cremo Cream along with the Gillette Venus Embrace razor.</li>
            <li> Very good shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;Left my legs very smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;love it.&lt;br /&gt;came on time.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these as gifts.  While not using it myself of course, I&#x27;ve used the original cremocreme which is awesome.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is not bad, but it&#x27;s not outstanding. I did a comparison test  and used Dove body wash on one leg and this shaving cream on the other, and Dove leg had more slip for shaving and was smoother afterwards.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best shave ever and it smells like pina colada. I&#x27;ve tried every shaving cream, gel and yes, even the powder... at every price point...nothing compares to this. Shaves closer so shaves last longer.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> Smells great, like a fruity pina colada. Helps so much with shaving, makes it easier to get a close shave. Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. Just follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> I actually prefer the original scent...which I guess is for a man, but prefer it over the floral/baby powder fresh scent. Best shaving cream bc of it&#x27;s thickness. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone with extremely sensitive skin. Every time I shave, I get little red, angry bumps! I have tried each type of razor you can think of. I&#x27;ve gone through the cheapies with just one blade on up to those fancy-pants schick intuition with the moisturizing bar of soap surrounding the blades. Nothing prevented the itchy bumps! I have even spent quite a bit of money trying just about every shave cream out there. My search is now over thanks to Cremo Cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a white cream of a richer lotion type consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something to note is that the Cremo Cream does not lather up and you only need a teensy amount. I use a dime sized amount per leg and my bottle lasted me months. If, however, you use a shaving brush it lathers a little better. I have just used my hands to rub it on my wet legs and it works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells sweet and subtle. The scent does not linger nor is it overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a double edged razor with this cream and it does a wonderful job of protecting my skin and providing enough lubrication so that my skin doesn&#x27;t suffer from lack of moisture. Each time I shave with this, it leaves my skin so soft and irritation free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad part about this is that it is a bit more expensive than your typical drugstore shave cream but I&#x27;ve found that it lasts so much longer and provides such great results that I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> If you use too much product, you won&#x27;t see any difference between Cremo and your regular shave gel or cream. A small pea size dot is all you need for one underarm. Rub it in, shave and rub any remaining cream into skin as post shave conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;Especially good product for shaving delicate areas, you realize how nice it is to actually see what you are shaving!  I first discovered the Men&#x27;s version at Walgreen&#x27;s, but when it came time to buy a new one, they no longer carried it. I was glad to find it on Amazon, and to find a women&#x27;s version. Even though I can&#x27;t tell the difference in performance, I like the pink cap. One tube lasts a looong time.</li>
            <li> Found this stuff at a Wegmans at thought &amp;#34;Ooooh, isn&#x27;t that purity for a decent price?&amp;#34; I love this stuff! It lasts forever too.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Works great. I use it on my arm pits and don&#x27;t have near the bumps I did before. I also use a safety razor which I think helps a lot too. Doesn&#x27;t take much to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> smells better than the original, so I&#x27;m happy that I found this one. Smooth and silky legs all over the place!</li>
            <li> The tagline is \\&quot;Try it once to believe it. Enjoy it for Life. It&#x27;s really that good\\&quot; and they aren&#x27;t kidding. This stuff is awesome and I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s not better known!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and this cream is very gentle and really protects your skin from the razor, while still getting a super-close shave - smoother than I get with the more common foamy shave gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an extra plus, it doesn&#x27;t have parabens or other dicey ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve let guests try my Cremo and they love it too and want to get their own. It&#x27;s like the gold standard of shaving creams/gels.</li>
            <li> Bought original red label to try and did not like it, passed onto wife and she enjoys the stuff for legs, says it&#x27;s moisturizing and easy on the skin. Red label has more of an orange citrus smell, pink is piña colada.</li>
            <li> best shaving cream I have ever used!! since it is non-aerosol, good for traveling too.my legs are silky smooth too.</li>
            <li> It is the ONLY shaving cream I use.  There is nothing better.  Not only does it work great, it smells great, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This makes shaving much more enjoyable compared to the other shaving products out there. It also, leaves my skin soft and silky. This is great considering I am very prone to razor bumps which is very unconformable and not nice to look at. This and the vitamin E lotion have almost gotten rid of all my bumps. Hopefully with more time I will be free of this problem...</li>
            <li> This is such an awesome product!  I came to amazon searching for some anti-itch lotion. For some reason, shaving lately has left me with razor bumps and itchy legs! Something I had never experienced before.  My search results brought me to this.  I read the description and thought, well, this seems to address my concerns specifically (and anti itch lotions didn&#x27;t seem to address my specific concerns).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You use very little of this before shaving, and it doesn&#x27;t go on relatively thick like shaving cream or gel.  It is very thin.  However, it leaves legs so smooth, and without razor bumps or itch!  The bottle will last a long time, the scent is light and nice.  I will be repurchasing and so long shaving gel!</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with a shaving cream; previously I would buy shaving foam.  I really enjoy using this product.  I like how it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or cause razor burn.  I have also noticed that I get a closer, smoother shave so I don&#x27;t need to shave as often.  I normally use a small amount of product; in fact, I am still using the current tube I bought earlier this year.  I thought it might be hard to see where I last last shaved (with the foam you can tell what areas have been done) but Creamo has a bit of lather to it, so that isn&#x27;t an issue for me.  The product rinses cleanly, no residue, and leaves the skin lightly moisturized. The scent is a normal &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; smell, not too floral or musky.  Overall I would recommend Creamo, especially to those who haven&#x27;t tried a shave cream before.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I expected. Helps with some shaving for arms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;I still prefer the more fluffy foams.&lt;br /&gt;I love love the smell of this shaving cream! wish i could use it as a lotion.... :)&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but honestly I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference compared to soap or regular shaving cream.  It did last a while, though.</li>
            <li> So pleased with this product. I have been shaving for 20 years so you think you&#x27;ve seen all of the magic creams on the market, and nothing has ever been better than plain soap for me. I get bad razor burn on the back of my legs, and when I first tried this cream, no bumps!! Shave is super smooth and feels smoother longer than normal. The only reason for the 4 stars is because it didn&#x27;t really help the razor burn in the nether regions...oh well, it didn&#x27;t claim to be God, so smooth and bump free legs are worth it!</li>
            <li> I only tired this because I read good things about it but I must be missing something here because I was NOT impressed in the least. I followed the directions to the T and this just made me frustrated, I used a little added a little water this did NOT lather at all, it&#x27;s clear so you can&#x27;t really SEE where it is that you shaved/need to shave or rinse it off, you could buy a cheap bottle of glycerin or a bar of glycerin soap and get the same exact results and a $4 bottle of glycerin would last you about 3-4 years shaving. Even baby oil will give you the same effects. Lady&#x27;s what have you been using prior to this if you like this so much a sickle? I could not wait to get back to my skintimate shaving gel which is also paraben free. My legs where dry and itchy after shaving, that NEVER happens. One star because it smells good, that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feel of Cremo Lady. Have been using the Original and just started using the lady.  It&#x27;s essentially the same, just a different scent.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin, this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make me legs itch like crazy. It is very concentrated, one tube will last about a year.</li>
            <li> I tried my husbands cremo cream, and loved it, decided to get this one for ladies for my legs instead of using his.  I like it too, but either works very, very good on my legs.</li>
