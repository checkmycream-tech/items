            <li>Goes on nice and smooth and gives added moisture. .</li>
            <li>Take the top off</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll have even more...</li>
            <li>Love the product...</li>
            <li>Love this tinted moisturizer use as my foundation</li>
            <li>the Boots \\&quot;high lights illuminating lotion\\&quot; is a great product as well to add a touch of glow to your cheekbones.</li>
            <li>I like the way I can apply it...smooth and easy...</li>
            <li>I love how smooth this goes on and the color is not too bold but covers well.</li>
            <li>It gave me huge breakouts on my cheeks and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light coverage, no perfume scent, and doesn&#x27;t clog skin.</li>
            <li>Moisturizer is not heavy,goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I first tried this in the summer  to even out my skin and decided I liked the product so much I continued to use it throughout the year.  </li>
            <li>I bought the \\&quot;medium\\&quot; shade last summer (at target) which was a good match for me as I had a bit of a tan.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting full coverage, but I did like that</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>nothing will look good on a rough, non-primed service.  </li>
            <li>I like this foundation as it has more of a natural look to it ...</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the look of heavy makeup and this product provides light coverage, good color and no breakouts.</li>
            <li>Medium is a bit dark for me wish I could find it in fair.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what I bought it for.  </li>
            <li>is my first time reviewing a product.  </li>
            <li>Now I know to do my research before buying something and not to buy it until I see all the information first.</li>
            <li>The tube&#x27;s top is contoured in such a way that the moisturizer smears all over the inside</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t do this, but felt like I should in case someone who is acne-prone is looking for the right tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product goes on   smooth and gives you a nice glow with enough coverage without feeling like you have a heavy foundation on.  </li>
            <li>Light with just enough coverage.  </li>
            <li>I tried this out because I use most of this company&#x27;s other products.  </li>
            <li>Also... because of the wide top, you have a lot of product left in the tube that you can&#x27;t squeeze out.</li>
            <li>Finally, I found Boots, and it is so pretty.  </li>
            <li>I have used this tinted moisturizer for a long time, and I like it so much I&#x27;ve been willing to forgive its major flaw -- the packaging.</li>
            <li>it looked natural.  </li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin, but I did not get any allergic reaction to it.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not heavy.</li>
            <li>I have dry-ish skin to begin with -- hence purchase of moisturizer, duh -- but have to say, I feel much more moist before this product.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a good tinted moisturizer and unfortunately this one was too sheer for me and the color did not match my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Nice subtle tint, no strong odor.</li>
            <li>I would certainly buy it again, hope it will get a little cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I use it followed with my loose powder for a natural look.</li>
            <li>Feels nice coming out of tube, but once you put on your face dries with a hard, dull, papery feeling.  </li>

            <li> The only note of caution is, as one other reviewer mentioned, that the tube tends to dispense a bit too much when you squeeze it, and you&#x27;ll get a nicer result with less product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy enough to smooth out blotches and uneven skin tone, but not heavy and drying like many base make ups.</li>
            <li> I used to used Serious Skin Care Classic tinted mositurizer in Champaigne color.  </li>
            <li> and this did not live up!</li>
            <li> Later through the day, I realized it had dried out my skin, and made it flaky,even though I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> I end up swabbing up the excess and putting it into an empty travel-sized jar that I keep on my dresser for this purpose.</li>
            <li> I wear it instead of my regular makeup base most of the time.</li>
            <li> However, it clogged my pores and created new breakouts so bad that it took months for me to get my normal skin back.  </li>
            <li> It is not matte like other products.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got one that was somehow stored improperly, but hard to believe that this is actually a Boots No. 7 product</li>
            <li> Color is not too dark.</li>
            <li> I have medium olive skin and use the medium tone throughout the year, while adding in a dab of the dark and mixing the two for summer.</li>
            <li> and I have to wipe it down every time I use it.</li>
            <li> this product doesn&#x27;t cover them up, but they are a bit less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Wear this everyday in place of makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I use the Sheer Tinted Moisturizer as a base makeup - the coverage is build-able, sheer, and not overly shiny.</li>
            <li> However, it causes my eyes to burn, which is not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Hard to find.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this has been discontinued or not, but it&#x27;s become impossible for me to find locally.  </li>
            <li> Worse, every once in a while the tube \\&quot;burps\\&quot; and out pours gobs of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> chose the wrong shade</li>
            <li> not cakey and fake looking, it seems to absorb into the skin as apposed to just sitting ontop.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed that I can no longer get it at Target.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> chose the wrong shade</li>
            <li> Wear this everyday in place of makeup. Time saver and SPF too.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and extremely pleased with how quickly I received this in the mail. Love it and will order again.  This product goes on   smooth and gives you a nice glow with enough coverage without feeling like you have a heavy foundation on.  I first tried this in the summer  to even out my skin and decided I liked the product so much I continued to use it throughout the year.  Good job Boots!</li>
            <li> Light coverage, no perfume scent, and doesn&#x27;t clog skin. I prefer this to the newer version and wish they would stop changing products that work!</li>
            <li> This is beautiful make-up.  I used to used Serious Skin Care Classic tinted mositurizer in Champaigne color.  It was perfect for me.  They quit making it even at the dismay and criticism they received when they replaced it with a \\&quot;new\\&quot; version.  Finally, I found Boots, and it is so pretty.  Just enough coverage, color, and it feels great!  Get your face in \\&quot;good\\&quot; shape....nothing will look good on a rough, non-primed service.  This, however, will help you get there!</li>
            <li> I bought the \\&quot;medium\\&quot; shade last summer (at target) which was a good match for me as I had a bit of a tan.  It&#x27;s now winter, so I just purchased the \\&quot;fair\\&quot; shade and like it as well - has a bit of warmth to it, but not orangey.  I do have several age spots on my cheeks ... this product doesn&#x27;t cover them up, but they are a bit less noticeable.  I like this foundation as it has more of a natural look to it ... not cakey and fake looking, it seems to absorb into the skin as apposed to just sitting ontop.  The only note of caution is, as one other reviewer mentioned, that the tube tends to dispense a bit too much when you squeeze it, and you&#x27;ll get a nicer result with less product.  One more note ... the Boots \\&quot;high lights illuminating lotion\\&quot; is a great product as well to add a touch of glow to your cheekbones.</li>
            <li> Returned ,didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what I bought it for.  It is worth every penny.  I will continure to use it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product hoping to reduce the appearance of post-acne marks and some redness.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting full coverage, but I did like that it looked natural.  Later through the day, I realized it had dried out my skin, and made it flaky,even though I have oily skin. I also have sensitive skin, but I did not get any allergic reaction to it.  However, it clogged my pores and created new breakouts so bad that it took months for me to get my normal skin back.  It gave me huge breakouts on my cheeks and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time reviewing a product.  I normally don&#x27;t do this, but felt like I should in case someone who is acne-prone is looking for the right tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you have acne-prone skin, do not purchase this product.  Make sure you get a tinted moisturizer that is non-comedogenic because non-comedogenic will not clog your pores.  I wish I would have known that before purchasing this product.  Now I know to do my research before buying something and not to buy it until I see all the information first. This product should have a list of ingredients on this page...you shouldn&#x27;t have to wait to buy it to see the ingredients on the package because you can&#x27;t get your money back on shipping.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth this goes on and the color is not too bold but covers well. I just wish I could find it in the store somewhere. Just remember to wash your hands well when done or your towels will be brown!</li>
            <li> I tried this out because I use most of this company&#x27;s other products.  Love it.  It&#x27;s light and gives great coverage.  I wear it instead of my regular makeup base most of the time.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good tinted moisturizer and unfortunately this one was too sheer for me and the color did not match my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Medium is the best color for me.  Hard to find.</li>
            <li> This is the only tinted moisturizer I will buy.  It goes on evenly, and you can wear under foundation, or by itself.</li>
            <li> This product goes on smoothly and feels nice on my skin.  However, it causes my eyes to burn, which is not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> It adds color and has sun protection I want.  But it&#x27;s not heavy. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Moisturizer is not heavy,goes on smooth. Color is not too dark.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at Target but they no longer carry it so I was happy to find it on Amazon. This moisturizer is the only one I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes and it matches my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Good product. Quick delivery. Would purchase again. It&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Good coverage, evens out skin-tone and lasts all day. I have used this for a couple of years now. It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> my favorite moisturizer</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this has been discontinued or not, but it&#x27;s become impossible for me to find locally.  Glad to have a source online.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  It goes on smoothly and it covers a good deal.  I would certainly buy it again, hope it will get a little cheaper.  I think the medium color is good for most and SPF 15 is good for the face in the sun too.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.  Goes on nice and smooth and gives added moisture. . with some coverage.  I use it followed with my loose powder for a natural look.</li>
            <li> I have used this tinted moisturizer for a long time, and I like it so much I&#x27;ve been willing to forgive its major flaw -- the packaging. The tube&#x27;s top is contoured in such a way that the moisturizer smears all over the inside and I have to wipe it down every time I use it. Worse, every once in a while the tube \\&quot;burps\\&quot; and out pours gobs of moisturizer. I smack the tube to try to burst the bubble, but it never works. I end up swabbing up the excess and putting it into an empty travel-sized jar that I keep on my dresser for this purpose. Also... because of the wide top, you have a lot of product left in the tube that you can&#x27;t squeeze out. Take the top off and you&#x27;ll get enough moisturizer for another couple of weeks. Cut the tube open after that and you&#x27;ll have even more... a lot sticks to the inside of the tube. What a system! Love the product... it&#x27;s light, looks good on the skin, doesn&#x27;t clog and is affordably priced. But it&#x27;s time to move on. Anyone have any suggestions?</li>
            <li> Feels nice coming out of tube, but once you put on your face dries with a hard, dull, papery feeling.  I have dry-ish skin to begin with -- hence purchase of moisturizer, duh -- but have to say, I feel much more moist before this product.  Maybe I got one that was somehow stored improperly, but hard to believe that this is actually a Boots No. 7 product, know the brand well and this did not live up!</li>
            <li> I like the way I can apply it...smooth and easy...and I like the way it looks.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Love this tinted moisturizer use as my foundation</li>
            <li> very impressed...this is the best tinted moisturizer I tried so far</li>
            <li> Nice subtle tint, no strong odor.</li>
            <li> I have tried every tinted moisturizer out there and non compare to this for me.  I have oily skin and can&#x27;t wear foundation. I don&#x27;t like the look of heavy makeup and this product provides light coverage, good color and no breakouts. Add a dusting of mineral blush and makeup is done. Medium is a bit dark for me wish I could find it in fair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before.  I am disappointed that I can no longer get it at Target.  It&#x27;s a great product.  Light with just enough coverage.  I like the finish. It is not matte like other products.</li>
            <li> I use the Sheer Tinted Moisturizer as a base makeup - the coverage is build-able, sheer, and not overly shiny. It&#x27;s heavy enough to smooth out blotches and uneven skin tone, but not heavy and drying like many base make ups. I have medium olive skin and use the medium tone throughout the year, while adding in a dab of the dark and mixing the two for summer.</li>
