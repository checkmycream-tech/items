            <li>This stuff smells great too!  </li>
            <li>The best hair wax out there!</li>
            <li>THIS ONE - ITS BEST</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still the best hair wax out there.</li>
            <li>You just need to find the perfect time when to apply this after taking a shower to have a perfect mat looking hair.</li>
            <li>great product!</li>
            <li>people say it is the best hair wax</li>
            <li>Really good stuff!</li>
            <li>My husband and I both use this with great results.</li>
            <li>For the look he achieves, it&#x27;s a great value for the price.</li>
            <li>My friends told me great things about this wax.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, I gave the remaining portions of this to my friend and he said it works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that will allow you to style your hair in any way imaginable.</li>
            <li>Great item.  </li>
            <li>lol.  </li>
            <li>It works as a wax, it&#x27;s just for sure not the best wax I have used.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as sticky as some others I have tried, which is good.  </li>
            <li>This is a great wax product, it does work better with my hair type(fine)</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>My hair is almost straight and works perfect with it.</li>
            <li>I just spread it evenly throughout all my hair and kind of crimp and twirl.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell.</li>
            <li>My hair is between medium/long and won&#x27;t play nice with this.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the smell</li>
            <li>It smells nice too.</li>
            <li>By far the best hair wax.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best wax I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Purchased for many people who have converted to this amazing product.</li>
            <li>After doing a bit more work on my hair, I noticed that the hold is way better with this product.</li>
            <li>However, I guess it works well for the appropriate hair, which mine wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>but if you want to make you hair look a specific way and somewhat \\&quot;spiked up\\&quot;, then this is probably not the best solution for you.  </li>
            <li>Easily my favorite wax ever.  </li>
            <li>I love this wax.</li>
            <li>IF YOU PUT THIS ONE IN YOUR ENTIRE HAND BEFORE USING IT IN YOUR HAIR, FOR BEST RESULTS.</li>
            <li>In my quest of finding that perfect hair product I have finally succeeded.  </li>
            <li>It works - allows my hair to be stylishly disheveled...  </li>
            <li>Others seem to love it, but this is just my experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; look, and even smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li>This product works pretty good</li>
            <li>This is pretty good stuff for shaping.  </li>
            <li>First off, I have to say that I&#x27;ve been looking for a cheap replacement for the discontinued Pantene Sculpting Wax (which was honestly an amazing paste for an amazing price).  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been looking for a good hair wax product for the longest time and tried different brands this one is the best so far..</li>
            <li>Perhaps this product would work better on fine, light colored hair.</li>
            <li>Says it&#x27;s easy to wash out and stays all day.  </li>
            <li>the Gatsy Hair Wax Mat Type can easily mold you hair and keep it holding all day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, item was delivered very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not waxy, greasy or to heavyâ€”it&#x27;s easy to apply, holds all day</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Gatsby Matte Type Hair Wax for several years now, and it&#x27;s great to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>otherwise, i&#x27;d say its fantastic and doesn&#x27;t leave a shine, (it does say &#x27;mat type&#x27; &amp;</li>
            <li>This stuff does exactly as it reports!!</li>
            <li>REALLY NICE WAX, HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>Works very very well for those hard to hold hair types, lasts all day, very easy to clean, and smells great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it best used after a good thorough towel dry out of the shower when my hair is just slightly moist.  </li>
            <li>This works better than any styling wax I&#x27;ve ever used and is very affordable.  </li>
            <li>One of my favourites of the mainstays in my hair products, a good dry hold-for me</li>
            <li>Good dry stiffer wax than just about all of them out there.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than the normal hairgel in that it doesn&#x27;t stiffen your hair so that you look more natural.  </li>
            <li>Is not so strong but it definitely gives a better look on your hair.</li>
            <li>When i saw the reviews of this wax i instantly bought it and the result is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>but I think I&#x27;ll be buying some more Gatsby Wild Shake.</li>
            <li>right after a shower.  </li>
            <li>Left a white residue on the hair and didn&#x27;t hold too great.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s kind of sweet, kind of weird).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the quality of the product is great, but the actual hold for Asian hair is not solid.  </li>
            <li>i have very straight hair though</li>
            <li>Best thing about it is that a little goes a long way in controlling your hair.  </li>
            <li>I need to buy more next time</li>
            <li>Not as thick as I&#x27;d like but still works great.</li>
            <li>mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>personally recommend Tigi Matte Wax Separation which is more matte and easier to wash off.</li>
            <li>, I think it actually holds better than the ones I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it does in fact do a good job of shine control, however the hold is not nearly as strong as i would like.  </li>
            <li>He loves it and always wants more of exactly the same one.  </li>
            <li>: I didn&#x27;t like it first because I thought it wasn&#x27;t strong enough but after extended use</li>
            <li>It does not allow you to really mold your hair exactly how you want it, but rather you just have to go with whatever it does with regards to holding up your hair.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s much harder to wash off than other waxes (which I&#x27;ve been able to rinse off with just warm water in the shower alone).</li>
            <li>and after a certain length, this product isn&#x27;t strong enough to hold it up how i like.</li>
            <li>you would probably be better off either spending more money on a stronger product, or less money on a cheaper one, rather than being stuck in the middle with this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this stuff for my son-in-law because he wears his hair sticking straight up</li>
            <li>Also, it really doesn&#x27;t make my hair look shiny or greasy either.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very efficient.  </li>
            <li>I spent hours researching, and I&#x27;m glad this has paid off for me.  </li>
            <li>It lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>, the product did not hold very well.</li>
            <li>If you have shorter hair and like a kind of spiky messy look, then this is the wax for you.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of an actual WAX as opposed to this stuff which was a bit too soft for me.</li>
            <li>It is soft and easy to apply while maintaining a strong hold and a little shine.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of wax and makes it look natural.</li>
            <li>I bought this product on Amazon purely because of the high reviews.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold strong and because my hair is very straight and thick, it doesnt last more than 1 or 2 hours.</li>
            <li>It does not add any shine like grease or pomade making the look more natural and dry.  </li>
            <li>So once again, this is more of an issue I believe with Asian hair as Asian hair has a unique consistency and different properties.</li>
            <li>but I can see it working better when I cut down my hair a bit.</li>
            <li>I have latin black hair and this wax is okay.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve been my main hair product for about a year.</li>
            <li>Flexible/strong/and smells decent.</li>
            <li>I have super thick fine hair that doesn&#x27;t like to cooperate normally</li>
            <li>My husband does a slicked back spiked thing and this allows enough feathering to make it look more natural.</li>
            <li>Haircuts\\&quot;, I use Gatsby for normal hairstyles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing that for people that want to just make their hair look messy and somewhat poofed, then it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>I decided to try this stuff out because I ran out of my normal \\&quot;clay\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>No hard hair, no flaking gel, no greasy look.</li>
            <li>Then I may add a little more as I smooth down some pieces.</li>
            <li>It keeps your hair in place without making it look greasy... very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>the hair looks very natural for the hold</li>
            <li>But so far is a 5 stars wax.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Gatsby Spikey Edge and Gatsby Wild Shake.</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair looking natural.</li>
            <li>compares to my old Faceshop wax (purple square puck) but they discontinued it and reformulated for the worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only con is that it does flake a bit, looking like dandruff - but I haven&#x27;t used a wax that doesn&#x27;t do that after a while anyway, so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>and this hold my hair up like no other.</li>
            <li>I have Asian black hair and believed that this Japanese solution would work well on my hair, but it did not hold to be true (literally).  </li>
            <li>This stuff provides the right amount of hold without making my hair look stiff.  </li>
            <li>I usually put a small amount in after towel drying my hair, then I hit it with the blow dryer pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I think working with Asian hair is completely different and thus this review might be totally different than all the other positive remarks on this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- sticks out straight but starts bending once it gets to ~half an inch long&lt;</li>
            <li>hair looks good and it does not smell bad.</li>

            <li> I decided to try this stuff out because I ran out of my normal \\&quot;clay\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> No hard hair, no flaking gel, no greasy look.</li>
            <li> Then I may add a little more as I smooth down some pieces.</li>
            <li> It keeps your hair in place without making it look greasy... very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> the hair looks very natural for the hold</li>
            <li> But so far is a 5 stars wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Gatsby Spikey Edge and Gatsby Wild Shake.</li>
            <li> It leaves the hair looking natural.</li>

            <li> The only con is that it does flake a bit, looking like dandruff - but I haven&#x27;t used a wax that doesn&#x27;t do that after a while anyway, so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> and this hold my hair up like no other.</li>
            <li> I have Asian black hair and believed that this Japanese solution would work well on my hair, but it did not hold to be true (literally).  </li>
            <li> This stuff provides the right amount of hold without making my hair look stiff.  </li>
            <li> I usually put a small amount in after towel drying my hair, then I hit it with the blow dryer pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I think working with Asian hair is completely different and thus this review might be totally different than all the other positive remarks on this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- sticks out straight but starts bending once it gets to ~half an inch long&lt;</li>
            <li> hair looks good and it does not smell bad.</li>
            <li> If you want to achieve a natural, out-of-bed wavy look with thick, straight hair, this product is what you&#x27;re looking for.  </li>
            <li> I could style my very thick hair the way I wanted, giving some parts more hold and other parts</li>
            <li> If your hair is particularly oily, leave the cap open for a few nights before using.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s particularly good if you have very straight, boring hair.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a wax that didn&#x27;t dry shiny, but still had enough strength to support my hay-like Asian hair - this wax is it!</li>
            <li> Says &amp;#34;matte dry look&amp;#34; but left my hair looking a bit greasy</li>
            <li> I have thick straight Asian hair</li>
            <li> A+ will continue buying as long as I have hair.</li>
            <li> Just like the title says, this product is not completely mat.</li>
            <li> like never completely dries.  </li>
            <li> The consistency of the wax itself is bit soft and &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34;, so it can leave the container messy after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : I used different type of waxes before and this definitely feels less sticky and the hair looks and feels dry.</li>
            <li> I use it for those twisty pieces-light, non-irritating and lasts all day, not too sticky so you have to wash it out the second day and plays well with other Gatsby products</li>
            <li> It is possible that my hair was a little too damp when I put it in last time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Neither of have very long hair nor do we heat style.</li>
            <li> but if it&#x27;s too dry it wont hold anything.</li>
            <li> Still, I&#x27;ve yet to find a single product out there that comes close to the sexiness of this.</li>
            <li> My only negative, which is why I gave it a 4 instead of 5, is that the stuff can build up if you put too much on and get a little too waxy.  </li>
            <li> After 15 minutes, my long spikes were already sagging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the pink gatsby moving rubber series, I would rate this product a 5/10 for hold (8/10 for pink) and a 4/10 for shine (7/10 for pink).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing</li>
            <li> This only remained for a little while and soon went away, maybe just from sensory deprivation.   </li>
            <li> The only issue is that i dont know if it could cause a hair fall since i have used it for a few months.</li>
            <li> a simple messy look.</li>
            <li> and if you wet it and comb it resets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several hair products over the years but nothing works as well for thick Asian hair like this product.  </li>
            <li> Those with wavy or curly hair may find this stuff far too thick.  </li>
            <li> It actually leaves your hair very slightly greasy.</li>
            <li> In the past years i have tried several kinds and types of hair waxes.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve always had problems using other hair products.</li>
            <li> The one shortcoming is that it is VERY sticky and can be difficult to get out of your hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing is more annoying than flaking hair gel since people always assume its dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with inch/inch and a half hair that was too wavy when any longer.</li>
            <li> In my experience, it was NOT very matte at all, as shiny as some of the pomades I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the container, I did not notice the typical green apple scent.</li>
            <li> It probably would&#x27;ve helped for me to get my hair thinned or grew my hair a little longer.  </li>
            <li> Dont expect like your are going to look like Goku, but i must say this helps a little on molding.</li>
            <li> the amount is so little</li>
            <li> product also smells a little like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Gatsby Wax Mat Type is very thick compared to the other Gatsby products, which should be expected.</li>
            <li> and this allows me to style my hair without looking greasy or stiff.</li>
            <li> You will have a very slight beach smell coming off of you for a while.</li>
            <li> I usually end up washing my hair twice when I&#x27;m using this stuff.</li>
            <li> not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Not sure I would get it again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have crazy spikey hair, so I can&#x27;t speak to how well it holds some of the asian styles, but it works for my needs and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li> After trying enough gels,hair sprays,pastes to make me go crazy</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> but my hair is a bit too thick for this type.</li>
            <li> if you apply it dry- doesn&#x27;t look dirty or flake.</li>
            <li> but it does feel a little weird-</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not gooey or ugly feeling like some.  </li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My husband and I both use this with great results. I have super thick fine hair that doesn&#x27;t like to cooperate normally and this allows me to style my hair without looking greasy or stiff. My husband does a slicked back spiked thing and this allows enough feathering to make it look more natural. Neither of have very long hair nor do we heat style.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff for my son-in-law because he wears his hair sticking straight up and it works like a charm!  He loves it and always wants more of exactly the same one.  Says it&#x27;s easy to wash out and stays all day.  It&#x27;s not gooey or ugly feeling like some.  For the look he achieves, it&#x27;s a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I used to use the got2b glued stuff, but it was just too sticky!  This stuff provides the right amount of hold without making my hair look stiff.  Also, it really doesn&#x27;t make my hair look shiny or greasy either.  Really good stuff!</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty cool. It works well, and does not create a Travolta-esque   \\&quot;Grease\\&quot; look, and even smells pretty good.  My only negative, which is why I gave it a 4 instead of 5, is that the stuff can build up if you put too much on and get a little too waxy.  But I concede this could be my fault as maybe I am not applying it correctly.  Or that the Amazon readership may be thinking \\&quot;DUH\\&quot; when reading this because waxes, by definition, are supposed to be, uh, \\&quot;waxy\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> This is a great wax product, it does work better with my hair type(fine) right after a shower.  This stuff smells great too!  If you have shorter hair and like a kind of spiky messy look, then this is the wax for you.</li>
            <li> In the past years i have tried several kinds and types of hair waxes. I think i almost used 10 or 12 different ones. When i saw the reviews of this wax i instantly bought it and the result is amazing. By far the best hair wax. My hair is almost straight and works perfect with it. The only issue is that i dont know if it could cause a hair fall since i have used it for a few months. But so far is a 5 stars wax. Also recommend the Gatsby Moving Rubber Spiky Edge.</li>
            <li> Works well for my (Asian) hair, which is:&lt;br /&gt;- medium-thick&lt;br /&gt;- sticks out straight but starts bending once it gets to ~half an inch long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a tiny amount each time to texturize hair that&#x27;s started bending.  I&#x27;ve probably used &amp;#60; 1/10 of it after 3 months of weekend use, so it&#x27;s very efficient.  No flakiness, no dryness, etc.  I spent hours researching, and I&#x27;m glad this has paid off for me.  It&#x27;s the only hair product I need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Gatsby Spikey Edge and Gatsby Wild Shake. They&#x27;ve been my main hair product for about a year. I don&#x27;t have \\&quot;Asian Hair\\&quot; but it&#x27;s similar in consistency. I also don&#x27;t go for \\&quot;Asian Haircuts\\&quot;, I use Gatsby for normal hairstyles.  Gatsby Wax Mat Type is very thick compared to the other Gatsby products, which should be expected. Upon opening the container, I did not notice the typical green apple scent. Instead this product had a scent extremely similar to moist towelettes. This only remained for a little while and soon went away, maybe just from sensory deprivation.   After doing a bit more work on my hair, I noticed that the hold is way better with this product. I could style my very thick hair the way I wanted, giving some parts more hold and other parts a simple messy look. This product works pretty good but I think I&#x27;ll be buying some more Gatsby Wild Shake.</li>
            <li> One of my favourites of the mainstays in my hair products, a good dry hold-for me I use it for those twisty pieces-light, non-irritating and lasts all day, not too sticky so you have to wash it out the second day and plays well with other Gatsby products</li>
            <li> The best hair wax out there! I&#x27;ve used this for years now. It leaves the hair looking natural. It lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> My friends told me great things about this wax. However, I guess it works well for the appropriate hair, which mine wasn&#x27;t.  My hair is very thick and I like to keep it short.  It probably would&#x27;ve helped for me to get my hair thinned or grew my hair a little longer.  Anyhow, I gave the remaining portions of this to my friend and he said it works great.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a wax that could provide some hold and texture, but not be too sticky. This is the stuff. I usually put a small amount in after towel drying my hair, then I hit it with the blow dryer pretty quickly. I get some volume and texture this way. Then I may add a little more as I smooth down some pieces. I don&#x27;t have crazy spikey hair, so I can&#x27;t speak to how well it holds some of the asian styles, but it works for my needs and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li> First off, I have to say that I&#x27;ve been looking for a cheap replacement for the discontinued Pantene Sculpting Wax (which was honestly an amazing paste for an amazing price).  I have Asian black hair and believed that this Japanese solution would work well on my hair, but it did not hold to be true (literally).  I&#x27;m sure the quality of the product is great, but the actual hold for Asian hair is not solid.  It does not allow you to really mold your hair exactly how you want it, but rather you just have to go with whatever it does with regards to holding up your hair.  I&#x27;m guessing that for people that want to just make their hair look messy and somewhat poofed, then it&#x27;s okay, but if you want to make you hair look a specific way and somewhat \\&quot;spiked up\\&quot;, then this is probably not the best solution for you.  I think working with Asian hair is completely different and thus this review might be totally different than all the other positive remarks on this product.  So once again, this is more of an issue I believe with Asian hair as Asian hair has a unique consistency and different properties.</li>
            <li> Gatsby was recommended to me by a hair stylist. This is by far the best wax I&#x27;ve ever used. It is soft and easy to apply while maintaining a strong hold and a little shine.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good stuff for shaping.  It isn&#x27;t as sticky as some others I have tried, which is good.  It is in the middle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several hair products over the years but nothing works as well for thick Asian hair like this product.  If you want to achieve a natural, out-of-bed wavy look with thick, straight hair, this product is what you&#x27;re looking for.  I&#x27;ve found it best used after a good thorough towel dry out of the shower when my hair is just slightly moist.  I just spread it evenly throughout all my hair and kind of crimp and twirl.  It does not add any shine like grease or pomade making the look more natural and dry.  It de-frizzes but at the same time doesn&#x27;t take away any volume.</li>
            <li> Easily my favorite wax ever.  I am a big fan of all Gatsby Hair products but the Gatsy Hair Wax Mat Type can easily mold you hair and keep it holding all day.</li>
            <li> I love this wax. I have really thick hair and this hold my hair up like no other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gatsby Matte Type Hair Wax for several years now, and it&#x27;s great to find it on Amazon. This is a great product that will allow you to style your hair in any way imaginable. It&#x27;s particularly good if you have very straight, boring hair. Those with wavy or curly hair may find this stuff far too thick.  The one shortcoming is that it is VERY sticky and can be difficult to get out of your hair. I usually end up washing my hair twice when I&#x27;m using this stuff. Still, I&#x27;ve yet to find a single product out there that comes close to the sexiness of this.</li>
            <li> Works very very well for those hard to hold hair types, lasts all day, very easy to clean, and smells great!</li>
            <li> REALLY NICE WAX, HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE - ITS BEST IF YOU PUT THIS ONE IN YOUR ENTIRE HAND BEFORE USING IT IN YOUR HAIR, FOR BEST RESULTS.</li>
            <li> In my quest of finding that perfect hair product I have finally succeeded.  This is so much better than the normal hairgel in that it doesn&#x27;t stiffen your hair so that you look more natural.  It also doesn&#x27;t flake like regular hair gel.  Nothing is more annoying than flaking hair gel since people always assume its dandruff.  Best thing about it is that a little goes a long way in controlling your hair.  You can always just run your fingers through your hair and restyle it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Left a white residue on the hair and didn&#x27;t hold too great. By the end of the day there were white flakes all over the hair and was no longer styled. Perhaps this product would work better on fine, light colored hair.</li>
            <li> Great item.  I need to buy more next time I have a period off to visit Thailand, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, item was delivered very quickly.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Good dry stiffer wax than just about all of them out there. Not as thick as I&#x27;d like but still works great.</li>
            <li> I have latin black hair and this wax is okay. Is not so strong but it definitely gives a better look on your hair. Dont expect like your are going to look like Goku, but i must say this helps a little on molding.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff. I found this stuff at Watson&#x27;s when I lived China and have since moved back to the states.  This works better than any styling wax I&#x27;ve ever used and is very affordable.  I now order them like 5 at a time so that i have one for travel, one for home, one for the lake cabin and one for the gym bag... It keeps your hair in place without making it look greasy... very natural looking.  Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold strong and because my hair is very straight and thick, it doesnt last more than 1 or 2 hours.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of wax and makes it look natural.</li>
            <li> Updated: Why has this increased in cost everywhere? Itâ€™s selling out and the price doubled and quadrupled in some places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still the best hair wax out there. Nice smell. It&#x27;s not waxy, greasy or to heavyâ€”it&#x27;s easy to apply, holds all day and if you wet it and comb it resets. Doesn&#x27;t look like you have anything in your hair no shine or greasy look if you apply it dry- doesn&#x27;t look dirty or flake. Purchased for many people who have converted to this amazing product. It&#x27;s the only thing I use. Women can still run thir hands through your hair without residue or hands getting stuck.</li>
            <li> Still using it since 2010, already bought multiple times and had no problems with it. hair looks good and it does not smell bad. You just need to find the perfect time when to apply this after taking a shower to have a perfect mat looking hair. For me my hair needs to be a bit feeling damped... If my hair is too damped it will have a shine look but if it&#x27;s too dry it wont hold anything. I guess choosing a wax depends on your hair type. I am not a hair expert so you may want to ask somebody else.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and swear by it. If your hair is particularly oily, leave the cap open for a few nights before using. That will alleviate the issue.</li>
            <li> I have thick straight Asian hair so I&#x27;ve always had problems using other hair products. This is hands down the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> No doubt to using Gatsby wax~ luv it!</li>
            <li> Finally. After trying enough gels,hair sprays,pastes to make me go crazy I ordered this product. I&#x27;m a guy with inch/inch and a half hair that was too wavy when any longer. This product controls it however I want. No hard hair, no flaking gel, no greasy look. I&#x27;m amazed. Flexible/strong/and smells decent. A+ will continue buying as long as I have hair. Thank you.</li>
            <li> It was s***. It&#x27;s been used once and then thrown away. Terrible product.</li>
            <li> great product! i have very straight hair though and after a certain length, this product isn&#x27;t strong enough to hold it up how i like. otherwise, i&#x27;d say its fantastic and doesn&#x27;t leave a shine, (it does say &#x27;mat type&#x27; &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;besides the lack of desired strength for longer hair, i always use this product when i have it a bit shorter.</li>
            <li> the amount is so little and I paid over $10 for this wax. people say it is the best hair wax but i do not think so. mediocre at best. not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Says &amp;#34;matte dry look&amp;#34; but left my hair looking a bit greasy</li>
            <li> it does in fact do a good job of shine control, however the hold is not nearly as strong as i would like.  you would probably be better off either spending more money on a stronger product, or less money on a cheaper one, rather than being stuck in the middle with this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff does exactly as it reports!! Love it!</li>
            <li> Works well but my hair is a bit too thick for this type.</li>
            <li> Just like the title says, this product is not completely mat. It actually leaves your hair very slightly greasy. I will keep experimenting and update. It is possible that my hair was a little too damp when I put it in last time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the product did not hold very well. After 15 minutes, my long spikes were already sagging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the pink gatsby moving rubber series, I would rate this product a 5/10 for hold (8/10 for pink) and a 4/10 for shine (7/10 for pink).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing compares to my old Faceshop wax (purple square puck) but they discontinued it and reformulated for the worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also smells a little like sunscreen. You will have a very slight beach smell coming off of you for a while.</li>
            <li> Now this product is definitely matte producing lol.  My hair is between medium/long and won&#x27;t play nice with this.  It works but I can see it working better when I cut down my hair a bit.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this stuff out because I ran out of my normal \\&quot;clay\\&quot;.  It works - allows my hair to be stylishly disheveled...  but it does feel a little weird- like never completely dries.  Not sure I would get it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on Amazon purely because of the high reviews. In my experience, it was NOT very matte at all, as shiny as some of the pomades I have used in the past. Also, it&#x27;s much harder to wash off than other waxes (which I&#x27;ve been able to rinse off with just warm water in the shower alone). It also has the wost gunky-motor-oily after hours of having been on. Others seem to love it, but this is just my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally recommend Tigi Matte Wax Separation which is more matte and easier to wash off.</li>
            <li> This is the second time buying it and it works well.</li>
            <li> It works as a wax, it&#x27;s just for sure not the best wax I have used. I really liked the smell (it&#x27;s kind of sweet, kind of weird). I just use the Crew Fiber now though - it&#x27;s more of an actual WAX as opposed to this stuff which was a bit too soft for me.</li>
            <li> Look: There is no stickiness with this. the hair looks very natural for the hold it offers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel: I used different type of waxes before and this definitely feels less sticky and the hair looks and feels dry. The consistency of the wax itself is bit soft and &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34;, so it can leave the container messy after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold: I didn&#x27;t like it first because I thought it wasn&#x27;t strong enough but after extended use, I think it actually holds better than the ones I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I like it and I will probably continue to use this going forward.</li>
            <li> not the best ant not the worst. what can you ask for?</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been looking for a good hair wax product for the longest time and tried different brands this one is the best so far..</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a wax that didn&#x27;t dry shiny, but still had enough strength to support my hay-like Asian hair - this wax is it! It smells nice too. The only con is that it does flake a bit, looking like dandruff - but I haven&#x27;t used a wax that doesn&#x27;t do that after a while anyway, so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
