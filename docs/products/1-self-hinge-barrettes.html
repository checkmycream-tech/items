            <li>These were the exact item I had used on her mother&#x27;s hair, so was happy to have found them.</li>

            <li>I love these clips.  </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>These are the best barrettes I have found that actually stay in my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>They stay in my daughters hair which is a problem I have with most Barrettes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay.  </li>
            <li>work better.</li>
            <li>They are that cute.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad they still make them.</li>
            <li>Just like the ones from the 80s! :)</li>
            <li>They are cute.</li>
            <li>I had these as a toddler and they bring back great memories!</li>
            <li>I love that they&#x27;re plastic</li>
            <li>love these.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Right now we&#x27;re just using them to hold up her bangs (on top of her head, like &amp;</li>
            <li>Like others, I would have been happier with some brighter colors more in line with the clothing now being worn.  </li>
            <li>I used to buy them at our local drug store and since they stopped carrying them, I get them online because they are great!</li>
            <li>She loves the animals and colors and I love the nostalgia.</li>
            <li>I love these barrettes and so does my daughter.</li>
            <li>These are really cute, retro barrettes.  </li>
            <li>They are made way better than the products today.</li>
            <li>so glad I found them here.</li>
            <li>I took one star away because it would&#x27;ve been nice to have more bold colors instead of mostly pastel ones.</li>
            <li>Super cute!</li>
            <li>and they are unique!</li>
            <li>Some of the designs have more of a cheap, plastic look but that is part of the charm, I guess.</li>
            <li>Takes me back to the good ole&#x27; 80&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>My daughter still has the baby fine hair</li>
            <li>but it is fine</li>
            <li>They stay put in her fine hair.</li>
            <li>I got these hoping they&#x27;d hold my toddler&#x27;s very fine hair, but they fall right out.</li>
            <li>These do not have metal that can destroy a toddler&#x27;s fine hair, but they hold in place great!  </li>
            <li>Now that I have a daughter, I thought she&#x27;d enjoy wearing them.</li>
            <li>Overall these are great retro looking barrettes.</li>
            <li>They are cute and colorful.  </li>
            <li>great price for a standard product .</li>
            <li>but they were so cheap</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t find anything to secure it so it wouldn&#x27;t get into her eyes.  </li>
            <li>I had used them for my girls when they were young and loved them then.  </li>
            <li>Classic barrettes, love these!</li>
            <li>I remember wearing these as a kid and was excited to find them for my daughter.</li>
            <li>She has super fine hair and they stay in all day.</li>
            <li>They stay clipped really well and are adorable.  </li>
            <li>Imagine I might need a bit more grip for a real styling hold.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would stay in our granddaughter&#x27;s fine hair - and not slip out with the first tug.  </li>
            <li>Came quickly and packaged well.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has straight silky hair and most of the fabric bow clips that are sold in the stores now just slip right out.  </li>
            <li>Love these old school barrettes!</li>
            <li>I love these old fashioned barrettes!</li>
            <li>pretty colors!</li>
            <li>These really do stay in my two year old&#x27;s fine hair, and they are adorable.</li>
            <li>so I think they&#x27;re definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>My daughter liked that there were different colors and designs.</li>
            <li>Unlike the barrettes that are sold at the hair store in only one style and are cheap and cheaply made.</li>
            <li>They are a bit pricier here on Amazon than I would probably pay for just any old clips, but I love these so much</li>
            <li>They are really cute colors and designs, I just wish they held more firm.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the only barrettes that stay in my 2 yr olds fine hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that they stay put and are safe---no sharp corners, edges and relatively cheap.</li>
            <li>Exactly as shown in photo.  </li>
            <li>I love the designs because I used to wear the same ones when I was a girl!</li>
            <li>these are ok, but I need something bigger for my toddlers hair.  </li>
            <li>They stay in my preschooler&#x27;s thick-but-straight hair, but they make it stick out at funny angles.</li>
            <li>#34;Pebbles Flinstone&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>She has quite long hair that hasn&#x27;t really gotten super thick yet, but I&#x27;ve been impressed at how much of her hair these barrettes can hold.</li>
            <li>My only issue with them is they easily fall out of my toddler&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>The only clip that will stay in my 3 y.o. daughter&#x27;s fine hair.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has extremely fine hair, so regular hair clips (including the metal snap clips) do not stay in her hair.  </li>
            <li>to manufacturer: I but you would have more sales if you offered similar plastic barrettes with a little more &amp;#34;Sparkle&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I really like these barrettes.</li>
            <li>These barrettes are great for thin hair.  </li>
            <li>My grand-daughter loves them as much as I do.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>They hold hair very snug.</li>
            <li>A lot of the baby hair accessories are kind of similar styles--ruffley bows, or boutique bows, flowers, etc, but this is just totally different--plastic?</li>
            <li>These hold the hair better than any other barrettes I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for continuing to make a classic quality product.</li>
            <li>They feel flimsier so they don&#x27;t stay in my daughters fine hair for long.</li>
            <li>Best barrettes available for little girls with thin hair!</li>
            <li>Pure nostalgia for me, but I&#x27;m really enjoying using these barrettes in our little girls&#x27;</li>
            <li>I would prefer more than 2 of each color, along with some black and deeper colors too.</li>
            <li>I only wish they had a couple more white clips.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a good product for my active 2 year old.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these barrettes.</li>
            <li>No school like the old school!!</li>
            <li>They look lovely, but invariably fall apart after a few months of use.</li>
            <li>They hold thick hair, they look cute and they are cheap enough that you don&#x27;t care if you lose them!</li>
            <li>Good grip and work well on toddlers&#x27; thin hair</li>
            <li>They are the same, but her hair is still a bit too fine to keep them in properly.</li>
            <li>Both of my girls prefer these to any of the pretty, sparkly ones from Claire&#x27;s and similar stores.</li>
            <li>Stays in 5 year old&#x27;s hair all day!</li>
            <li>I thought the price was a bit higher than expected but you certainly get quite an assortment.  </li>
            <li>I wish these clips would hold a little more hair but they&#x27;re still sturdy enough that they won&#x27;t &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; open if I put the right amount of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Not as sturdy as the old school ones.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my 4 year old.  </li>
            <li>My daughter is 23 months and has curly wild hair.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my 2 year old grand-daughter.  </li>
            <li>I bought them for my 2 year old.</li>
            <li>22 month old daughter pulls them out.</li>
            <li>They hold the hair in place and so far, seem immune to the 1 1/2 yr old&#x27;s attempts to pull out.</li>
            <li>I´ve bought the first package 7 years ago and they are the only barrettes that actually stay in place.</li>
            <li>My one year old granddaughter can&#x27;t keep other clips in her hair and these work better because they have little teeth that grip the hair.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>They are so hard to fine.</li>
            <li>My 3-year old can&#x27;t open them and attempts to get them out of her hair by ripping them out--along with some of her hair.</li>
            <li>so Amazon is the only way to get them so far....</li>
            <li>I think they were worth the few extra dollars.</li>
            <li>I used to wear these exact type of barrettes as a child, and have searched unsuccessfully in the stores for ones similar for my little girls.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also fun, because they&#x27;re something different than the flowers and bows that I usually put in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has fine, thin hair and she pulls these out with ease.</li>

            <li> I really like these barrettes.</li>
            <li> These barrettes are great for thin hair.  </li>
            <li> My grand-daughter loves them as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> They hold hair very snug.</li>
            <li> A lot of the baby hair accessories are kind of similar styles--ruffley bows, or boutique bows, flowers, etc, but this is just totally different--plastic?</li>
            <li> These hold the hair better than any other barrettes I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for continuing to make a classic quality product.</li>
            <li> They feel flimsier so they don&#x27;t stay in my daughters fine hair for long.</li>
            <li> Best barrettes available for little girls with thin hair!</li>
            <li> Pure nostalgia for me, but I&#x27;m really enjoying using these barrettes in our little girls&#x27;</li>
            <li> I would prefer more than 2 of each color, along with some black and deeper colors too.</li>
            <li> I only wish they had a couple more white clips.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a good product for my active 2 year old.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these barrettes.</li>
            <li> No school like the old school!!</li>
            <li> They look lovely, but invariably fall apart after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> They hold thick hair, they look cute and they are cheap enough that you don&#x27;t care if you lose them!</li>
            <li> Good grip and work well on toddlers&#x27; thin hair</li>
            <li> They are the same, but her hair is still a bit too fine to keep them in properly.</li>
            <li> Both of my girls prefer these to any of the pretty, sparkly ones from Claire&#x27;s and similar stores.</li>
            <li> Stays in 5 year old&#x27;s hair all day!</li>
            <li> I thought the price was a bit higher than expected but you certainly get quite an assortment.  </li>
            <li> I wish these clips would hold a little more hair but they&#x27;re still sturdy enough that they won&#x27;t &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; open if I put the right amount of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Not as sturdy as the old school ones.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 4 year old.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is 23 months and has curly wild hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 2 year old grand-daughter.  </li>
            <li> I bought them for my 2 year old.</li>
            <li> 22 month old daughter pulls them out.</li>
            <li> They hold the hair in place and so far, seem immune to the 1 1/2 yr old&#x27;s attempts to pull out.</li>
            <li> I´ve bought the first package 7 years ago and they are the only barrettes that actually stay in place.</li>
            <li> My one year old granddaughter can&#x27;t keep other clips in her hair and these work better because they have little teeth that grip the hair.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> They are so hard to fine.</li>
            <li> My 3-year old can&#x27;t open them and attempts to get them out of her hair by ripping them out--along with some of her hair.</li>
            <li> so Amazon is the only way to get them so far....</li>
            <li> I think they were worth the few extra dollars.</li>
            <li> I used to wear these exact type of barrettes as a child, and have searched unsuccessfully in the stores for ones similar for my little girls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also fun, because they&#x27;re something different than the flowers and bows that I usually put in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has fine, thin hair and she pulls these out with ease.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t do that, because they are flat plastic, with tiny teeth, sort of like a headband</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying hard to keep these from getting lost, unlike the many clips we&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> These are exactly the same barrettes I had when I was little!!  </li>
            <li> My sisters noticed them when we were visiting, too, and they were excited to see this little blast from the past.  </li>
            <li> And now my daughter wears them, if my husband can distract her with a jig long enough for me to get it in without her noticing.</li>
            <li> Meant for less hair than a 3 or 5 yr old.  </li>
            <li> My girls use them everyday since they were 1 year old!</li>
            <li> They stay in her hair all day long, regardless of her activities.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely search for other color combinations.</li>
            <li> These barrettes stay in place and keep loose hair out of her face.</li>
            <li> Those are the ones I wanted, but I found them later at the grocery store for half of the price.</li>
            <li> These turned out to be smaller and less sturdy than the barrettes I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Meant for a younger child or one with less hair than my grandaughters</li>
            <li> Not sure how other commenters with fine, thin hair are getting these to stay in.</li>
            <li> I used the same clips as a little girl</li>
            <li> These are the only barrettes that will stay in my daughter&#x27;s hair because of the little teeth.</li>
            <li> I had similar barrettes when I was a little girl growing up in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> These are the same barrettes I used as a little girl.  </li>
            <li> I used the same ones when I was a little girl.</li>
            <li> and they hold my 3 yo&#x27;s thin hair really well.  </li>
            <li> I remember the plastic being harder, though.</li>
            <li> However, given the picture I received what I should&#x27;ve expected.</li>
            <li> was not what I expected</li>
            <li> I only really did 4 stars because I&#x27;m disappointed that barrettes that are 30+ years old (they may have even been my sister&#x27;s!)</li>
            <li> I remember us having other shapes too</li>
            <li> These barrettes were exactly what I expected, but one of them was missing the plastic knob to clasp it closed, rendering it useless.</li>
            <li> Yet they are hard to open.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old daughter has thin hair</li>
            <li> thing to note: my daughter has thick black asian hair.</li>
            <li> These are sometimes a bit difficult to open and may break even short fingernails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 42 and wore these when I was little.  </li>
            <li> I have ones from when I was little</li>
            <li> the need help with the other ones usually...</li>
            <li> I used to wear these barrettes when I was a little girl, so I bought them for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I had these when I was little</li>
            <li> I had these when I was little and couldn&#x27;t find them in the store.</li>
            <li> They are durable and clamp tight to my daughters hair,  so she rarely loses them.  </li>
            <li> Possibly I&#x27;m just doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> They usually stay on, but I remember my childhood ones stayed on longer.</li>
            <li> They are not available at pharmacies lately</li>
            <li> these types of clips seem hard to find.</li>
            <li> They are hard to find in stores anymore,</li>
            <li> I have thick, thick hair and it hardly holds a strand.</li>
            <li> If she doesn&#x27;t pull them out, they slowly start to fall out after just an hour or so.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed there were not more colors.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for these for a while, all the knock-offs are terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why you can&#x27;t get these in the stores anymore!  I&#x27;m 42 and wore these when I was little.  They&#x27;re the only barrettes that stay in my 2 yr olds fine hair!</li>
            <li> I really like these barrettes. And they bring back memories from my childhood. They are durable and clamp tight to my daughters hair,  so she rarely loses them.  Unlike the barrettes that are sold at the hair store in only one style and are cheap and cheaply made. Why don&#x27;t they make barrettes like this anymore?</li>
            <li> Not as sturdy as the old school ones.</li>
            <li> I used the same clips as a little girl and now I use them on my daughter.  My daughter is a toddler and has very fine.  These clips stay put:)</li>
            <li> Oh gosh. Nostalgia here. I bought these for my 4 year old.  She LOVES picking out the animal of the day.  THey made her giggle when she saw them.  They also stay great in her hair!</li>
            <li> Came quickly and packaged well.  Exactly as shown in photo.  These are the only barrettes that will stay in my daughter&#x27;s hair because of the little teeth.</li>
            <li> I love these clips.  My daughter still has the baby fine hair so I use these with her pony tails to add extra cuteness.  They stay clipped really well and are adorable.  I remember these when I was a kid.</li>
            <li> No school like the old school!! My daughter is 23 months and has curly wild hair. These have the teeth and secure closure we need!! Love them. I want all the colors.</li>
            <li> These barrettes are great for thin hair.  They work for me.  I was a bit disappointed there were not more colors.  But, overall, I like them.</li>
            <li> I had similar barrettes when I was a little girl growing up in the 80&#x27;s. Now that I have a daughter, I thought she&#x27;d enjoy wearing them. These barrettes stay in place and keep loose hair out of her face. I took one star away because it would&#x27;ve been nice to have more bold colors instead of mostly pastel ones.</li>
            <li> Overall these are great retro looking barrettes. They are like the ones that I used as a kid in the 80s. Some of the designs have more of a cheap, plastic look but that is part of the charm, I guess. These are the best barrettes I have found that actually stay in my daughter&#x27;s hair. She enjoys picking out different designs each day. I would highly recommend these barrettes.</li>
            <li> These are exactly the same barrettes I had when I was little!!  And now my daughter wears them, if my husband can distract her with a jig long enough for me to get it in without her noticing.</li>
            <li> These are great, just like I used to have as a kid. They stay in my daughters hair which is a problem I have with most Barrettes.</li>
            <li> These barrettes were exactly what I expected, but one of them was missing the plastic knob to clasp it closed, rendering it useless.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay.  I have ones from when I was little and they hold my 3 yo&#x27;s thin hair really well.  I was hoping these would be the same, but they aren&#x27;t.  I only really did 4 stars because I&#x27;m disappointed that barrettes that are 30+ years old (they may have even been my sister&#x27;s!) work better.</li>
            <li> These are sometimes a bit difficult to open and may break even short fingernails. My 3-year old can&#x27;t open them and attempts to get them out of her hair by ripping them out--along with some of her hair.</li>
            <li> I have been hunting for these because they are the only ones that stay clipped. My granddaughter has a lot of hair but it is fine and these are the best.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 2 year old grand-daughter.  I had used them for my girls when they were young and loved them then.  These hold the hair better than any other barrettes I&#x27;ve found.  They are cute and colorful.  My grand-daughter loves them as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I checked Amazon for these plastic barrettes..!  I have Lhasa Apsos and have found that these&lt;br /&gt;type of barrettes are the only ones to hold their hair back.  Guess what--none of the local stores carry them,&lt;br /&gt;so finding these was truly a blessing.</li>
            <li> I used to wear these exact type of barrettes as a child, and have searched unsuccessfully in the stores for ones similar for my little girls. I have purchased a variety of those being offered nowadays, from the likes of Claire&#x27;s, but none of them work as well as these. They look lovely, but invariably fall apart after a few months of use. These were sturdy growing up, and we never had to rebuy them, so I&#x27;m hoping this will be the case now with these. The ones from Claire&#x27;s also have a tendency to pull my daughters&#x27; hair out when we have to take them out, because they use the metal alligator type clips for them, which tend  to catch individual hairs in them. These don&#x27;t do that, because they are flat plastic, with tiny teeth, sort of like a headband only smaller, so you just pop the clip open and pull it out, without any metal hinge to deal with. Both of my girls prefer these to any of the pretty, sparkly ones from Claire&#x27;s and similar stores. Another benefit to these is that they can put them in themselves...the need help with the other ones usually...</li>
            <li> They remind me of the barrettes I had as a kid. Thanks for continuing to make a classic quality product.</li>
            <li> These are the absolute best clips. I love their awesome vintage look-- they remind me of clips I wore when I was a girl in the 80s. I bought them for my 2 year old. She has quite long hair that hasn&#x27;t really gotten super thick yet, but I&#x27;ve been impressed at how much of her hair these barrettes can hold. They come in a great range of colors. They are a bit pricier here on Amazon than I would probably pay for just any old clips, but I love these so much I think they were worth the few extra dollars. I&#x27;m trying hard to keep these from getting lost, unlike the many clips we&#x27;ve purchased in the past. I have to say, if these do go the way of all the clips, I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy another package. They are that cute.</li>
            <li> Those are the ones I wanted, but I found them later at the grocery store for half of the price.</li>
            <li> My one year old granddaughter can&#x27;t keep other clips in her hair and these work better because they have little teeth that grip the hair.&lt;br /&gt;They are a retro look.  I looked in one or two stores and couldn&#x27;t find them but of course Amazon had them.  Thanks</li>
            <li> great price for a standard product .</li>
            <li> Stays in 5 year old&#x27;s hair all day!</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find these for my daughter!  Takes me back to the good ole&#x27; 80&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> These are the only barrettes that will stay in my 1-year-old daughter&#x27;s hair. She can&#x27;t pull them out! They are stay-put and I&#x27;m glad they still make them. I love the designs because I used to wear the same ones when I was a girl!</li>
            <li> I used to wear these barrettes when I was a little girl, so I bought them for my daughter. They are the same, but her hair is still a bit too fine to keep them in properly.</li>
            <li> Love these old school barrettes!</li>
            <li> Just like when I was a kid! My 4yo loves picking out which pair she&#x27;d like to wear that day.</li>
            <li> these are ok, but I need something bigger for my toddlers hair.  these types of clips seem hard to find.</li>
            <li> These do not have metal that can destroy a toddler&#x27;s fine hair, but they hold in place great!  I only wish they had a couple more white clips.</li>
            <li> The only clip that will stay in my 3 y.o. daughter&#x27;s fine hair.  Same as I used as a kid.</li>
            <li> I love these old fashioned barrettes! They look adorable in my daughter&#x27;s hair! I had looked for them everywhere and online is where I found them so I think they&#x27;re definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> These are the Goody barrettes from years ago. I remember the plastic being harder, though. These still work great, however, and they snap well.</li>
            <li> Just like the ones from the 80s! :)</li>
            <li> I got these hoping they&#x27;d hold my toddler&#x27;s very fine hair, but they fall right out. They stay in my preschooler&#x27;s thick-but-straight hair, but they make it stick out at funny angles. Possibly I&#x27;m just doing it wrong. They are cute.</li>
            <li> These turned out to be smaller and less sturdy than the barrettes I was expecting. I wish I could find the ones like I had as a kid!</li>
            <li> Finally hair clips that stay in.  I had these as a toddler and they bring back great memories!</li>
            <li> They hold hair very snug.</li>
            <li> I remember wearing these as a kid and was excited to find them for my daughter. She has super fine hair and they stay in all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using those metal clips to keep my daughter&#x27;s bangs up and out of her eyes but the clips would fall off or my daughter would take them off. Who knows how many clips we&#x27;ve gone through until I discovered that these plastic ones won&#x27;t fall off! I&#x27;ve bought similar ones at Dollar Tree but they were so cheap, they wouldn&#x27;t even snap shut! These were good quality and worked well.  My daughter liked that there were different colors and designs. I&#x27;m glad that they stay put and are safe---no sharp corners, edges and relatively cheap. I would buy again and do recommend to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note: my daughter has thick black asian hair. I wish these clips would hold a little more hair but they&#x27;re still sturdy enough that they won&#x27;t &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; open if I put the right amount of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to manufacturer: I but you would have more sales if you offered similar plastic barrettes with a little more &amp;#34;Sparkle&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Finally a barrette that stays in my daughter&#x27;s hair. I bought these because the ones I purchased at my local store would not stay snapped or just slid out of her hair; these did not do that. I would prefer more than 2 of each color, along with some black and deeper colors too. However, given the picture I received what I should&#x27;ve expected. I will definitely search for other color combinations. Overall, this is a good product for my active 2 year old.</li>
            <li> These really do stay in my two year old&#x27;s fine hair, and they are adorable.</li>
            <li> My daughter has extremely fine hair, so regular hair clips (including the metal snap clips) do not stay in her hair.  These clips work perfectly.  They stay in her hair all day long, regardless of her activities.  This includes putting on a hat to head out in the sun while at pre-k... when I pick her up, the clips are still in.  Despite being plastic, they still look very cute.</li>
            <li> I had these when I was little and I bought them for nostalgia. They work great - I love that they&#x27;re plastic so I don&#x27;t have to worry about metal in the pool! Really cute and a great accessory!</li>
            <li> They usually stay on, but I remember my childhood ones stayed on longer.</li>
            <li> The best clips are barrettes, they stay in place and keep my daughters hair in place and look cute. I dont have to keep clipping them on again and again.</li>
            <li> 22 month old daughter pulls them out.</li>
            <li> I was wanting some of these for my daughter because I remember when my sisters and I used to wear them back when we were growing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are basically the same as I remember--rabbits, dots, bows...I remember us having other shapes too (like, a violin or fiddle or something? and different flowers?) but I thought these were great.  The bow shaped ones don&#x27;t stay in my baby&#x27;s hair well, but the others do.  It&#x27;s nice because even though they do appear to be assorted designs and colors, they are in matching pairs, so there&#x27;s no problem matching if you want one on each side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these.  My sisters noticed them when we were visiting, too, and they were excited to see this little blast from the past.  It&#x27;s also fun, because they&#x27;re something different than the flowers and bows that I usually put in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  A lot of the baby hair accessories are kind of similar styles--ruffley bows, or boutique bows, flowers, etc, but this is just totally different--plastic? with a picture?  Feels good to mix things up a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a six-star product, definitely.</li>
            <li> These do a great job holding my daughters fine hair.</li>
            <li> Pure nostalgia for me, but I&#x27;m really enjoying using these barrettes in our little girls&#x27; hair.&lt;br /&gt;Right now we&#x27;re just using them to hold up her bangs (on top of her head, like &amp;#34;Pebbles Flinstone&amp;#34;).  Imagine I might need a bit more grip for a real styling hold.</li>
            <li> Good grip and work well on toddlers&#x27; thin hair</li>
            <li> My 3 year old daughter has thin hair and I couldn&#x27;t find anything to secure it so it wouldn&#x27;t get into her eyes.  I have been looking for these barrettes for some time because I remembered they have teeth in them to hold hair.  They work perfectly for her and I remember these from when I was a child - poodle, teddy bear designs.</li>
            <li> I have two girls and they are unique! I´ve bought the first package 7 years ago and they are the only barrettes that actually stay in place. My girls use them everyday since they were 1 year old! Everybody loves them as they remember being the ones we used growing up. They are not available at pharmacies lately so Amazon is the only way to get them so far.... Great quality and colors!</li>
            <li> Meant for less hair than a 3 or 5 yr old.  Meant for a younger child or one with less hair than my grandaughters</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t seem like the same quality I&#x27;ve purchased at the store before. They feel flimsier so they don&#x27;t stay in my daughters fine hair for long.</li>
            <li> Just like the barrettes my mom put in my hair as a child. LOVE these! I have been looking for these for a while, all the knock-offs are terrible. These are great!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would stay in our granddaughter&#x27;s fine hair - and not slip out with the first tug.  These were the exact item I had used on her mother&#x27;s hair, so was happy to have found them. They were a Christmas stocking stuffer, so have been in use for about a month now.  They hold the hair in place and so far, seem immune to the 1 1/2 yr old&#x27;s attempts to pull out. I thought the price was a bit higher than expected but you certainly get quite an assortment.  Like others, I would have been happier with some brighter colors more in line with the clothing now being worn.  I wound up buying another brand for that pop of color. That&#x27;s the reason for only four stars.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Use on my silkies hair.</li>
            <li> Just like when I was a kid!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift. They are great!</li>
            <li> They hold thick hair, they look cute and they are cheap enough that you don&#x27;t care if you lose them! I used to buy them at our local drug store and since they stopped carrying them, I get them online because they are great!</li>
            <li> Best barrettes available for little girls with thin hair!</li>
            <li> These are the same barrettes I used as a little girl.  I remember they were the only ones that stayed well in my hair.  My daughter has straight silky hair and most of the fabric bow clips that are sold in the stores now just slip right out.  She loves the animals and colors and I love the nostalgia.</li>
            <li> I love these barrettes and so does my daughter. They are so hard to fine. They stay put in her fine hair. I used the same ones when I was a little girl.</li>
            <li> Super cute! pretty colors! There is no hair barrettes like this in stores. It was great pice too.</li>
            <li> These are really cute, retro barrettes.  My only issue with them is they easily fall out of my toddler&#x27;s hair.  Yet they are hard to open.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying these again.</li>
            <li> Nice pastel colors.  Work well in my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I had these when I was little and couldn&#x27;t find them in the store. They are made way better than the products today. They don&#x27;t slide out of your hair. Love these!!</li>
            <li> was not what I expected</li>
            <li> My daughter has fine, thin hair and she pulls these out with ease. If she doesn&#x27;t pull them out, they slowly start to fall out after just an hour or so. I have thick, thick hair and it hardly holds a strand. They are really cute colors and designs, I just wish they held more firm. Not sure how other commenters with fine, thin hair are getting these to stay in.</li>
            <li> Classic barrettes, love these! They are hard to find in stores anymore, so glad I found them here.</li>
