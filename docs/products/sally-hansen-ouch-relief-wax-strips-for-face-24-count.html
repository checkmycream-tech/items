    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The plastic strips were very effective.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because Sally Hansen is a good brand and that has a good reputation to its products.</li>
            <li>I have even used a blow dryer to warm them.</li>
            <li>Which scares to me think what kind of chemicals even exist on those wipes.</li>
            <li>i use the wipes and the plastic strips its more effective for me that way not the strips that come in this box.</li>
            <li>I used to buy years ago seemed to work a lot better.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you read the instructions 100%.  </li>
            <li>Please spend your money on better products.</li>
            <li>I think these are much better than Veet  or most brands that are out there for quick</li>
            <li>The only reason this is getting two stars is the ouch-relief wipes that come with it are pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>Works great on chin, upper lip.  </li>
            <li>No matter what I tried the wax does not peel apart smoothly.</li>
            <li>Extremely easy to use and not painful (even without using the wipe that numbs the area).</li>
            <li>Maybe they are more &#x27;gentle&#x27; for the ouch-relief</li>
            <li>Luckily adding lotion and anti-itch cream relieved the itching and pain and swelling.</li>
            <li>First, it recommends that you let your hair grow for three weeks!  </li>
            <li>They are really decent for a quick fix such as between professional waxes or great for an area that does not need much removed.</li>
            <li>First time</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>First of all, warming the strips in your hand does not work.</li>
            <li>Nobody wants to wax with a strip like that!</li>
            <li>When you are able to use them no hair is actually removed.</li>
            <li>I cannot think of one positive thing to say about this product.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy them separately.</li>
            <li>Although the ouch-relief component of this product works really well, the wax strips couldn&#x27;t even remove hair from my arm.</li>
            <li>Amazon price is decent  on these as well.</li>
            <li>My initial plan was to use it for my face, but I tested them on my legs first.</li>
            <li>The results on my upper lip were decent, and this was so much faster/cheaper than a waxing appointment.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the plastic is better at protecting the wax while they&#x27;re in the box than the paper ones, and the wax was dried out, but there was barely any wax on the paper ones in this product.  </li>
            <li>(No previous acne issues - ever!)  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t imagine what it would look like if I did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an old box, as the expiration date is in one year.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I would never use this particular product again.  </li>
            <li>The wipes themselves are HUGE and come in a foil packet you tear open (Like a Red Lobster wet wipe), so you can&#x27;t store and reuse the wipe again.</li>
            <li>Who wants to walk around with a hairy whatever for that long?</li>
            <li>I held it in front of a space heater on high for about two minutes, and the wax finally melted enough to use.</li>
            <li>it was a hot mess is all I can say ....</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, even then, the wax only stuck to the smallest, finest, most invisible hairs on my face, and left the visible ones completely untouched.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately, even then, the wax only stuck to the smallest, finest, most invisible hairs on my face, and left the visible ones completely untouched.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the point of claiming &amp;#34;PAIN FREE TECHNOLOGY&amp;#34; is it doesn&#x27;t actually wax and leaves behind alot the majority of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am experienced with at-home wax strips and was disappointed by this product, as well as, upset that I spent my money on something that did not deliver the promised results.</li>
            <li> The label claims that it works on short hair, but it seems to grip long hair only.  </li>
            <li> not sure why, but there are ALWAYS hairs left on my upper lip after following the directions to remove it.</li>
            <li> They used to be such a great product by both of the two boxes I bought are horrible!!!</li>
            <li> Uneven clumps of wax were left on each of the strips even after warming them with my hands for several minutes.</li>
            <li> Not only did they pull the littlest amount of hair possible, you could not warm them properly.</li>
            <li> Since the skin is already sensitive, one should never re-strip the same area (in fear of further irritating the skin).</li>
            <li> This kid is super easy, practically idiot proof!  </li>
            <li> They are a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Being a fan of the classic wax strips from Sally Hansen, I was excited to try this product, hoping that it would be a little less painful to use.  </li>
            <li> Such a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Could not tell you about other areas..</li>
            <li> Never having tried waxing before, I wanted to start with this one, because it was half the price of other Sally Hansen hair removal kits.  </li>
            <li> I am middle eastern and have thick hair</li>
            <li> The wipes slightly numb the area effectively, but unfortunately the wax strips ARE NOT the plastic ones they sell in the other kit.  </li>
            <li> The wax wouldn&#x27;t stick to the hair - repeated attempts to remove hair didn&#x27;t even get half the job done.</li>
            <li> Rubbing the fabric-like sheets between your hands doesn&#x27;t even SLIGHTLY melt the wax.</li>
            <li> After I pulled the  strip off, half of my hair was still on my lip.</li>
            <li> It seems they are investing less on the quality, and therefore will not be getting anymore money from me.</li>
            <li> So frustrating because I want it to be a one-shot deal....and have it last a couple of weeks (which is how this product used to be)...</li>
            <li> 100% waste of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the strips I bought were damaged, because when I pulled the two pieces of paper apart to expose the &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; on each strip, an equal amount of wax adhered to each piece of paper, leaving an extremely thin layer of on each piece.  </li>
            <li> This thin coating of wax did not grip short hair at all.  </li>
            <li> Very painful to use and within a week after using this product, my face had broken out with significant acne where the strips had been!  </li>
            <li> I have a little bit of thin sparse hair here and there and tried to do my eyebrows</li>
            <li> /&gt;First I used the pre-treatment wipes which effectively numb the area (for me it was the upper lip).</li>
            <li> LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN WAX STRIP DO NOT WORK ON THICK HAIR.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all, complete waste of money, sorry very unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> however I am not good at this wax thing anyhow.</li>
            <li> (not my actual leg, I forgot to take a picture at the time :( )</li>
            <li> I work up this morning and my face is still a little numb.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this one of the worst products I have bought from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick the the non ouch-relief version, even if it is painful!</li>
            <li> Wax doesn&#x27;t take off hair, it still hurts, and the wipes emit awful fumes</li>
            <li> Worst of all, my skin has swollen itchy bumps afterwards.</li>
            <li> Maybe I used it incorrectly, but I followed directions for fear of horrible results, but that&#x27;s what I got!</li>
            <li> Horrible!  </li>

            <li> This product does not work at all. Uneven clumps of wax were left on each of the strips even after warming them with my hands for several minutes. The wax wouldn&#x27;t stick to the hair - repeated attempts to remove hair didn&#x27;t even get half the job done.</li>
            <li> Being a fan of the classic wax strips from Sally Hansen, I was excited to try this product, hoping that it would be a little less painful to use.  Well, the wipes they give you WOULD work to relieve pain if the waxing strips worked!  The wipes slightly numb the area effectively, but unfortunately the wax strips ARE NOT the plastic ones they sell in the other kit.  They are made of paper and when you put them on your hair, you might as well be using scotch tape.  They do not remove the hair AT ALL.  The plastic strips were very effective.  Perhaps the plastic is better at protecting the wax while they&#x27;re in the box than the paper ones, and the wax was dried out, but there was barely any wax on the paper ones in this product.  I&#x27;ll stick the the non ouch-relief version, even if it is painful!</li>
            <li> the strips from Sally hansen I used to buy years ago seemed to work a lot better. not sure why, but there are ALWAYS hairs left on my upper lip after following the directions to remove it. So frustrating because I want it to be a one-shot deal....and have it last a couple of weeks (which is how this product used to be)...now I have to do it TWICE in a row AND still tweeze out a couple of still-missed strays.&lt;br /&gt;disappointed.</li>
            <li> Received today can&#x27;t wait to try it out. First time</li>
            <li> I have been using the regular Sally Hansen strips (the ones on a plastic sheet) for about a year now, and when I ran out of my stockpile, I bought these by mistake. They are a total waste of money. Rubbing the fabric-like sheets between your hands doesn&#x27;t even SLIGHTLY melt the wax. I held it in front of a space heater on high for about two minutes, and the wax finally melted enough to use. Unfortunately, even then, the wax only stuck to the smallest, finest, most invisible hairs on my face, and left the visible ones completely untouched. The only reason this is getting two stars is the ouch-relief wipes that come with it are pretty awesome. I would absolutely buy them separately. However, the box only comes with three wipes. The wipes themselves are HUGE and come in a foil packet you tear open (Like a Red Lobster wet wipe), so you can&#x27;t store and reuse the wipe again.</li>
            <li> the ouch relief works well, but the wax strips don&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t stick</li>
            <li> 100% waste of money. Followed all directions. Wax doesn&#x27;t take off hair, it still hurts, and the wipes emit awful fumes</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money! Not only did they pull the littlest amount of hair possible, you could not warm them properly. I followed the directions exactly. Worst of all, my skin has swollen itchy bumps afterwards. I even considered going to the hospital. Luckily adding lotion and anti-itch cream relieved the itching and pain and swelling. I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t imagine what it would look like if I did. My initial plan was to use it for my face, but I tested them on my legs first. Please do not use! I have included a picture of what the bumps looked like when it happened. (not my actual leg, I forgot to take a picture at the time :( )</li>
            <li> Although the ouch-relief component of this product works really well, the wax strips couldn&#x27;t even remove hair from my arm. I will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> OUCH!  Very painful to use and within a week after using this product, my face had broken out with significant acne where the strips had been!  (No previous acne issues - ever!)  Maybe I used it incorrectly, but I followed directions for fear of horrible results, but that&#x27;s what I got!</li>
            <li> I read about this on a beauty blog and immediately dropped it into my amazon cart.  I have never waxed before, let alone by myself at home.  This kid is super easy, practically idiot proof!  Just make sure you read the instructions 100%.  My lady &#x27;stache has finally met it&#x27;s match.</li>
            <li> The wax strips do not work LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN WAX STRIP DO NOT WORK ON THICK HAIR. I am middle eastern and have thick hair and it didn&#x27;t remove anything and the numbing wipes well they work. i Waxed my last night i use the wipes and the plastic strips its more effective for me that way not the strips that come in this box. I work up this morning and my face is still a little numb.</li>
            <li> Personally, I would never use this particular product again.  Never having tried waxing before, I wanted to start with this one, because it was half the price of other Sally Hansen hair removal kits.  First, it recommends that you let your hair grow for three weeks!  Who wants to walk around with a hairy whatever for that long? The label claims that it works on short hair, but it seems to grip long hair only.  I don&#x27;t know if the strips I bought were damaged, because when I pulled the two pieces of paper apart to expose the &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; on each strip, an equal amount of wax adhered to each piece of paper, leaving an extremely thin layer of on each piece.  This thin coating of wax did not grip short hair at all.  It&#x27;s not an old box, as the expiration date is in one year.  The wax also leaves a sticky residue on the skin.</li>
            <li> Works great on chin, upper lip.  Saves  a bundle on pro waxing.  Eyebrow area a bit trickier, you need to trim the strips, and probably need to use tweezers in addition.  Extremely easy to use and not painful (even without using the wipe that numbs the area).</li>
            <li> Did not work at all, complete waste of money, sorry very unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> Do you want a product that removes hair? Do you want to spend your valuable money on a product that works well? If you answered yes to either one of these questions then this is not the product for you. I cannot think of one positive thing to say about this product. First of all, warming the strips in your hand does not work. I have even used a blow dryer to warm them. No matter what I tried the wax does not peel apart smoothly. When the strips peel apart the wax has multiple ridges, lines, and bumps. Nobody wants to wax with a strip like that! When you are able to use them no hair is actually removed. Maybe they are more &#x27;gentle&#x27; for the ouch-relief it promises? Either way, they do not work. Please spend your money on better products. I have found that Veet and Nads work well.</li>
            <li> I bought this because Sally Hansen is a good brand and that has a good reputation to its products. Unfortunately this one of the worst products I have bought from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I used the pre-treatment wipes which effectively numb the area (for me it was the upper lip). Which scares to me think what kind of chemicals even exist on those wipes. The numbing sensation felt a bit like the after effects of Novocaine. I waited 10 min after as stated on the box, warmed the strips with my hands, and applied them to my upper lip. After I pulled the  strip off, half of my hair was still on my lip. Since the skin is already sensitive, one should never re-strip the same area (in fear of further irritating the skin). I had to end up plucking the rest. What&#x27;s the point of claiming &amp;#34;PAIN FREE TECHNOLOGY&amp;#34; is it doesn&#x27;t actually wax and leaves behind alot the majority of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am experienced with at-home wax strips and was disappointed by this product, as well as, upset that I spent my money on something that did not deliver the promised results. It seems they are investing less on the quality, and therefore will not be getting anymore money from me.</li>
            <li> I have a little bit of thin sparse hair here and there and tried to do my eyebrows it was a hot mess is all I can say .... however I am not good at this wax thing anyhow.</li>
            <li> This product did not remove any facial hair. Instead it ripped off my skin and left redness, swelling &amp; pain. I will never attempt  hair removal myself ever again. Go to a salon and have it waxed, ladies!!</li>
            <li> The results on my upper lip were decent, and this was so much faster/cheaper than a waxing appointment. Thumbs up from me.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years. They are really decent for a quick fix such as between professional waxes or great for an area that does not need much removed. I think these are much better than Veet  or most brands that are out there for quick fixes.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product. I am only speaking of the facial wax. Could not tell you about other areas.. Amazon price is decent  on these as well.</li>
            <li> Horrible!  Does not work!  They used to be such a great product by both of the two boxes I bought are horrible!!! Sally Hansen will not replace them either!  Do not buy!</li>
