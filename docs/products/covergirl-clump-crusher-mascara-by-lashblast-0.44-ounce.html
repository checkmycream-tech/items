            <li>I was a devoted fan of Covergirl&#x27;s Lashblast Volume (in the orange tube) as it gave my lashes the fullest look for the best price, but I always had issues with a coating of flakes beneath my eyes before the day was even up!</li>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>Still looked great before the water though!</li>

            <li>great volume and thickness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great every day mascara.</li>

            <li>It just gives eyes very nice, polished look.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing at just that!</li>

            <li>Like this stuff is so good</li>
            <li>The color is good and my lashes are never clumpy or sticky.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s fairly long-lasting through out the day.</li>
            <li>This is a good mascara for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best CG mascara I&#x27;ve found since I couldn&#x27;t find the original Marathon anymore.</li>
            <li>And you get the most beautiful lash shape.</li>
            <li>The mascara&#x27;s SUPER and the Cover Girl (vs Lancome) price is awesome.  </li>

            <li>Guess I&#x27;ll stick to my favorite (Buxom), not the cheapest, but this product allows me to give my lashes great coverage without clumping.</li>
            <li>No mess and beautifully applies on the eyelashes with the perfect volume.</li>

            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love my lashes after using this!</li>
            <li>If someone cries a lot make sure it is water resistant!</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied!</li>
            <li>Love It!  </li>
            <li>And for the price, you will not get a better value for your buck!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>Okay !</li>
            <li>I really do love this mascara!</li>
            <li>Amazing length and volume.</li>
            <li>mascara is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing amazing</li>
            <li>There were no clumps and it gives nice coverage.</li>
            <li>The brush is nice too, keeps from clumping.</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely even with one coat.</li>
            <li>No clumps, no spiky lashes with blunt ends, no globs on the lower lashes, just nice separation and length.  </li>
            <li>It crushes clumps and provides nice even coverage while making my eyelashes look longer.</li>
            <li>but it still kind of clumped.</li>
            <li>:) I would reccomend to anyone looking for a good and inexpensive mascara.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump, but it&#x27;s also nothing spectacular.  </li>
            <li>The wand is nice and the mascara lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>The color was good and it lasted most of the day.</li>
            <li>, I couldnt believe how easy was to apply it on my lower eye lashes and no clumps either, cant say is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used but its pretty good....</li>
            <li>good for application to lower lasters, the shape of the brush just isn&#x27;t as easy on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t waterproof for those who prefer waterproof mascara; it does come off very easily when washing your face.</li>
            <li>and this is way better than most mascara&#x27;s I&#x27;ver tried!</li>
            <li>Brush is great for fanning out lashes and does exactly what it claims, builds non-clumpy volume!</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;ve been wearing this for 2 days now and I am loving it.  </li>
            <li>It does not smudge, the color is nice, and I&#x27;m surprisingly pleased.</li>
            <li>Normally I would need to see many reviews and wasn&#x27;t that impressed with her lashes.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara of all time - and I&#x27;ve tried many, many varieties!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it does not clump up, and it goes on very easily and does coat each and every lash, just as it says it does.  </li>
            <li>Great mascara, reasonable price!</li>
            <li>provide the appearance of great volume and length to lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Is not water proof, as I found out on first use but</li>
            <li>This mascara is pretty great.  </li>
            <li>- just full, gorgeous lashes.  </li>
            <li>I love the mascara and the shipping was very quick!</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and evenly with no clumps at all.</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments and questions about what I&#x27;m doing to my lashes ever since I switched to this holy grail mascara.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>So glad I did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap risk!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>and I love that about it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but the brand is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>Pay attention, cause we gals are on a budget most of the time.</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>Cover Girl has always been better than the rest.</li>
            <li>For years, I used my favorite, a mascara by Lancome.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brand of mascara.</li>
            <li>You will really love this wand…</li>
            <li>They can get product gooped on it, but just make sure you scrape some off on the rim before applying.</li>
            <li>So much better than the falsies mascara.</li>
            <li>so this product does make them more noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Make sure that you are deciding that you don&#x27;t want water resistant mascara.</li>
            <li>Will buy more.</li>
            <li>This was one of the mascaras that ranked in the top 5.</li>
            <li>I found another way better &amp; cheaper</li>
            <li>Felt like I had to keep adding more</li>
            <li>I guess I need to look for something that will add more volume and body to my lashes.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara ever.</li>
            <li>Just so you know, the best is the basic mascara made by ColoreScience.</li>
            <li>, it has an interesting angle and the bristles sweep away a lot of excess product when you brush it on.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it gave my lashes 200% more volume though, which is why I am giving it four stars instead of five.</li>
            <li>so I did not expect fabulous lashes since I&#x27;ve lost them, but the mascara goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>It is because of this innovative brush that I would recommend this mascara over [[ASIN:B0018QE47</li>
            <li>Over time, the brush has started to work better as the mascara has become more evenly distributed on the brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible but it could be much better.</li>
            <li>Hope you get a better experience out of this item than I did.</li>
            <li>does the trick, so  for me to put this product in a separate category, it has to deliver something more.  </li>
            <li>, it stays on all day, no clumps, and does not crumble or fall or leave marks on top lids.  </li>
            <li>(The easier it comes off, the better, for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>, I can buy this in more than one color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What is your favorite color?</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>the only reason i gave it 4 stars is becuase its not the best drugstore mascara i use.</li>
            <li>My favorite for years was Bobbi Brown&#x27;s Everything Mascara.</li>
            <li>but I love that there is no fallout.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>with many cosmetics, it takes time to find the ones that do what they say they will do.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for more volume, my mom happened to like it.</li>
            <li>Applies with precision, looks way better than the mega-brush products, and NO FLAKING, NO IRRITATION, even after all-day and all-evening out.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple weeks and love it.</li>
            <li>This was just an okay product to me.</li>
            <li>I have used many brands of mascara in all price ranges and I prefer these.  </li>
            <li>I also use the Lashblast Volume (Orange tube) and love it.  </li>
            <li>It took me a try or two to use it in such a way as to get the volume and length without the clumps, but once I figured it out, it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that leaves my lashes beautiful and clump-free!</li>
            <li>I am always on a quest for a mascara I love.</li>
            <li>but I love the end result.</li>
            <li>how many times I coat (provided</li>
            <li>That seems to happen with anything I really love.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recently, my favorite mascara has been Cover Girl Lash Blast Volume (in the orange tube)</li>
            <li>A cheap product!</li>
            <li>This mascara is okay.</li>
            <li>Covergirl Clump Crusher Mascara is designed to give you the ideal length of a good mascara without the clumping, and that is exactly what it does, according to my 17 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, this mascara really does work!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good mascara but tends to flake, which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not false-lash volume + length, but it&#x27;s pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s the highest reviewed drugstore mascara I&#x27;ve seen on Amazon) and it was worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>Just be easy with it; you don&#x27;t need more than 2 coats.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, seems to catch most eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I love the shape of the wand because it makes it easy to get every eyelash on your eye.</li>
            <li>The convex side (bulging out?) is great for lengthening, and the concave is fantastic for bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>The brush is great at separating the lashes, making your lashes look very natural.</li>
            <li>Great so far!</li>
            <li>Very good product especially for a drug store mascara!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m betting this product might be a better fit for women with longer or curvier lashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true - no clumps!</li>
            <li>It is also easy to wash off.  </li>
            <li>It is fairly easy to take off if it runs from water or accidental smears and comes off well at night.</li>
            <li>Clump Crusher goes on easily.</li>
            <li>It goes on well, and while the brush doesn&#x27;t magickally master clumps, it is easy to work with, and goes on evenly.</li>
            <li>but they can be easily combed out.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>Easy to use and get to those lashes in the corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also find it does not wash off easily, but that could be my choice in removers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does take some getting use to but the product is still easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>strong brush, and it doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>strong and scratchy.</li>
            <li>I love full lashes and this did not content me as well as I thought it should have I put on 2 coats</li>
            <li>Also if you flip the brush upside down it is perfect for your bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>This is a very good, well priced, every day mascara that is easy to apply, dries quickly and gives one&#x27;s lashes moderate volume and length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Washes off easily with cleanser and water, which is important for me with my contact lenses.</li>
            <li>About 3-4 hours into wearing it, it has smeared below my lashes, which is fine if you want that smokey, humid look.</li>
            <li>So if you apply quickly, I&#x27;d skip buying this and just go with lashblast, my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a loyal \\&quot;Covergirl\\&quot; and this product exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>the clump looks very natural good color,great product would recommend to everyone</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a makeup expert by any means, but I didn&#x27;t feel the &amp;#34;clump crusher&amp;#34; claim was really accurate -</li>
            <li>It never clumps, adds great volume, and can actually get to each and every one of my lashes with it&#x27;s curved wand.</li>
            <li>Clump Crusher is truly a fantastic mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>Anyway, I found that it was very well liked among all the people who tried it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is precisely waterproof</li>
            <li>I rarely review on amazon, but I was so pleased  </li>
            <li>It makes lashes look amazing and it lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>It goes on lightly with no clumps..</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll get volume without your eyelashes clumping together, and the enjoy the added benefit that your mascara won&#x27;t flake off or smudge during the day.</li>
            <li>So, this mascara goes on smoothly, it makes lashes thicker and longer</li>
            <li>I might buy it again because it&#x27;s fairly cheap.</li>
            <li>it goes on smoothly with the brush and doesn&#x27;t clump on my lashes.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s too fat in diameter to fit in the openings of my makeup case.  </li>
            <li>I was using the &#x27;Falsies&#x27; and was happy with the product, but this one was a bit different.  </li>
            <li>fantastic lashes.</li>
            <li>It does not clump and it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>The brush allows the mascara to be applied lightly.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff, natural looking, it does what it says - no clumps.</li>
            <li>True, no clumps easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>However, this is not an ideal mascara for someone looking for extreme volume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this mascara the past week or so, and the nice thing is that it has not clumped, so that is great.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t clump very easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the hunt for the perfect mascara - one that doesn&#x27;t leave smudges or flake or dry out fast -</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s always better to do the curling first.</li>
            <li>The applicator doesn&#x27;t get all clumped up with eyelashes and mascara--it stays clean, somehow.  </li>
            <li>While you won&#x27;t need to touch up the mascara, itself, during the day, you will need to clean up where it has smeared.</li>
            <li>The brush is really good not your typical super bristly kind.  </li>
            <li>It stays on all day but comes off cleanly with my makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I think this mascara is a good deal, easy to use whether you use make up often or only occasionally, and is fairly foolproof.</li>
            <li>It was kind of a pain using two different mascaras, but I liked features of both of them - the plastic brush of Lash Exact and the curve of Falsies.</li>
            <li>Use the convex on your upper lashes to define them easily, and the concave on the bottom, for a great smudgeless application of the shorter bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s true there is no clumping with this mascara at all I love so much</li>
            <li>First of all I love the bright green packaging totally cute.</li>
            <li>I received a full tube of</li>
            <li>it is a good basic mascara for length.</li>
            <li>The only difference between this and my beloved lashblast is the brush.</li>
            <li>The no clump claim seems to be true, but this just doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes pop.</li>
            <li>The bristles are rubber and rather short, but a good amount of them.</li>
            <li>This is a very versatile and satisfying product.</li>
            <li>Good angled applicator- does not touch your upper lid.  </li>
            <li>But it is not clumping, they are true to their word about that point.</li>
            <li>This mascara is true to it&#x27;s name</li>
            <li>Especially when you consider the price, this is a really good mascara that delivers just what</li>
            <li>I use my Buxom Lash for more drama when I really do my eyes up.</li>
            <li>so I was kind of surprised when she said she didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is billed as a no clump product, and I have found that to be true.  </li>
            <li>I know that so many women like that very famous brand of mascara that comes in the pink tube</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on smooth or coat the lashes easily, so you can&#x27;t get much length with this mascara.</li>
            <li>mascara is an excellent choice if you are interested in natural looking lashes with moderate volume and length.</li>
            <li>A great product, and I find other mascaras to be a compromise.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t feel like it gives 200% more volume as the package states, it does a good job lengthening and defining lashes with literally no clumps whatsoever (and a little volume).  </li>
            <li>I love how I was able to find it on Amazon because I just wanted to try test new mascaras without having to pay too much money.</li>
            <li>You have to keep swiping your lashes with it, but since it dries so quickly, it starts clumping everywhere.</li>
            <li>The case is a fairly obnoxious lime green, but it fits in my rotating make-up organizer on my vanity, so I can&#x27;t ask for much more than that.  </li>
            <li>I have been a loyal buys of this product since it came out years ago.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so happy I finally found it and that it is reasonably priced at Amazon.com.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried so many types of mascaras and this is my favorite overall.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is better than a lot of the high end mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have heard a ton of good reviews about this mascara and let me say that every single one of them were right!</li>
            <li>On one hand, this mascara absolutely does what it says on the tin -- it did a far better job than most mascaras when it comes to the clumping issue.</li>
            <li>No clumping..goes on smooth and easy and makes your lashes look healthy and long.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Covergirl Clump Crusher to anyone - and Amazon.com sells it for such a great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice brush, nice shape, nice mascara... not much of a legnthener but great at making your lashes thick without clumping!!!</li>
            <li>I tried this new product and it worked fabulously!</li>
            <li>I have long lashes and this mascara is wonderful and definitely does not clump at all.</li>
            <li>I loved the curved brush, it seperated all my lashes and reached every single one.</li>
            <li>but this Covergirl Mascara has been my favorite thus far!</li>
            <li>2nd favorite is NYX Doll Eye Mascara!</li>
            <li>Overall, I get better -- and quicker!</li>
            <li>, you can literally place the mascara exactly where you want it !</li>
            <li>I do like the bright green color, since that makes it easy to find in a purse.</li>
            <li>I originally tested the Brown which I found to be extremely, surprisingly light in color, even lighter than my normal lashes.</li>
            <li>mascara is amazing, especially considering how affordable it is.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This mascara is great at not clumping even if you re-apply a few times.  </li>
            <li>My favorite mascara before was from BareMinerals because my eyelashes looked natural but fuller with it.</li>
            <li>I did some simple research before I bought, so I will share them with you along with my own</li>
            <li>But if you want a more natural look with no clumps this is for you.</li>
            <li>This mascaras success is in the design of</li>
            <li>My lashes are nice and full, but not really WOW!</li>
            <li>my right eye as a LOT of extra eye lashes in one spot and this brush can&#x27;t handle that... but the Covergirl LashBlastLength can handle it nicely.</li>
            <li>I believe that there are many other mascara products by Covergirl that are far superior.</li>
            <li>This is a great mascara for long very natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li>I like this but not as much as their original lashblast mascara.</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>He was right, it doesn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
            <li>I heard about this product on the Today Show and went right out and purchased it.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a generally good formula, but I do find that I need to be very careful not to overdo it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a ton in terms of volume or length, but it does give a very natural looking kick to your lashes and is easy to remove without scrubbing at your eyes with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>it comes off very easily with some generic make up</li>
            <li>It also makes my lashes feel very full and soft even after drying, unlike some that makes them feel like spikes.  </li>
            <li>The small, rubbery bristles do a great job of applying the mascara evenly.</li>
            <li>You want good, dark coloration and length without your lashes looking like spider legs?</li>
            <li>I also liked the fact that my lashes felt soft and supple - not stiff or sticky.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump, the brush is slightly arched for great application, and easy to take off with simple make up remover wipes.</li>
            <li>Those that have the white primer are great, but sometimes white is leftover, ugh.</li>
            <li>Very nice, takes a few coats, but it does lengthen and separate lashes well!  </li>
            <li>it is a very very inexpensive mascara that does a descent job.  </li>
            <li>Still has clumps, seems to dry more quickly and flake off.</li>
            <li>I do use lash primer by Loreal first and this mascara by Cover Girl</li>
            <li>and I will absolutely be buying this again!</li>
            <li>amazon has done it again, thanks!</li>
            <li>I gave this a 4 star rating because not only did this mascara not clump on my lashes, but I was able to reapply coats without getting my lashes stuck together.</li>
            <li>and I ended up buying more before this came in weeeeeks later.</li>
            <li>This mascara really is a clump crusher as the name suggests!  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>First off, it absolutely does clump!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to my favorite.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll switch it up next order! :)</li>
            <li>Use it on the inner lids top and bottom.</li>
            <li>Use it on the inner lids top and bottom.</li>
            <li>My current favorite \\&quot;dime store\\&quot; mascara is [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The product does exactly what it says...</li>
            <li>First off my tube of mascara says &#x27;water resistent&#x27; not waterproof.</li>
            <li>maybe I should try it with more coats and put it on a different way?</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, product appears fresh.  </li>
            <li>I think you still need an eyelash comb (it&#x27;s a wee bit clumpy when it first goes on)</li>
            <li>but ultimately I think it helps me apply the mascara better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many others and always come back to this.</li>
            <li>I love mascara and use it daily and this brand is my go to.  </li>
            <li>I have used several much more pricey brands...</li>
            <li>I was able to apply multiple layers of this product and it truly did not clump.  </li>
            <li>It gives good definition, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I consider this the perfect casual or office mascara, as it gives lashes some definition without an overdone look.  </li>
            <li>I love the original Covergirl Lashblast in the orange tube but wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the large wand since I have small eyes and lashes, so I decided to try this one for the wand alone.</li>
            <li>I totally love this one, plus the color of the barrel is green which is easy to see when it&#x27;s in my purse.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless it does provide a great everyday natural lash look.</li>
            <li>The Lashblast line generally is good quality and got me away from more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>You get the same effects without the clumps, higher cost, or a special trip to the mall!  </li>
            <li>make up to be able to look good without working too hard on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Shaped like a smile or a wedge (thicker in the center and tapered at the ends), the brush is composed of many short plastic spikes that move easily through the lashes while depositing lots of pigment at the lash roots.</li>
            <li>It is the first mascara I have ever used that absolutely did not clump.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much lash paint and separator...</li>
            <li>For the past five or so years, I&#x27;ve been searching for a replacement that is as good as Lancome&#x27;s product.  </li>
            <li>I have very puny lashes and this mascara made my lashes look thick and amazing!  </li>
            <li>Application is easy, pull the applicator out of the tube and brush it on upper and lower lashes.  </li>
            <li>She wears mascara not for increasing apparent length but for \\&quot;definition\\&quot; and she was pleasently surprised at how well this product worked, and  how many compliments she received.  </li>
            <li>I think this mascara is a good deal, easy to use whether you use make up often or only occasionally, and is fairly foolproof.e inner eyelids, your eyes look smaller and harder.  </li>
            <li>I think the standard Maybelline Great Lash and Covergirl LashBlastLength beat this hands down.</li>
            <li>With the plethora of drugstore mascaras, there are certainly plenty of &amp;#34;fails&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>will purchase this again, and certainly would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews on this mascara.</li>
            <li>As a  regular fan of original lash blast, this one is an absolute winner!</li>
            <li>I really liked it, and I buy mascara at Macy&#x27;s ...who knew you could get so much for so little.  </li>
            <li>This really works and it was a dollar cheaper than it sells for in the store.  </li>
            <li>It also can really get my lower lashes well which is always a struggle.</li>
            <li>It is very pigmented as well and can really volumize my lashes without them looking spidery.</li>
            <li>This one is really a clump crusher.</li>
            <li>Really does volumize the lashes so much.</li>
            <li>It really, really doesn&#x27;t clump, lashes stay separated, and you can just keep applying until you get the effect you want.  </li>
            <li>and it really does not clump.  </li>
            <li>I have a real problem with raccoon eyes after hours of wearing mascara, even with powder under my eyes.</li>
            <li>The color of the tube is cute - green!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is not much to like about this product.  </li>
            <li>all while separating them &amp; really doesn&#x27;t leave any clumps!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>absolutely recommend this mascara if you&#x27;re not into the clumpy eyelash look.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara by Covergirl.</li>
            <li>Though not as much length and volume as I have anticipated for.</li>
            <li>Pro quality is that it stays on the whole day without smudging.</li>
            <li>&amp; IT REALLY DOES NOT CLUMP UP</li>
            <li>The brush doesn&#x27;t pull too much mascara out too</li>
            <li>I really like the way the curved brush fits the curve of the eyelashes</li>
            <li>Highly recommended !</li>
            <li>This mascara works very well and does not clump too much.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t want too much \\&quot;volume.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>So much so that I get mascara on my brow bone when I blink after application.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference in this and</li>
            <li>This product really does what it says.</li>
            <li>It thickens and lengthens as much as</li>
            <li>So, as always, I turned to Amazon.com because the reviews I find on their products help so much in deciding what to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>So just imagine how much it would enhance thicker fuller lashes.  </li>
            <li>and it really didn&#x27;t lengthen or thicken.</li>
            <li>I use it for during the day when I don&#x27;t have much makeup on.</li>
            <li>This is not the one to use, though, for a night out when you want a really \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; lash look.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>You get long, long lashes, no clumping, the wand is so good you should never throw it away.</li>
            <li>I find that this applies cleaner than most other mascaras I have tried</li>
            <li>The brush is unique, and is the reason that the product does not clump at all - even with multiple coats.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use any other mascara again</li>
            <li>the handle is wider than most other mascara&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>so me rating this as my second favorite is a pretty big deal.</li>
            <li>Compared to other products she has used she was expecting more from this Covergirl mascara.  </li>
            <li>and THEN it clumped a little, but normal use, no clumping, good for use with an eyelash curler, which I have to use, no black clumps on your curler.</li>
            <li>I need a mascara brush that is fine with bristles that aren&#x27;t too long or the mascara between the bristles never makes to my lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not left with dark residue under my eyes or on my pillowcase after a good night&#x27;s sleep.  </li>
            <li>(I have fair skin and dark blonde hair).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to all my friends, both in real life and online.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I&#x27;d rather take no clumps and fast application over high volume and lengthened spider lashes.</li>
            <li>the way, I got a great tip from a make up artist:  If you use eyeliner on the inner eyelids, your eyes look smaller and harder.  </li>
            <li>Very ordinary and not worth the praise and fame obtained, there Mascara best of them, will not buy again Aaod</li>
            <li>Instead, use white or very light blue.</li>
            <li>Instead, use white or very light blue.</li>
            <li>mascara is an excellent choice if you are interested in natural looking lashes with moderate volume and length.only recommend the Brown for extremely fair, light blondes or perhaps strawberry blondes with pale, pale lashes who are interested in a casual, natural look.</li>
            <li>but after trying this it is now my new fave!  </li>
            <li>Love the black color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too keen on all the black dust that settles on the top of my cheeks after just a couple hours of wearing this stuff.</li>
            <li>Not very voluminizing but has a easy brush to use.</li>
            <li>The clumping is minimal and it goes on easy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not talking about rubbing my eyes or anything fierce, but just touching my lashes -- black flakes.</li>
            <li>It is not clump-free, but it is less clumpy than most mascara.</li>
            <li>This same mascara is sold at Walmart for 6.00 more for the same product, and I did not have to leave my house to get it!</li>
            <li>I have tried more than a few masscaras... and this one holds up very well.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be getting this particular one again.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s decent for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super picky about my mascara and have used the same brand forever</li>
            <li>I now use it for day, since it&#x27;s not very dramatic.</li>
            <li>K CoverGirl Lashblast Mascara, Very Black 800]], which is a very good, everyday</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for all.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried high end mascaras</li>
            <li>Of course, any mascara can clump, but this one is really nice about being hard to.</li>
            <li>I am surprised how much I like this Clump Crusher Mascara.  </li>
            <li>curved brush really improves application accuracy and eyelash appearance - lush, not phony - PLEASE</li>
            <li>As much as I enjoy your spokesperson (Pink) and would probably buy something that she endorses</li>
            <li>However, this stuff is pretty flaky and requires multiple applications to really fill out my lashes.</li>
            <li>I got the results that would normally require a lash</li>
            <li>It goes on great and makes my lashes look thick and long.</li>
            <li>Most mascaras will leave my eyelashes feeling heavy and gummy and sticky.  </li>
            <li>I almost never have to worry about clumps and they make my lashes look nice and thick.</li>
            <li>The price is right, especially if you can take advantage of additional discounts with subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>It seemed to get &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; quicker than other brands, meaning it got sticky and didn&#x27;t go on as smooth.</li>
            <li>But for extreme definition and lift, this mascara is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have been using a prescription product to lengthen and thicken my eyelashes (Latisse), and Clump Crusher brings my \\&quot;new eyelashes\\&quot; to deliciously-long proportions.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research for a new mascara.</li>
            <li>but after trying this new Clump Crusher Mascara</li>
            <li>I now have a new favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you want some natural lashes, then buy this product but if you want full long lashes then this one might not be the one for you.</li>
            <li>I do have long lashes and pretty much</li>
            <li>When applied, it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>My first use of the product was rather laughable - far too much product came out on first use, resulting in far too many clumps for a &#x27;clump crusher&#x27; mascara.</li>
            <li>This mascara is the first that I could actually apply to my lower lashes (with ease!)</li>
            <li>Even a brand-new tube works great, instead of the gloppy mess you usually get.</li>
            <li>U easialy can get a natural look and evening drama!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already bought a second tube to use when the first runs out.</li>
            <li>I would be more likely to use this if the brush was different and I&#x27;m not a big fan of water proof mascara.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve heard her say she didn&#x27;t like such a product</li>
            <li>True, it goes on clump-free, but there&#x27;s not much volume or length building.</li>
            <li>Just clean it with rubbing alcohol every now and then and use it instead of whatever wand you find inside any other mascara you are using, which you shouldn&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li>I recently entered a more professional career and daily basic make up</li>
            <li>The curvy shape of the brush makes it easy to apply with just a few strokes.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is in an easy to see, green container.</li>
            <li>without making a huge mess of the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>clump as much as some other mascaras (the covergirl exact eyelights and maybeline Volum&#x27; Express One)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will certainly keep buying it in the future.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly with little to no clumping</li>
            <li>My lashes are evenly coated and clearly separated every time.</li>
            <li>I switched from an department brand to this based on a recommendation and I am pleasantly surprised at the quality.</li>
            <li>I prefer natural, feathery-looking lashes, and this does the job.</li>
            <li>have bought three additional so far.</li>
            <li>When it is time to wash it off at the end of the day, it rinses completely with water and a washcloth.  </li>
            <li>This one so far is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>The mascara did start to flake after a couple hours of use after the tube was a couple months old, but by then it&#x27;s time to replace the tube for sanitary reasons anyway.</li>
            <li>You can use 1 or 2 coats to make them look natural &amp; 3-5 coats to make them look thicker &amp; blacker.</li>
            <li>The wand is curved, so I&#x27;ll call it concave and convex for the the respective side of the wand.</li>
            <li>Looks Fairly Natural and curls.</li>
            <li>Product lasts a complete working day.</li>
            <li>Straight brushes can be tricky because they reach only a portion of the lashes.</li>
            <li>The brush separates each lush.  </li>
            <li>The review on Amazon from a man who puts mascara on his wife because her hands shake too much was enough for me to buy it.  </li>
            <li>No flaking all day and my lashes are as soft as if I were not wearing mascara.</li>
            <li>but so far haven&#x27;t found it.</li>
            <li>It gives my eyelashes lots of length and volume and to my complete amazement...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and wear contact lenses and can even sleep in this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I change my mascara tube each month, tossing away the old one, but I think sometimes the stock here can be old.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t express strongly enough how much I dislike it.</li>
            <li>I just wish it had the wow factor of my waterproof.  </li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look longer and thicker but still natural.</li>
            <li>Granted, Benefit&#x27;s product has more body, but the same can be achieved with Covergirl&#x27;s mascara after a few applications.</li>
            <li>It is also not as thick or clumpy as many waterproof mascaras tend to be.</li>
            <li>My eye lashes were nicely defined, darkened, and just thick enough.  </li>
            <li>My old go to was Benefit&#x27;s Bad Gal Lash, but it was becoming a more costly purchase with my new job</li>
            <li>They are very long and pretty lush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and it really clumps less than most other mascaras!</li>
            <li>mascara is smooth and somewhat glossy in Brown and matte in Very Black.</li>
            <li>Not crazy like some other Covergirl or Maybelline, or Loreal mascaras can be, but WITHOUT CLUMPS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had previously been using CoverGirl Lash Exact for my first coat; then Maybelline Falsies for the second coat.</li>
            <li>Length-wise, this is only decent.</li>
            <li>The shape of the brush allows for quick and even application even at the more difficult to reach areas: the inner and outer corners, the lower lashes.</li>
            <li>not perfectly clump free, but not bad.</li>
            <li>I have pale, thin, unattractive lashes and these make mine look beautiful</li>
            <li>It even helps elongate lashes which is definitely a major plus!</li>
            <li>I would must rather buy this mascara because it makes my lashes long with no clumps and at a reasonable price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It applies evenly without much clumping as long as you kept the brush moving.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty straightforward mascara that will coat your lashes without causing any clumps or leaving behind chunks of mascara that you need to brush or pick out with a needle.</li>
            <li>Nice and black but maybe a little more thin</li>
            <li>I think Clump Crusher is kind of a stupid name, but this is fantastic for maximizing the length of my lashes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump at all and gives you long pretty lashes that last and do not crumble.  </li>
            <li>I have short, thin lashes and this wand has a way of bringing out what I have and builds my lashes up nicely.  </li>
            <li>I would only recommend the Brown for extremely fair, light blondes or perhaps strawberry blondes with pale, pale lashes who are interested in a casual, natural look.</li>
            <li>If your lashes are so sparse you look like Minnie Mouse, buy artificial lashes or, even better, get them individually applied by a make up artist for special occasions.</li>
            <li>I expected more from this mascara, but it turned out to be plain no &amp;#34;special effects&amp;#34; like volume or length.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dark (love the black</li>
            <li>this does mean it is easy to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I actually like this better than a few of the higher priced brands, but must state that I don&#x27;t wear contacts, so am not sure how it would work for those who do.</li>
            <li>Recently the department store brand mascara was been making my eyes itch and turn red, brand new out of the box!</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a go based on the other positive reviews</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump, and it curls &amp; lengthens my lashes just enough to still have a natural look to them.  </li>
            <li>My only issue is that sometimes the mascara does in fact clump - if the mascara is too old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but not great, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>I also like that it&#x27;s not a super skinny curved brush, but a little more substantial.</li>
            <li>This gives the right amount of lengthening and thickening, even if you put it on with a heavy hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, I ordered black and was sent brown.</li>
            <li>so it wants to fall over, and angled at the other end</li>
            <li>Compared to other drugstore mascaras this doesn&#x27;t clump as much.</li>
            <li>As the name suggests, the brush works very well for eliminating clumps and separating lashes, which always seems to  be an issue with other mascaras.  </li>
            <li>It does what it says it will do, smudges very little, and looks natural and pretty on.</li>
            <li>and I can apply it in the morning before work and then at 7 pm reapply a coat for a more dramatic effect before going out to dinner.</li>
            <li>can go from daytime to a more dramatic look by layering the mascara on, and there are truly no clumps.</li>
            <li>My lashes stuck together so much that I spent a ridiculous amount of time using a lash comb trying to clean them up.</li>
            <li>When your bold enough to name a product clump crusher, ya leave us w wild thoughts of no more clumps!</li>
            <li>On the down side, though, this mascara left my lashes far mor stiff and straight than they normally are, enough so that I needed to use a lash curler for my lashes to look even vaguely normal.</li>
            <li>It dries really fast and the short hard plastic bristles on the brush don&#x27;t disperse much product.</li>
            <li>Despite its claims, it did actually clump... and flake... and generally disappeared throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I usually ended up just removing it right after applying because I didn&#x27;t like the way it looked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small on one end and top heavy</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was a devoted fan of Covergirl&#x27;s Lashblast Volume (in the orange tube) as it gave my lashes the fullest look for the best price, but I always had issues with a coating of flakes beneath my eyes before the day was even up!</li>

            <li> But it&#x27;s fairly long-lasting through out the day.</li>
            <li> This is a good mascara for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best CG mascara I&#x27;ve found since I couldn&#x27;t find the original Marathon anymore.</li>
            <li> And you get the most beautiful lash shape.</li>
            <li> The mascara&#x27;s SUPER and the Cover Girl (vs Lancome) price is awesome.  </li>

            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love my lashes after using this!</li>
            <li> If someone cries a lot make sure it is water resistant!</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied!</li>
            <li> Love It!  </li>
            <li> And for the price, you will not get a better value for your buck!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> Okay !</li>
            <li> I really do love this mascara!</li>
            <li> Amazing length and volume.</li>
            <li> mascara is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing amazing</li>
            <li> There were no clumps and it gives nice coverage.</li>
            <li> The brush is nice too, keeps from clumping.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely even with one coat.</li>
            <li> No clumps, no spiky lashes with blunt ends, no globs on the lower lashes, just nice separation and length.  </li>
            <li> It crushes clumps and provides nice even coverage while making my eyelashes look longer.</li>
            <li> but it still kind of clumped.</li>
            <li> :) I would reccomend to anyone looking for a good and inexpensive mascara.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump, but it&#x27;s also nothing spectacular.  </li>
            <li> The wand is nice and the mascara lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> The color was good and it lasted most of the day.</li>
            <li> , I couldnt believe how easy was to apply it on my lower eye lashes and no clumps either, cant say is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used but its pretty good....</li>
            <li> good for application to lower lasters, the shape of the brush just isn&#x27;t as easy on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t waterproof for those who prefer waterproof mascara; it does come off very easily when washing your face.</li>
            <li> and this is way better than most mascara&#x27;s I&#x27;ver tried!</li>
            <li> Brush is great for fanning out lashes and does exactly what it claims, builds non-clumpy volume!</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve been wearing this for 2 days now and I am loving it.  </li>
            <li> It does not smudge, the color is nice, and I&#x27;m surprisingly pleased.</li>
            <li> Normally I would need to see many reviews and wasn&#x27;t that impressed with her lashes.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara of all time - and I&#x27;ve tried many, many varieties!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it does not clump up, and it goes on very easily and does coat each and every lash, just as it says it does.  </li>
            <li> Great mascara, reasonable price!</li>
            <li> provide the appearance of great volume and length to lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Is not water proof, as I found out on first use but</li>
            <li> This mascara is pretty great.  </li>
            <li> - just full, gorgeous lashes.  </li>
            <li> I love the mascara and the shipping was very quick!</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and evenly with no clumps at all.</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments and questions about what I&#x27;m doing to my lashes ever since I switched to this holy grail mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> So glad I did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap risk!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> and I love that about it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but the brand is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li> Pay attention, cause we gals are on a budget most of the time.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> Cover Girl has always been better than the rest.</li>
            <li> For years, I used my favorite, a mascara by Lancome.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of mascara.</li>
            <li> You will really love this wand…</li>
            <li> They can get product gooped on it, but just make sure you scrape some off on the rim before applying.</li>
            <li> So much better than the falsies mascara.</li>
            <li> so this product does make them more noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Make sure that you are deciding that you don&#x27;t want water resistant mascara.</li>
            <li> Will buy more.</li>
            <li> This was one of the mascaras that ranked in the top 5.</li>
            <li> I found another way better &amp; cheaper</li>
            <li> Felt like I had to keep adding more</li>
            <li> I guess I need to look for something that will add more volume and body to my lashes.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara ever.</li>
            <li> Just so you know, the best is the basic mascara made by ColoreScience.</li>
            <li> , it has an interesting angle and the bristles sweep away a lot of excess product when you brush it on.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it gave my lashes 200% more volume though, which is why I am giving it four stars instead of five.</li>
            <li> so I did not expect fabulous lashes since I&#x27;ve lost them, but the mascara goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> It is because of this innovative brush that I would recommend this mascara over [[ASIN:B0018QE47</li>
            <li> Over time, the brush has started to work better as the mascara has become more evenly distributed on the brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible but it could be much better.</li>
            <li> Hope you get a better experience out of this item than I did.</li>
            <li> does the trick, so  for me to put this product in a separate category, it has to deliver something more.  </li>
            <li> , it stays on all day, no clumps, and does not crumble or fall or leave marks on top lids.  </li>
            <li> (The easier it comes off, the better, for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> , I can buy this in more than one color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What is your favorite color?</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> the only reason i gave it 4 stars is becuase its not the best drugstore mascara i use.</li>
            <li> My favorite for years was Bobbi Brown&#x27;s Everything Mascara.</li>
            <li> but I love that there is no fallout.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> with many cosmetics, it takes time to find the ones that do what they say they will do.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for more volume, my mom happened to like it.</li>
            <li> Applies with precision, looks way better than the mega-brush products, and NO FLAKING, NO IRRITATION, even after all-day and all-evening out.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple weeks and love it.</li>
            <li> This was just an okay product to me.</li>
            <li> I have used many brands of mascara in all price ranges and I prefer these.  </li>
            <li> I also use the Lashblast Volume (Orange tube) and love it.  </li>
            <li> It took me a try or two to use it in such a way as to get the volume and length without the clumps, but once I figured it out, it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that leaves my lashes beautiful and clump-free!</li>
            <li> I am always on a quest for a mascara I love.</li>
            <li> but I love the end result.</li>
            <li> how many times I coat (provided</li>
            <li> That seems to happen with anything I really love.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently, my favorite mascara has been Cover Girl Lash Blast Volume (in the orange tube)</li>
            <li> A cheap product!</li>
            <li> This mascara is okay.</li>
            <li> Covergirl Clump Crusher Mascara is designed to give you the ideal length of a good mascara without the clumping, and that is exactly what it does, according to my 17 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly, this mascara really does work!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good mascara but tends to flake, which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not false-lash volume + length, but it&#x27;s pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s the highest reviewed drugstore mascara I&#x27;ve seen on Amazon) and it was worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Just be easy with it; you don&#x27;t need more than 2 coats.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, seems to catch most eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I love the shape of the wand because it makes it easy to get every eyelash on your eye.</li>
            <li> The convex side (bulging out?) is great for lengthening, and the concave is fantastic for bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> The brush is great at separating the lashes, making your lashes look very natural.</li>
            <li> Great so far!</li>
            <li> Very good product especially for a drug store mascara!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m betting this product might be a better fit for women with longer or curvier lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true - no clumps!</li>
            <li> It is also easy to wash off.  </li>
            <li> It is fairly easy to take off if it runs from water or accidental smears and comes off well at night.</li>
            <li> Clump Crusher goes on easily.</li>
            <li> It goes on well, and while the brush doesn&#x27;t magickally master clumps, it is easy to work with, and goes on evenly.</li>
            <li> but they can be easily combed out.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> Easy to use and get to those lashes in the corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also find it does not wash off easily, but that could be my choice in removers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does take some getting use to but the product is still easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> strong brush, and it doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> strong and scratchy.</li>
            <li> I love full lashes and this did not content me as well as I thought it should have I put on 2 coats</li>
            <li> Also if you flip the brush upside down it is perfect for your bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> This is a very good, well priced, every day mascara that is easy to apply, dries quickly and gives one&#x27;s lashes moderate volume and length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Washes off easily with cleanser and water, which is important for me with my contact lenses.</li>
            <li> About 3-4 hours into wearing it, it has smeared below my lashes, which is fine if you want that smokey, humid look.</li>
            <li> So if you apply quickly, I&#x27;d skip buying this and just go with lashblast, my all time favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a loyal \\&quot;Covergirl\\&quot; and this product exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> the clump looks very natural good color,great product would recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup expert by any means, but I didn&#x27;t feel the &amp;#34;clump crusher&amp;#34; claim was really accurate -</li>
            <li> It never clumps, adds great volume, and can actually get to each and every one of my lashes with it&#x27;s curved wand.</li>
            <li> Clump Crusher is truly a fantastic mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> Anyway, I found that it was very well liked among all the people who tried it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is precisely waterproof</li>
            <li> I rarely review on amazon, but I was so pleased  </li>
            <li> It makes lashes look amazing and it lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> It goes on lightly with no clumps..</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll get volume without your eyelashes clumping together, and the enjoy the added benefit that your mascara won&#x27;t flake off or smudge during the day.</li>
            <li> So, this mascara goes on smoothly, it makes lashes thicker and longer</li>
            <li> I might buy it again because it&#x27;s fairly cheap.</li>
            <li> it goes on smoothly with the brush and doesn&#x27;t clump on my lashes.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s too fat in diameter to fit in the openings of my makeup case.  </li>
            <li> I was using the &#x27;Falsies&#x27; and was happy with the product, but this one was a bit different.  </li>
            <li> fantastic lashes.</li>
            <li> It does not clump and it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> The brush allows the mascara to be applied lightly.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff, natural looking, it does what it says - no clumps.</li>
            <li> True, no clumps easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> However, this is not an ideal mascara for someone looking for extreme volume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara the past week or so, and the nice thing is that it has not clumped, so that is great.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t clump very easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the hunt for the perfect mascara - one that doesn&#x27;t leave smudges or flake or dry out fast -</li>
            <li> WELL WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s always better to do the curling first.</li>
            <li> The applicator doesn&#x27;t get all clumped up with eyelashes and mascara--it stays clean, somehow.  </li>
            <li> While you won&#x27;t need to touch up the mascara, itself, during the day, you will need to clean up where it has smeared.</li>
            <li> The brush is really good not your typical super bristly kind.  </li>
            <li> It stays on all day but comes off cleanly with my makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I think this mascara is a good deal, easy to use whether you use make up often or only occasionally, and is fairly foolproof.</li>
            <li> It was kind of a pain using two different mascaras, but I liked features of both of them - the plastic brush of Lash Exact and the curve of Falsies.</li>
            <li> Use the convex on your upper lashes to define them easily, and the concave on the bottom, for a great smudgeless application of the shorter bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s true there is no clumping with this mascara at all I love so much</li>
            <li> First of all I love the bright green packaging totally cute.</li>
            <li> I received a full tube of</li>
            <li> it is a good basic mascara for length.</li>
            <li> The only difference between this and my beloved lashblast is the brush.</li>
            <li> The no clump claim seems to be true, but this just doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes pop.</li>
            <li> The bristles are rubber and rather short, but a good amount of them.</li>
            <li> This is a very versatile and satisfying product.</li>
            <li> Good angled applicator- does not touch your upper lid.  </li>
            <li> But it is not clumping, they are true to their word about that point.</li>
            <li> This mascara is true to it&#x27;s name</li>
            <li> Especially when you consider the price, this is a really good mascara that delivers just what</li>
            <li> I use my Buxom Lash for more drama when I really do my eyes up.</li>
            <li> so I was kind of surprised when she said she didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is billed as a no clump product, and I have found that to be true.  </li>
            <li> I know that so many women like that very famous brand of mascara that comes in the pink tube</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on smooth or coat the lashes easily, so you can&#x27;t get much length with this mascara.</li>
            <li> mascara is an excellent choice if you are interested in natural looking lashes with moderate volume and length.</li>
            <li> A great product, and I find other mascaras to be a compromise.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t feel like it gives 200% more volume as the package states, it does a good job lengthening and defining lashes with literally no clumps whatsoever (and a little volume).  </li>
            <li> I love how I was able to find it on Amazon because I just wanted to try test new mascaras without having to pay too much money.</li>
            <li> You have to keep swiping your lashes with it, but since it dries so quickly, it starts clumping everywhere.</li>
            <li> The case is a fairly obnoxious lime green, but it fits in my rotating make-up organizer on my vanity, so I can&#x27;t ask for much more than that.  </li>
            <li> I have been a loyal buys of this product since it came out years ago.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so happy I finally found it and that it is reasonably priced at Amazon.com.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried so many types of mascaras and this is my favorite overall.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is better than a lot of the high end mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have heard a ton of good reviews about this mascara and let me say that every single one of them were right!</li>
            <li> On one hand, this mascara absolutely does what it says on the tin -- it did a far better job than most mascaras when it comes to the clumping issue.</li>
            <li> No clumping..goes on smooth and easy and makes your lashes look healthy and long.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Covergirl Clump Crusher to anyone - and Amazon.com sells it for such a great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> nice brush, nice shape, nice mascara... not much of a legnthener but great at making your lashes thick without clumping!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this new product and it worked fabulously!</li>
            <li> I have long lashes and this mascara is wonderful and definitely does not clump at all.</li>
            <li> I loved the curved brush, it seperated all my lashes and reached every single one.</li>
            <li> but this Covergirl Mascara has been my favorite thus far!</li>
            <li> 2nd favorite is NYX Doll Eye Mascara!</li>
            <li> Overall, I get better -- and quicker!</li>
            <li> , you can literally place the mascara exactly where you want it !</li>
            <li> I do like the bright green color, since that makes it easy to find in a purse.</li>
            <li> I originally tested the Brown which I found to be extremely, surprisingly light in color, even lighter than my normal lashes.</li>
            <li> mascara is amazing, especially considering how affordable it is.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This mascara is great at not clumping even if you re-apply a few times.  </li>
            <li> My favorite mascara before was from BareMinerals because my eyelashes looked natural but fuller with it.</li>
            <li> I did some simple research before I bought, so I will share them with you along with my own</li>
            <li> But if you want a more natural look with no clumps this is for you.</li>
            <li> This mascaras success is in the design of</li>
            <li> My lashes are nice and full, but not really WOW!</li>
            <li> my right eye as a LOT of extra eye lashes in one spot and this brush can&#x27;t handle that... but the Covergirl LashBlastLength can handle it nicely.</li>
            <li> I believe that there are many other mascara products by Covergirl that are far superior.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara for long very natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li> I like this but not as much as their original lashblast mascara.</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> He was right, it doesn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
            <li> I heard about this product on the Today Show and went right out and purchased it.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a generally good formula, but I do find that I need to be very careful not to overdo it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a ton in terms of volume or length, but it does give a very natural looking kick to your lashes and is easy to remove without scrubbing at your eyes with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> it comes off very easily with some generic make up</li>
            <li> It also makes my lashes feel very full and soft even after drying, unlike some that makes them feel like spikes.  </li>
            <li> The small, rubbery bristles do a great job of applying the mascara evenly.</li>
            <li> You want good, dark coloration and length without your lashes looking like spider legs?</li>
            <li> I also liked the fact that my lashes felt soft and supple - not stiff or sticky.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump, the brush is slightly arched for great application, and easy to take off with simple make up remover wipes.</li>
            <li> Those that have the white primer are great, but sometimes white is leftover, ugh.</li>
            <li> Very nice, takes a few coats, but it does lengthen and separate lashes well!  </li>
            <li> it is a very very inexpensive mascara that does a descent job.  </li>
            <li> Still has clumps, seems to dry more quickly and flake off.</li>
            <li> I do use lash primer by Loreal first and this mascara by Cover Girl</li>
            <li> and I will absolutely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> amazon has done it again, thanks!</li>
            <li> I gave this a 4 star rating because not only did this mascara not clump on my lashes, but I was able to reapply coats without getting my lashes stuck together.</li>
            <li> and I ended up buying more before this came in weeeeeks later.</li>
            <li> This mascara really is a clump crusher as the name suggests!  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> First off, it absolutely does clump!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to my favorite.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll switch it up next order! :)</li>
            <li> Use it on the inner lids top and bottom.</li>
            <li> Use it on the inner lids top and bottom.</li>
            <li> My current favorite \\&quot;dime store\\&quot; mascara is [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The product does exactly what it says...</li>
            <li> First off my tube of mascara says &#x27;water resistent&#x27; not waterproof.</li>
            <li> maybe I should try it with more coats and put it on a different way?</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product appears fresh.  </li>
            <li> I think you still need an eyelash comb (it&#x27;s a wee bit clumpy when it first goes on)</li>
            <li> but ultimately I think it helps me apply the mascara better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many others and always come back to this.</li>
            <li> I love mascara and use it daily and this brand is my go to.  </li>
            <li> I have used several much more pricey brands...</li>
            <li> I was able to apply multiple layers of this product and it truly did not clump.  </li>
            <li> It gives good definition, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I consider this the perfect casual or office mascara, as it gives lashes some definition without an overdone look.  </li>
            <li> I love the original Covergirl Lashblast in the orange tube but wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the large wand since I have small eyes and lashes, so I decided to try this one for the wand alone.</li>
            <li> I totally love this one, plus the color of the barrel is green which is easy to see when it&#x27;s in my purse.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless it does provide a great everyday natural lash look.</li>
            <li> The Lashblast line generally is good quality and got me away from more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> You get the same effects without the clumps, higher cost, or a special trip to the mall!  </li>
            <li> make up to be able to look good without working too hard on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Shaped like a smile or a wedge (thicker in the center and tapered at the ends), the brush is composed of many short plastic spikes that move easily through the lashes while depositing lots of pigment at the lash roots.</li>
            <li> It is the first mascara I have ever used that absolutely did not clump.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much lash paint and separator...</li>
            <li> For the past five or so years, I&#x27;ve been searching for a replacement that is as good as Lancome&#x27;s product.  </li>
            <li> I have very puny lashes and this mascara made my lashes look thick and amazing!  </li>
            <li> Application is easy, pull the applicator out of the tube and brush it on upper and lower lashes.  </li>
            <li> She wears mascara not for increasing apparent length but for \\&quot;definition\\&quot; and she was pleasently surprised at how well this product worked, and  how many compliments she received.  </li>
            <li> I think this mascara is a good deal, easy to use whether you use make up often or only occasionally, and is fairly foolproof.e inner eyelids, your eyes look smaller and harder.  </li>
            <li> I think the standard Maybelline Great Lash and Covergirl LashBlastLength beat this hands down.</li>
            <li> With the plethora of drugstore mascaras, there are certainly plenty of &amp;#34;fails&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> will purchase this again, and certainly would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews on this mascara.</li>
            <li> As a  regular fan of original lash blast, this one is an absolute winner!</li>
            <li> I really liked it, and I buy mascara at Macy&#x27;s ...who knew you could get so much for so little.  </li>
            <li> This really works and it was a dollar cheaper than it sells for in the store.  </li>
            <li> It also can really get my lower lashes well which is always a struggle.</li>
            <li> It is very pigmented as well and can really volumize my lashes without them looking spidery.</li>
            <li> This one is really a clump crusher.</li>
            <li> Really does volumize the lashes so much.</li>
            <li> It really, really doesn&#x27;t clump, lashes stay separated, and you can just keep applying until you get the effect you want.  </li>
            <li> and it really does not clump.  </li>
            <li> I have a real problem with raccoon eyes after hours of wearing mascara, even with powder under my eyes.</li>
            <li> The color of the tube is cute - green!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is not much to like about this product.  </li>
            <li> all while separating them &amp; really doesn&#x27;t leave any clumps!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> absolutely recommend this mascara if you&#x27;re not into the clumpy eyelash look.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara by Covergirl.</li>
            <li> Though not as much length and volume as I have anticipated for.</li>
            <li> Pro quality is that it stays on the whole day without smudging.</li>
            <li> &amp; IT REALLY DOES NOT CLUMP UP</li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t pull too much mascara out too</li>
            <li> I really like the way the curved brush fits the curve of the eyelashes</li>
            <li> Highly recommended !</li>
            <li> This mascara works very well and does not clump too much.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t want too much \\&quot;volume.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> So much so that I get mascara on my brow bone when I blink after application.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference in this and</li>
            <li> This product really does what it says.</li>
            <li> It thickens and lengthens as much as</li>
            <li> So, as always, I turned to Amazon.com because the reviews I find on their products help so much in deciding what to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> So just imagine how much it would enhance thicker fuller lashes.  </li>
            <li> and it really didn&#x27;t lengthen or thicken.</li>
            <li> I use it for during the day when I don&#x27;t have much makeup on.</li>
            <li> This is not the one to use, though, for a night out when you want a really \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; lash look.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> You get long, long lashes, no clumping, the wand is so good you should never throw it away.</li>
            <li> I find that this applies cleaner than most other mascaras I have tried</li>
            <li> The brush is unique, and is the reason that the product does not clump at all - even with multiple coats.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use any other mascara again</li>
            <li> the handle is wider than most other mascara&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> so me rating this as my second favorite is a pretty big deal.</li>
            <li> Compared to other products she has used she was expecting more from this Covergirl mascara.  </li>
            <li> and THEN it clumped a little, but normal use, no clumping, good for use with an eyelash curler, which I have to use, no black clumps on your curler.</li>
            <li> I need a mascara brush that is fine with bristles that aren&#x27;t too long or the mascara between the bristles never makes to my lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not left with dark residue under my eyes or on my pillowcase after a good night&#x27;s sleep.  </li>
            <li> (I have fair skin and dark blonde hair).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to all my friends, both in real life and online.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;d rather take no clumps and fast application over high volume and lengthened spider lashes.</li>
            <li> the way, I got a great tip from a make up artist:  If you use eyeliner on the inner eyelids, your eyes look smaller and harder.  </li>
            <li> Very ordinary and not worth the praise and fame obtained, there Mascara best of them, will not buy again Aaod</li>
            <li> Instead, use white or very light blue.</li>
            <li> Instead, use white or very light blue.</li>
            <li> mascara is an excellent choice if you are interested in natural looking lashes with moderate volume and length.only recommend the Brown for extremely fair, light blondes or perhaps strawberry blondes with pale, pale lashes who are interested in a casual, natural look.</li>
            <li> but after trying this it is now my new fave!  </li>
            <li> Love the black color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too keen on all the black dust that settles on the top of my cheeks after just a couple hours of wearing this stuff.</li>
            <li> Not very voluminizing but has a easy brush to use.</li>
            <li> The clumping is minimal and it goes on easy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not talking about rubbing my eyes or anything fierce, but just touching my lashes -- black flakes.</li>
            <li> It is not clump-free, but it is less clumpy than most mascara.</li>
            <li> This same mascara is sold at Walmart for 6.00 more for the same product, and I did not have to leave my house to get it!</li>
            <li> I have tried more than a few masscaras... and this one holds up very well.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be getting this particular one again.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s decent for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super picky about my mascara and have used the same brand forever</li>
            <li> I now use it for day, since it&#x27;s not very dramatic.</li>
            <li> K CoverGirl Lashblast Mascara, Very Black 800]], which is a very good, everyday</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for all.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried high end mascaras</li>
            <li> Of course, any mascara can clump, but this one is really nice about being hard to.</li>
            <li> I am surprised how much I like this Clump Crusher Mascara.  </li>
            <li> curved brush really improves application accuracy and eyelash appearance - lush, not phony - PLEASE</li>
            <li> As much as I enjoy your spokesperson (Pink) and would probably buy something that she endorses</li>
            <li> However, this stuff is pretty flaky and requires multiple applications to really fill out my lashes.</li>
            <li> I got the results that would normally require a lash</li>
            <li> It goes on great and makes my lashes look thick and long.</li>
            <li> Most mascaras will leave my eyelashes feeling heavy and gummy and sticky.  </li>
            <li> I almost never have to worry about clumps and they make my lashes look nice and thick.</li>
            <li> The price is right, especially if you can take advantage of additional discounts with subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> It seemed to get &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; quicker than other brands, meaning it got sticky and didn&#x27;t go on as smooth.</li>
            <li> But for extreme definition and lift, this mascara is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have been using a prescription product to lengthen and thicken my eyelashes (Latisse), and Clump Crusher brings my \\&quot;new eyelashes\\&quot; to deliciously-long proportions.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research for a new mascara.</li>
            <li> but after trying this new Clump Crusher Mascara</li>
            <li> I now have a new favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you want some natural lashes, then buy this product but if you want full long lashes then this one might not be the one for you.</li>
            <li> I do have long lashes and pretty much</li>
            <li> When applied, it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> My first use of the product was rather laughable - far too much product came out on first use, resulting in far too many clumps for a &#x27;clump crusher&#x27; mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara is the first that I could actually apply to my lower lashes (with ease!)</li>
            <li> Even a brand-new tube works great, instead of the gloppy mess you usually get.</li>
            <li> U easialy can get a natural look and evening drama!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already bought a second tube to use when the first runs out.</li>
            <li> I would be more likely to use this if the brush was different and I&#x27;m not a big fan of water proof mascara.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve heard her say she didn&#x27;t like such a product</li>
            <li> True, it goes on clump-free, but there&#x27;s not much volume or length building.</li>
            <li> Just clean it with rubbing alcohol every now and then and use it instead of whatever wand you find inside any other mascara you are using, which you shouldn&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li> I recently entered a more professional career and daily basic make up</li>
            <li> The curvy shape of the brush makes it easy to apply with just a few strokes.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is in an easy to see, green container.</li>
            <li> without making a huge mess of the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> clump as much as some other mascaras (the covergirl exact eyelights and maybeline Volum&#x27; Express One)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will certainly keep buying it in the future.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly with little to no clumping</li>
            <li> My lashes are evenly coated and clearly separated every time.</li>
            <li> I switched from an department brand to this based on a recommendation and I am pleasantly surprised at the quality.</li>
            <li> I prefer natural, feathery-looking lashes, and this does the job.</li>
            <li> have bought three additional so far.</li>
            <li> When it is time to wash it off at the end of the day, it rinses completely with water and a washcloth.  </li>
            <li> This one so far is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> The mascara did start to flake after a couple hours of use after the tube was a couple months old, but by then it&#x27;s time to replace the tube for sanitary reasons anyway.</li>
            <li> You can use 1 or 2 coats to make them look natural &amp; 3-5 coats to make them look thicker &amp; blacker.</li>
            <li> The wand is curved, so I&#x27;ll call it concave and convex for the the respective side of the wand.</li>
            <li> Looks Fairly Natural and curls.</li>
            <li> Product lasts a complete working day.</li>
            <li> Straight brushes can be tricky because they reach only a portion of the lashes.</li>
            <li> The brush separates each lush.  </li>
            <li> The review on Amazon from a man who puts mascara on his wife because her hands shake too much was enough for me to buy it.  </li>
            <li> No flaking all day and my lashes are as soft as if I were not wearing mascara.</li>
            <li> but so far haven&#x27;t found it.</li>
            <li> It gives my eyelashes lots of length and volume and to my complete amazement...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and wear contact lenses and can even sleep in this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I change my mascara tube each month, tossing away the old one, but I think sometimes the stock here can be old.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express strongly enough how much I dislike it.</li>
            <li> I just wish it had the wow factor of my waterproof.  </li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look longer and thicker but still natural.</li>
            <li> Granted, Benefit&#x27;s product has more body, but the same can be achieved with Covergirl&#x27;s mascara after a few applications.</li>
            <li> It is also not as thick or clumpy as many waterproof mascaras tend to be.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes were nicely defined, darkened, and just thick enough.  </li>
            <li> My old go to was Benefit&#x27;s Bad Gal Lash, but it was becoming a more costly purchase with my new job</li>
            <li> They are very long and pretty lush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and it really clumps less than most other mascaras!</li>
            <li> mascara is smooth and somewhat glossy in Brown and matte in Very Black.</li>
            <li> Not crazy like some other Covergirl or Maybelline, or Loreal mascaras can be, but WITHOUT CLUMPS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had previously been using CoverGirl Lash Exact for my first coat; then Maybelline Falsies for the second coat.</li>
            <li> Length-wise, this is only decent.</li>
            <li> The shape of the brush allows for quick and even application even at the more difficult to reach areas: the inner and outer corners, the lower lashes.</li>
            <li> not perfectly clump free, but not bad.</li>
            <li> I have pale, thin, unattractive lashes and these make mine look beautiful</li>
            <li> It even helps elongate lashes which is definitely a major plus!</li>
            <li> I would must rather buy this mascara because it makes my lashes long with no clumps and at a reasonable price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It applies evenly without much clumping as long as you kept the brush moving.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty straightforward mascara that will coat your lashes without causing any clumps or leaving behind chunks of mascara that you need to brush or pick out with a needle.</li>
            <li> Nice and black but maybe a little more thin</li>
            <li> I think Clump Crusher is kind of a stupid name, but this is fantastic for maximizing the length of my lashes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump at all and gives you long pretty lashes that last and do not crumble.  </li>
            <li> I have short, thin lashes and this wand has a way of bringing out what I have and builds my lashes up nicely.  </li>
            <li> I would only recommend the Brown for extremely fair, light blondes or perhaps strawberry blondes with pale, pale lashes who are interested in a casual, natural look.</li>
            <li> If your lashes are so sparse you look like Minnie Mouse, buy artificial lashes or, even better, get them individually applied by a make up artist for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I expected more from this mascara, but it turned out to be plain no &amp;#34;special effects&amp;#34; like volume or length.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dark (love the black</li>
            <li> this does mean it is easy to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I actually like this better than a few of the higher priced brands, but must state that I don&#x27;t wear contacts, so am not sure how it would work for those who do.</li>
            <li> Recently the department store brand mascara was been making my eyes itch and turn red, brand new out of the box!</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a go based on the other positive reviews</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump, and it curls &amp; lengthens my lashes just enough to still have a natural look to them.  </li>
            <li> My only issue is that sometimes the mascara does in fact clump - if the mascara is too old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but not great, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I also like that it&#x27;s not a super skinny curved brush, but a little more substantial.</li>
            <li> This gives the right amount of lengthening and thickening, even if you put it on with a heavy hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, I ordered black and was sent brown.</li>
            <li> so it wants to fall over, and angled at the other end</li>
            <li> Compared to other drugstore mascaras this doesn&#x27;t clump as much.</li>
            <li> As the name suggests, the brush works very well for eliminating clumps and separating lashes, which always seems to  be an issue with other mascaras.  </li>
            <li> It does what it says it will do, smudges very little, and looks natural and pretty on.</li>
            <li> and I can apply it in the morning before work and then at 7 pm reapply a coat for a more dramatic effect before going out to dinner.</li>
            <li> can go from daytime to a more dramatic look by layering the mascara on, and there are truly no clumps.</li>
            <li> My lashes stuck together so much that I spent a ridiculous amount of time using a lash comb trying to clean them up.</li>
            <li> When your bold enough to name a product clump crusher, ya leave us w wild thoughts of no more clumps!</li>
            <li> On the down side, though, this mascara left my lashes far mor stiff and straight than they normally are, enough so that I needed to use a lash curler for my lashes to look even vaguely normal.</li>
            <li> It dries really fast and the short hard plastic bristles on the brush don&#x27;t disperse much product.</li>
            <li> Despite its claims, it did actually clump... and flake... and generally disappeared throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I usually ended up just removing it right after applying because I didn&#x27;t like the way it looked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small on one end and top heavy</li>
            <li> The mascara itself is a good consistency, not too thick nor too thin.</li>
            <li> I got so mad at the several mascara&#x27;s in my make-up case that were supposedly clump-free but left huge clumps on my eyelashes that I had to spend an extra 10 minutes each morning brushing the darn clumps out (who wants to present themselves to the world with gobs of mascara caking their eyelashes!?????).  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s slightly curved and fits the curve of the lashline to get all of the lashes easily, even the hard to get inside ones.</li>
            <li> Definitely my favorite and will work with whatever look I&#x27;m going for whether it&#x27;s natural everyday makeup or dramatic &amp;#34;I&#x27;m going out&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Dark enough for my taste but still clearly brown.</li>
            <li> Good thing for me, since I usually love to wear lots of mascara but hate those little globs you have to slowly remove with a cotton swab.</li>
            <li> &quot;, the ability to apply multiple coats one over the other was not a problem as long as the mascara had not dried fully.</li>
            <li> When you go back to do the middle and other end, some lashes end up with too little, some too much mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long, blonde eyelashes &amp; this</li>
            <li> I CAN say that it is long lasting.</li>
            <li> My only criticism is minor-</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m not sure if this is a negative, but it does seem to take a while (longer than most) to dry.</li>
            <li> The problem I&#x27;ve found is that each tube does not last very long if you like to have a full-lash look.  </li>
            <li> I have blonde sparse lashes that aren&#x27;t very long.</li>
            <li> I usually use Covergirl&#x27;s \\&quot;professional\\&quot; mascara, and although I don&#x27;t think it provides quite as much volume as this one does, it doesn&#x27;t flake or smear, no matter how long I wear it.</li>
            <li> cause the formula dries up quickly and worse</li>
            <li> I have long lashes and it makes them look extra flipped out and long!</li>
            <li> Made my eyelashes super long and thin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mascara&#x27;s can be expensive; especially when buying special types.  </li>
            <li> I will try almost any brand, from expensive (Chanel) to quite cheap (Maybelline).</li>
            <li> This mascara is no joke there is absolutely no clumps when applying, that being said, there&#x27;s no build up of the product so there is not extra volume at all.</li>
            <li> Makes me eyelashes long and separated.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look long and silky-</li>
            <li> and I have long lashes</li>
            <li> The clumps were minimal, but still present.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes thick and long and really pop.</li>
            <li> Only thing I say, seems to run out quicker than other mascaras.</li>
            <li> I may look for other Cover Girl mascara&#x27;s with a bit smaller brush.</li>
            <li> In addition, it is volumizing and, although not advertised to lengthen, lengths my short eyelashes extremely well.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful due to the rave reviews I read about this product on multiple websites.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t seemed to dry out my lashes (causing breakage) as some mascaras have.</li>
            <li> It is really lengthening but not very volumizing at least for me.</li>
            <li> Thin, short, &amp; straight downward.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t clump, looks greats on my eyes, and is in a cute little green container (as opposed to a black one which is hard to find in my makeup bag).</li>
            <li> I even put a little saline in it to try to soften up the formula a little (pinterest trick!), but it didn&#x27;t seem to help much.  </li>
            <li> The wand is curved, with a thinner inner side, to lay down product, and a fatter outer edge that can comb and separate lashes, not that they needed it.</li>
            <li> it colors and defines my lashes without thickening them too much, since I&#x27;m a little too old to pull off a dramatic super-huge-eyelash</li>
            <li> mascara stays on all day without flaking or ending up smeared under my eyes, and it washes off easily with soap and water or cold</li>
            <li> I kept finding black specs all around my eyes the entire day.</li>
            <li> But overall, it did what it was intended to do, turn my eyelashes black, with no clumps.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m a sucker for clever marketing, but I will always have a tube of this on-hand in addition to any other ones I try.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell the difference between black and very black, and v. black was cheaper</li>
            <li> thats a lot to say(always need to rescue my makeup with Q-tips because I simply can&#x27;t apply the mascara without a mess cuz my hands shake a lot)</li>
            <li> Item was dried up and didn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> am shocked at how much I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not real picky when it comes to mascara</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it and she tries all kinds of make-up.</li>
            <li> You have to put on two coats for darker eyelashes, but there are absolutely no clumps.</li>
            <li> I do use 3-4 applications while it&#x27;s still wet</li>
            <li> The look is very natural but still dramatic enough to see a difference.  </li>
            <li> Does tend to crumble after about 9 hours, but other than that, just as expected.  </li>
            <li> I have short eyelashes, so when I apply mascara, usually they clump up.</li>
            <li> not too much other make up.  </li>
            <li> But prepare to buy it twice as often as any other brand/type of mascara.</li>
            <li> The curve follows the curve of the eye, so one stroke goes from one end of the lid to the other.  </li>
            <li> and it has replaced all of my other mascaras (DiorShow, Givenchy)&lt;br /&gt;A must have.</li>
            <li> : I am quite specific in my mascara preferences and I usually don&#x27;t care for curved brushes.</li>
            <li> not exactly what I would call a \\&quot;Clump</li>
            <li> are some of the other Covergirl Mascara&#x27;s that you&#x27;ve tried?</li>
            <li> There are no clumps, it makes my lashes look longer than any other product I&#x27;ve tried, and it lasts.</li>
            <li> Of the dozens of mascaras I&#x27;ve purchased over the years, I decided to try this based upon other Amazon reviews.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll no doubt keep trying other mascaras because I can&#x27;t help myself</li>
            <li> Every other mascara I&#x27;ve tried does one or the other.</li>
            <li> If you wait a few minutes and let the mascara dry, you can use your lash curler...</li>
            <li> Also nothing gets rid of eyebags (I don&#x27;t mean temporary puffiness from staying up late or partying, but real undereye suitcases), so save your money for the surgery.</li>
            <li> Also nothing gets rid of eyebags (I don&#x27;t mean temporary puffiness from staying up late or partying, but real undereye suitcases), so save your money for the surgery.</li>
            <li> flake like some mascaras due (leaving dark circles below your bottom lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I do feel like it is less clumpy than other mascaras I have used</li>
            <li> but I did not think it was too dark at all</li>
            <li> It smudges during the day, I had dark rims under my eyes after work.</li>
            <li> I found the wand was too stiff and the mascara was very dry.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the odd shape of the container.  </li>
            <li> I will say that the only slight negative is that it doesn&#x27;t give a ton of volume/lift.  </li>
            <li> Clump Crusher is your product, hands down.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well!</li>
            <li> So begins my crazy extravengaze for the right</li>
            <li> tube is thick and chubby so it feels a little different in your hand.  </li>
            <li> experience is that this formula is drier than those of say, Loreal Voluminous Carbon Black.</li>
            <li> It goes on really well, not too thick or thin.</li>
            <li> I keep seeing a bunch of black flakes all around my eyes and cheeks after I put it on.  </li>
            <li> B004GHG8EK L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Million Lashes Mascara, Blackest Black]]</li>
            <li> Otherwise, for anyone else, I would not go lighter than the Black Brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise, for anyone else, I would not go lighter than the Black Brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you won&#x27;t end up with a mess.</li>
            <li> even a heated one, without creating a mess.</li>
            <li> With some other products, my eyes feel tired and heavy, but it doesn&#x27;t feel the same with this!</li>
            <li> mascara comes in four shades: Very Black, Black, Black Brown, and Brown.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t let coats dry in between, but that&#x27;s just common sense that you don&#x27;t do that).</li>
            <li> The one flaw is that after a few hours of wear, if I accidentally touch my lashes, the black mascara starts to flake off my lashes.</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used too if your not familiar with covergirl mascaras.</li>
            <li> BUT caffeine does temporarily provide a little bit of shrinkage.</li>
            <li> BUT caffeine does temporarily provide a little bit of shrinkage.</li>
            <li> THe brush has a ton of little prongs i guess you&#x27;d call them.</li>
            <li> any other mascara I have used in the past</li>
            <li> It also seems just a little sticky to me.</li>
            <li> I am still looking for an inexpensive mascara that doesn&#x27;t make lashes stick together, clump, or run if your eyes water a little, and that can add a little volume and length.</li>
            <li> This brush does that on the end bristles but then gets a little fat for me.</li>
            <li> As it claims, it adds volume and a little length without clumping.</li>
            <li> loves how it hold my curl and doesnt weigh my lashes down!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright, and very dark and makes my eyelashes look thicker.</li>
            <li> Soak cotton balls in cold coffee left from breakfast and place on the bags, lean back and relax for 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Soak cotton balls in cold coffee left from breakfast and place on the bags, lean back and relax for 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my lashes feel heavy either.</li>
            <li> A few years ago they changed it, and it&#x27;s never been on par, since.</li>
            <li> but it does the trick for everyday mascara.</li>
            <li> By comparable, I mean they both don&#x27;t clump, they both elongate and thicken, and they both have the same hard bristles.</li>
            <li> but I pay less!</li>
            <li> I do like the brush but am not sure if I will reorder in black.</li>
            <li> I was sent brown instead of my usual color black.</li>
            <li> Clump Crusher Very Black by Cover Girl Cosmetics to review for the Amazon Vine program.</li>
            <li> The color is very black</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara in Very Black (rather than Brown) and I have upgraded my opinion from 4 to 5 Stars.</li>
            <li> got it in the color very black.</li>
            <li> I have this in very black in water resistant.</li>
            <li> I found the brush a little hard to pull out of the tube</li>
            <li> As others have stated very little volume.</li>
            <li> All my mascara usually smears under my eyes after a while,giving me racoon eyes.</li>
            <li> However, it was $20 for a small one.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t thick and heavy if that is what you are looking for.  </li>
            <li> &quot; look isn&#x27;t what I usually go for.....</li>
            <li> If you have thin lashes, this will emphasize lashes by darkness (I bought Very Black) and slight thickness.</li>
            <li> Even 1 coat would suffice, or else your eyelashes will get very stiff.</li>
            <li> This mascara separates the lashes well, but it&#x27;s very stiff going on and hurts my lashes and eyelids when I apply it.  </li>
            <li> The wand has very stiff ridges that comb through your lashes as you apply it.  </li>
            <li> Cover Girl Clump Crusher Mascara completely avoids those bad feelings.  </li>
            <li> Once dried, the mascara would clump somewhat when a fresh coat was applied.....not terrible but</li>
            <li> will, at least for a while, be using this product again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that the brush isn&#x27;t some gimmick-y contraption like alot of the wands being introduced lately.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump and goes on thick.</li>
            <li> you are looking for thick volume, this probably isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> make them look even longer, curls them &amp; makes them look thick</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have naturally thick lashes</li>
            <li> How thick should your eyelash be before you start looking like Tammy Faye Baker.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this due to all the hype, but was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I probably would go with a less expensive brand next time, but this isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical since &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; mascara tends to make a lot of claims with little results.</li>
            <li> Too bad the commercial didn&#x27;t match the product.</li>
            <li> This lets me use a few coats to get the thickness I want without the creepy clumpy spider leg lash look.</li>
            <li> Worse than any I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> The bristles are stuff and if you like to start at the base of your lashes, it actually hurts.</li>
            <li> I worked a 14 hour day and was too exhausted to take off my make up before hitting the sack, when I woke up in the morning</li>
            <li> It does not clump like my department store brand and it doesn&#x27;t have the ingredient that was irritating my eyes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not great for getting inside the corners of your eyes.</li>
            <li> If you rub your eyes then it&#x27;s not great to use on your bottom lashes because the product flakes off.</li>
            <li> A lot of times people think I am wearing false eyelashes when all I have on is mascara.  </li>
            <li> It makes it feel a bit awkward in my small hand</li>
            <li> I found it to be horrible and didn&#x27;t at all live up to it&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li> Tip: To prevent nasty build up on your falsies, apply this mascara over your fake lashes to blend them in with the real ones with out clumping them together.</li>
            <li> YOu get a little flaking and flecking, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I hate, hate, hate mascara that clumps and leaves lashes feeling sticky or gummy and that particular brand always left my lashes feeling that way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike the other fat wand CG mascaras, I also didn&#x27;t poke myself in the eye trying to reach the base of my lashes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to any mascara-lover who is sick and tired of clumpy, awful mascara.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrendous, mind you, but still annoying as I expect my mascara to stay on even if I touch my eyes a little bit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just unfortunate that mine lasted about a month before drying out.</li>
            <li> There are some really expensive mascaras out there</li>
            <li> It is rather difficult for me to put on my bottom lashes (the brush hits my skin)</li>
            <li> But even four layers didn&#x27;t make my lashes stumpy or weird.</li>
            <li> purchased it because out of all the expensive mascaras I buy, my one issue with them all is that they clump!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I noticed it flaking as others noted, but it does migrate, one way or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no perfect mascara.</li>
            <li> tried the water resistant version of this however, and I feel it might have been the wrong packaging.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use this if you&#x27;re going to watch a sad movie!&lt;br /&gt;Impressed with the curved brush as this is the means of \\&quot;clump crushing\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Cover Girl products because they work well and aren&#x27;t overly expensive.  </li>
            <li> The formula is thin, so if your looking for crazy volume, this isn&#x27;t going to deliver.  </li>
            <li> However, she was not impressed with the product.  </li>
            <li> Weird,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always afraid of getting spider lashes when I use mascara, but didn&#x27;t have that problem with Clump Crusher.</li>
            <li> I always got clumps each time I applied, which was disappointing given the marketing claims.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this mascara!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically impossible to clump.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all around a bad formula and bad brush design.</li>
            <li> but this one was bad for me.</li>
            <li> The bad part about this type of brush is you cannot roll it over into your eyelashes</li>
            <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t clump,smear,run, or anything bad.</li>
            <li> and when I took off the mascara the beautician was shocked and insisted on knowing what product I was using on my lashes as she had never seen a mascara that lengthened so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> Because of the clumps, when I blinked after applying, the mascara would get on my bottom lid, which was really annoying.</li>
            <li> I hate clumps, and this mascara didn&#x27;t clump at all.</li>
            <li> I would rank it #1.</li>
            <li> I HATE clumps</li>
            <li> I hate this product!</li>
            <li> used to use the Maybelline falsies nascar which is terrible compared to this mascara.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Started flaking almost as soon as I put it on. I kept finding black specs all around my eyes the entire day. Never again.</li>
            <li> This really works and it was a dollar cheaper than it sells for in the store.  It is the first mascara I have ever used that absolutely did not clump.  I like that I can wear mascara without it LOOKING like mascara.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever tried! It never clumps, adds great volume, and can actually get to each and every one of my lashes with it&#x27;s curved wand. It also can really get my lower lashes well which is always a struggle. I highly recommend this for all. It is very pigmented as well and can really volumize my lashes without them looking spidery. I have received many compliments and questions about what I&#x27;m doing to my lashes ever since I switched to this holy grail mascara. Definitely my favorite and will work with whatever look I&#x27;m going for whether it&#x27;s natural everyday makeup or dramatic &amp;#34;I&#x27;m going out&amp;#34; makeup. You have to give this one a try!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump and goes on thick. I have very short eyelashes and this is way better than most mascara&#x27;s I&#x27;ver tried!</li>
            <li> I watched a vlog on uTube regarding this mascara.  The person raved about it and said it was her go to mascara.  Normally I would need to see many reviews and wasn&#x27;t that impressed with her lashes.  Go figure...I took the risk because the price was EXCELLENT!  The mascara is excellent and believe me, I am picky.  I do use lash primer by Loreal first and this mascara by Cover Girl is awesome.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS MASCARA! I have heard a ton of good reviews about this mascara and let me say that every single one of them were right! This is the best mascara I have used and I will absolutely be buying this again! WELL WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> This same mascara is sold at Walmart for 6.00 more for the same product, and I did not have to leave my house to get it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always afraid of getting spider lashes when I use mascara, but didn&#x27;t have that problem with Clump Crusher. There were no clumps and it gives nice coverage. Doesn&#x27;t make my lashes feel heavy either.</li>
            <li> I love this. I have never purchased makeup online. So glad I did. This has great coverage and no clumps.</li>
            <li> I switched from an department brand to this based on a recommendation and I am pleasantly surprised at the quality. The wand is a great design and the product holds up to the name - no clumps. Impressive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup expert by any means, but I didn&#x27;t feel the &amp;#34;clump crusher&amp;#34; claim was really accurate - I always got clumps each time I applied, which was disappointing given the marketing claims. Because of the clumps, when I blinked after applying, the mascara would get on my bottom lid, which was really annoying. I usually ended up just removing it right after applying because I didn&#x27;t like the way it looked.</li>
            <li> I hate this product! It leaves a ton of clumps! I wouldn&#x60;t reccomend this product at all! And I paid $7.95 for this!</li>
            <li> I am surprised how much I like this Clump Crusher Mascara.  The brush is does not pick up a ton of mascara so you have to apply a couple of coats to make it stand out, but on the plus side you do NOT get clumps!  I find that this applies cleaner than most other mascaras I have tried and I find that with the price Amazon.com has (subscribe &amp; Save with coupon) it is a very very inexpensive mascara that does a descent job.  I recommend giving it a shot.  It&#x27;s a cheap risk!</li>
            <li> Clump crusher. Seriously. Purchase this product. I went in to get eyelash extensions and when I took off the mascara the beautician was shocked and insisted on knowing what product I was using on my lashes as she had never seen a mascara that lengthened so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Benefit&#x27;s &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real!&amp;#34; to thicken the lash then this to lengthen. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> love this product! CG mascara rocks, never clumpy, goes on great, stays put, keeps me looking fab!  good purchase over all, fair price, came on time, satisfied by my purchase once again.  amazon has done it again, thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. I do feel like it is less clumpy than other mascaras I have used and I love that about it. It&#x27;s become one of my favorites!!</li>
            <li> This mascara leaves NO clumps.  I do not even have to scrape excess off the brush.  The curvy shape of the brush makes it easy to apply with just a few strokes.  It is also easy to wash off.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> All my mascara usually smears under my eyes after a while,giving me racoon eyes. This one doesn&#x27;t. Love it. The brush is nice too, keeps from clumping.</li>
            <li> Very nice, takes a few coats, but it does lengthen and separate lashes well!  It is also not as thick or clumpy as many waterproof mascaras tend to be.</li>
            <li> This is a good mascara. The bottle squeezes the brush so that there are no clumps.  I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Clump Crusher is truly a fantastic mascara. The brush is unique, and is the reason that the product does not clump at all - even with multiple coats. This mascara is the first that I could actually apply to my lower lashes (with ease!) without making a huge mess of the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for thick volume, this probably isn&#x27;t for you. You want good, dark coloration and length without your lashes looking like spider legs? Clump Crusher is your product, hands down. Highly recommend to all my friends, both in real life and online.</li>
            <li> I have short eyelashes, so when I apply mascara, usually they clump up. This one is really a clump crusher. My favorite mascara before was from BareMinerals because my eyelashes looked natural but fuller with it. However, it was $20 for a small one. This one also does the same but I pay less! I totally love this one, plus the color of the barrel is green which is easy to see when it&#x27;s in my purse.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 4 star rating because not only did this mascara not clump on my lashes, but I was able to reapply coats without getting my lashes stuck together. It&#x27;s just unfortunate that mine lasted about a month before drying out.</li>
            <li> There are some really expensive mascaras out there but this Covergirl Mascara has been my favorite thus far! I would must rather buy this mascara because it makes my lashes long with no clumps and at a reasonable price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for anyone on a budget!!</li>
            <li> I should of just went to the store and bought it, because this took forever to get and I ended up buying more before this came in weeeeeks later. but the brand is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara for long very natural looking lashes. This mascara is no joke there is absolutely no clumps when applying, that being said, there&#x27;s no build up of the product so there is not extra volume at all. If you want some natural lashes, then buy this product but if you want full long lashes then this one might not be the one for you. Tip: To prevent nasty build up on your falsies, apply this mascara over your fake lashes to blend them in with the real ones with out clumping them together.</li>
            <li> Covergirl Clump crusher mascara is great does not clump at all. Only thing I say, seems to run out quicker than other mascaras.</li>
            <li> Great so far! Really does volumize the lashes so much. With some other products, my eyes feel tired and heavy, but it doesn&#x27;t feel the same with this!</li>
            <li> Item was dried up and didn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a while for a product that actually coated my lashes evenly with product without clumps or spider lashes... This product is amazing at just that! However, this is not an ideal mascara for someone looking for extreme volume. I would recommend using Maybelline&#x27;s The Rocket mascara for okay separation and great volume!</li>
            <li> This mascara really is a clump crusher as the name suggests!  No mess and beautifully applies on the eyelashes with the perfect volume.</li>
            <li> Yes, there are no clumps!  I really liked it, and I buy mascara at Macy&#x27;s ...who knew you could get so much for so little.  Pay attention, cause we gals are on a budget most of the time. ;)</li>
            <li> Good stuff, natural looking, it does what it says - no clumps. I prefer natural, feathery-looking lashes, and this does the job. My favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews on this mascara. I found it to be horrible and didn&#x27;t at all live up to it&#x27;s name. First off, it absolutely does clump! It dries really fast and the short hard plastic bristles on the brush don&#x27;t disperse much product. You have to keep swiping your lashes with it, but since it dries so quickly, it starts clumping everywhere. It also crumbles and flakes onto your face throughout the day. It doesn&#x27;t go on smooth or coat the lashes easily, so you can&#x27;t get much length with this mascara. It&#x27;s all around a bad formula and bad brush design. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this one again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not real picky when it comes to mascara but this one was bad for me. After wearing it for only a couple hours it begins to flake. Worse than any I&#x27;ve ever tried. I gave it a couple weeks but I&#x27;ve had enough. I&#x27;m going back to my favorite. &amp;#34;If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it&amp;#34;. When will I learn? LOL</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I agree that this is the best mascara we have ever used.  It really, really doesn&#x27;t clump, lashes stay separated, and you can just keep applying until you get the effect you want.  Even a brand-new tube works great, instead of the gloppy mess you usually get. I only wish I could stock up enough to last me the rest of my life, because I&#x27;m scared to death they will change or discontinue it!</li>
            <li> I like this mascara a lot.  Love the black color and it really does not clump.  Handle is bulky but I do not find it to be an issue.  I like the curved brush too.  Will buy again - have bought three additional so far.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, it doesn&#x27;t clump (until well after the expiration date, anyway). However, this stuff is pretty flaky and requires multiple applications to really fill out my lashes. I&#x27;m not too keen on all the black dust that settles on the top of my cheeks after just a couple hours of wearing this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have a real problem with raccoon eyes after hours of wearing mascara, even with powder under my eyes. Cover Girl has always been better than the rest. I used to use the orange one, now I&#x27;m hooked on this one. Goes on nicely even with one coat. Washes off easily with cleanser and water, which is important for me with my contact lenses.</li>
            <li> This product does meet the promise of no clumps.  However, the volume isn&#x27;t quite the 200x promised.  The brush does a good job of separating lashes.  Not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I received a full tube of Clump Crusher Very Black by Cover Girl Cosmetics to review for the Amazon Vine program. In my 56 years, I&#x27;ve used a lot of mascara:  different colors, different brands, expensive-to-cheap, curling, thickening, waterproof, etc., etc., etc.  For years, I used my favorite, a mascara by Lancome.  It is no longer made.  For the past five or so years, I&#x27;ve been searching for a replacement that is as good as Lancome&#x27;s product.  I think I&#x27;ve found it.  Clump Crusher (which is a name a teenager would have come up with!) works beautifully from application to removal.  Application is easy, pull the applicator out of the tube and brush it on upper and lower lashes.  Since the applicator is curved, you need to apply it \\&quot;with\\&quot; the curve, not against it.  The applicator doesn&#x27;t get all clumped up with eyelashes and mascara--it stays clean, somehow.  As I apply the mascara, I can see that the product is lengthening my eyelashes, and I am impressed with how separated my eyelashes remain.  No clumps, no spiky lashes with blunt ends, no globs on the lower lashes, just nice separation and length.  I have been using a prescription product to lengthen and thicken my eyelashes (Latisse), and Clump Crusher brings my \\&quot;new eyelashes\\&quot; to deliciously-long proportions.  How wonderful!  The product stays on all day.  No flakes, no raccoon eyes, no smudges underneath my lower lid.  When it is time to wash it off at the end of the day, it rinses completely with water and a washcloth.  I&#x27;m not left with dark residue under my eyes or on my pillowcase after a good night&#x27;s sleep.  The case is a fairly obnoxious lime green, but it fits in my rotating make-up organizer on my vanity, so I can&#x27;t ask for much more than that.  The mascara&#x27;s SUPER and the Cover Girl (vs Lancome) price is awesome.  I recommend this mascara to those who like lengthening and separation.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. Wonderful, no clumps. My daughter loves it and she tries all kinds of make-up. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> The title says it all. This is a pretty straightforward mascara that will coat your lashes without causing any clumps or leaving behind chunks of mascara that you need to brush or pick out with a needle. It doesn&#x27;t do a ton in terms of volume or length, but it does give a very natural looking kick to your lashes and is easy to remove without scrubbing at your eyes with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> When your bold enough to name a product clump crusher, ya leave us w wild thoughts of no more clumps! Lol Its an okay product and Id have no problem purchasing again...but it feels decent/average. I havent found that MY GO TO MASCARA PRODUCT yet.</li>
            <li> This is the mascara I&#x27;ve been using for a while.  Nice and black but maybe a little more thin that I like.  Maybe I&#x27;ll switch it up next order! :)</li>
            <li> Still has clumps, seems to dry more quickly and flake off.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve been wearing this for 2 days now and I am loving it.  I have 5 different mascara&#x27;s bc I wear mascara a lot but not too much other make up.  This one so far is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s cheap (almost always my #1 reason ha ha)&lt;br /&gt;2. It goes on smoothly with little to no clumping&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s dark (love the black brown)&lt;br /&gt;4. The color of the tube is cute - green!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is not much to like about this product.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;My 2nd favorite is NYX Doll Eye Mascara!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of mascara. I can&#x27;t really tell the difference between black and very black, and v. black was cheaper so I bought it. The mascara did start to flake after a couple hours of use after the tube was a couple months old, but by then it&#x27;s time to replace the tube for sanitary reasons anyway.</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing!!! I have long, blonde eyelashes &amp; this make them look even longer, curls them &amp; makes them look thick all while separating them &amp; really doesn&#x27;t leave any clumps!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend this mascara if you&#x27;re not into the clumpy eyelash look. You can use 1 or 2 coats to make them look natural &amp; 3-5 coats to make them look thicker &amp; blacker. Love this mascara!! &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use the Maybelline falsies nascar which is terrible compared to this mascara. You will really love this wand…</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara by Covergirl. It is a good, low-price mascara for daytime wear. However, this mascara is NOT going to be a plumper...it is a good basic mascara for length. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with clumping or with smudging with this mascara.</li>
            <li> The only difference between this and my beloved lashblast is the brush. The bristles are stuff and if you like to start at the base of your lashes, it actually hurts. A lot. So if you apply quickly, I&#x27;d skip buying this and just go with lashblast, my all time favorite.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to mascara! I&#x27;ve been using Clump Crusher for over a year and it&#x27;s great for me.  It doesn&#x27;t clump, and it curls &amp; lengthens my lashes just enough to still have a natural look to them.  (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a &amp;#34;falsies&amp;#34; look, this is not the mascara for you.</li>
            <li> No clumps as promised. Makes me eyelashes long and separated. Not very voluminizing but has a easy brush to use. Takes some getting used too if your not familiar with covergirl mascaras.</li>
            <li> I always loved Covergirl Mascara. They never clump! And you get the most beautiful lash shape. Just be easy with it; you don&#x27;t need more than 2 coats. Even 1 coat would suffice, or else your eyelashes will get very stiff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright, and very dark and makes my eyelashes look thicker. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily make them longer though!</li>
            <li> I have tried more than a few masscaras... and this one holds up very well. The brush is great at separating the lashes, making your lashes look very natural.</li>
            <li> The no clump claim seems to be true, but this just doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes pop. I won&#x27;t be getting this particular one again.</li>
            <li> This mascara Covergirl Clump Crusher does as advertised. Though not as much length and volume as I have anticipated for. Nonetheless it does provide a great everyday natural lash look.</li>
            <li> I expected more from this mascara, but it turned out to be plain no &amp;#34;special effects&amp;#34; like volume or length. Pro quality is that it stays on the whole day without smudging.</li>
            <li> I like this but not as much as their original lashblast mascara. It is really lengthening but not very volumizing at least for me. And I want a mascara that does both. It is also a bit flakey. I&#x27;m undecided as to whether I&#x27;d buy it again..probably not. But it&#x27;s decent for the price. The brush is great too. I like the bright chunky packaging.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product for myself, I asked myself if I needed another mascara. With the plethora of drugstore mascaras, there are certainly plenty of &amp;#34;fails&amp;#34;. I did some simple research before I bought, so I will share them with you along with my own experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t compare ingredients or anything like that, but simply abused the power of Google and YouTube, and searched through countless reviews. You might think that&#x27;s a lot of work put into a mascara, but hey, that&#x27;s just how women shop, right? Anyway, I found that it was very well liked among all the people who tried it. It&#x27;s even sold in Costco in a 3 pack!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience is that this formula is drier than those of say, Loreal Voluminous Carbon Black. The bristles are rubber and rather short, but a good amount of them. They can get product gooped on it, but just make sure you scrape some off on the rim before applying. It really doesn&#x27;t clump very easily. Of course, any mascara can clump, but this one is really nice about being hard to. It definitely builds volume, and I&#x27;d say about 150% (not 200% as packaging says). If you have thin lashes, this will emphasize lashes by darkness (I bought Very Black) and slight thickness. Length-wise, this is only decent. Not crazy like some other Covergirl or Maybelline, or Loreal mascaras can be, but WITHOUT CLUMPS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application tip: The wand is curved, so I&#x27;ll call it concave and convex for the the respective side of the wand. The convex side (bulging out?) is great for lengthening, and the concave is fantastic for bottom lashes. Use the convex on your upper lashes to define them easily, and the concave on the bottom, for a great smudgeless application of the shorter bottom lashes. Try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;d rather take no clumps and fast application over high volume and lengthened spider lashes. That&#x27;s just personal preference.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! WORKS WONDERS. &amp; IT REALLY DOES NOT CLUMP UP</li>
            <li> No clumps. Amazing length and volume. Looks Fairly Natural and curls. This mascara is better than a lot of the high end mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using CoverGirl Lash Exact for my first coat; then Maybelline Falsies for the second coat. It was kind of a pain using two different mascaras, but I liked features of both of them - the plastic brush of Lash Exact and the curve of Falsies. Then I found this one - plastic brush and curve all in one mascara. I also like that it&#x27;s not a super skinny curved brush, but a little more substantial. I think Clump Crusher is kind of a stupid name, but this is fantastic for maximizing the length of my lashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara is great to apply and looks lovely on your lashes.  The problem I&#x27;ve found is that each tube does not last very long if you like to have a full-lash look.  The product dries out and begins to crumble on your lashes.  I love the fact that it does not clump up, and it goes on very easily and does coat each and every lash, just as it says it does.  But prepare to buy it twice as often as any other brand/type of mascara.</li>
            <li> Loved this! So much better than the falsies mascara. No clumps, it lets you get from edge to edge without getting it in your eye or on your eye lid. I will buy It again. The brush doesn&#x27;t pull too much mascara out too so you won&#x27;t end up with a mess. It actually gives me a longer and thicker look to my eye lashes. Mind you I have Asian lashes. Thin, short, &amp; straight downward.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve resigned myself to only getting one coat of this on.  Which means it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes as long/thick as I&#x27;d like.  If I do a second coat I get flaking.</li>
            <li> This is a good mascara for the money.  The clumping is minimal and it goes on easy.  I will use it again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It does what it says it will do, smudges very little, and looks natural and pretty on. Not at all clumpy or globby yet definitely adds impact. This is maybe the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I don&#x27;t know if this is precisely waterproof but i&#x27;ve worn it while splashing in a pool and tearing up and it still looked great. I rarely review on amazon, but I was so pleased  thought I&#x27;d share my experience.</li>
            <li> This mascara is in an easy to see, green container. The product does not clump as stated from my several days of wearing this. It goes on really well, not too thick or thin. The brush does a good job of getting my lashes evenly coated. The one flaw is that after a few hours of wear, if I accidentally touch my lashes, the black mascara starts to flake off my lashes. I&#x27;m not talking about rubbing my eyes or anything fierce, but just touching my lashes -- black flakes. It&#x27;s not horrendous, mind you, but still annoying as I expect my mascara to stay on even if I touch my eyes a little bit.  But still, I do like that it doesn&#x27;t clump, looks greats on my eyes, and is in a cute little green container (as opposed to a black one which is hard to find in my makeup bag).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for about 2 weeks now and it works quite efficiently.  I don&#x27;t have naturally thick lashes so this product does make them more noticeable.  I t lasts the entire day without getting gloppy; the brush has also stayed \\&quot;unclumped,\\&quot; which makes forr easier application.  I really like the way the curved brush fits the curve of the eyelashes</li>
            <li> Works extremely well! Love my lashes after using this! It is rather difficult for me to put on my bottom lashes (the brush hits my skin) but nothing a q-tip can&#x27;t take care of! Great product!</li>
            <li> On one hand, this mascara absolutely does what it says on the tin -- it did a far better job than most mascaras when it comes to the clumping issue. I hate clumps, and this mascara didn&#x27;t clump at all. On the down side, though, this mascara left my lashes far mor stiff and straight than they normally are, enough so that I needed to use a lash curler for my lashes to look even vaguely normal. Overall, I get better -- and quicker! -- results by using a regular mascara and then using a lash comb to remove any clumps than I do by using this mascara and then a lash curler. I&#x27;m betting this product might be a better fit for women with longer or curvier lashes.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use any other mascara again I already bought another one as a back up. No clumps? No problem.  It&#x27;s definitely a must.</li>
            <li> Just as it says - clump crusher ! U may build the layers without any clumps! U easialy can get a natural look and evening drama! Great mascara, reasonable price! Highly recommended !</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase. Covergirl Clump Crusher is an awesome mascara. I love how I was able to find it on Amazon because I just wanted to try test new mascaras without having to pay too much money. I love the mascara and the shipping was very quick! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Make sure that you are deciding that you don&#x27;t want water resistant mascara. I got this for someone because she ran out but later on found out it was water resistant and she was a bit bummed out. If someone cries a lot make sure it is water resistant!</li>
            <li> It makes lashes look amazing and it lasts the whole day. When applied, it looks very natural. Totally satisfied! Will buy more.</li>
            <li> Its all I use I have long lashes and it makes them look extra flipped out and long! Def recommend!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research for a new mascara. This was one of the mascaras that ranked in the top 5. I would rank it #1. It actually said what is does. No clumps, longer lashes, even tho I chose not to get Waterproof, it didn&#x27;t come off until I wash my face at night. yea!</li>
            <li> I only keep mascara for a couple of months. This mascara works very well and does not clump too much. It is fairly easy to take off if it runs from water or accidental smears and comes off well at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve changed my mind.....&lt;br /&gt;This mascara doesn&#x27;t do it for me anymore.  I haven&#x27;t been using this for awhile now cause the formula dries up quickly and worse I keep seeing a bunch of black flakes all around my eyes and cheeks after I put it on.  I regret buying another one.  I found another way better &amp; cheaper mascara I&#x27;ve been using.  If you would like to know which one you can contact me.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, seems to catch most eyelashes.  Does tend to crumble after about 9 hours, but other than that, just as expected.  Two coats needed.  Those that have the white primer are great, but sometimes white is leftover, ugh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried high end mascaras and I always end up going back to this. I have long lashes and this mascara is wonderful and definitely does not clump at all.</li>
            <li> It says no clump and it&#x27;s true there is no clumping with this mascara at all I love so much and I totally recommend getting that</li>
            <li> Felt like I had to keep adding more cause it didn&#x27;t look like I had any on. I guess I need to look for something that will add more volume and body to my lashes. But overall, it did what it was intended to do, turn my eyelashes black, with no clumps.</li>
            <li> Product lasts a complete working day. Makes my lashes stand out!</li>
            <li> Love It!  my teen uses nothing else...I use waterproof same brand!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, and Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara ever. I almost never have to worry about clumps and they make my lashes look nice and thick.</li>
            <li> I admit, I put on a ton just to test it and THEN it clumped a little, but normal use, no clumping, good for use with an eyelash curler, which I have to use, no black clumps on your curler. It&#x27;s not screamingly perfect, but I&#x27;d say one of the best brand name mascaras I&#x27;ve tried. Definitely good value for your money!</li>
            <li> This is not the best Mascara ever.  Just so you know, the best is the basic mascara made by ColoreScience. It&#x27;s perfect. You get long, long lashes, no clumping, the wand is so good you should never throw it away. Just clean it with rubbing alcohol every now and then and use it instead of whatever wand you find inside any other mascara you are using, which you shouldn&#x27;t be. ColoreScience is the best. But boy, does this come close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want too much \\&quot;volume.\\&quot; How thick should your eyelash be before you start looking like Tammy Faye Baker.  We want length and color. If your lashes are so sparse you look like Minnie Mouse, buy artificial lashes or, even better, get them individually applied by a make up artist for special occasions. But don&#x27;t clunk up your lashes so they look gummy. This gives the right amount of lengthening and thickening, even if you put it on with a heavy hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CoverGirl Clump Crusher goes on easily. To challenge their \\&quot;no clumping\\&quot; claim, I slathered on four coats.  Two coats of mascara should be the limit. Three...you&#x27;re pushing it. Four...get your diploma, you are a Clown College Graduate.  But even four layers didn&#x27;t make my lashes stumpy or weird. They were starting to look overdone, so I stopped there. If you wait a few minutes and let the mascara dry, you can use your lash curler...even a heated one, without creating a mess. YOu get a little flaking and flecking, but not too bad. Still, it&#x27;s always better to do the curling first. I like the brush, it has an interesting angle and the bristles sweep away a lot of excess product when you brush it on.  The curve follows the curve of the eye, so one stroke goes from one end of the lid to the other.  Straight brushes can be tricky because they reach only a portion of the lashes. When you go back to do the middle and other end, some lashes end up with too little, some too much mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I got a great tip from a make up artist:  If you use eyeliner on the inner eyelids, your eyes look smaller and harder.  Instead, use white or very light blue. It makes your eyes open up and look bigger and younger.  Use it on the inner lids top and bottom. Also nothing gets rid of eyebags (I don&#x27;t mean temporary puffiness from staying up late or partying, but real undereye suitcases), so save your money for the surgery. BUT caffeine does temporarily provide a little bit of shrinkage. Soak cotton balls in cold coffee left from breakfast and place on the bags, lean back and relax for 20 minutes.  It should make a difference. I have also heard that Preparation H works, but I believe the formula has been changed.  Perhaps we should be checking out the hemmerhoid cream reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your patience. I think this mascara is a good deal, easy to use whether you use make up often or only occasionally, and is fairly foolproof.e inner eyelids, your eyes look smaller and harder.

            <li> I tried this new product and it worked fabulously! You have to put on two coats for darker eyelashes, but there are absolutely no clumps. you dont even need to use a tool to seperate your eyelashes, the wonderful product brush does it for you. THe brush has a ton of little prongs i guess you&#x27;d call them. I was very impressed, I would buy this product. Also watery eyes didn&#x27;t make a difference, no runs. If you leave it on overnight still looks great.</li>
            <li> This is a mascara that I will purchase again. I loved the curved brush, it seperated all my lashes and reached every single one. The color is very black but I did not think it was too dark at all (I have fair skin and dark blonde hair). It stayed on all day and did not smudge which is always a good thing when it comes to mascara! I don&#x27;t think it gave my lashes 200% more volume though, which is why I am giving it four stars instead of five.</li>
            <li> Covergirl  Mascara produces a good product.  I am a senior so I did not expect fabulous lashes since I&#x27;ve lost them, but the mascara goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> It is a good product. Great for lengthening lashes. So much so that I get mascara on my brow bone when I blink after application. It doesn&#x27;t clump even when applying second coat, but doesn&#x27;t thicken lashes any way. They just get longer.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best drugstore mascara I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it because out of all the expensive mascaras I buy, my one issue with them all is that they clump!&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is amazing, especially considering how affordable it is.&lt;br /&gt;I am shocked at how much I love it and it has replaced all of my other mascaras (DiorShow, Givenchy)&lt;br /&gt;A must have.</li>
            <li> i just got this mascara its great,it crushes well the clump looks very natural good color,great product would recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> It crushes clumps and provides nice even coverage while making my eyelashes look longer. I&#x27;m a loyal \\&quot;Covergirl\\&quot; and this product exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> It goes on lightly with no clumps..yes! It actually performs as advertised.  It isn&#x27;t thick and heavy if that is what you are looking for.  But if you want a more natural look with no clumps this is for you.</li>
            <li> 1/31/13 UPDATE: I have been using this mascara in Very Black (rather than Brown) and I have upgraded my opinion from 4 to 5 Stars. This is a very good, well priced, every day mascara that is easy to apply, dries quickly and gives one&#x27;s lashes moderate volume and length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW: I am quite specific in my mascara preferences and I usually don&#x27;t care for curved brushes. This brush, however is excellent. Shaped like a smile or a wedge (thicker in the center and tapered at the ends), the brush is composed of many short plastic spikes that move easily through the lashes while depositing lots of pigment at the lash roots. The shape of the brush allows for quick and even application even at the more difficult to reach areas: the inner and outer corners, the lower lashes. It is because of this innovative brush that I would recommend this mascara over [[ASIN:B0018QE47K CoverGirl Lashblast Mascara, Very Black 800]], which is a very good, everyday product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This  mascara is smooth and somewhat glossy in Brown and matte in Very Black. It applies evenly without much clumping as long as you kept the brush moving. \\&quot;Build-ability\\&quot;, the ability to apply multiple coats one over the other was not a problem as long as the mascara had not dried fully. Once dried, the mascara would clump somewhat when a fresh coat was applied.....not terrible but not exactly what I would call a \\&quot;Clump Crusher\\&quot; either. My current favorite \\&quot;dime store\\&quot; mascara is [[ASIN:B004GHG8EK L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Million Lashes Mascara, Blackest Black]] and I can apply it in the morning before work and then at 7 pm reapply a coat for a more dramatic effect before going out to dinner. You also can do this with \\&quot;Clump Crusher\\&quot;, but not with the same voluminous effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara comes in four shades: Very Black, Black, Black Brown, and Brown. I originally tested the Brown which I found to be extremely, surprisingly light in color, even lighter than my normal lashes. I would only recommend the Brown for extremely fair, light blondes or perhaps strawberry blondes with pale, pale lashes who are interested in a casual, natural look. Otherwise, for anyone else, I would not go lighter than the Black Brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is an excellent choice if you are interested in natural looking lashes with moderate volume and length.only recommend the Brown for extremely fair, light blondes or perhaps strawberry blondes with pale, pale lashes who are interested in a casual, natural look. Otherwise, for anyone else, I would not go lighter than the Black Brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is an excellent choice if you are interested in natural looking lashes with moderate volume and length.</li>
            <li> The product does exactly what it says... you&#x27;ll get volume without your eyelashes clumping together, and the enjoy the added benefit that your mascara won&#x27;t flake off or smudge during the day. It isn&#x27;t waterproof for those who prefer waterproof mascara; it does come off very easily when washing your face. I actually like this better than a few of the higher priced brands, but must state that I don&#x27;t wear contacts, so am not sure how it would work for those who do. It hasn&#x27;t seemed to dry out my lashes (causing breakage) as some mascaras have. It&#x27;s a basic, budget-friendly mascara that doesn&#x27;t go on in globs and seems to hold up well throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Covergirl Clump Crusher Mascara is designed to give you the ideal length of a good mascara without the clumping, and that is exactly what it does, according to my 17 year old daughter.  She wears mascara not for increasing apparent length but for \\&quot;definition\\&quot; and she was pleasently surprised at how well this product worked, and  how many compliments she received.  This is a very versatile and satisfying product.</li>
            <li> My first use of the product was rather laughable - far too much product came out on first use, resulting in far too many clumps for a &#x27;clump crusher&#x27; mascara. Over time, the brush has started to work better as the mascara has become more evenly distributed on the brush. It seems to be a generally good formula, but I do find that I need to be very careful not to overdo it.</li>
            <li> First off my tube of mascara says &#x27;water resistent&#x27; not waterproof. Second it all flaked of by lunchtime at work. Yuck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible but it could be much better. It could be because I have short lashes but it still kind of clumped. I love full lashes and this did not content me as well as I thought it should have I put on 2 coats maybe I should try it with more coats and put it on a different way? I don&#x27;t know. Hope you get a better experience out of this item than I did.</li>
            <li> The best mascara ever made!  Ok-ok, let me explain...  I do have long lashes and pretty much any mascara I use does the trick, so  for me to put this product in a separate category, it has to deliver something more.  So, this mascara goes on smoothly, it makes lashes thicker and longer, it stays on all day, no clumps, and does not crumble or fall or leave marks on top lids.  It comes off well with regular eye make up remover.  The brush separates each lush.  It just gives eyes very nice, polished look.  I have been a loyal buys of this product since it came out years ago.  And for the price, you will not get a better value for your buck!</li>
            <li> I recently entered a more professional career and daily basic make up (blemishes covered, mascara, liner or lip tint) is necessary to play the part. So begins my crazy extravengaze for the right make up to be able to look good without working too hard on a daily basis. I&#x27;ve purchased 12 types of mascara (no worries I used coupons, total cost to me was about $1.00 a tube).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara has great ratings if you check Amazon, CVS, and P&amp;G&#x27;s website. But I don&#x27;t think it lives up to the hype. I get fewer clumps with the LASHBLAST LENGHT (yellow tube) than this &#x27;clump crusher.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;I found that it stays on throughout the day&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t flake like some mascaras due (leaving dark circles below your bottom lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clump as much as some other mascaras (the covergirl exact eyelights and maybeline Volum&#x27; Express One)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;No volume&lt;br /&gt;Still some clumps, I think part of this depends on the dispersal of your eye lashes. my right eye as a LOT of extra eye lashes in one spot and this brush can&#x27;t handle that... but the Covergirl LashBlastLength can handle it nicely. I seem to get clumps toward th bottom of the brush, this may also be tied to angle of application, or where the brush fits the eye since it&#x27;s curved (I&#x27;ll play with application and adjust my review as necessary)&lt;br /&gt;Not good for application to lower lasters, the shape of the brush just isn&#x27;t as easy on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - If you walk into a convience store or grocery store this tube is $7.00. It&#x27;s not woth it. I think the standard Maybelline Great Lash and Covergirl LashBlastLength beat this hands down.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I skip foundation, sometimes I skip eye shadow... I NEVER skip the mascara. It&#x27;s the one item of make up I truly care about wearing. (Well, that and lip gloss. Anyway...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is amazing. Though I haven&#x27;t tested it in the rain- I CAN say that it is long lasting. I worked a 14 hour day and was too exhausted to take off my make up before hitting the sack, when I woke up in the morning my mascara still looked great. I haven&#x27;t tested it in the rain yet, buttt it comes off very easily with some generic make up remover I have. (The easier it comes off, the better, for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara does not clump. I love it. My eyelashes look long and silky- they don&#x27;t look like gross spider legs with this stuff. No flakes, no smudges. Highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing expensive department store mascara for many years. Recently the department store brand mascara was been making my eyes itch and turn red, brand new out of the box! On a whim while shopping with my teenager, I decided to try \\&quot;her brand\\&quot; and grabbed the Covergirl Clump Crusher Mascara at my grocery store. After just one application I was impressed. It does not clump like my department store brand and it doesn&#x27;t have the ingredient that was irritating my eyes. It does not smudge, the color is nice, and I&#x27;m surprisingly pleased. I&#x27;m saving money too! The eye-irritating department store brand costs $22 and with the money I saved, I can buy this in more than one color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are some of the other Covergirl Mascara&#x27;s that you&#x27;ve tried? What would you recommend I try next? Is there a lengthener version? What is your favorite color?</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It gives great volume without the clumps. Not to mention, I only paid $7. I&#x27;ve already bought a second tube to use when the first runs out.</li>
            <li> This is just Ok. I don&#x27;t see much difference in this and any other mascara I have used in the past</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this product.  Despite its claims, it did actually clump... and flake... and generally disappeared throughout the day.  I ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> True, no clumps easy to apply.  Good angled applicator- does not touch your upper lid.  Great value for your dollar.</li>
            <li> i like this a lot! got it in the color very black. would recommend. loves how it hold my curl and doesnt weigh my lashes down! the only reason i gave it 4 stars is becuase its not the best drugstore mascara i use. i prefer the loreal double extend. but this one is also great</li>
            <li> The review on Amazon from a man who puts mascara on his wife because her hands shake too much was enough for me to buy it.  He was right, it doesn&#x27;t clump.  I also saw it on a talk show.</li>
            <li> By comparable, I mean they both don&#x27;t clump, they both elongate and thicken, and they both have the same hard bristles. Granted, Benefit&#x27;s product has more body, but the same can be achieved with Covergirl&#x27;s mascara after a few applications.</li>
            <li> This product really does what it says. NO CLUMPS to be seen! Price point is on par with what you would pay at a drug store but I would never reorder this item of I had to pay for shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara! I HATE clumps and I have long lashes but I like them thicker. This lets me use a few coats to get the thickness I want without the creepy clumpy spider leg lash look.</li>
            <li> For the price, it is a great mascara.  No clumping..goes on smooth and easy and makes your lashes look healthy and long.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical since &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; mascara tends to make a lot of claims with little results. Surprisingly, this mascara really does work! It makes my lashes thick and long and really pop. I definitely recommend someone try it over the $$$ brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used every mascara known to womankind. My favorite for years was Bobbi Brown&#x27;s Everything Mascara. It was perfect. A few years ago they changed it, and it&#x27;s never been on par, since. I&#x27;ve never found a go-to replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this mascara isn&#x27;t perfect. It goes on well, and while the brush doesn&#x27;t magickally master clumps, it is easy to work with, and goes on evenly. It thickens and lengthens as much as any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it bleeds on my lower lashes. About 3-4 hours into wearing it, it has smeared below my lashes, which is fine if you want that smokey, humid look. I can&#x27;t say that I noticed it flaking as others noted, but it does migrate, one way or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no perfect mascara. While you won&#x27;t need to touch up the mascara, itself, during the day, you will need to clean up where it has smeared.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product appears fresh.  I think you still need an eyelash comb (it&#x27;s a wee bit clumpy when it first goes on) but I love that there is no fallout.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve used ever. It works wonders. I have pale, thin, unattractive lashes and these make mine look beautiful :) I would reccomend to anyone looking for a good and inexpensive mascara.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s the best CG mascara I&#x27;ve found since I couldn&#x27;t find the original Marathon anymore. There are no clumps, it makes my lashes look longer than any other product I&#x27;ve tried, and it lasts.</li>
            <li> This truly does crush clumps. The wand is curved, with a thinner inner side, to lay down product, and a fatter outer edge that can comb and separate lashes, not that they needed it. I got the results that would normally require a lash comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the other fat wand CG mascaras, I also didn&#x27;t poke myself in the eye trying to reach the base of my lashes. No flaking all day and my lashes are as soft as if I were not wearing mascara. A great product, and I find other mascaras to be a compromise. Good stuff,!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara the past week or so, and the nice thing is that it has not clumped, so that is great. But it doesn&#x27;t seem to volumize my lashes at all. It also seems just a little sticky to me. When I put it on, I often have to use my finger tips to separate some of my lashes that stick together as I am applying it. That is always a pet peeve of mine when it comes to mascara, so for that, I just can&#x27;t give it five stars. But it is not clumping, they are true to their word about that point. I am still looking for an inexpensive mascara that doesn&#x27;t make lashes stick together, clump, or run if your eyes water a little, and that can add a little volume and length.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara.  It&#x27;s true - no clumps! - just full, gorgeous lashes.  I highly recommend this to any mascara-lover who is sick and tired of clumpy, awful mascara.  This one truly lives up to its title.  Great mascara.</li>
            <li> First, I ordered black and was sent brown. I tried it for a day anyway just to see if the product holds up to its claims. It&#x27;s a pretty good mascara but tends to flake, which I don&#x27;t like. I do like the brush but am not sure if I will reorder in black. I&#x27;m on the hunt for the perfect mascara - one that doesn&#x27;t leave smudges or flake or dry out fast - but so far haven&#x27;t found it.</li>
            <li> I was a devoted fan of Covergirl&#x27;s Lashblast Volume (in the orange tube) as it gave my lashes the fullest look for the best price, but I always had issues with a coating of flakes beneath my eyes before the day was even up! I decided to give this a go based on the other positive reviews (it&#x27;s the highest reviewed drugstore mascara I&#x27;ve seen on Amazon) and it was worth every penny!! It gives my eyelashes lots of length and volume and to my complete amazement... NO FLAKES! HALLELUJAH! After years of searching, I&#x27;ve found my mascara soulmate!</li>
            <li> nice brush, nice shape, nice mascara... not much of a legnthener but great at making your lashes thick without clumping!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Covergirl Clump Crusher to anyone - and Amazon.com sells it for such a great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mascara&#x27;s can be expensive; especially when buying special types.  I got so mad at the several mascara&#x27;s in my make-up case that were supposedly clump-free but left huge clumps on my eyelashes that I had to spend an extra 10 minutes each morning brushing the darn clumps out (who wants to present themselves to the world with gobs of mascara caking their eyelashes!?????).  So I was on the hunt, again, to find a mascara that did what it promised to do.  So, as always, I turned to Amazon.com because the reviews I find on their products help so much in deciding what to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with many cosmetics, it takes time to find the ones that do what they say they will do.  This mascara is true to it&#x27;s name and I&#x27;m so happy I finally found it and that it is reasonably priced at Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!  Will certainly keep buying it in the future.</li>
            <li> Very ordinary and not worth the praise and fame obtained, there Mascara best of them, will not buy again Aaod</li>
            <li> Made my eyelashes super long and thin. I was looking for more volume, my mom happened to like it. I suppose it&#x27;s hit or miss.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many types of mascaras and this is my favorite overall.  I want longer and ideally fuller lashes.  While I don&#x27;t feel like it gives 200% more volume as the package states, it does a good job lengthening and defining lashes with literally no clumps whatsoever (and a little volume).  My old go to was Benefit&#x27;s Bad Gal Lash, but it was becoming a more costly purchase with my new job so I decided to give this one a try.  You get the same effects without the clumps, higher cost, or a special trip to the mall!  Great product!  Hope it doesn&#x27;t get discontinued ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the water resistant version of this however, and I feel it might have been the wrong packaging.  The second I came in contact with water, it smeared and offered no water resistance.  Still looked great before the water though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super picky about my mascara and have used the same brand forever but after trying this it is now my new fave!  The brush is really good not your typical super bristly kind.  It doesn&#x27;t clump at all and gives you long pretty lashes that last and do not crumble.  Like this stuff is so good I&#x27;m telling everyone.</li>
            <li> Does all that is claimed! However the brush i quite different from the one pictured, it is thicker and has shorter spike type distributing bristles.</li>
            <li> I have blonde sparse lashes that aren&#x27;t very long. I need a mascara brush that is fine with bristles that aren&#x27;t too long or the mascara between the bristles never makes to my lashes. This brush does that on the end bristles but then gets a little fat for me. The mascara itself is a good consistency, not too thick nor too thin. I may look for other Cover Girl mascara&#x27;s with a bit smaller brush.</li>
            <li> This works great. The color is good and my lashes are never clumpy or sticky. With a lot of mascaras they run into my eyes and bother me all day. I never have a problem with this one. Great for a night out or for work.</li>
            <li> So... we have a lot of different mascaras but you buy the one you believe will help you achieve the looks you want. With this mascara specifically you get a lot of presicion, and coming from me thats a lot to say(always need to rescue my makeup with Q-tips because I simply can&#x27;t apply the mascara without a mess cuz my hands shake a lot), I couldnt believe how easy was to apply it on my lower eye lashes and no clumps either, cant say is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used but its pretty good.... The bad part about this type of brush is you cannot roll it over into your eyelashes but I guess this one makes it up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing amazing but it does the trick for everyday mascara. I might buy it again because it&#x27;s fairly cheap.</li>
            <li> Finally - great length, definition, AND volume!  Applies with precision, looks way better than the mega-brush products, and NO FLAKING, NO IRRITATION, even after all-day and all-evening out.  I have sensitive eyes and wear contact lenses and can even sleep in this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curved brush really improves application accuracy and eyelash appearance - lush, not phony - PLEASE don&#x27;t ever stop making this product !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  I use the outer-edge of the curved brush against my lashes - with this approach, you can literally place the mascara exactly where you want it !</li>
            <li> no clumps, but zero volume.  Pretty much lash paint and separator...</li>
            <li> I have short, thin lashes and this wand has a way of bringing out what I have and builds my lashes up nicely.  This is my favorite mascara and I just keep coming back to it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara of all time - and I&#x27;ve tried many, many varieties! My only issue is that sometimes the mascara does in fact clump - if the mascara is too old. I change my mascara tube each month, tossing away the old one, but I think sometimes the stock here can be old. The price is right, especially if you can take advantage of additional discounts with subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> The following review is based on my wife&#x27;s use of the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple weeks and love it. It goes on very smoothly and evenly with no clumps at all. My lashes are evenly coated and clearly separated every time. It stays on all day but comes off cleanly with my makeup remover. I was sent brown instead of my usual color black. I was impressed by the way the brown looked. Dark enough for my taste but still clearly brown. My only criticism is minor- the handle is wider than most other mascara&#x27;s. It makes it feel a bit awkward in my small hand but ultimately I think it helps me apply the mascara better.</li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of covergirl cosmetics, but decided to try this mascara out after reading reviews.  I&#x27;m so glad I did! This mascara does not clump AT ALL.  In addition, it is volumizing and, although not advertised to lengthen, lengths my short eyelashes extremely well. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This mascaras success is in the design of it&#x27;s brush.&lt;br /&gt;You do get clumps but they can be easily combed out.&lt;br /&gt;Does provide the appearance of great volume and length to lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Is not water proof, as I found out on first use but this does mean it is easy to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t use this if you&#x27;re going to watch a sad movie!&lt;br /&gt;Impressed with the curved brush as this is the means of \\&quot;clump crushing\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have very puny lashes and this mascara made my lashes look thick and amazing!  So just imagine how much it would enhance thicker fuller lashes.  I consider this mascara a &#x27;must-have&#x27; from now on and will not be without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Cover Girl products because they work well and aren&#x27;t overly expensive.  This mascara doesn&#x27;t disappoint - it goes on smoothly with the brush and doesn&#x27;t clump on my lashes.  I like that it colors and defines my lashes without thickening them too much, since I&#x27;m a little too old to pull off a dramatic super-huge-eyelash look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara stays on all day without flaking or ending up smeared under my eyes, and it washes off easily with soap and water or cold cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the odd shape of the container.  It&#x27;s small on one end and top heavy so it wants to fall over, and angled at the other end so it can&#x27;t stand on that end either.  And it&#x27;s too fat in diameter to fit in the openings of my makeup case.  I do like the bright green color, since that makes it easy to find in a purse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the plastic brushes before and didn&#x27;t like them.  For some reason this one is different.  Easy to use and get to those lashes in the corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on what you want will make or break this review.  I was using the &#x27;Falsies&#x27; and was happy with the product, but this one was a bit different.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to add a lot of length, but it does separate quite well and I&#x27;m finding I like the look.  I do use 3-4 applications while it&#x27;s still wet and it gives a bit of a spikey look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find it does not wash off easily, but that could be my choice in removers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will, at least for a while, be using this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;MEF</li>
            <li> Compared to other drugstore mascaras this doesn&#x27;t clump as much. I found the brush a little hard to pull out of the tube and it&#x27;s not great for getting inside the corners of your eyes. If you rub your eyes then it&#x27;s not great to use on your bottom lashes because the product flakes off. I did find that after 5+ hours of wear the product irritated my eyes. I would be more likely to use this if the brush was different and I&#x27;m not a big fan of water proof mascara.</li>
            <li> Covergirl Clump Crusher Mascara delivers just what it promises -- there are no gross clumps in the finished look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can go from daytime to a more dramatic look by layering the mascara on, and there are truly no clumps. Good thing for me, since I usually love to wear lots of mascara but hate those little globs you have to slowly remove with a cotton swab. Especially when you consider the price, this is a really good mascara that delivers just what Cover Girl promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase this again, and certainly would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Do like this product and would reccomend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mascara.  It doesn&#x27;t clump, but it&#x27;s also nothing spectacular.  I probably would go with a less expensive brand next time, but this isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this mascara! I&#x27;ve tried so many others and always come back to this. It goes on great and makes my lashes look thick and long. No clumps and the brush doesn&#x27;t get mascara all over my face.</li>
            <li> Great price and really great mascara.  No clumping and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for a while. The only reason I bought it on amazon is because I was already making an order anyway.</li>
            <li> While this mascara isn&#x27;t all I hoped and dreamed it would be, it works well. The clumps were minimal, but still present. I&#x27;ve never been a fan of the curved brushes, but that&#x27;s just personal preference. The small, rubbery bristles do a great job of applying the mascara evenly. It seemed to get &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; quicker than other brands, meaning it got sticky and didn&#x27;t go on as smooth. But it&#x27;s fairly long-lasting through out the day. For the price, I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> not perfectly clump free, but not bad. The Lashblast line generally is good quality and got me away from more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this due to all the hype, but was not impressed. True, it goes on clump-free, but there&#x27;s not much volume or length building. I now use it for day, since it&#x27;s not very dramatic. I use my Buxom Lash for more drama when I really do my eyes up.</li>
            <li> This was just an okay product to me. I did find that this product clumped (despite the name) and it really didn&#x27;t lengthen or thicken. I use it for during the day when I don&#x27;t have much makeup on. It gives my lashes some definition. But if you&#x27;re looking for a product to use with heavier makeup or for going out, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I am a mascara junkie so me rating this as my second favorite is a pretty big deal. First of all I love the bright green packaging totally cute. I have this in very black in water resistant. I love the shape of the wand because it makes it easy to get every eyelash on your eye. You can get the outer corner and the inner corner with ease. Also if you flip the brush upside down it is perfect for your bottom lashes. This mascara doesn&#x27;t clump,smear,run, or anything bad. This is my go to mascara!</li>
            <li> This mascara separates the lashes well, but it&#x27;s very stiff going on and hurts my lashes and eyelids when I apply it.  I even put a little saline in it to try to soften up the formula a little (pinterest trick!), but it didn&#x27;t seem to help much.  It gives good definition, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I am a mascara junky.  I will try almost any brand, from expensive (Chanel) to quite cheap (Maybelline). I heard about this product on the Today Show and went right out and purchased it. I can&#x27;t express strongly enough how much I dislike it. My lashes stuck together so much that I spent a ridiculous amount of time using a lash comb trying to clean them up. Guess I&#x27;ll stick to my favorite (Buxom), not the cheapest, but this product allows me to give my lashes great coverage without clumping.</li>
            <li> Of the dozens of mascaras I&#x27;ve purchased over the years, I decided to try this based upon other Amazon reviews.  This did not disappoint.  As the name suggests, the brush works very well for eliminating clumps and separating lashes, which always seems to  be an issue with other mascaras.  It also makes my lashes feel very full and soft even after drying, unlike some that makes them feel like spikes.  I will say that the only slight negative is that it doesn&#x27;t give a ton of volume/lift.  If you are looking exclusively for length/lift, I might try something else.  Also, I&#x27;m not sure if this is a negative, but it does seem to take a while (longer than most) to dry.</li>
            <li> I like all of Covergirl&#x27;s Lashblast line.  I have used many brands of mascara in all price ranges and I prefer these.  I love mascara and use it daily and this brand is my go to.  I also use the Lashblast Volume (Orange tube) and love it.  The wand is nice and the mascara lasts all day.  It is not clump-free, but it is less clumpy than most mascara.</li>
            <li> After years of buying a $25 a tube mascara, I&#x27;m going back to Covergirl.  This mascara is pretty great.  The wand has very stiff ridges that comb through your lashes as you apply it.  It&#x27;s basically impossible to clump.  It also gave my lashes great lift without having to use an eyelash curler, and even by the end of the day, my lashes were still lifted...that never happens.  The formula is thin, so if your looking for crazy volume, this isn&#x27;t going to deliver.  But for extreme definition and lift, this mascara is fantastic.</li>
            <li> fantastic lashes. I can put on multiple coats of this mascara and get no clumps. great volume and thickness. Very good product especially for a drug store mascara!</li>
            <li> It took me a try or two to use it in such a way as to get the volume and length without the clumps, but once I figured it out, it worked perfectly. It&#x27;s a great every day mascara. It&#x27;s not false-lash volume + length, but it&#x27;s pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> My wife asked me to get this for her as she saw it on TV.  Yes, commercials do work for those in the marketing department.  However, she was not impressed with the product.  Compared to other products she has used she was expecting more from this Covergirl mascara.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve heard her say she didn&#x27;t like such a product so I was kind of surprised when she said she didn&#x27;t like it.  Too bad the commercial didn&#x27;t match the product.</li>
            <li> This is a good mascara for the price. My lashes are nice and full, but not really WOW! It does not clump and it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that leaves my lashes beautiful and clump-free! I have used several much more pricey brands... but this is it! My search is now over. You will not be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> I am always on a quest for a mascara I love. I was hopeful due to the rave reviews I read about this product on multiple websites. It&#x27;s ok but not great, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. As others have stated very little volume. It smudges during the day, I had dark rims under my eyes after work. I don&#x27;t know about you but the \\&quot;drinking whiskey at my desk\\&quot; look isn&#x27;t what I usually go for.....</li>
            <li> works well. strong brush, and it doesn&#x27;t clump. i do like the way my eyelashes look! My only concern is that when using the brush it feels like it is going to pull all of your eyelashes out. strong and scratchy. Weird, but I love the end result.</li>
            <li> This has become my HG mascara. I love the original Covergirl Lashblast in the orange tube but wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the large wand since I have small eyes and lashes, so I decided to try this one for the wand alone. They don&#x27;t lie when they say it doesn&#x27;t clump. I&#x27;m one of those people that puts coat upon coat on to bulk up and darken my light, thin lashes and this one doesn&#x27;t clump no matter how many times I coat (provided I don&#x27;t let coats dry in between, but that&#x27;s just common sense that you don&#x27;t do that). I haven&#x27;t had any problems with smudging on my eyelids or underneath my eyes despite getting the regular formula. I like that the brush isn&#x27;t some gimmick-y contraption like alot of the wands being introduced lately. It&#x27;s a sturdy brush that&#x27;s slightly curved and fits the curve of the lashline to get all of the lashes easily, even the hard to get inside ones. I&#x27;ll no doubt keep trying other mascaras because I can&#x27;t help myself and i&#x27;m a sucker for clever marketing, but I will always have a tube of this on-hand in addition to any other ones I try. I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it anytime soon. That seems to happen with anything I really love.</li>
            <li> I know that so many women like that very famous brand of mascara that comes in the pink tube but I was never a fan. I hate, hate, hate mascara that clumps and leaves lashes feeling sticky or gummy and that particular brand always left my lashes feeling that way. I never understood they hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, my favorite mascara has been Cover Girl Lash Blast Volume (in the orange tube) but after trying this new Clump Crusher Mascara I now have a new favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to get a lot of compliments on my eyelashes. They are very long and pretty lush.  A lot of times people think I am wearing false eyelashes when all I have on is mascara.  Still, this does present a problem.  Most mascaras will leave my eyelashes feeling heavy and gummy and sticky.  Cover Girl Clump Crusher Mascara completely avoids those bad feelings.  My eye lashes were nicely defined, darkened, and just thick enough.  The look is very natural but still dramatic enough to see a difference.  I also liked the fact that my lashes felt soft and supple - not stiff or sticky.  This mascara also is great at resisting smudging and smearing and doesn&#x27;t flake. I was able to apply multiple layers of this product and it truly did not clump.  My lashes stayed define and did not bind together.  In short, the product works just as it promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube is thick and chubby so it feels a little different in your hand.  It does take some getting use to but the product is still easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you will like this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to give this product 5 starts because I wish it held up longer.  I used to always use waterproof mascara because I like how well it held up during the day.  This mascara is great at not clumping even if you re-apply a few times.  So, it actually does what is says.  I just wish it had the wow factor of my waterproof.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> As much as I enjoy your spokesperson (Pink) and would probably buy something that she endorses, I feel this product falls short. I found the wand was too stiff and the mascara was very dry. I would not buy this product again. I did see that the mascara did clump on the wand, but not on the lashes. The color was good and it lasted most of the day. I believe that there are many other mascara products by Covergirl that are far superior.</li>
            <li> As a  regular fan of original lash blast, this one is an absolute winner! Brush is great for fanning out lashes and does exactly what it claims, builds non-clumpy volume! It even helps elongate lashes which is definitely a major plus! This is just an all around great mascara!</li>
            <li> Okay ! A cheap product! You get what you pay for I guess!</li>
            <li> Wife didn&#x27;t like it. Had her try this one under the subscribe and save. Back to the orange colored one for her.</li>
            <li> This mascara is billed as a no clump product, and I have found that to be true.  The brush allows the mascara to be applied lightly.  I consider this the perfect casual or office mascara, as it gives lashes some definition without an overdone look.  This is not the one to use, though, for a night out when you want a really \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; lash look.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> This mascara is okay. As it claims, it adds volume and a little length without clumping. The biggest drawback, however, is that it starts flaking after a couple of hours, leaving a residue under my lower lashes. I usually use Covergirl&#x27;s \\&quot;professional\\&quot; mascara, and although I don&#x27;t think it provides quite as much volume as this one does, it doesn&#x27;t flake or smear, no matter how long I wear it. Every other mascara I&#x27;ve tried does one or the other. This one didn&#x27;t smear, but flaking was an issue.</li>
            <li> I really do love this mascara! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and it really clumps less than most other mascaras! I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump, the brush is slightly arched for great application, and easy to take off with simple make up remover wipes. It makes my lashes look longer and thicker but still natural. Highly recommended!</li>
