            <li>This product is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and have never been able to tan.  </li>
            <li>This is far and away the best sunless tanning product on yhe market--why is it not in leading retailers any more?!!!!</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re worried you will glow like a macy&#x27;s mannequin, you won&#x27;t - it&#x27;s good for every day use.</li>
            <li>It smells good, too but is shimmery in the sun, for those who don&#x27;t want shimmer.</li>
            <li>I AM FAIR SKINNED</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s luminous and bronzy without being orange, even on EXTREMELY fair skin.</li>
            <li>I have fair porcelain skin.</li>
            <li>The Fair Tones has to be ordered because it is not stocked in stores.</li>
            <li>While I loved the color this gave me, the smell,</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone with fair skin</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and this natural glow worked great.</li>
            <li>The shimmer is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>and it came out nice and dewy.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>I was able to get the fair skin edition from Amazon for which I&#x27;m grateful.  </li>
            <li>The micro pearl flecks also gave me a nice immediate glow.</li>
            <li>I put it on every day in the summer and look like I have a nice tan.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad to get this product in the fair skin tones.  </li>
            <li>I have been using self tanners since 1991 and this is by far the best one I have used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best self-tanner I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li>Also, I think it smelled nice - kind of like a light grapefruit scent.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty great product.  </li>
            <li>I am sooooo impressed with the light brown color - it looks very natural, sunkissed, and glowy.  </li>
            <li>It really looks great.    </li>
            <li>and I totally love it.</li>
            <li>then I&#x27;m sure you would probably get more color</li>
            <li>I personally love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many others and have never been satisfied.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better for me.  </li>
            <li>LOreal Sunless Sublime Glow Daily Moisturizer Fair Skin Tones worked great for me.  </li>
            <li>Love the shimmer in this one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a wonderful product that has become a standard part of my summer days.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product because it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>However, I would love to know if they develop a ginger sunless tanning line...?</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it goes on and stays on.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also a great moisturiser and when applying you don&#x27;t really need a lot.</li>
            <li>I have NEVER been able to get my legs to tan and did not like Banana Boat&#x27;s tanner, and my legs look pretty good with this one--</li>
            <li>It has a strong scent, as the result of the self-tanning compounds, which provide a very warm, somewhat masculine, earthy smell, almost like leather, and the lotion itself, which has a really nice summery fragrance.</li>
            <li>The overall olfactory experience is very pleasant and memorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will say though that I have pretty fair skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommended for all fair skins as a subtle hint of color that will make you look awesome.</li>
            <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t even know what I&#x27;m putting on, but last night in bed, he commented that I smelled so good, and he kept sniffing me because he liked it better than those floral or fruity lotions.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is great as a moisturizer, too, my dry skin feels nice and hydrated all day.  </li>
            <li>it was easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is even easy to spread on your skin</li>
            <li>I also tried the Jergen&#x27;s product once and found it&#x27;s odor so strong</li>
            <li>it is the odor--very strong Mango/Almond odor with chemical aftertones that lingers even after a shower.</li>
            <li>my sheets smell of it strongly.</li>
            <li>It also works very fast, nice looking tan after 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li>I deducted one star because there is some shimmer in the lotion that I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy on my skin.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>It feels and smells lovely - and I have had some fab compliments on how golden I look without them knowing that it was from a product.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only a great gradual tanner</li>
            <li>This is the best gradual tan lotion for pale girls.  </li>
            <li>--I had very distinct lines after the 1st application.</li>
            <li>I used it once a day, after showering, for a week then twice a day for three or four days and it most definitely made a difference that I was very pleased with.  </li>
            <li>I went to an amusement, rode maybe 4 water-based rides, and by the end of the day the spots that were hit by my clothes were my original skin color.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and it gives my pasty white skin just the right amount of a light brown glow.</li>
            <li>i am super fair complected (the lightest shade or second lightest shade available of any foundation or concealer ive worn, just to help illustrate).</li>
            <li>and I will most certainly be using it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the drugstore brands and some high end, this has great natural color, and it&#x27;s inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>Gives a nice light tan look, with barely detectable shimmer.</li>
            <li>so I tried the one for fair skin and felt that it didn&#x27;t quite give me enough color</li>
            <li>and I have a nice soft glow now and am not orange or fakey looking at all</li>
            <li>As a fair skin blonde</li>
            <li>B000NPVD7Q L&#x27;Oreal Sunless Sublime Glow Daily Moisturizer, Fair Skin Tones 8 fl oz (236 ml)]]</li>
            <li>By the way, on my face, I used LOreal Sunless Sublime Glow Daily Moisturizer Face for Fair Skin, which did not have the pearl flecks, but did have SPF 15.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give as much color, but that is okay because I wear makeup</li>
            <li>And it leaves a nice even color that looks natural.</li>
            <li>The oder is not bad at all....</li>
            <li>good if you need quick results that will last a while.</li>
            <li>I feel it has a very pleasant and delicate smell; definately not a bad smell.  </li>
            <li>I would have rated it 5 stars but it fades too quickly after not using it.</li>
            <li>I have used LOreal Sunless Sublime Glow Fair Skin tone for 2 days now and I am shocked at what a wonderful tan I have.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it two stars because it faded quickly with showers and because it&#x27;s not L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s fault that my skin is not suited for sunless tanning.</li>
            <li>This is a nice way to gradually change your leg color rather than &amp;#34;oh, what happened to you?&amp;#34; It goes on smooth and is pretty easy to blend around and not get too many streaks or heavy patches.</li>
            <li>and I love that other redhaired ladies are loving it as well.</li>
            <li>This works very well without looking like Orangina!!  </li>
            <li>Opposite days I pile it on and have a super amazing glow.</li>
            <li>I had a hint of tan color within a day, nice and even, and it got a little better each day.  </li>
            <li>I use the fair to build up a little color then alternate between the medium and fair.  </li>
            <li>Its so nice not to have to walk around with pasty white skin in the summer anymore!</li>
            <li>I spent an embarrassing amount of time searching for a sunless tanner for fair skin.</li>
            <li>Most people have yellow undertones to their skin which works well with self tanners, but I have very fair skin with pink undertones and most of them come out orange and uneven which is very obvious on my fair skin.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it make even the whitest skin a bit more lively, it adds a glorious bit of shimmer to the skin, which makes you look very dewy and nice.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, the long lasting natural color, and the beautiful glow it leaves on your skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend applying after a shower before bed and wearing loose fitting clothes...great product!</li>
            <li>Unlike the other reviewer I liked the mild smell.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am really pleased with this product and would recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li>This is the first tan in a bottle product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>My legs ended up matching my arms that already had a light, natural tan.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for transitioning during seasons, or for special events - it can be built up over a few hours for a stronger \\&quot;glow\\&quot; without looking too unnatural and without risking massive splotches or streaks.</li>
            <li>Anyway so if you have fair skin and actually use it daily</li>
            <li>After looking in local stores, I could only find products for Fair to MEDIUM skin tones, which are unacceptable for me.</li>
            <li>Other than that I really love this stuff and will more than likely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>tried the body lotion on my face which I would never dare before and it works perfectly on my super sensitive face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the scent is ok, not as bad as some of the older self tanning products, but not the most amazing scent ever, either.  </li>
            <li>But soy sauce is such an accurate description of the smell that oozed from my pores for the hour</li>
            <li>The color of this product is very natual and the smell is acceptable.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>This product works so much better than I ever expected.  </li>
            <li>The shimmer was too much for me.</li>
            <li>My husband said I absolutely reeked, and that it stunk up the whole house.  </li>
            <li>My old favorite daily tanner was discontinued</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good when you put it on and not as bad afterwards as most products that give you a sunless tan.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell funny and the color looks natural</li>
            <li>and this gives me a glow that makes me look tons better (in my mind) with out making me look too dark or orangey.</li>
            <li>This product is great, it really moisturizes the skin as well, my face is dry, so i applied my usual moisturizer before i applied this</li>
            <li>Most of them smell bad when they react to the bacteria on your skin&#x27;s surface, but that washes off in the shower in the morning when you wash with a good antibacterial soap (I use Dial).</li>
            <li>I am super white with freckles</li>
            <li>However, after my first application (I followed all directions), I turned orange and had major streaking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a redhead with ghostly pale, freckled and pinkish skin, and I&#x27;ve seen and heard too many horror stories of spray tan disasters.</li>
            <li>so I was on the hunt for a new one.</li>
            <li>This lotion goes on smoothly, dries quickly, and gives the hint of subtle color without streaking.</li>
            <li>it gives you a nice subtle glow.</li>
            <li>It was nice and subtle, without taking forever to emerge.  </li>
            <li>The tan looks nice and natural, no matter how thick you lather it on.  </li>
            <li>I have really pale skin, after using it every day for 5 days, my skin has a healthy tint that looks natural.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was apprehensive about getting a product like this, not knowing if my legs would turn out oompa loompa like, but it looked very natural.  </li>
            <li>I have tried them ALL and have a closet filled with half used bottles of tanner ranging in price from $5 to $30</li>
            <li>I love this Loreal daily moisturizer, the color it gives is so natural, never too dark, streaky, or orange.</li>
            <li>When others notice, then you know your skin does not look naturally sun-kissed.</li>
            <li>It leaves a natural looking brown tint, no orange tint.</li>
            <li>I leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This is the only bronzer that looks like a real tan.  </li>
            <li>I do recommend gently ex foliating every second day of application to prevent a scuzzy buildup.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t look weird on my fair skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a GORGEOUS fake tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I thought at first I was putting on too much, but no matter how little I use, it still leaves brown stains on my towels.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others, more expensive, this works really well.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural like you just got back from the day at the beach..</li>
            <li>Some people complained about the smell, but I honestly didn&#x27;t notice anything different from a regular daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a little color without all the UV-Ray damage.</li>
            <li>This product got my very white, nearly translucent legs to a sunkissed color just in time for a wedding I was attending.  </li>
            <li>if you really use this daily it wouldn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li>so I figured I would see more of a dramatic change.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply without streaking as the tanning effect is fairly subtle and builds up only after repeated use.</li>
            <li>It does have a little bit of a shimmer to it you might want to be aware of.</li>
            <li>This smells sooo much better than other self tanner/gradual tan moisturizers, I can&#x27;t believe someone complained about it.  </li>
            <li>It makes my dull pale skin look more alive.</li>
            <li>so a little color went a long way and that was exactly what this lotion provided me with.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It has a strong scent, as the result of the self-tanning compounds, which provide a very warm, somewhat masculine, earthy smell, almost like leather, and the lotion itself, which has a really nice summery fragrance.</li>
            <li> The overall olfactory experience is very pleasant and memorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will say though that I have pretty fair skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommended for all fair skins as a subtle hint of color that will make you look awesome.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t even know what I&#x27;m putting on, but last night in bed, he commented that I smelled so good, and he kept sniffing me because he liked it better than those floral or fruity lotions.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is great as a moisturizer, too, my dry skin feels nice and hydrated all day.  </li>
            <li> it was easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It is even easy to spread on your skin</li>
            <li> I also tried the Jergen&#x27;s product once and found it&#x27;s odor so strong</li>
            <li> it is the odor--very strong Mango/Almond odor with chemical aftertones that lingers even after a shower.</li>
            <li> my sheets smell of it strongly.</li>
            <li> It also works very fast, nice looking tan after 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li> I deducted one star because there is some shimmer in the lotion that I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy on my skin.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> It feels and smells lovely - and I have had some fab compliments on how golden I look without them knowing that it was from a product.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only a great gradual tanner</li>
            <li> This is the best gradual tan lotion for pale girls.  </li>
            <li> --I had very distinct lines after the 1st application.</li>
            <li> I used it once a day, after showering, for a week then twice a day for three or four days and it most definitely made a difference that I was very pleased with.  </li>
            <li> I went to an amusement, rode maybe 4 water-based rides, and by the end of the day the spots that were hit by my clothes were my original skin color.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and it gives my pasty white skin just the right amount of a light brown glow.</li>
            <li> i am super fair complected (the lightest shade or second lightest shade available of any foundation or concealer ive worn, just to help illustrate).</li>
            <li> and I will most certainly be using it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the drugstore brands and some high end, this has great natural color, and it&#x27;s inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> Gives a nice light tan look, with barely detectable shimmer.</li>
            <li> so I tried the one for fair skin and felt that it didn&#x27;t quite give me enough color</li>
            <li> and I have a nice soft glow now and am not orange or fakey looking at all</li>
            <li> As a fair skin blonde</li>
            <li> B000NPVD7Q L&#x27;Oreal Sunless Sublime Glow Daily Moisturizer, Fair Skin Tones 8 fl oz (236 ml)]]</li>
            <li> By the way, on my face, I used LOreal Sunless Sublime Glow Daily Moisturizer Face for Fair Skin, which did not have the pearl flecks, but did have SPF 15.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give as much color, but that is okay because I wear makeup</li>
            <li> And it leaves a nice even color that looks natural.</li>
            <li> The oder is not bad at all....</li>
            <li> good if you need quick results that will last a while.</li>
            <li> I feel it has a very pleasant and delicate smell; definately not a bad smell.  </li>
            <li> I would have rated it 5 stars but it fades too quickly after not using it.</li>
            <li> I have used LOreal Sunless Sublime Glow Fair Skin tone for 2 days now and I am shocked at what a wonderful tan I have.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars because it faded quickly with showers and because it&#x27;s not L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s fault that my skin is not suited for sunless tanning.</li>
            <li> This is a nice way to gradually change your leg color rather than &amp;#34;oh, what happened to you?&amp;#34; It goes on smooth and is pretty easy to blend around and not get too many streaks or heavy patches.</li>
            <li> and I love that other redhaired ladies are loving it as well.</li>
            <li> This works very well without looking like Orangina!!  </li>
            <li> Opposite days I pile it on and have a super amazing glow.</li>
            <li> I had a hint of tan color within a day, nice and even, and it got a little better each day.  </li>
            <li> I use the fair to build up a little color then alternate between the medium and fair.  </li>
            <li> Its so nice not to have to walk around with pasty white skin in the summer anymore!</li>
            <li> I spent an embarrassing amount of time searching for a sunless tanner for fair skin.</li>
            <li> Most people have yellow undertones to their skin which works well with self tanners, but I have very fair skin with pink undertones and most of them come out orange and uneven which is very obvious on my fair skin.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it make even the whitest skin a bit more lively, it adds a glorious bit of shimmer to the skin, which makes you look very dewy and nice.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, the long lasting natural color, and the beautiful glow it leaves on your skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend applying after a shower before bed and wearing loose fitting clothes...great product!</li>
            <li> Unlike the other reviewer I liked the mild smell.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am really pleased with this product and would recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li> This is the first tan in a bottle product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My legs ended up matching my arms that already had a light, natural tan.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for transitioning during seasons, or for special events - it can be built up over a few hours for a stronger \\&quot;glow\\&quot; without looking too unnatural and without risking massive splotches or streaks.</li>
            <li> Anyway so if you have fair skin and actually use it daily</li>
            <li> After looking in local stores, I could only find products for Fair to MEDIUM skin tones, which are unacceptable for me.</li>
            <li> Other than that I really love this stuff and will more than likely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> tried the body lotion on my face which I would never dare before and it works perfectly on my super sensitive face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the scent is ok, not as bad as some of the older self tanning products, but not the most amazing scent ever, either.  </li>
            <li> But soy sauce is such an accurate description of the smell that oozed from my pores for the hour</li>
            <li> The color of this product is very natual and the smell is acceptable.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> This product works so much better than I ever expected.  </li>
            <li> The shimmer was too much for me.</li>
            <li> My husband said I absolutely reeked, and that it stunk up the whole house.  </li>
            <li> My old favorite daily tanner was discontinued</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good when you put it on and not as bad afterwards as most products that give you a sunless tan.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell funny and the color looks natural</li>
            <li> and this gives me a glow that makes me look tons better (in my mind) with out making me look too dark or orangey.</li>
            <li> This product is great, it really moisturizes the skin as well, my face is dry, so i applied my usual moisturizer before i applied this</li>
            <li> Most of them smell bad when they react to the bacteria on your skin&#x27;s surface, but that washes off in the shower in the morning when you wash with a good antibacterial soap (I use Dial).</li>
            <li> I am super white with freckles</li>
            <li> However, after my first application (I followed all directions), I turned orange and had major streaking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a redhead with ghostly pale, freckled and pinkish skin, and I&#x27;ve seen and heard too many horror stories of spray tan disasters.</li>
            <li> so I was on the hunt for a new one.</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on smoothly, dries quickly, and gives the hint of subtle color without streaking.</li>
            <li> it gives you a nice subtle glow.</li>
            <li> It was nice and subtle, without taking forever to emerge.  </li>
            <li> The tan looks nice and natural, no matter how thick you lather it on.  </li>
            <li> I have really pale skin, after using it every day for 5 days, my skin has a healthy tint that looks natural.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive about getting a product like this, not knowing if my legs would turn out oompa loompa like, but it looked very natural.  </li>
            <li> I have tried them ALL and have a closet filled with half used bottles of tanner ranging in price from $5 to $30</li>
            <li> I love this Loreal daily moisturizer, the color it gives is so natural, never too dark, streaky, or orange.</li>
            <li> When others notice, then you know your skin does not look naturally sun-kissed.</li>
            <li> It leaves a natural looking brown tint, no orange tint.</li>
            <li> I leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This is the only bronzer that looks like a real tan.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend gently ex foliating every second day of application to prevent a scuzzy buildup.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look weird on my fair skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a GORGEOUS fake tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I thought at first I was putting on too much, but no matter how little I use, it still leaves brown stains on my towels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others, more expensive, this works really well.</li>
            <li> It looks very natural like you just got back from the day at the beach..</li>
            <li> Some people complained about the smell, but I honestly didn&#x27;t notice anything different from a regular daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a little color without all the UV-Ray damage.</li>
            <li> This product got my very white, nearly translucent legs to a sunkissed color just in time for a wedding I was attending.  </li>
            <li> if you really use this daily it wouldn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> so I figured I would see more of a dramatic change.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply without streaking as the tanning effect is fairly subtle and builds up only after repeated use.</li>
            <li> It does have a little bit of a shimmer to it you might want to be aware of.</li>
            <li> This smells sooo much better than other self tanner/gradual tan moisturizers, I can&#x27;t believe someone complained about it.  </li>
            <li> It makes my dull pale skin look more alive.</li>
            <li> so a little color went a long way and that was exactly what this lotion provided me with.</li>
            <li> could make me look really weird but its super natural looking,  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for over month and only had one minor streak.</li>
            <li> It can get a little orangey- and streaky, but I&#x27;m new to the tanning lotions, so could be user error LOL.&lt;br</li>
            <li> after the lotion is dry I only smell my perfume.   </li>
            <li> This is the first tanner I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t look odd on pale skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the seller didn&#x27;t purposely do it, but it still is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I returned it and bought the Jergen&#x27;s version instead which has a much nicer, delicate, handcreme smell.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, and this is a big however, if you manage to get wet while wearing clothes (even just a bathing suit)</li>
            <li> The same issue can be achieved after a shower or bath if you rub your skin too roughly with the towel.  </li>
            <li> I will keep using this product as long as I can get my hands on it.</li>
            <li> or so I waited for it to dry.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to dry also.</li>
            <li> I quit seeing it in the local stores a few years ago, so have only bought from amazon.</li>
            <li> Only one complaint, and I&#x27;m surprised I didn&#x27;t see this in other reviews.</li>
            <li> After you shower when you dry off, the color comes off on the towels!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite dedicated enough to use this daily though, I usually use it once</li>
            <li> One thing to note is it&#x27;s not super moisturizing, so every 3rd day or</li>
            <li> I still choose to use a daily tanner instead of a regular tanner because I never have trouble with it going on unevenly, it&#x27;s goof proof.</li>
            <li> -minus</li>
            <li> I am blonde and pale skinned</li>
            <li> Unlike the other reviews, it turned me orange, I sparkle like freaking Edward Cullen, and I smell like a wet dog.</li>
            <li> My skin looks even, with a completely natural, subtle color.</li>
            <li> so I also use my other lotion to keep the color locked in and keep my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> Also the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all like it has with other self tanners.</li>
            <li> I guess is the equivalent of the tan other skin types get in a summer afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very pale and try to protect myself from the sun, so getting a tan outside is not an option.  </li>
            <li> I tried Jergens again but they have changed their formula and it was too thick and never really soaked in all the way, so it left me feeling a little oily and sticky which I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> It doesnt smell nearly as bad as Jergens Natural Glow, though it is a bit more expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews that it smells like tea, and it does a little.  </li>
            <li> This product may work for some but with my complexion my skin turned slightly orange.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this lotion for about two weeks now and can see a slight change in my colour tone.</li>
            <li> I agree with previous reviews that it does smell like soy sauce.</li>
            <li> I still had about half the bottle though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so desperate to get rid of my racerback lines that I would have been willing to overlook these flaws.</li>
            <li> I did learn to allow at least 30 minutes for it to dry otherwise it can stain clothing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what offended the other reviewer unless she dislikes the smell of citrus or the way the product reacts to her body chemistry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bonus that it is giving me a little color, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> avoid streaking I typically apply a liberal-but-even layer of this, followed by a thin layer of my standard body lotion to \\&quot;blend\\&quot; the product into feet/ankles/elbows/knee pits, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale with dark hair and eyes, i tan dark</li>
            <li> I guess doing away with the smell is hard for manufacturers - after 8 hours I really get tired of smelling it!</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because it has an unpleasant odor for the first bit after you apply it.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m just impatient plus</li>
            <li> : Smell is there and stays and stays (and stays on clothes), damp and heavy feel on skin</li>
            <li> it says you will notice results after a few applications</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pasty pale with freckles and will burn if I try to \\&quot;tan.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I think L&#x27;Oreal has discontinued this, which is sad because this is 1/2 the price of similar moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried sunless tanners in the past and turned orange.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have that horrible smell most self tanners have.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why some complained about that....</li>
            <li> I apply a very small amount of lotion.  </li>
            <li> Pale isn&#x27;t half as bad as being spotted.</li>
            <li> That is something else that will be hard to find!  </li>
            <li> I like this lotion because it gives a subtle tan to skin, but I do not the shimmer it leaves behind on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> it does have a bit of reflective quality to it, but it&#x27;s very subtle, so</li>
            <li> Also, I think the shimmer is very subtle.  </li>
            <li> I like the glow and the smell isn&#x27;t bad, but my boyfriend even said my legs looked whiter after a few days use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had to agree.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t turn you orange and the smell isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the reviews about the bad smell....</li>
            <li> OMG AWFUL!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells terrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this product works, but i would not call it the solution to all sunless tan problems.  it&#x27;s quite runny in texture (although it may be just the tube i received, i seem to remember a thicker texture when i tested in store) and it&#x27;s not tinted so it&#x27;s tricky to see where you&#x27;ve just applied it.  the scent is ok, not as bad as some of the older self tanning products, but not the most amazing scent ever, either.  it does have a bit of reflective quality to it, but it&#x27;s very subtle, so if you&#x27;re worried you will glow like a macy&#x27;s mannequin, you won&#x27;t - it&#x27;s good for every day use.</li>
            <li> I have tried them ALL and have a closet filled with half used bottles of tanner ranging in price from $5 to $30 and I have to say, this gives me the best color and the best coverage.  Most people have yellow undertones to their skin which works well with self tanners, but I have very fair skin with pink undertones and most of them come out orange and uneven which is very obvious on my fair skin.  I am sooooo impressed with the light brown color - it looks very natural, sunkissed, and glowy.  I just stocked up!  Also, I think it smelled nice - kind of like a light grapefruit scent. I&#x27;m not sure what offended the other reviewer unless she dislikes the smell of citrus or the way the product reacts to her body chemistry.  Most of them smell bad when they react to the bacteria on your skin&#x27;s surface, but that washes off in the shower in the morning when you wash with a good antibacterial soap (I use Dial).</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and this natural glow worked great. It doesn&#x27;t turn you orange and the smell isn&#x27;t that bad. it gives you a nice subtle glow. One thing I don&#x27;t like is all the glitter in it.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty great product.  The tan looks nice and natural, no matter how thick you lather it on.  And it&#x27;s a great moisturizer too.  Some people complained about the smell, but I honestly didn&#x27;t notice anything different from a regular daily moisturizer.  The shimmer is a nice touch.  It really looks great.    HOWEVER, and this is a big however, if you manage to get wet while wearing clothes (even just a bathing suit) it&#x27;ll rub off.  I went to an amusement, rode maybe 4 water-based rides, and by the end of the day the spots that were hit by my clothes were my original skin color.  AND it doesn&#x27;t even come off evenly.  It comes off splotchy, so it looks like you have some sort of skin disorder.  Sweat will do it too.  So don&#x27;t intend on spending time in the heat, especially if you insist on doing so with clothes on.  The same issue can be achieved after a shower or bath if you rub your skin too roughly with the towel.  Basically, you have to baby the tan like nobody&#x27;s business because if you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll find it rubbing off in some spots.  Pale isn&#x27;t half as bad as being spotted.</li>
            <li> Unlike the other reviews, it turned me orange, I sparkle like freaking Edward Cullen, and I smell like a wet dog. I am not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> My old favorite daily tanner was discontinued so I was on the hunt for a new one. I tried Jergens again but they have changed their formula and it was too thick and never really soaked in all the way, so it left me feeling a little oily and sticky which I didn&#x27;t like. So I tried this one and loved it! I love the scent, the long lasting natural color, and the beautiful glow it leaves on your skin (the glow will stay until you wash). I will say though that I have pretty fair skin so I tried the one for fair skin and felt that it didn&#x27;t quite give me enough color so I tried the medium one and I totally love it. I&#x27;m not quite dedicated enough to use this daily though, I usually use it once and then once the color wears off after about 5-7 days I will use it again. I still choose to use a daily tanner instead of a regular tanner because I never have trouble with it going on unevenly, it&#x27;s goof proof. Anyway so if you have fair skin and actually use it daily then I&#x27;m sure you would probably get more color, I&#x27;m just impatient plus if you really use this daily it wouldn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using self tanners since 1991 and this is by far the best one I have used. It looks very natural like you just got back from the day at the beach.. I&#x27;m very pale with dark hair and eyes, i tan dark but i dont want to damage my skin. This product is great, it really moisturizes the skin as well, my face is dry, so i applied my usual moisturizer before i applied this and it came out nice and dewy.&lt;br /&gt;Use gloves as well..love it</li>
            <li> This product may work for some but with my complexion my skin turned slightly orange. After using for about a week, my husband suggested I stop using it because my skin was turning orange. When others notice, then you know your skin does not look naturally sun-kissed. I discontinued this product immediately.</li>
            <li> MY Positives: No streaks or unsightly orange-y spots, noticeable color after 1 use, smell (like peach tea) is less-bad than old-school tanners, and I only need to use it every 2-4 days to maintain color (can&#x27;t imagine daily use).    MY Negatives: Smell is there and stays and stays (and stays on clothes), damp and heavy feel on skin (like never soaks in - I prefer lighter, barely-there moisturizer), at end of day I can wipe yellow-orange off skin with a damp washcloth.    I&#x27;ll stick with this until the next-gen of sunless tanners comes out. I guess doing away with the smell is hard for manufacturers - after 8 hours I really get tired of smelling it!</li>
            <li> This looks great and not orange! I started seeing it change after the second use! It smells good, too but is shimmery in the sun, for those who don&#x27;t want shimmer. I personally love it. I would have rated it 5 stars but it fades too quickly after not using it. You must keep re-applying it if you want to stay tan.</li>
            <li> This is the best self-tan product I have used. It leaves a natural looking brown tint, no orange tint. I leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized. It also works very fast, nice looking tan after 3-4 hours. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have used LOreal Sunless Sublime Glow Fair Skin tone for 2 days now and I am shocked at what a wonderful tan I have.  I am blonde and pale skinned and I have a nice soft glow now and am not orange or fakey looking at all and the tan is even and no streaks...... this is a prefect product!!!!   The oder is not bad at all.... I am not sure why some complained about that.... after the lotion is dry I only smell my perfume.   I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!   Marilyn</li>
            <li> This is far and away the best sunless tanning product on yhe market--why is it not in leading retailers any more?!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this Loreal daily moisturizer, the color it gives is so natural, never too dark, streaky, or orange. I quit seeing it in the local stores a few years ago, so have only bought from amazon. I&#x27;ve tried so many others and have never been satisfied. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> This is the best gradual tan lotion for pale girls.  I&#x27;m a redhead as well and I love that other redhaired ladies are loving it as well. I&#x27;ve tried the drugstore brands and some high end, this has great natural color, and it&#x27;s inexpensive.  I think L&#x27;Oreal has discontinued this, which is sad because this is 1/2 the price of similar moisturizers.  This smells sooo much better than other self tanner/gradual tan moisturizers, I can&#x27;t believe someone complained about it.  Also, I think the shimmer is very subtle.  I use the fair to build up a little color then alternate between the medium and fair.  I will keep using this product as long as I can get my hands on it.</li>
            <li> my legs are pasty white so a little color went a long way and that was exactly what this lotion provided me with.</li>
            <li> This is the only bronzer that looks like a real tan.  I was able to get the fair skin edition from Amazon for which I&#x27;m grateful.  As a fair skin blonde I think it&#x27;s better for me.  I&#x27;ve tried others, more expensive, this works really well. [[ASIN:B000NPVD7Q L&#x27;Oreal Sunless Sublime Glow Daily Moisturizer, Fair Skin Tones 8 fl oz (236 ml)]]</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews on this site and recommendation from my friend, I purchased this product. I have very fair skin color and I am worried about any tanning that looks too obvious. The color of this product is very natual and the smell is acceptable. I deducted one star because there is some shimmer in the lotion that I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy on my skin. I don&#x27;t know why they need shimmer in this...Overall, I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This is the first tanner I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t look odd on pale skin.  Gives a nice light tan look, with barely detectable shimmer. Easy to apply without streaking as the tanning effect is fairly subtle and builds up only after repeated use.Unlike the other reviewer I liked the mild smell.  I also tried the Jergen&#x27;s product once and found it&#x27;s odor so strong I had to shower and scrub it off.  It just goes to demonstrate that reaction to scent is very individual!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pasty pale with freckles and will burn if I try to \\&quot;tan.\\&quot;  Plus, I don&#x27;t care for the cancer risk.  I&#x27;ve tried sunless tanners in the past and turned orange.  I don&#x27;t want to go to the spa for a spray tan because it&#x27;s expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need a tan, just some color to keep from being so pasty.  LOreal Sunless Sublime Glow Daily Moisturizer Fair Skin Tones worked great for me.  I had a hint of tan color within a day, nice and even, and it got a little better each day.  It didn&#x27;t look weird on my fair skin.  It was nice and subtle, without taking forever to emerge.  The micro pearl flecks also gave me a nice immediate glow. By the way, on my face, I used LOreal Sunless Sublime Glow Daily Moisturizer Face for Fair Skin, which did not have the pearl flecks, but did have SPF 15.  It doesn&#x27;t give as much color, but that is okay because I wear makeup anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people complain about the smell, but I think it depends on taste.  I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews that it smells like tea, and it does a little.  My husband doesn&#x27;t even know what I&#x27;m putting on, but last night in bed, he commented that I smelled so good, and he kept sniffing me because he liked it better than those floral or fruity lotions.  He had never complimented my lotion scent before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great as a moisturizer, too, my dry skin feels nice and hydrated all day.  It&#x27;s a bonus that it is giving me a little color, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it five stars!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have that horrible smell most self tanners have. I have really pale skin, after using it every day for 5 days, my skin has a healthy tint that looks natural. Overall I am really pleased with this product and would recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li> This is the first tan in a bottle product I have ever used. My birthday is coming up in June and I wanted to get some colour while avoiding the tanning salons and blistering Texas heat. Ive been using this lotion for about two weeks now and can see a slight change in my colour tone. I am very fair skinned so I figured I would see more of a dramatic change. This stuff works great as a moisturizer. On days I know I&#x27;m not going out and il just lounge around the house I apply a very small amount of lotion.  Opposite days I pile it on and have a super amazing glow. Only downside is I look like a sparkling bead that belongs atop a prom dress. My boyfriend said I looked like Edward cullens wife. Haha. Other than that I really love this stuff and will more than likely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the reviews about the bad smell.... I feel it has a very pleasant and delicate smell; definately not a bad smell.  The only thing I would change about this product is to add spf to it.  I am in search of a similar tanner with spf!  Love the shimmer in this one.  That is something else that will be hard to find!  Try this product!  It&#x27;s the best self-tanner I&#x27;ve found so far.  I think I&#x27;ve tried 5 or so.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on smoothly, dries quickly, and gives the hint of subtle color without streaking. I use it daily during the summer to keep some color. I am very pale and try to protect myself from the sun, so getting a tan outside is not an option.  They stopped selling this in stores - I&#x27;m so hooked that I buy it from Amazon sellers. One thing to note is it&#x27;s not super moisturizing, so every 3rd day or so I also use my other lotion to keep the color locked in and keep my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> I AM FAIR SKINNED AND THIS PRODUCT DOES  NOT TURN YELLOW.  WOULDN&#x27;T BE WITHOUT IT</li>
            <li> This is a GORGEOUS fake tanning lotion. It&#x27;s luminous and bronzy without being orange, even on EXTREMELY fair skin. It has a strong scent, as the result of the self-tanning compounds, which provide a very warm, somewhat masculine, earthy smell, almost like leather, and the lotion itself, which has a really nice summery fragrance. The overall olfactory experience is very pleasant and memorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To avoid streaking I typically apply a liberal-but-even layer of this, followed by a thin layer of my standard body lotion to \\&quot;blend\\&quot; the product into feet/ankles/elbows/knee pits, etc. Not only does it make even the whitest skin a bit more lively, it adds a glorious bit of shimmer to the skin, which makes you look very dewy and nice. It WILL stain your finger/toe nails and make any joint-flesh turn brown if you do not wash your hands thoroughly and promptly after applying/blending. It will also stain clothing items if you don&#x27;t let the product absorb properly and/or get sweaty after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a wonderful product that has become a standard part of my summer days. It&#x27;s great for transitioning during seasons, or for special events - it can be built up over a few hours for a stronger \\&quot;glow\\&quot; without looking too unnatural and without risking massive splotches or streaks.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion because it gives a subtle tan to skin, but I do not the shimmer it leaves behind on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and have never been able to tan.  This product is amazing!  I put it on every day in the summer and look like I have a nice tan.  Its so nice not to have to walk around with pasty white skin in the summer anymore!</li>
            <li> I used it on my legs during the summer&lt;br /&gt;It works great&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again in a flash</li>
            <li> I have fair porcelain skin. This works very well without looking like Orangina!!  I do recommend gently ex foliating every second day of application to prevent a scuzzy buildup. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This provided &amp;#34;tan&#x27; for my fair-skin over-60 skin without looking orange. it was easy to apply. I did learn to allow at least 30 minutes for it to dry otherwise it can stain clothing.  I recommend this product because it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. The Fair Tones has to be ordered because it is not stocked in stores.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell funny and the color looks natural</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. I am very fair (freckles and all) and this gives me a glow that makes me look tons better (in my mind) with out making me look too dark or orangey. Also the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all like it has with other self tanners. I have been using it for over month and only had one minor streak.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was recommended by Consumer Reports.  It smells pretty good when you put it on and not as bad afterwards as most products that give you a sunless tan. And it leaves a nice even color that looks natural. Only one complaint, and I&#x27;m surprised I didn&#x27;t see this in other reviews. After you shower when you dry off, the color comes off on the towels! I thought at first I was putting on too much, but no matter how little I use, it still leaves brown stains on my towels. They come off in the washing machine, but it just means a lot of extra towel washing -- after every shower or two, depending how fussy you are about how your towels look.</li>
            <li> This product works so much better than I ever expected.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a little color without all the UV-Ray damage.</li>
            <li> This is a nice way to gradually change your leg color rather than &amp;#34;oh, what happened to you?&amp;#34; It goes on smooth and is pretty easy to blend around and not get too many streaks or heavy patches. It does have a little bit of a shimmer to it you might want to be aware of. I gave it 4 stars because it has an unpleasant odor for the first bit after you apply it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my skin tone. I like the glow and the smell isn&#x27;t bad, but my boyfriend even said my legs looked whiter after a few days use. I&#x27;ll be trying another brand instead.</li>
            <li> I spent an embarrassing amount of time searching for a sunless tanner for fair skin. I&#x27;m a redhead with ghostly pale, freckled and pinkish skin, and I&#x27;ve seen and heard too many horror stories of spray tan disasters. After looking in local stores, I could only find products for Fair to MEDIUM skin tones, which are unacceptable for me. This lotion appeared to have the best reviews for the best price. I agree with previous reviews that it does smell like soy sauce. OMG AWFUL!!!! But soy sauce is such an accurate description of the smell that oozed from my pores for the hour or so I waited for it to dry. The shimmer was too much for me. I&#x27;m so desperate to get rid of my racerback lines that I would have been willing to overlook these flaws. However, after my first application (I followed all directions), I turned orange and had major streaking. I&#x27;m giving it two stars because it faded quickly with showers and because it&#x27;s not L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s fault that my skin is not suited for sunless tanning. However, I would love to know if they develop a ginger sunless tanning line...?</li>
            <li> It feels and smells lovely - and I have had some fab compliments on how golden I look without them knowing that it was from a product. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> this is a great product for people who wish to look tan but without going in the sun and damage their skin,&lt;br /&gt;especially great for people with fair skin !</li>
            <li> i am super fair complected (the lightest shade or second lightest shade available of any foundation or concealer ive worn, just to help illustrate). i have gotten several compliments on my complection since i started using this. I was worried any self tanner at all could make me look really weird but its super natural looking,  It makes my dull pale skin look more alive. I love it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to get this product in the fair skin tones.  I can&#x27;t find it in ay of the stores around here. It blends well with my skin and I love the way it goes on and stays on.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is fantastic. It gives a noticeable glow, but not orange or in your face! It is even easy to spread on your skin-minus the fact when I received it, it was exploded in the package. I still had about half the bottle though. I&#x27;m sure the seller didn&#x27;t purposely do it, but it still is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it gives my pasty white skin just the right amount of a light brown glow. It doesnt smell nearly as bad as Jergens Natural Glow, though it is a bit more expensive. It&#x27;s not only a great gradual tanner but it&#x27;s also a great moisturiser and when applying you don&#x27;t really need a lot. I&#x27;d recommend applying after a shower before bed and wearing loose fitting clothes...great product!</li>
            <li> While I loved the color this gave me, the smell, oh the smell.  My husband said I absolutely reeked, and that it stunk up the whole house.  Unfortunately, I had to agree.  This stuff smells terrible.  If it turns men off, what&#x27;s the point?  I returned it and bought the Jergen&#x27;s version instead which has a much nicer, delicate, handcreme smell.</li>
            <li> I am super white with freckles and I always need to wear makeup on my face so my skin tone looks even. I also have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product its AMAZING!! I could actually stop wearing makeup!!. My skin looks even, with a completely natural, subtle color. I guess is the equivalent of the tan other skin types get in a summer afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the body lotion on my face which I would never dare before and it works perfectly on my super sensitive face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for all fair skins as a subtle hint of color that will make you look awesome.</li>
            <li> This product got my very white, nearly translucent legs to a sunkissed color just in time for a wedding I was attending.  I used it once a day, after showering, for a week then twice a day for three or four days and it most definitely made a difference that I was very pleased with.  I was apprehensive about getting a product like this, not knowing if my legs would turn out oompa loompa like, but it looked very natural.  My legs ended up matching my arms that already had a light, natural tan.  I would recommend this product to anyone with fair skin and I will most certainly be using it again.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the product-- it says you will notice results after a few applications--I had very distinct lines after the 1st application. It can get a little orangey- and streaky, but I&#x27;m new to the tanning lotions, so could be user error LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do NOT like about it is the odor--very strong Mango/Almond odor with chemical aftertones that lingers even after a shower. Lingers on clothes until they are washed-- my sheets smell of it strongly. Takes a while to dry also. Definitely not a daily thing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall- good if you need quick results that will last a while. I have NEVER been able to get my legs to tan and did not like Banana Boat&#x27;s tanner, and my legs look pretty good with this one--so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
