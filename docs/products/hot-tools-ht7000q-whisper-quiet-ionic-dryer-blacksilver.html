            <li>This one is perfect!  </li>
            <li>very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly.</li>
            <li>This was a great hairdryer while it lasted.  </li>
            <li>Drying time and noise are greatly reduced.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with this purchase</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>and I love it!!</li>
            <li>FABULOUS!!!  </li>
            <li>It was a very nice dryer.</li>
            <li>Hope it holds up as well as the one I own!</li>
            <li>You can also still hear people talking around you, which is nice!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d read a couple of not so good reviews before buying this dryer, but honestly can&#x27;t find anything to complain about!  </li>
            <li>Well now I want to let my hair grow, so I will need something to keep it under control and looking good.</li>
            <li>Good seller, but product in not whispering.</li>
            <li>(I use 2-3 days a week), so it&#x27;s good for my purposes.</li>
            <li>Do not expect gale force winds with this product, but it is a good trade off for my purposes.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li>love this hair dryer!  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice, easy to use dryer.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like the fact that the buttons are on the front kind of where your hand is when you hold it.</li>
            <li>I already own this dryer.</li>
            <li>This dryer seems noisier than the one I previously own.</li>
            <li>After you shower and get dressed, you are already feeling warm</li>
            <li>Of course, it also helps that I can choose warm air to ensure I do not burn them.</li>
            <li>I especially love that the cool button stays in place as opposed to some dryers that have cool &amp;#34;shot&amp;#34; settings.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to style with this.</li>
            <li>The maximum heat setting is not too hot and it is perfect for my fine hair and won&#x27;t damage it.  </li>
            <li>Most amazing hair dryer I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>It is so nice to be able to blowdry hair without it being so noisy.</li>
            <li>I have arthritis and this dryer is very light weight.  </li>
            <li>I have now bought 3 of these, for myself and friends, and we are all satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Better than I ever imagined.</li>
            <li>Wish I had returned it instead of writing an OK review:  </li>
            <li>it is quieter than most blow dryers.</li>
            <li>This is the most lightest and quietest hair dryer that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>COOL SHOT!</li>
            <li>The warm and cool settings come in handy in the Texas summers when you are getting ready.  </li>
            <li>The buttons on the front make it easy to see the settings.  </li>
            <li>Love the locking cool shot.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be built fine and does the job well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quieter, but still sounds funky, like cheap bushings or something.  </li>
            <li>Great temperature control and very quiet.</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy styling with it.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for my daughter because I didn&#x27;t want her to wind up deaf like her mom.</li>
            <li>I had really wanted the Rusk Speed Freak because I&#x27;d used it and loved it, but the price was just too much for me.</li>
            <li>It comes with two useful attachments to diffuse or target the air, both work fine.</li>
            <li>The locking cool shot is nice, but how long do most people need the cool shot?  </li>
            <li>Giving it 3 stars as amazon/hot tools allowed me to return is for a full refund after the return period ended.</li>
            <li>Everything else about this works well too - air flow, cool button, etc.  </li>
            <li>I will tolerate anything for that cool shot.  </li>
            <li>- cool shot button in a spot where I seem to accidentally activate it a lot.  </li>
            <li>With this dryer, the cool button can be turned on by hitting the cool button which stays depressed even if you are not holding it.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I wanted a quiet hair dryer and the reviews were really good.</li>
            <li>The Cool button broke after a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>This works well for quick styling (like bangs) or for a full blowout.</li>
            <li>Other than that it was great.</li>
            <li>Does a very good job drying and the most important feature is that it&#x27;s very quiet in comparison to every other hair dryer we have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Most dryers produce a high pitch whine that has got to be exacting some degree of hearing loss.</li>
            <li>Very light and relatively quiet but feels cheap.  </li>
            <li>Nice dryer and quiet!</li>
            <li>Nice and quiet, drys well, according to my wife.  </li>
            <li>It is colorful which she also was attracted to.</li>
            <li>It is powerful yet</li>
            <li>I needed a powerful dryer that was not loud.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That alone is worth the price of the unit, but it is also well built</li>
            <li>so if I want to blow dry my hair with the warm or cool setting</li>
            <li>I cannot figure how they advertise right on the box that this dryer \\&quot;reduces drying time up to 50%.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>It is quiet and light-weight, and the locking cool shot feature is handy, but I was expecting dry time to be better.</li>
            <li>While this is an excellent, well-known and trusted brand, this dryer was a huge disappointment for me.  </li>
            <li>absolutely love that not only do you get high and low blowing options, but you also get the option for hot, warm and cool air settings.  </li>
            <li>I own other Hot Tools hair products and love them, so when I needed a replacement for my Chi blowe dryer, I went with this Hot Tools Professional dryer.  </li>
            <li>so I gave it to my grand-daughter who loves it very much</li>
            <li>Love not having to spend all that extra time just drying my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ll find out why it cost more than a regular $25 rig as time goes on.</li>
            <li>Not quite as quiet as I thought, but quieter then most.</li>
            <li>Not as hot as some dryers</li>
            <li>hot shower.  </li>
            <li>hot flashes.  </li>
            <li>This blowdryer is quiet, lightweight, and stylish.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect to not hear anything, as it does make a sound, but just not as loud that you&#x27;d have to shout to be heard.</li>
            <li>also use this to dry my dogs since it doesn&#x27;t spook them as much as my more powerful and louder hair dryer did.  </li>
            <li>It has a cool button on it so that the only air that comes out is cool</li>
            <li>Not the best or the worst good hair dryer</li>
            <li>My step mom works at a salon, and she said that I got a pretty decent hair dryer for the price I paid!</li>
            <li>After 18 months the COOL blast function which I  never turned on is suddenly stuck on (have to hold it in for HOT!) .</li>
            <li>quiet and dries hair quickly!</li>
            <li>Quiet and light.</li>
            <li>The lesser sound comes from a slower motor, I think.  </li>
            <li>it drys the hair fast.  </li>
            <li>My arms and hands are not tired or in pain after drying my hair.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t perspire as much, it helps.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent buy only because the price is significantly lower than the real quite comps.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and it took forever to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>SO far the Hot Tools is still running, so for the price</li>
            <li>The other great thing is that my wife says it actually dries her hair faster than the obnoxiously loud old one did.</li>
            <li>This new one is so much quieter and is not shrill or high pitched so problem solved.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t do a blow-out most days, and usually only do a quick minute or two to start drying and style the front with a round brush, so I probably wouldn&#x27;t notice as much.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I think the reason is that the fan inside turns slower and does not produce the bothersome high pitch whine noise.  </li>
            <li>The concentrator nozzle &amp;#34;locks&amp;#34; in with four prongs, which means it only sites straight horizontal or straight vertical, so you can&#x27;t sit it an an angle to account for maybe not holding the dryer straight, this is my biggest pet peeve about it.  .</li>
            <li>It is powerful yet qiet enough</li>
            <li>Why is it so hard to find a good lightweight quiet dryer?</li>
            <li>It gets plenty hot enough to dry my hair quickly -</li>
            <li>Especially it being Hot Tools.</li>
            <li>You can pay a lot more for a dryer that does no better.</li>
            <li>Better than dryers I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li>I can turn it on with the cats sitting near the bathroom watching me and they don&#x27;t run away in terror!</li>
            <li>I originally had the Centrix Q zone which is much sturdier and felt like it dried my hair quicker</li>
            <li>: It really is very lightweight and quiet; It gets very hot (necessary for my hair); There are two speeds and two heat settings; The cool button stays down when you press it.</li>
            <li>This one is much better, quieter and once your hair is dry, the ionic cold setting gives hair a nice finishing shine.</li>
            <li>In other words, you have to hold the cool button down in order for it to blow cool air.  </li>
            <li>I guess the 50% depends on what you are comparing it to as far as drying time and/or brand.  </li>
            <li>It really is very quiet, and handles very well.</li>
            <li>It dries fast and the noise is very low, just as promised.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something that my 3 year old would use that does not scare her.  </li>
            <li>so much for whisper quiet!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not jet-engine loud.</li>
            <li>So I bought this one and am ok with it, but not thrilled.</li>
            <li>(Although I didn&#x27;t realize that this would be an advantage, it is a lot easier to set in a style when you don&#x27;t have to hold down the cool button.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I not only use the cool setting when I am already too hot and still need some air to dry my hair, but I use it to quickly dry my hair spray after I have sprayed some on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>found it!&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend, I am up before my husband and he was constantly complaining about my previously loud dryer.</li>
            <li>I like to have high heat and low blow from a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected from this product description.  </li>
            <li>Also, I wish it were a little smaller to carry on trips, but the light weight makes up for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The dryer is whisper quite and the only complaint I have is that it is heavier than most dryers I have used.</li>
            <li>I had a hard time finding a reasonably priced dryer that was quiet and had a cool air setting.  </li>
            <li>Only high and low for heat and high and low for speed settings.  </li>
            <li>I personally like this dryer, but there is no doubt it is not as powerful as other blow dryers.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;multiple heat/speed settings\\&quot; consist of high or low.  </li>
            <li>Used half day and it started making a funny noise, and cannot be returned..</li>
            <li>So I guess if you want this because it is quieter than other dryers, which it is, then you need to be ready to give up some of its blowing</li>
            <li>This unit is much quieter than any other dryer I have heard.  </li>
            <li>The unit does get completely hot as controlled by the locking cool shot button which maybe some of those folks had locked in the wrong position.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely much quieter than the average hair drier.</li>
            <li>I put the diffuser on the end, set for high heat and low blow, and in 10 minutes, my curls are just dry enough and not frizzy!</li>
            <li>It is top heavy and too small.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to not hear anything, as it does make a sound, but just not as loud that you&#x27;d have to shout to be heard.</li>
            <li> also use this to dry my dogs since it doesn&#x27;t spook them as much as my more powerful and louder hair dryer did.  </li>
            <li> It has a cool button on it so that the only air that comes out is cool</li>
            <li> Not the best or the worst good hair dryer</li>
            <li> My step mom works at a salon, and she said that I got a pretty decent hair dryer for the price I paid!</li>
            <li> After 18 months the COOL blast function which I  never turned on is suddenly stuck on (have to hold it in for HOT!) .</li>
            <li> quiet and dries hair quickly!</li>
            <li> Quiet and light.</li>
            <li> The lesser sound comes from a slower motor, I think.  </li>
            <li> it drys the hair fast.  </li>
            <li> My arms and hands are not tired or in pain after drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t perspire as much, it helps.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent buy only because the price is significantly lower than the real quite comps.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and it took forever to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> SO far the Hot Tools is still running, so for the price</li>
            <li> The other great thing is that my wife says it actually dries her hair faster than the obnoxiously loud old one did.</li>
            <li> This new one is so much quieter and is not shrill or high pitched so problem solved.  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t do a blow-out most days, and usually only do a quick minute or two to start drying and style the front with a round brush, so I probably wouldn&#x27;t notice as much.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I think the reason is that the fan inside turns slower and does not produce the bothersome high pitch whine noise.  </li>
            <li> The concentrator nozzle &amp;#34;locks&amp;#34; in with four prongs, which means it only sites straight horizontal or straight vertical, so you can&#x27;t sit it an an angle to account for maybe not holding the dryer straight, this is my biggest pet peeve about it.  .</li>
            <li> It is powerful yet qiet enough</li>
            <li> Why is it so hard to find a good lightweight quiet dryer?</li>
            <li> It gets plenty hot enough to dry my hair quickly -</li>
            <li> Especially it being Hot Tools.</li>
            <li> You can pay a lot more for a dryer that does no better.</li>
            <li> Better than dryers I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> I can turn it on with the cats sitting near the bathroom watching me and they don&#x27;t run away in terror!</li>
            <li> I originally had the Centrix Q zone which is much sturdier and felt like it dried my hair quicker</li>
            <li> : It really is very lightweight and quiet; It gets very hot (necessary for my hair); There are two speeds and two heat settings; The cool button stays down when you press it.</li>
            <li> This one is much better, quieter and once your hair is dry, the ionic cold setting gives hair a nice finishing shine.</li>
            <li> In other words, you have to hold the cool button down in order for it to blow cool air.  </li>
            <li> I guess the 50% depends on what you are comparing it to as far as drying time and/or brand.  </li>
            <li> It really is very quiet, and handles very well.</li>
            <li> It dries fast and the noise is very low, just as promised.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something that my 3 year old would use that does not scare her.  </li>
            <li> so much for whisper quiet!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not jet-engine loud.</li>
            <li> So I bought this one and am ok with it, but not thrilled.</li>
            <li> (Although I didn&#x27;t realize that this would be an advantage, it is a lot easier to set in a style when you don&#x27;t have to hold down the cool button.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I not only use the cool setting when I am already too hot and still need some air to dry my hair, but I use it to quickly dry my hair spray after I have sprayed some on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> found it!&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend, I am up before my husband and he was constantly complaining about my previously loud dryer.</li>
            <li> I like to have high heat and low blow from a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected from this product description.  </li>
            <li> Also, I wish it were a little smaller to carry on trips, but the light weight makes up for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The dryer is whisper quite and the only complaint I have is that it is heavier than most dryers I have used.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding a reasonably priced dryer that was quiet and had a cool air setting.  </li>
            <li> Only high and low for heat and high and low for speed settings.  </li>
            <li> I personally like this dryer, but there is no doubt it is not as powerful as other blow dryers.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;multiple heat/speed settings\\&quot; consist of high or low.  </li>
            <li> Used half day and it started making a funny noise, and cannot be returned..</li>
            <li> So I guess if you want this because it is quieter than other dryers, which it is, then you need to be ready to give up some of its blowing</li>
            <li> This unit is much quieter than any other dryer I have heard.  </li>
            <li> The unit does get completely hot as controlled by the locking cool shot button which maybe some of those folks had locked in the wrong position.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely much quieter than the average hair drier.</li>
            <li> I put the diffuser on the end, set for high heat and low blow, and in 10 minutes, my curls are just dry enough and not frizzy!</li>
            <li> It is top heavy and too small.</li>
            <li> I stopped using my old hairdryer due to it giving me a headache with the noise.</li>
            <li> However the Centrix did break suddenly after 4 years, for no apparent reason (I didn&#x27;t drop it or travel, etc).  </li>
            <li> and I think it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is its large size.  </li>
            <li> I have ultra thick and coarse hair, it usually takes me 45 to 60 minutes to dry my hair, with this hair dryer I have been able to dry and style within 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> And while not as quiet as I expected, it is still an improvement on noise (maybe why the lower power doesn&#x27;t bother me, quieter was a big priority for me).  </li>
            <li> She hates loud noises and trying to dry her hair was a big bunch of trouble.</li>
            <li> The unit is heavy as expected, but the strange thing is that the manufacturer&#x27;s handle is not ergonomically correct -- like they put in on backwards (facing the wrong direction) without any indents for gripping!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t blow that hard, really, so should be</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife because her old one was so loud and shrill that I couldn&#x27;t be in the same room with her when she was using it for fear it would trigger a migraine.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not a lot of air volume and it takes a long time to dry hair using it.</li>
            <li> however long it takes to get things dry.</li>
            <li> Low power and isn&#x27;t as quite as some other units.</li>
            <li> Too bad -- I love the quiet.</li>
            <li> it does not blow my hair all over while I am trying to dry</li>
            <li> This dryer is definitely quiet but how could it not be with the little bit of air it blows.</li>
            <li> Very quiet and dried my shoulder length hair in no time.  </li>
            <li> It does take a few extra minutes to do a blow-out</li>
            <li> Now she grabs this dryer and tries to do it herself.</li>
            <li> Heat stopped working after only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I find I don&#x27;t need the concentrator one even when I&#x27;m blowing my (thin, wavy) hair straight, but those with thicker or curlier hair may need it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this hair dryer for a few months</li>
            <li> The vendor shipped the product within the expected time frame.  </li>
            <li> Dry time is just average.</li>
            <li> It takes SLIGHTLY longer for me to dry the hair at lower heat, because I have alot of it.</li>
            <li> Obviously i am too lazy to return it</li>
            <li> (I have wavy/curly hair depending on the season), but nothing extreme.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting used to using my other hand to push the buttons.</li>
            <li> so I can hear the phone doorbell or other sounds while I am using the dryer.  </li>
            <li> Not worth $25 to return it for repair.</li>
            <li> (thick Asian hair).  </li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s a little hard to work the buttons because they are on the back of the handle.</li>
            <li> Both the handle and the dryer are oddly shaped.</li>
            <li> It was a little heavy for me</li>
            <li> I never thought I would use the locking cold shot, but I really like that feature.  </li>
            <li> Broke a few days after the return period.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: June, 2012: Hairdryer stopped working after a few months.</li>
            <li> No problems or issues as described in a few postings.</li>
            <li> This dryer is wonderfully quiet, but I returned it because of the poor design.</li>
            <li> It is very large and very heavy and extremely ugly.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not a very effective hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The dryer works and is relatively quiet; however the controls are on the wrong side of the handle so that you must stop drying to make any change.  </li>
            <li> Not satisfied AT ALL.</li>
            <li> Wife said the handle was hard to hold, returned the item...</li>
            <li> So, I find it&#x27;s hard to hold.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not too hard to hold over your head for</li>
            <li> means it is hard to hold upright and manipulate.</li>
            <li> Hard to handle.</li>
            <li> I found the controls on the back of the handle to be awkward, too.  </li>
            <li> It added at least 50% to my drying time.  </li>
            <li> My hand accidentally turns them off at least once each time I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> Even the \\&quot;high\\&quot; temp and speed is extremely slow.  </li>
            <li> But if someone has thick hair, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because i wanted a quiet one, and it would be if it wasn&#x27;t for the annoying rattling.</li>
            <li> it is a bit heavy and awkward</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> Unfortunately mine has a horrible rattle coming from the motor that is as loud as the motor (if not</li>
            <li> I might of just got a bad one, not sure.</li>
            <li> After about two months something started to rattle inside and then the cold shot button stopped working.  </li>
            <li> The buttons are also awkwardly placed.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> Expensive blow dryer for it to break after a month!!!!!!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Quiet and light. Seems to be built fine and does the job well. Low setting works well for drying hair</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 6 months. Not worth $25 to return it for repair.</li>
            <li> Nice dryer and quiet!</li>
            <li> While this is an excellent, well-known and trusted brand, this dryer was a huge disappointment for me.  I own other Hot Tools hair products and love them, so when I needed a replacement for my Chi blowe dryer, I went with this Hot Tools Professional dryer.  The \\&quot;multiple heat/speed settings\\&quot; consist of high or low.  Even the \\&quot;high\\&quot; temp and speed is extremely slow.  I have fine hair, and it took forever to dry my hair.  The locking cool shot is nice, but how long do most people need the cool shot?  The concentrator is not adjustable to different angles.  It locks in place, and there&#x27;s no adjusting it to a different angle.  I found the controls on the back of the handle to be awkward, too.  I cannot figure how they advertise right on the box that this dryer \\&quot;reduces drying time up to 50%.\\&quot;  It added at least 50% to my drying time.  I guess the 50% depends on what you are comparing it to as far as drying time and/or brand.  It is a fairly quiet dryer, so if that is your only criteria, it might work for you.  I have gone back to a Chi; once again, it did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Wife said the handle was hard to hold, returned the item...</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer! My step mom works at a salon, and she said that I got a pretty decent hair dryer for the price I paid! Especially it being Hot Tools. It is so quiet! I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> It makes a rattling noise inside the motor as if i was sent one of the defected ones or something. I bought it because i wanted a quiet one, and it would be if it wasn&#x27;t for the annoying rattling. Obviously i am too lazy to return it so I&#x27;m just dealing with it...</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement. It is quiet and light-weight, and the locking cool shot feature is handy, but I was expecting dry time to be better. Dry time is just average.</li>
            <li> The dryer works and is relatively quiet; however the controls are on the wrong side of the handle so that you must stop drying to make any change.  It is very large and very heavy and extremely ugly.  I have to hide it in a drawer so that I don&#x27;t have to look at it in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Broke at 35 days after purchase, so can&#x27;t return it!  Expensive blow dryer for it to break after a month!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have now bought 3 of these, for myself and friends, and we are all satisfied.  For the amount of drying power they put out these dryers are astonishingly quiet.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have ultra thick and coarse hair, it usually takes me 45 to 60 minutes to dry my hair, with this hair dryer I have been able to dry and style within 15 minutes. Love not having to spend all that extra time just drying my hair. Great purchase for me!</li>
            <li> This was a great hairdryer while it lasted.  Very quiet and dried my shoulder length hair in no time.  After about two months something started to rattle inside and then the cold shot button stopped working.  Giving it 3 stars as amazon/hot tools allowed me to return is for a full refund after the return period ended.</li>
            <li> Why is it so hard to find a good lightweight quiet dryer? This one is not it. I also don&#x27;t like the fact that the buttons are on the front kind of where your hand is when you hold it. It is fairly quiet though.</li>
            <li> It really is very quiet, and handles very well. I haven&#x27;t used a hair dryer for a while, I wanted to see if I could go with one. Well now I want to let my hair grow, so I will need something to keep it under control and looking good.</li>
            <li> Good seller, but product in not whispering. Need improvement on blower.</li>
            <li> Broke a few days after the return period.  Piece broke off inside dryer and it stopped heating.  Not satisfied AT ALL.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is the quietest one I&#x27;ve had in years.  My husband always said that they sounded like a jet engine taking off but this one definitely does not.  Everything else about this works well too - air flow, cool button, etc.  Some people have said that they dont like the buttons on the outside but I like that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quieter, but still sounds funky, like cheap bushings or something.  The lesser sound comes from a slower motor, I think.  It doesn&#x27;t blow that hard, really, so should be quieter.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ll find out why it cost more than a regular $25 rig as time goes on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read a couple of not so good reviews before buying this dryer, but honestly can&#x27;t find anything to complain about!  It dries fast and the noise is very low, just as promised.  What a great purchase!</li>
            <li> Not quite as quiet as I thought, but quieter then most.</li>
            <li> Nice and quiet, drys well, according to my wife.  She loves it and it was a great gift to her!</li>
            <li> Love the locking cool shot.  Not as hot as some dryers but I prefer that.  it is a bit heavy and awkward but you get used to that.  I will tolerate anything for that cool shot.  hot shower.  hot flashes.  COOL SHOT!</li>
            <li> love this hair dryer!  quiet and dries hair quickly!</li>
            <li> Awesome! This is my second one and I love it!! Wouldn&#x27;t ever get a different one!</li>
            <li> (Updated) I originally bought this for my daughter because I didn&#x27;t want her to wind up deaf like her mom. It&#x27;s definitely much quieter than the average hair drier. However, it&#x27;s not a very effective hair dryer. There&#x27;s not a lot of air volume and it takes a long time to dry hair using it. I guess that&#x27;s the trade off.</li>
            <li> I personally like this dryer, but there is no doubt it is not as powerful as other blow dryers.  And while not as quiet as I expected, it is still an improvement on noise (maybe why the lower power doesn&#x27;t bother me, quieter was a big priority for me).  It does take a few extra minutes to do a blow-out (I have wavy/curly hair depending on the season), but nothing extreme.  I also don&#x27;t do a blow-out most days, and usually only do a quick minute or two to start drying and style the front with a round brush, so I probably wouldn&#x27;t notice as much.  Only high and low for heat and high and low for speed settings.  I might consider buying this again, though I hope they re-design to fix the cons below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - cool shot button in a spot where I seem to accidentally activate it a lot.  The concentrator nozzle &amp;#34;locks&amp;#34; in with four prongs, which means it only sites straight horizontal or straight vertical, so you can&#x27;t sit it an an angle to account for maybe not holding the dryer straight, this is my biggest pet peeve about it.  .</li>
            <li> noisey-constant buzz on all speed settings from the beginning  (bought it because it was advertised as quiet-&lt;br /&gt;wont accept a return as return date had exp.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful hair dryer. I was looking for something that my 3 year old would use that does not scare her.  She hates loud noises and trying to dry her hair was a big bunch of trouble. Now she grabs this dryer and tries to do it herself. It has a cool button on it so that the only air that comes out is cool so no worries about burning. It is colorful which she also was attracted to. If you need a dryer for a toddler that is quiet... this is it.</li>
            <li> So quiet and drys hair well</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has all the features I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It really is very lightweight and quiet; It gets very hot (necessary for my hair); There are two speeds and two heat settings; The cool button stays down when you press it. (Although I didn&#x27;t realize that this would be an advantage, it is a lot easier to set in a style when you don&#x27;t have to hold down the cool button.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It&#x27;s a little hard to work the buttons because they are on the back of the handle. I&#x27;m used to controling them with my finger tips. I&#x27;m getting used to using my other hand to push the buttons. Also, I wish it were a little smaller to carry on trips, but the light weight makes up for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: June, 2012: Hairdryer stopped working after a few months. I contacted the company, but did not hear back. Too bad. It was a very nice dryer.</li>
            <li> FABULOUS!!!  I have lots and lots of super-fine, curly hair.  I like to have high heat and low blow from a hair dryer.  This one is perfect!  I put the diffuser on the end, set for high heat and low blow, and in 10 minutes, my curls are just dry enough and not frizzy!</li>
            <li> I already own this dryer. Purchased this one for a backup. The box was damaged on one corner. This dryer seems noisier than the one I previously own. Hope it holds up as well as the one I own!</li>
            <li> Used half day and it started making a funny noise, and cannot be returned..so much for whisper quiet!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately mine has a horrible rattle coming from the motor that is as loud as the motor (if not louder).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is going back. Will update when replacement arrives to see if it was just a 1 time problem.</li>
            <li> Most amazing hair dryer I have ever had.  Drying time and noise are greatly reduced.  Better than I ever imagined.</li>
            <li> This blowdryer is quiet, lightweight, and stylish.  It is so nice to be able to blowdry hair without it being so noisy. it drys the hair fast.  i will be recommending this hair dryer to all.</li>
            <li> Low power and isn&#x27;t as quite as some other units. It&#x27;s a decent buy only because the price is significantly lower than the real quite comps.</li>
            <li> Updating review. After 18 months the COOL blast function which I  never turned on is suddenly stuck on (have to hold it in for HOT!) . Wish I had returned it instead of writing an OK review:  I always wanted a &#x27;quiet&#x27; hairdryer.  This unit doesn&#x27;t have that tell-tale high-pitched whine - just a low rattle-noise.  SUCH a relief from noise pollution. The maximum heat setting is not too hot and it is perfect for my fine hair and won&#x27;t damage it.  It takes SLIGHTLY longer for me to dry the hair at lower heat, because I have alot of it. The unit is heavy as expected, but the strange thing is that the manufacturer&#x27;s handle is not ergonomically correct -- like they put in on backwards (facing the wrong direction) without any indents for gripping! So, I find it&#x27;s hard to hold.  I would not want to use this every day (I use 2-3 days a week), so it&#x27;s good for my purposes.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis and this dryer is very light weight.  My arms and hands are not tired or in pain after drying my hair.  It is powerful yet qiet enough so I can hear the phone doorbell or other sounds while I am using the dryer.  It is powerful yet it does not blow my hair all over while I am trying to dry/style my hair.</li>
            <li> Heat stopped working after only a few weeks. it is quieter than most blow dryers.</li>
            <li> Does a very good job drying and the most important feature is that it&#x27;s very quiet in comparison to every other hair dryer we have ever owned. Most dryers produce a high pitch whine that has got to be exacting some degree of hearing loss. So if you want your hair dried and want to do it without waking up the whole house, this is your dryer.</li>
            <li> You can pay a lot more for a dryer that does no better. Great temperature control and very quiet. Just as advertised.</li>
            <li> The dryer is whisper quite and the only complaint I have is that it is heavier than most dryers I have used.</li>
            <li> very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. Better than dryers I&#x27;ve had in the past. No problems or issues as described in a few postings. The unit does get completely hot as controlled by the locking cool shot button which maybe some of those folks had locked in the wrong position.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. I must say it is very quiet.</li>
            <li> The blow dryer was very quiet. However, I didn&#x27;t even have it a week before it blew up on me. Other than that it was great. I might of just got a bad one, not sure.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair so this dryer works well in drying my hair but it takes longer to do so.  But if someone has thick hair, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it.  So I guess if you want this because it is quieter than other dryers, which it is, then you need to be ready to give up some of its blowing power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love that not only do you get high and low blowing options, but you also get the option for hot, warm and cool air settings.  I had a hard time finding a reasonably priced dryer that was quiet and had a cool air setting.  The warm and cool settings come in handy in the Texas summers when you are getting ready.  After you shower and get dressed, you are already feeling warm so if I want to blow dry my hair with the warm or cool setting so I don&#x27;t perspire as much, it helps.  I especially love that the cool button stays in place as opposed to some dryers that have cool &amp;#34;shot&amp;#34; settings.  In other words, you have to hold the cool button down in order for it to blow cool air.  With this dryer, the cool button can be turned on by hitting the cool button which stays depressed even if you are not holding it. I not only use the cool setting when I am already too hot and still need some air to dry my hair, but I use it to quickly dry my hair spray after I have sprayed some on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this to dry my dogs since it doesn&#x27;t spook them as much as my more powerful and louder hair dryer did.  Of course, it also helps that I can choose warm air to ensure I do not burn them.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, easy to use dryer.  It was a little heavy for me so I gave it to my grand-daughter who loves it very much</li>
            <li> This works well for quick styling (like bangs) or for a full blowout. It&#x27;s relatively lightweight so it&#x27;s not too hard to hold over your head for however long it takes to get things dry. It comes with two useful attachments to diffuse or target the air, both work fine. I find I don&#x27;t need the concentrator one even when I&#x27;m blowing my (thin, wavy) hair straight, but those with thicker or curlier hair may need it. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s &amp;#34;whisper&amp;#34; quiet but it&#x27;s not jet-engine loud. I can turn it on with the cats sitting near the bathroom watching me and they don&#x27;t run away in terror!</li>
            <li> This is the most lightest and quietest hair dryer that I have ever used. I actually enjoy styling with it. I stopped using my old hairdryer due to it giving me a headache with the noise. This one is much better, quieter and once your hair is dry, the ionic cold setting gives hair a nice finishing shine. Very easy to style with this. Don&#x27;t expect to not hear anything, as it does make a sound, but just not as loud that you&#x27;d have to shout to be heard. You can also still hear people talking around you, which is nice!</li>
            <li> This dryer is wonderfully quiet, but I returned it because of the poor design. Both the handle and the dryer are oddly shaped. The head is weighted so that it falls backward as you hold it and the angle of the grip means it is hard to hold upright and manipulate. The buttons are also awkwardly placed. Perhaps it works for hair dressers since they are standing over the head of their customers, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me at home. Too bad -- I love the quiet.</li>
            <li> The quietest hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever heard.  I has a solid feel to it and looks well made.  It gets plenty hot enough to dry my hair quickly - I switch it to low after a minute or so.  The buttons on the front make it easy to see the settings.  I never thought I would use the locking cold shot, but I really like that feature.  The only negative is its large size.  Overall, a great hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Very light and relatively quiet but feels cheap.  There is a part inside that rolls around and it makes me think the dryer is going to break any minute.  I originally had the Centrix Q zone which is much sturdier and felt like it dried my hair quicker (thick Asian hair).  However the Centrix did break suddenly after 4 years, for no apparent reason (I didn&#x27;t drop it or travel, etc).  I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend $80 again. SO far the Hot Tools is still running, so for the price, I guess it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this hair dryer for a few months so I cannot write anything regarding durability yet, but it is a very quiet hairdryer.  Do not expect gale force winds with this product, but it is a good trade off for my purposes.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected from this product description.  The vendor shipped the product within the expected time frame.  I am happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I needed a powerful dryer that was not loud.&lt;br /&gt;I found it!&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend, I am up before my husband and he was constantly complaining about my previously loud dryer.</li>
            <li> Not the best or the worst good hair dryer but I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one.  It is a quiet dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted a quiet hair dryer and the reviews were really good. This dryer is definitely quiet but how could it not be with the little bit of air it blows. I had really wanted the Rusk Speed Freak because I&#x27;d used it and loved it, but the price was just too much for me. So I bought this one and am ok with it, but not thrilled. I also don&#x27;t like where the controls are located. My hand accidentally turns them off at least once each time I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife because her old one was so loud and shrill that I couldn&#x27;t be in the same room with her when she was using it for fear it would trigger a migraine.  This new one is so much quieter and is not shrill or high pitched so problem solved.  The other great thing is that my wife says it actually dries her hair faster than the obnoxiously loud old one did.</li>
            <li> The Cool button broke after a couple of weeks and I had to duct tape it pressed in so there would be any heat at all.</li>
            <li> This unit is much quieter than any other dryer I have heard.  I think the reason is that the fan inside turns slower and does not produce the bothersome high pitch whine noise.  That alone is worth the price of the unit, but it is also well built and I think it will last a long time.  Works great.</li>
            <li> It is top heavy and too small. Hard to handle.</li>
