            <li>Best thing: it doesn&#x27;t burn!</li>
            <li>the best one for me is Tissue Moisture.</li>
            <li>Oh and if you read the article, the comments are very good too.  </li>
            <li>Not as great tasting but a great value.</li>
            <li>My dental checkup was great with no gum problems.  </li>
            <li>So nice to ditch the poisons!</li>
            <li>tastes good and it&#x27;s not so toxic as the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Great refreshing and healthier mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I am 100% satisfied!</li>
            <li>kind</li>
            <li>Tastes great and leaves my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the taste of this stuff, but it works great.  </li>
            <li>SO glad Amazon carries this line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brand for several years and am having wonderful checkups at the Dentist.</li>
            <li>I love this Rinse.  </li>
            <li>This product fits that category! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I stumbled across this mouth wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to use more products with ingredients I can pronounce, and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Still looking for my favorite mouthwash.</li>
            <li>And my gum doesn&#x27;t bother me any more.</li>
            <li>its not horribly minty-</li>
            <li>Okay for me.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think it work better than any of the others</li>
            <li>my favorite mouthwash..</li>
            <li>Overall, the mouthwash doesn&#x27;t taste quite as good, but is still excellent at keeping my gums healthy (I can tell if I skip using it) and is pleasant enough that I will keep buying it; how nice to have such a good alternative to flouride and alcohol!</li>
            <li>After the rinsing it leaves my mouth feeling nice and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available as an add-on</li>
            <li>Most importantly, this product works.</li>
            <li>Takes time to get used to the aftertaste, otherwise great product with no other burning sensation.</li>
            <li>I was previously using a hydrogen peroxide mouthwash which was great, but stopped using it when the price went up to over $12 a bottle!</li>
            <li>Great mouth wash seems to burn the germs off my tongue without feeling like you entire mouth is on fire.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the flavor, and can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s better at keeping my mouth fresh than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t burn, yet your mouth still feels clean after rinsing with it</li>
            <li>The price here is way better than the Whole Foods price too.</li>
            <li>It leaves my breath smelling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>mild mouth wash.</li>
            <li>mild minty taste</li>
            <li>A PubMed article studying polysorbate 80 said that it was a causative agent of a pregnant woman going into anaphylactic shock.</li>
            <li>No lingering aftertaste and breath stays fresh for hours…</li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel fresh without any stinging or unnatural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I always look for health care products that are organic or the most natural.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my mouth feeling fresh, even when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>This don&#x27;t burn my mouth while using this, but this will keep me fresh.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, much cheaper than the local stores.</li>
            <li>So with that in mind, I am not going to be ordering this product because as so many think here that it&#x27;s a natural ingredient product, it is not.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to pick up a bottle whenever I don&#x27;t have enough items in my cart to qualify for free shipping.</li>
            <li>i like Healthy Dentist products in general and</li>
            <li>Combine that with the peace of mind that you are using natural ingredients and no harsh chemicals and it has become popular in my house.</li>
            <li>This product has a nice flavor and I greatly appreciate not having all the added artificial color, flavors, and chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, there is Polysorbate 80 instead of the Betaine.</li>
            <li>It really works to help my gums!</li>
            <li>This stuff seems to be working pretty well, except my gums are bleeding a bit still-</li>
            <li>The only difference with this mouth wash is you have to shake before use and swish for good solid minute to get the desired affect.</li>
            <li>I really like this one.</li>
            <li>really like that it has no alcohol, which I cannot stand.</li>
            <li>I do really like that</li>
            <li>You really have to be on your guard today.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how many germs this is killing when I use it, but the flavor is mild and it doesn&#x27;t hurt to use.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my most recent order tasted slightly different and checked the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Perfect if you want to avoid all the unnecessary things they put in other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li>Positives:  Free of artificial coloring &amp; works nicely.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 12 year old son who has braces and he likes it</li>
            <li>Purified water, vegetable glycerine, ale vera gel, xylitol, natural flavors, oliviamidopropyl betaine, citric acid, potassium citrate, grapefruit seed extract.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping given a few weeks with this that will clear up, but if not, well, this mouthwash is okay but not fantastic.</li>
            <li>Recommended by my dentist and works much, much better than the the brand she previously recommended which left dark stains on my teeth.</li>
            <li>I could not find much information on the Polysorbate 80 except that it is safer than the other Polysorbates.</li>

            <li> I have been using this for about a year and got to like it a lot. I noticed that my most recent order tasted slightly different and checked the ingredients. Sure enough, there is Polysorbate 80 instead of the Betaine. I could not find much information on the Polysorbate 80 except that it is safer than the other Polysorbates. Overall, the mouthwash doesn&#x27;t taste quite as good, but is still excellent at keeping my gums healthy (I can tell if I skip using it) and is pleasant enough that I will keep buying it; how nice to have such a good alternative to flouride and alcohol!</li>
            <li> This antiseptic mouthwash does the job, without the powerful mint taste and uncomfortable burning sensation. It leaves my breath smelling fresh and clean. I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but I like it.</li>
            <li> Hard to find out in town. SO glad Amazon carries this line. I&#x27;ve used this brand for several years and am having wonderful checkups at the Dentist.</li>

            <li> Positives:  Free of artificial coloring &amp; works nicely.  Negatives:  contains betaine.  Active ingredient:  methanol.  List of inactive ingredients:  Purified water, vegetable glycerine, ale vera gel, xylitol, natural flavors, oliviamidopropyl betaine, citric acid, potassium citrate, grapefruit seed extract.</li>
            <li> I love this Rinse.  It makes my mouth feel fresh without any stinging or unnatural ingredients.  Plus it has Xylitol in it!  The price here is way better than the Whole Foods price too.</li>
            <li> I always look for health care products that are organic or the most natural.  This product fits that category! :)</li>

            <li> I really like this one. This don&#x27;t burn my mouth while using this, but this will keep me fresh. I love it.</li>
            <li> Great mouth wash seems to burn the germs off my tongue without feeling like you entire mouth is on fire. The only difference with this mouth wash is you have to shake before use and swish for good solid minute to get the desired affect. I dont know if it kills all the germs in your mouth but it will kill those germs on your tongue at least.</li>

            <li> Most importantly, this product works. Combine that with the peace of mind that you are using natural ingredients and no harsh chemicals and it has become popular in my house.</li>
            <li> mild mouth wash. Doesn&#x27;t burn, yet your mouth still feels clean after rinsing with it</li>
            <li> I started to develop periodontitis, and my hygienist requested to see me every four months. After I used this mouth rinse for a few weeks, my hygienist said my gum had improved a lot, and that she only needed to see me every six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that it has no alcohol, which I cannot stand. After the rinsing it leaves my mouth feeling nice and clean. And my gum doesn&#x27;t bother me any more.</li>
            <li> I was previously using a hydrogen peroxide mouthwash which was great, but stopped using it when the price went up to over $12 a bottle! Eek! This stuff seems to be working pretty well, except my gums are bleeding a bit still- a problem I have when not using mouthwash. I&#x27;m hoping given a few weeks with this that will clear up, but if not, well, this mouthwash is okay but not fantastic. I do really like that its not horribly minty- I hate mint flavorings and this one doesn&#x27;t make me want to gag.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice flavor and I greatly appreciate not having all the added artificial color, flavors, and chemicals.  It has enough sting to do the job but not so much that you want to spit it out after a few seconds.</li>
            <li> This variety doesn&#x27;t burn in my mouth like one of the others. Despite using it daily I still have some bleeding gums.</li>
            <li> Tastes great and leaves my mouth feeling clean. So nice to ditch the poisons!</li>
            <li> i like Healthy Dentist products in general and the best one for me is Tissue Moisture.</li>
            <li> Takes time to get used to the aftertaste, otherwise great product with no other burning sensation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how many germs this is killing when I use it, but the flavor is mild and it doesn&#x27;t hurt to use. I also appreciate the absence of ingredients I&#x27;m not overfond of.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, much cheaper than the local stores. Perfect if you want to avoid all the unnecessary things they put in other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> Okay for me.  Didn&#x27;t think it work better than any of the others</li>
            <li> my favorite mouthwash..mild minty taste</li>
            <li> I was going to purchase this product here but decided to read the reviews here.  The one thing that screamed out at me was the mention of Polysorbate 80 over and over again. I researched it and in this attached article it says &amp;#34;an increased risk of blood clots, stroke, heart attack, heart failure, and of tumor growth or recurrence in patients with certain types of cancer. A PubMed article studying polysorbate 80 said that it was a causative agent of a pregnant woman going into anaphylactic shock. In addition, studies have shown that it could be especially harmful to patients with Crohn’s disease.&amp;#34;  So with that in mind, I am not going to be ordering this product because as so many think here that it&#x27;s a natural ingredient product, it is not.  Shame on them for marketing it as if it were.  You really have to be on your guard today.  Oh and if you read the article, the comments are very good too.  http://thegoodhuman.com/2012/05/31/what-is-polysorbate-80/</li>
            <li> tastes good and it&#x27;s not so toxic as the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; kind</li>
