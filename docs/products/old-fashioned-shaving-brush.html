            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you a beginning &amp;#34;safety razor shaver&amp;#34; like I was, it is a good deal to see if you will like it and how your skin will react.</li>
            <li>But quality is really good, compared to the price.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good bargain</li>

            <li>and it lathers well while feeling nice on my face.</li>

            <li>I guess its ok for the price.</li>
            <li>I love almost everything about the brush.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>It was the most inexpensive one I could find&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Husband bought it with a safety razor, so he could be more like his grandfather.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve reviewed this before, it&#x27;s why I bought 4 more.</li>
            <li>Great price and works very well.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good brush for the money.</li>
            <li>I wanted to really give it a good workout before posting a review, but I&#x27;ve been using this for 6+ months</li>
            <li>works amazing and was super cheap in comparison...</li>
            <li>it is fine if you need something that you don&#x27;t mind forgetting in a hotel bathroom.</li>
            <li>This brush is great, it works well and the bristles are soft when soaked in hot water appropriately.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, very good, worth it for the price, definitely.</li>
            <li>for something so cheap and crappy looking, this brush has lasted me a while.</li>
            <li>I used it daily after 2 years and it still works and feels great.</li>
            <li>Also, the handle is plastic and cheap feeling.</li>
            <li>The badger hair makes for a smooth shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>It is cheap but it does its job.</li>
            <li>I was happy with my purchase at first as the brush came with thick soft bristles and a perfectly sized handle.</li>
            <li>idea how it works for shaving but for keeping a rifle clean</li>
            <li>Naturally, the smell will dissipate in its own time, but you can speed it up quicker with some vinegar and water.</li>
            <li>I am sure it will be much admired.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is good.</li>
            <li>It lathers well, rinses out clean and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t really vouch for much more because he has no used it yet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product.  </li>
            <li>With a simple brush like this, you can work up a respectable lather even with a crappy hotel soap, and an even better one if you bring a bar of Dove or something from home.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m sure I still have much to learn about the right brushes and soaps for the job, but a badger brush plus Dove has in fact become my default shaving setup even at home now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bristles falling out here and there for the first 3-4 shaves is the only downside, but that&#x27;s not a bad trade off at all for a good entry badger brush.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed like a good product and worked well, however after a short time it fell apart, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE!</li>
            <li>Once I get more into straight shaving I&#x27;ll get a higher end brush and edit a comparison.</li>
            <li>this is the first badger brush I&#x27;ve tried, but it seemed to build lather perfectly and its pretty soft ( i can&#x27;t really compare it to another brush since its my first one)I&#x27;ve used it about 7 times so far</li>
            <li>The handle is very plastic-y and it looks cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth for the money payed.</li>
            <li>like I spent a good 10 minutes cleaning</li>
            <li>I found Luxor Pro Shaving Brush ideal to use on such short TDY stints which help me to travel with just a carry-on withot the hassle to check-in my</li>
            <li>It does a great job of getting into tiny cracks and removing tiny bits of dirt.  </li>
            <li>shipping was very fast</li>
            <li>it was the first brush i bought to shave</li>
            <li>as you can see, very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;GO FOR IT!</li>
            <li>love the brushed and this help boost coast for my homemade goat milk shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>The first thing one needs with this though, is a stand.</li>
            <li>This was the first brush I bought when I tried out shaving with a DE razor for the first time four months ago.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It had an off putting smell from the first time it was used...</li>
            <li>first time I had that happen with a brush</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush, after stumbling out of a mall store where the cheapest alternative was $50.</li>
            <li>It is not top class brush for sure, as soon as you use it once, you will see the quality is not the top one.</li>
            <li>bristles started falling out after the first use.</li>
            <li>The hairs don&#x27;t fall out and its pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this as a starter brush to avoid wasting to much money learning what you like.</li>
            <li>Real he-man stuff here.  </li>
            <li>and it really hasn&#x27;t lost any hairs and it drys and rinses without a problem.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bought the brush for a very speficic purpose.</li>
            <li>They definitely went cheap on the adhesive.  </li>
            <li>However, that is to be expected and in-fact I am glad that it has that scent on it; it tells me that the brush truly is a badger</li>
            <li>, you can&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li>For the pricepoint, you really can&#x27;t beat this.</li>
            <li>I wish it had been free shipping, but no such luck.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the product.</li>
            <li>and then your ready to use.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, the size is just right</li>
            <li>A few hairs have fallen out, but overall it&#x27;s pretty good for the price.  </li>
            <li>Decent for the price.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;exactly what i needed to replace my older brush&lt;br</li>
            <li>A quick 30 second brushing with this looks</li>
            <li>Bought two of these as gifts they seem decent, but I would recommend a tweezersman for only a few dollars more its a thicker haired brush, with less bristle hair loss right off the bat, but again not a bad item, there&#x27;s just better ones out there in almost the same price range.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just trying for a cheap entry level to try wet shaving</li>
            <li>this is a good choice but from my experience and the other reviews I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to last long.</li>
            <li>Bristles are firm enough but yet soft touch, handle is nice.</li>
            <li>Hair after the first initial shedding has all but stopped falling out.</li>
            <li>You only lose the bristles in the first 3-4 shaves, though.</li>
            <li>The Luxor Pro Shaving Brush is a pretty standard brush.</li>
            <li>Shave brushes have a flat top and make you want to stand them upside down.</li>
            <li>Stay far far far away from this substandard brush.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as soft as brushes I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li>The price is low, but comparable to brushes costing 15x as much.</li>
            <li>This one was far closer to what I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far no loss of bristles.  </li>
            <li>Three months into its life it completely fell apart.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and it works well.</li>
            <li>The bristles are falling out  slowly but surely.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that you will lose quite a decent amount of bristles on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty disappointed because I really liked this brush and would have continued using it for much longer if it didn&#x27;t fall apart.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Brush hair loss is expected the first few uses (something I was not aware of with my first brush), but as long as you occasionally condition the brush, it will last you a good little while.</li>
            <li>The base is definitely of a cheep plastic, but its a good product and gets the job done... make sure to dry upside down as to not retain any moisture.</li>
            <li>You will lose hair from the brush the first few shaves, but eventually that stops.</li>
            <li>when you first get it there will be quits a few bristles falling out just rub the brush until they stop coming out</li>

            <li> Bought two of these as gifts they seem decent, but I would recommend a tweezersman for only a few dollars more its a thicker haired brush, with less bristle hair loss right off the bat, but again not a bad item, there&#x27;s just better ones out there in almost the same price range.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just trying for a cheap entry level to try wet shaving</li>
            <li> this is a good choice but from my experience and the other reviews I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to last long.</li>
            <li> Bristles are firm enough but yet soft touch, handle is nice.</li>
            <li> Hair after the first initial shedding has all but stopped falling out.</li>
            <li> You only lose the bristles in the first 3-4 shaves, though.</li>
            <li> The Luxor Pro Shaving Brush is a pretty standard brush.</li>
            <li> Shave brushes have a flat top and make you want to stand them upside down.</li>
            <li> Stay far far far away from this substandard brush.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as soft as brushes I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> The price is low, but comparable to brushes costing 15x as much.</li>
            <li> This one was far closer to what I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far no loss of bristles.  </li>
            <li> Three months into its life it completely fell apart.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and it works well.</li>
            <li> The bristles are falling out  slowly but surely.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that you will lose quite a decent amount of bristles on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed because I really liked this brush and would have continued using it for much longer if it didn&#x27;t fall apart.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Brush hair loss is expected the first few uses (something I was not aware of with my first brush), but as long as you occasionally condition the brush, it will last you a good little while.</li>
            <li> The base is definitely of a cheep plastic, but its a good product and gets the job done... make sure to dry upside down as to not retain any moisture.</li>
            <li> You will lose hair from the brush the first few shaves, but eventually that stops.</li>
            <li> when you first get it there will be quits a few bristles falling out just rub the brush until they stop coming out</li>
            <li> Also the inside of the handle retained water and made the whole thing smell slightly of vomit no matter how dry the bristles were when I put it away.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend lathering with the brush a few times before actually shaving with it, unless you&#x27;d like your face to be covered up with badger hair and foamy</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t expect it to last a long time.</li>
            <li> the shaving brush last a long time.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it will last very long.</li>
            <li> It does not matter to me, as long as I can grip the brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took so long to receive.</li>
            <li> My short term US Foreign Service TDY assignments of a week or two duration take me to the remote corners of the world where familiar brands of shaving cream are either not available or are not easy to find without knowing where to go look for them in a strange city where few</li>
            <li> I hang it out to dry</li>
            <li> They need to drip dry to be preserved.</li>
            <li> so the brush can drip dry rather than set in you shaving cup.</li>
            <li> I used it to shave about 3 times a week for the past 4 months and today the knot completely unglued and fell out of the handle.</li>
            <li> Although it does loose a lot of bristles I would recommend it to others if the price was an issues.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has been using it for about 7 months now and it definitely has less bristles.</li>
            <li> The bristles are rough, and scratchy on your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;hairs are not too rough and fits into my brush holder</li>
            <li> It comes, initially, with the scent of wild badger on it (a rather unpleasant smell however not bad enough for me to be unable to shave with it).</li>
            <li> It was extremely inexpensive, so you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> Really not a worthwhile brush to buy unless you want one for very occasional use</li>
            <li> The plastic handle is just fine, and the bristle loss is not too bad.</li>
            <li> It loses a couple of bristles still occasionally.</li>
            <li> A few bristles come off every time I use them, so I&#x27;m not sure if this brush will last me a while.</li>
            <li> Not even using improperly (didn&#x27;t store it bristles-down, dried after use, etc.)</li>
            <li> The whole bristle head broke off after just a few uses &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this brush broke after less than a month of every other day use.</li>
            <li> Poor quality brush can out for handle less than a week after receving.</li>
            <li> My son wanted one, so I price shopped it hard, wanting the badger hair.  </li>
            <li> It shed like crazy, and then the entire brush fell out of the handle.</li>
            <li> The only thing is was disappointed about was some of the boxes came smashed.</li>
            <li> Really poor quality.</li>
            <li> --- sorry.</li>
            <li> Of course it isn&#x27;t very expensive....</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about this brush.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This brush is great, it works well and the bristles are soft when soaked in hot water appropriately. It loses a couple of bristles still occasionally. You get what you pay for and more with this, great brush, contributes to the best shave I have ever gotten every single day</li>
            <li> It was only so-so.  Wasn&#x27;t very good using it with shaving cream.  Also, some bristles came out with each use.</li>
            <li> The luxor pro saving brush works as described. It looses a lot of bristles when being used but it was a good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> At first it seemed like a good product and worked well, however after a short time it fell apart, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE!</li>
            <li> Used it maybe five times. It shed like crazy, and then the entire brush fell out of the handle. Also the inside of the handle retained water and made the whole thing smell slightly of vomit no matter how dry the bristles were when I put it away.</li>
            <li> I bought the Luxor Pro Badger Brush Model No. 0216P Sold by: Beauty Encounter, Inc. through Amazon. It wasn&#x27;t as soft as brushes I&#x27;ve had and then the brush hair part fell out of the handle after 6 months. I hang it out to dry so I was not abusing it. Of course it isn&#x27;t very expensive....</li>
            <li> I have been using this a couple of weeks, and the bristles come out and get on my face while shaving.  It was extremely inexpensive, so you get what you pay for.  It&#x27;s not a bad product.  Just don&#x27;t expect it to last a long time.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a nice brush! It&#x27;s a nice brush that creates a nice lather for a nice shave! Who cares about the price?! The bristles lift the hair off your face and into position to be properly cut out of the way! Win!</li>
            <li> for something so cheap and crappy looking, this brush has lasted me a while. it was the first brush i bought to shave and it&#x27;s still running...or going.....it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart..yet...&lt;br /&gt;seller- great, got here fast.&lt;br /&gt;price- as you can see, very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;GO FOR IT!</li>
            <li> The brush came off the handle within three uses. Really poor quality. Do not buy it if you are looking for a reliable product.</li>
            <li> Poor quality brush can out for handle less than a week after receving. I decided to find one not on line one I could see before purchasing. I would not recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great price! Although it does loose a lot of bristles I would recommend it to others if the price was an issues.</li>
            <li> Bristles are firm enough but yet soft touch, handle is nice. Overall very happy with my purchase, will buy again!</li>
            <li> love the brushed and this help boost coast for my homemade goat milk shaving soap.  The only thing is was disappointed about was some of the boxes came smashed. this did nothing for my display. the shaving brush last a long time.</li>
            <li> A few hairs have fallen out, but overall it&#x27;s pretty good for the price.  I would recommend this as a starter brush to avoid wasting to much money learning what you like.</li>
            <li> The first thing one needs with this though, is a stand. Shave brushes have a flat top and make you want to stand them upside down. Never do this. They need to drip dry to be preserved. get a stand.</li>
            <li> The price is low, but comparable to brushes costing 15x as much. I&#x27;ve been using the brush for about 6 of the 9 mos since purchase, (I took a 3 mos hiatus from shaving to grow a beard for the winter), and the brush hasn&#x27;t missed a beat. Brush hair loss is expected the first few uses (something I was not aware of with my first brush), but as long as you occasionally condition the brush, it will last you a good little while.</li>
            <li> This is a OK Product. This product is, as described in adv and does as it is said in adv.</li>
            <li> gtg, holding up fantastically</li>
            <li> Arrr...Arrr...Arrr!!!!  Real he-man stuff here.  I use it on trips instead of carrying shaving cream.  It works perfectly with the soap they provide in hotel rooms and hot water.  Adds the adventure of the trip</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cheap you can&#x27;t expect it to be perfect. It does what it was intended to do but I don&#x27;t think it will last very long. The bristles are falling out  slowly but surely. My boyfriend has been using it for about 7 months now and it definitely has less bristles. He actually just informed me that the fur part actually detached from the plastic handle.</li>
            <li> all the brush hairs fell out and clogged my sink</li>
            <li> This was the first brush I bought when I tried out shaving with a DE razor for the first time four months ago. I was happy with my purchase at first as the brush came with thick soft bristles and a perfectly sized handle. I used it to shave about 3 times a week for the past 4 months and today the knot completely unglued and fell out of the handle. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed because I really liked this brush and would have continued using it for much longer if it didn&#x27;t fall apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about to buy a different brush that&#x27;s going to likely be much more expensive but will hopefully last longer. If you&#x27;re just trying for a cheap entry level to try wet shaving this is a good choice but from my experience and the other reviews I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to last long.</li>
            <li> I guess its ok for the price. The bristles break off while applying cream to my face then get cut up by the razor quickening the dulling</li>
            <li> I used it daily after 2 years and it still works and feels great. Hair after the first initial shedding has all but stopped falling out. works amazing and was super cheap in comparison...</li>
            <li> After about a year the bristles fell out.  I used two part epoxy to glue them back in.  Brush is still working great.</li>
            <li> The whole bristle head broke off after just a few uses &#x3D;( Not even using improperly (didn&#x27;t store it bristles-down, dried after use, etc.)</li>
            <li> If you want a brush that does the job for a bargain price, this would be it. However, you get what you pay for. The bristles are rough, and scratchy on your skin. A few bristles come off every time I use them, so I&#x27;m not sure if this brush will last me a while. Also, the handle is plastic and cheap feeling. All in all though, I&#x27;m happy with the brush because of the price.</li>
            <li> this is the first badger brush I&#x27;ve tried, but it seemed to build lather perfectly and its pretty soft ( i can&#x27;t really compare it to another brush since its my first one)I&#x27;ve used it about 7 times so far and it really hasn&#x27;t lost any hairs and it drys and rinses without a problem. It&#x27;s a good brush if youre on a budget! Once I get more into straight shaving I&#x27;ll get a higher end brush and edit a comparison.</li>
            <li> Really not a worthwhile brush to buy unless you want one for very occasional use while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;-The bristles fall out even when brand new.&lt;br /&gt;-It had an off putting smell from the first time it was used...first time I had that happen with a brush before.&lt;br /&gt;-Creates lather well enough.&lt;br /&gt;-Overall it is fine if you need something that you don&#x27;t mind forgetting in a hotel bathroom.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, after stumbling out of a mall store where the cheapest alternative was $50. Not the price point I was looking for. This one was far closer to what I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought the brush for a very speficic purpose. I recently had a can of shaving cream confiscated at the airport because of those pesky 3oz liquids-and-gels restrictions. Never again. With a simple brush like this, you can work up a respectable lather even with a crappy hotel soap, and an even better one if you bring a bar of Dove or something from home. And I&#x27;m sure I still have much to learn about the right brushes and soaps for the job, but a badger brush plus Dove has in fact become my default shaving setup even at home now. Might never buy a can of shaving cream again.</li>
            <li> Bought two of these as gifts they seem decent, but I would recommend a tweezersman for only a few dollars more its a thicker haired brush, with less bristle hair loss right off the bat, but again not a bad item, there&#x27;s just better ones out there in almost the same price range.</li>
            <li> Only sporadic use as I used it for travel.  They definitely went cheap on the adhesive.  I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> The badger hair makes for a smooth shaving experience.  So far no loss of bristles.  I recommend getting a plastic stand so the brush can drip dry rather than set in you shaving cup.</li>
            <li> Good for the price. Decent for the price. A very good deal for the price. Would but this produc again.</li>
            <li> Cheap. The brush fell out of the handle after just 5 months of use.</li>
            <li> I like this brush quite a bit. It comes, initially, with the scent of wild badger on it (a rather unpleasant smell however not bad enough for me to be unable to shave with it). However, that is to be expected and in-fact I am glad that it has that scent on it; it tells me that the brush truly is a badger brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have given this brush four stars. I love almost everything about the brush. As an entry-level badger brush, it&#x27;s good. Great, even. The bristles are soft, the size is just right and it lathers well while feeling nice on my face. The only downside is that you will lose quite a decent amount of bristles on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a brush that&#x27;s around 6 bucks, you can&#x27;t expect too much. You only lose the bristles in the first 3-4 shaves, though. I would highly recommend lathering with the brush a few times before actually shaving with it, unless you&#x27;d like your face to be covered up with badger hair and foamy lather!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the smell turns you off, there are ways to get rid of it. Naturally, the smell will dissipate in its own time, but you can speed it up quicker with some vinegar and water. Just google methods of breaking in a badger brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles falling out here and there for the first 3-4 shaves is the only downside, but that&#x27;s not a bad trade off at all for a good entry badger brush. The handle is also plastic, which some people may not like. It does not matter to me, as long as I can grip the brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very good, worth it for the price, definitely.</li>
            <li> The base is definitely of a cheep plastic, but its a good product and gets the job done... make sure to dry upside down as to not retain any moisture.</li>
            <li> I received this item in great condition. However, this is a Christmas gift and the receipient hasn&#x27;t received it yet. I am sure it will be much admired.</li>
            <li> This item is great for the price, but it is not &amp;#34;top quality&amp;#34;.  The handle is very plastic-y and it looks cheaply made.  But it seems to service it&#x27;s purpose okay.</li>
            <li> For the pricepoint, you really can&#x27;t beat this. Things you should know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) The handle is plastic&lt;br /&gt;2.) Some of the bristles fall out&lt;br /&gt;3.) It was the most inexpensive one I could find&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you a beginning &amp;#34;safety razor shaver&amp;#34; like I was, it is a good deal to see if you will like it and how your skin will react.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth for the money payed. It is not top class brush for sure, as soon as you use it once, you will see the quality is not the top one. But quality is really good, compared to the price.</li>
            <li> shipping was very fast&lt;br /&gt;exactly what i needed to replace my older brush&lt;br /&gt;hairs are not too rough and fits into my brush holder</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good brush for the money. Its breaking in nicely and spreads the lather very nicely. I like it</li>
            <li> The Luxor Pro Shaving Brush is a pretty standard brush. It is cheap but it does its job. A brush is only supposed to spread out the shaving cream around and this brush does just that. The hair on the brush starts falling a bit after continuous use but that&#x27;s what you get for the price. Overall, it is good. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok and better than the one it replaced and for the price was a good deal. would recommend in future</li>
            <li> My son wanted one, so I price shopped it hard, wanting the badger hair.  It is what it said.  I wish it had been free shipping, but no such luck.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this brush broke after less than a month of every other day use. The entire brush just popped out of the handle. Bummer. I went to Ride-Aid and found one cheaper and stronger.</li>
            <li> Husband bought it with a safety razor, so he could be more like his grandfather. He thinks it works super great.</li>
            <li> Sooo I don&#x27;t use it for shaving.  Bought this while I was in Afghanistan to dust my weapon with.  It does a great job of getting into tiny cracks and removing tiny bits of dirt.  A quick 30 second brushing with this looks like I spent a good 10 minutes cleaning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No idea how it works for shaving but for keeping a rifle clean it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Good product at a great price. I like using this product and will order this item again. Thanks for the product.</li>
            <li> bristles started falling out after the first use. Three months into its life it completely fell apart. Stay far far far away from this substandard brush.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush for beginners to od school shaving. The hairs don&#x27;t fall out and its pretty sturdy. Definitely a good bargain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed this before, it&#x27;s why I bought 4 more. I have nothing bad to say about this brush. buy it</li>
            <li> Great price and works very well. You will lose hair from the brush the first few shaves, but eventually that stops. Helps give a great shave!</li>
            <li> If you want to try out this form of shaving this is a good brush to get you started. when you first get it there will be quits a few bristles falling out just rub the brush until they stop coming out and then your ready to use. It lathers well, rinses out clean and dries quickly. For the price I would say a good deal</li>
            <li> This is a good value for its price.  The plastic handle is just fine, and the bristle loss is not too bad.</li>
            <li> The product is really good. The brush is soft and it works well. I would be more happy if they had sent it in a week. It took so long to receive.</li>
            <li> I got it as a gift and he loves it, I can&#x27;t really vouch for much more because he has no used it yet --- sorry.</li>
            <li> My short term US Foreign Service TDY assignments of a week or two duration take me to the remote corners of the world where familiar brands of shaving cream are either not available or are not easy to find without knowing where to go look for them in a strange city where few if any understand or speak English especially when you are pressed for time.  The airline safety regulations do not permit shaving cream in your carry-on bag.  Shaving soap and shaving brush in my carry-on saves me the hassle to check-in my bags.  I found Luxor Pro Shaving Brush ideal to use on such short TDY stints which help me to travel with just a carry-on withot the hassle to check-in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;Rashid A. Makhdoom</li>
            <li> The bristles came out in 4 shaves. Please stop selling such stuff amazon...please</li>
            <li> I wanted to really give it a good workout before posting a review, but I&#x27;ve been using this for 6+ months and it&#x27;s still holding together quite nicely.</li>
