            <li>It is currently rather fine, but it is there and is becoming noticible.</li>
            <li>Rogaine has helped with the amount of hair I found in the shower drain, but I don&#x27;t really see any significant hair regrowth.</li>
            <li>Great Product, works well, easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t smell like medicine, as some other similar products on the market ..</li>

            <li>It really works!  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m all about the price point... ;-)</li>
            <li>so i will have to place another order soon for 2 more bottles, but if you are looking to grow hair back</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin but experienced very little irritation.</li>
            <li>I can’t speak much about the product yet because this is my first time trying it.</li>
            <li>As far as the shipper and time of shipment i am in afghanistan and recieved this product fairly quickly i think a week or so</li>
            <li>I am getting a bit thinner on top, right down my part.  </li>
            <li>Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing for my balding area.</li>
            <li>it does take a very dedicated person to use this</li>
            <li>I works very well even though it took about 3 weeks for me to see a difference.</li>
            <li>But as I said I works very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Do explain why you liked or disliked this</li>
            <li>but I bought this because my hair was thinning on top due to health issues, but I give it 5 stars because of the fact it does work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I continue using it for an other month</li>
            <li>and my entire head is full of baby hair.</li>
            <li>or so my entire head will be full,</li>
            <li>Quick results if used properly.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky because I tried this ten years ago and it DID WORK and still does.</li>
            <li>i highly suggest this product.</li>
            <li>This is normal and you should expect it.  </li>
            <li>Had no idea until I got this that when you start, you virtually have to use it &#x27;forever&#x27;, and there are lots of qualifying statements about if your hair isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; thin, you shouldn&#x27;t use it, and it might be good to check with your Doctor, etc,</li>
            <li>a little less time consuming would be great..</li>
            <li>i have fine thin hair, so fine  </li>
            <li>and it was packaged nicely, the box wasn&#x27;t half open or anything</li>
            <li>After just one month I am already seeing new hair growth</li>
            <li>but I think this means the new hairs are growing in - make an analogy to how your legs feel if you haven&#x27;t shaved for a while.</li>
            <li>and i have alot of new growth</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell just right now, because I only have less than a month trying out, but I know it works, even though makes my hair kind of rough</li>
            <li>This product does work, however it even started new growth like sideburns down my face which worked a little too good, I know have to wax my sideburns</li>
            <li>Your review will be marked as an Amazon Verified Purchase.</li>
            <li>i thought about a wig at 32yrs old.  </li>
            <li>and i thought wow my scalp isnt shiny</li>
            <li>After much reading, I wanted to know what the differences between the brand name and the generic were.</li>
            <li>or so you definitely notice hair growing and it steadily progresses.</li>
            <li>Now, it&#x27;s been more than a couple of months and my hair is THICK!  </li>
            <li>So far I have been using it over a month now and notice hair growing back.</li>
            <li>As far as the actual product itslef this stuff is godsent literally.</li>
            <li>I still use it just to keep my hair looking thick and smooth.</li>
            <li>Worth this slight occasional discomfort, though.</li>
            <li>This seems super small for trying to grow hair on your head.</li>
            <li>I had new hair growth after only 2 weeks of use, although I&#x27;ve been using it only once daily at night.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>its very watered down compared to the name brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> its very watered down compared to the name brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this</li>
            <li> After using this for just a couple of days my hairs been last oily and sometime a lil dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> For 18$ , u can get ur eyebrows back, for those who are skeptical, its worth a try!</li>
            <li> Trying to thicken up my eyebrows, using for about a month, so far no significant difference.  </li>
            <li> I used this a few years back on the same area i am using it on now (my temples, to grow my edges back) and it took a littleless than a month for me to see the hairs growing in and after 2 months of use</li>
            <li> I lost a patch of hair due to injury and it&#x27;s back</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth the risk of excess facial hair, keep it to 2% unless recommended by your doctor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> U loose you</li>
            <li> etc - decided I&#x27;m going with fine thin hair and forget this much trouble!</li>
            <li> I used it once a day in the morning until the bottle was empty, about three months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had thin hair my whole life.  </li>
            <li> Must carefully follow instructions on this one.  </li>
            <li> Saw absolutely no difference to the area from the start date to the end date.</li>
            <li> You need to read all of the instructions carefully</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long I&#x27;m supposed to use this product to see results, but, after 2 months of use, I have not seen any growth of hair!!</li>
            <li> I notice much less hair loss in the drain too.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived in less than a week.</li>
            <li> Giving it less than 12 weeks won&#x27;t tell you if it is working for you or not.  </li>
            <li> Was a little bummed out about that.</li>
            <li> I noticed a little bit of dullness on my hair where the liquid dried on it.  </li>
            <li> so i decided to take a before and after a few months pic..</li>
            <li> even the times ive used rogaine in the past</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t thick</li>
            <li> they were thick and getting longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to find the cheapest way to maintain my &#x27;hair situation&#x27;, with the least side effects to both my skin and my wallet!</li>
            <li> very slow go at it</li>
            <li> i get tired of having to dedicate time to use it..</li>
            <li> It also appears that my thinning got worse.</li>
            <li> Nothing too dramatic</li>
            <li> /&gt;it was soooooo scary, I lose a lot of my hair, which make me soooooooooooooooooooooooooo concern</li>
            <li> I have a very thin hair line and it is growing thicker since the usage of this product.</li>
            <li> For years i have been overplucking and  had really ugly eyebrows that were so thin and sparse.</li>
            <li> but I get afraid of these products.  </li>
            <li> but after a stranger asked me if i was sick.</li>
            <li> If they don&#x27;t work I would be disappointed.</li>
            <li> will because i hate being bald..</li>
            <li> BAD REACTION VERY BAD!!!!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I had a  VERY!!! BAD REACTION VERY BAD!!!!</li>
            <li> Trying to thicken up my eyebrows, using for about a month, so far no significant difference.  Use on a cotton swab in order not to have it drip in your eyes.  I will update this if in another month I see a difference.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  After just one month I am already seeing new hair growth</li>
            <li> It works!! I lost a patch of hair due to injury and it&#x27;s back and then some. I still use it just to keep my hair looking thick and smooth.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t tell just right now, because I only have less than a month trying out, but I know it works, even though makes my hair kind of rough</li>
            <li> It is a good product but you need to use it every day and leaves your hair sticky. If I wanted to use it I need to pull my hair on a pony tail.</li>
            <li> I am getting a bit thinner on top, right down my part.  So I gave this product a try and was very satisfied with the results.  It&#x27;s so easy to use, leaves no residue on the hair, is absorbed quickly, has no odor, looks like water. I used it once a day in the morning until the bottle was empty, about three months.  I notice much less hair loss in the drain too.  I would recommend it.  Please note: Not for a receding hairline.</li>
            <li> Had no idea until I got this that when you start, you virtually have to use it &#x27;forever&#x27;, and there are lots of qualifying statements about if your hair isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; thin, you shouldn&#x27;t use it, and it might be good to check with your Doctor, etc, etc - decided I&#x27;m going with fine thin hair and forget this much trouble!</li>
            <li> The product arrived in less than a week.</li>
            <li> Great Product, works well, easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t smell like medicine, as some other similar products on the market ..</li>
            <li> Have been using it for some time.  Can&#x27;t stop, hair will fall out.</li>
            <li> This product does work, however it even started new growth like sideburns down my face which worked a little too good, I know have to wax my sideburns and I wasn&#x27;t expecting that. Was a little bummed out about that.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used this yet but I bought this because my hair was thinning on top due to health issues, but I give it 5 stars because of the fact it does work</li>
            <li> After using this for just a couple of days my hairs been last oily and sometime a lil dry and itchy. So far I have been using it over a month now and notice hair growing back. Hope to see more results later on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually using this product to make my eyebrows thicker, after a week or so you definitely notice hair growing and it steadily progresses. I was looking into 5% minoxidil products until I found out that women shouldn&#x27;t use it or you might sprout a mustache (yikes). So ladies, I know you want your hair to grow but it&#x27;s not worth the risk of excess facial hair, keep it to 2% unless recommended by your doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin but experienced very little irritation. I apply twice a day with a Q-tip. This seems super small for trying to grow hair on your head.</li>
            <li> This actually works for me!  I&#x27;ve had thin hair my whole life.  Nothing too dramatic but I always wanted a bit thivker hair and I have it now!  And I do recommend this type of application over the foaming Romaine.  The liquid dropper method is easier and faster to apply AND I feel it gives better coverage.  I have the foam kind right now but I won&#x27;t buy that one again.  It really works!  I used it for about 3-4 weeks wondering each day when I would apply &amp;#34;Is this working?&amp;#34; and thinking that it was.  Now, it&#x27;s been more than a couple of months and my hair is THICK!  So pleased!</li>
            <li> It works pretty good.</li>
            <li> I started using this product last month on the 29th and it&#x27;s the 21st today and my entire head is full of baby hair. It isn&#x27;t thick but I definitely can see the difference. I had new hair growth after only 2 weeks of use, although I&#x27;ve been using it only once daily at night.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product. I&#x27;m sure if I continue using it for an other month or so my entire head will be full, atleast I&#x27;m hopeful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Must carefully follow instructions on this one.  I can already see an improvement in my hair.  I have a very thin hair line and it is growing thicker since the usage of this product.</li>
            <li> Not the best product for my hair. Ih has caused me more harm than I had before.</li>
            <li> My hair starting thinning two years ago around my forehead. It came back after two months of using. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it.  I need to be more consistent but I get afraid of these products.  If they don&#x27;t work I would be disappointed.</li>
            <li> U loose you hair if you stop using it!</li>
            <li> Not what I wanted I want something to shampoo hair and a mousse</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working I will be buying it again and would recommend this product to a friend,i was nervous thought I would be allergic</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for my balding area. Saw absolutely no difference to the area from the start date to the end date. Was hoping this would be the one to correct problem</li>
            <li> Makes you dizzy. Besides that, they test it on animals, not wash it off from their skin and let them be tortured this way. Want to sponsor them so they continue this? Your choice.</li>
            <li> this does and will work.......... i have fine thin hair, so fine  i thought about a wig at 32yrs old.  i went to the dr and was tested to make sure i didnt have anything that would cause my hair loss, the only reson they could give me was stress (maybe) and having children. so i have tried rogaine off and on for years.. i get tired of having to dedicate time to use it.. but after a stranger asked me if i was sick. i decided its time i did something about it.. even the times ive used rogaine in the past it had work..very slow go at it but it worked.. just as soon as u stop the hair starts to fall out.. so i decided to take a before and after a few months pic.. and i thought wow my scalp isnt shiny anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i started using this about a month ago and i didnt tell anyone, my husband said your hair is looking better what have you done so i told him about the rogaine..it does take a very dedicated person to use this but i have stuck with it and will because i hate being bald..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;at first it gave me a headache but that has since stopped. the reason for the 3 stars is that i think foam or something else a little less time consuming would be great.. i have tried the cheap version of this like walmarts and it doesnt work.. its very watered down compared to the name brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i guess this is something i will have to keep doing for forever.. but worth it not to be bald..also i decided to take a womens one a days vitamin bescause my dr said low vitamin deficiency can cause hair loss..</li>
            <li> Non-greasy, NO smell, easy to apply. Great price ($19.00 including the shipping--cheaper than WalMart!!!). Must wait 4-8 months for results. I will try a generic brand next to see if my scalp can tolerate that blend of the minoxidil solution. I&#x27;m trying to find the cheapest way to maintain my &#x27;hair situation&#x27;, with the least side effects to both my skin and my wallet! After much reading, I wanted to know what the differences between the brand name and the generic were. So I started with the Rogaine, and next I am trying the Target brand of minoxidil, because it claims to be unscented, while the WalMart brand does not. Hopefully, it will be just as good as the Rogaine, because I can get 3 bottles for under $20.00. I&#x27;m all about the price point... ;-)</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I didn&#x27;t care for my scalp being white because of residue. It also appears that my thinning got worse.</li>
            <li> Quick results if used properly.  Itchy scalp on occasion, but I think this means the new hairs are growing in - make an analogy to how your legs feel if you haven&#x27;t shaved for a while. Worth this slight occasional discomfort, though.</li>
            <li> Anybody who has had hair thinning and hates it - well, they want to try anything. I was lucky because I tried this ten years ago and it DID WORK and still does. It is a hereditary problem and I&#x27;m doing great. It takes a while (a couple of months) but it does help!</li>
            <li> As far as the shipper and time of shipment i am in afghanistan and recieved this product fairly quickly i think a week or so and it was packaged nicely, the box wasn&#x27;t half open or anything so that&#x27;s always a good thing. As far as the actual product itslef this stuff is godsent literally. I used this a few years back on the same area i am using it on now (my temples, to grow my edges back) and it took a littleless than a month for me to see the hairs growing in and after 2 months of use they were thick and getting longer. I am now using this as directed twice a day everyday in conjunction with the nature&#x27;sbounty hair skin and nail pills that i ave been using for a little over a month and already my edges are nice and full and getting more and more length to them. I will use this product for 3 months so i will have to place another order soon for 2 more bottles, but if you are looking to grow hair back i highly suggest this product. And if you want even better results try the hair skin and nail pills also</li>
            <li> I used this on my eyebrows which were almost non existent before i used rogaine. For years i have been overplucking and  had really ugly eyebrows that were so thin and sparse. I finally decided to give rogaine a try and after 3 weeks of applying it i started to see very light hairs growing where there  hadnt been growth for years. Im on my second month using it and i have alot of new growth and I look better, eyebrows really make a difference to your face. Im still using it and planning to until I see more growth. For 18$ , u can get ur eyebrows back, for those who are skeptical, its worth a try!</li>
            <li> It is too soon to know what my results are. Will know more in a couple of. Months.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for over a month. no help rather hair loss has increased considerably&lt;br /&gt;it was soooooo scary, I lose a lot of my hair, which make me soooooooooooooooooooooooooo concern&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will not recommend you guys using it&lt;br /&gt;noooooooo&lt;br /&gt;plz dont buy it</li>
            <li> Evidentally it either works or it doesn&#x27;t. It seems to be working for me. I didn&#x27;t have overall thinning, I had a patch at my temples that went bald. I&#x27;ve been using the product and I definately have hair growing there again. It is currently rather fine, but it is there and is becoming noticible.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years however you have to do&lt;br /&gt;just that use it. It will grow hair but if you stop your daily regiment&lt;br /&gt;you will lose that hair again.Will not grow alopecia hair loss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long I&#x27;m supposed to use this product to see results, but, after 2 months of use, I have not seen any growth of hair!!</li>
            <li> Rogaine has helped with the amount of hair I found in the shower drain, but I don&#x27;t really see any significant hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> This product either will work for you, or not.  You need to read all of the instructions carefully so you know what you can expect, and how to get the best results.  Initially, it WILL cause an increase in hair loss.  This is normal and you should expect it.  You won&#x27;t see any growth result until you&#x27;ve used it for about 12 weeks.  Hair has a definite growth cycle and it requires time. Giving it less than 12 weeks won&#x27;t tell you if it is working for you or not.  I noticed a little bit of dullness on my hair where the liquid dried on it.  There is also some irritation, but my Dr. gave me something for that.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I heard it was good for growing eyebrows. I works very well even though it took about 3 weeks for me to see a difference. But as I said I works very well.</li>
            <li> Package came quick. Buttttt the box was mashed all up. They put it in a flimsy envelope. Oh we&#x27;ll guess it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> This product was just as in the picture and it was shipped to me sooner then promised. The packaging was great. I can’t speak much about the product yet because this is my first time trying it. However it doesn’t tingle or burn when I put it on. I will try to update you on the product when I see any results. Thanks.</li>
