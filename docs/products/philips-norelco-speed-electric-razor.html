    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

            <li>Excellent product, great for home or travel, easy to use.</li>
            <li>A reliable brand from Philips and a good deal.</li>
            <li>The closeness of the shave is not as good as the Spectra despite the newer floating head design of this shaver.  </li>
            <li>the two way rotation is good.  </li>
            <li>This razor was a good buy.</li>

            <li>I bought this razor for my son and he is delighted with it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m delighted with it also.</li>
            <li>loved Norelco, made in Holland....</li>
            <li>It gives a fairly close shave, but I would not say it is a \\&quot;very\\&quot; close shave.</li>
            <li>But every time I wash and clean my face, my shave is EXCELLENT.</li>
            <li>The cut is clean, and it trims perfectly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I did.     </li>
            <li>I got this on the Deal of the Day and have been very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not gonna take it any more!</li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco electric razors for 18 years and they are consistently the best.  </li>
            <li>If you get it with free shipping you&#x27;ll be quite happy with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Norelco</li>
            <li>It was really nice.</li>
            <li>it is that the Razor has it&#x27;s own stand</li>
            <li>/&gt;To get as good a shave (and a bit of a better shave on the neck and jaw line)</li>
            <li>Must of us know (3) but have our own reasons for preferring an electric device.us know (3) but have our own reasons for preferring an electric device.</li>
            <li>It is, however, effective.</li>
            <li>this on is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Good way to cheap out Norelco.  </li>
            <li>When you old and get in your ways, leave it to Amazon to help find the perfect item.</li>
            <li>Most amazing electric razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very smooth when you shave and</li>
            <li>Norelco was very comfortable for shaving from Day One.</li>
            <li>When I was in a hurry, I often shaved without washing and cleaning my face and was not at all pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using an electric razor and this Norelco did pretty awesome job.</li>
            <li>I am sure the 8240 will work as well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The on/off button and spring loaded trimmer require more force to operate than I</li>
            <li>I decided to try Philips Norelco for a change and I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more from a razor.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more from a razor.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to LOVE?</li>
            <li>I thought surely there would be an improvement in quality over time.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor in many  years.</li>
            <li>but it gives a better shave when your face gets used to it.  </li>
            <li>I could not believe the quietness and speed, but most of all the close shave this razor provided.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always enjoyed shaving with Philips Norelco electric razors.  </li>
            <li>I would prefer the trimmer to have more resistance from collapsing.</li>
            <li>and I was so pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I need something that works for more than the one-year-Chinese-shaver.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have a sideburn trimmer and cost more.  </li>
            <li>they just keep making them better.</li>
            <li>and lower-end Norelco models) the build quality is still not as good as their higher end models.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this one April 2012 and work great so far.</li>
            <li>unfortunatly I have found this product the  norelco 8240xl to compare most unfavorably with the norelco spectra 8831xl,which I consider to be  far superior to the latest, the Norelco arcitec.</li>
            <li>For me, a clean, satisfying shave which is what it&#x27;s all about day-after-day, six/seven days a week.  </li>
            <li>Price was comparable so having it delivered to our door made the decision easy.</li>
            <li>I wonder, though, if it is worth spending extra and getting the best.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very quick.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;and rinsing out under the sink means I clean it more often.  </li>
            <li>Although the release button is too easy to press by accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>still going strong.</li>
            <li>Good things, the use of down feeling good, and the price is very cheap, hope Amazon continues to launch cheap goodies.</li>
            <li>I replace the rotary shaving heads once a year (as recommended by Philips Norelco) and they are easy to get and cheap</li>
            <li>The shaver arrived in a timely manner and has worked just fine.</li>
            <li>I have another one, and it works fine.</li>
            <li>So I surprised him with this new one, a very happy man now!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the Philips Norelco Razor and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that you can rinse the heads &amp; top assembly under hot tap water to clean.</li>
            <li>Its fantastic.</li>
            <li>I always get a smooth, close shave even in humid SW Florida.</li>
            <li>I have tried Remmington and Braun but neither was as comfortable or as close of a shave.  </li>
            <li>The slower blades do not give a smooth feel to shaving.</li>
            <li>Norelco was once the premier shaver manufacturer and the 9190XL was great, but now like this model they make only junk.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and feels comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to handle.</li>
            <li>This shaver leaves you&#x27;re face smooth</li>
            <li>Replacement blades easily available.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s only had it for a week, but he is happy with it.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Just had my first comfortable shave and am glad I took advantage of Amazon&#x27;s Deal of the Day price of $50.</li>
            <li>Further, it holds a charge for about 10 days, and is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used electric shavers for 25 years, off and on, this is BY FAR, the best one.</li>
            <li>so I asked for this new shaver for father&#x27;s day and let my say this one is way better!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure that certainly it&#x27;ll be as great as the previous one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using the original blade set and getting what I consider to be a close shave.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great, just a newer version of my ancient one, except one minor gripe:</li>
            <li>I still have my original Norelco shaver from 1995...</li>
            <li>Yes, agreed, it&#x27;s a pain to clean the blades but doing so, for me, immediately restores the close shave feeling</li>
            <li>I do not need to worry about clean up.</li>
            <li>It did not give a clean shave.</li>
            <li>It runs great ; I never use it in the shower though as I alwatys shave in the dry.  </li>
            <li>This one shaves well and rinses clean under the faucet.</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth operation and completely cordless.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, just pop the top open, run hot water through it, and you&#x27;re good</li>
            <li>Otherwise, just pop the top open, run hot water through it, and you&#x27;re good</li>
            <li>I am impressed so far with how long it goes without recharging.</li>
            <li>But I liked my old Norelco&#x27;s and decided to give them another shot.</li>
            <li>After much research and reading many reviews, I chose this razor.  </li>
            <li>The shave is faster, closer and more gentle.</li>
            <li>Not a bad razor at all.  </li>
            <li>Norelco has a plastic body and is very light weight compared to my older metal body Panasonic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean - the shaving head hinges up and gives you complete access.  </li>
            <li>The price was right on Amazon with free shipping</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quiet, comfortable, fast, close and cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quiet, comfortable, fast, close and cheap.</li>
            <li>It gives a FAST, SMOOTH, and COMFORTABLE shave.  </li>
            <li>so the dry shave is not as good as this model, but the wet shave is very nice.</li>
            <li>so the dry shave is not as good as this model, but the wet shave is very nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used pretty much every Norelco out there from the top of the line SensoTouch 3D to their bottom of the line 6000 series.</li>
            <li>To their credit they kept replacing it with a new one, however the original model was no longer available, and they tried to give me a lower value one.  </li>
            <li>Much better than my old Norelco and outclasses my newer Braun shaver.     </li>
            <li>These razors have lasted me years each which saves a bundle over buying disposables and is entirely worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>The first full charge seemed to last forever, I was impressed and charging time is minimal.</li>
            <li>I only take the heads out for a more detailed cleaning about once a month.</li>
            <li>I only take the heads out for a more detailed cleaning about once a month.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Noreco claims this model offers \\&quot;50% more shaving surface.\\</li>
            <li>After more than ten years of using a Braun, this gentle Philips Norelco Speed Electric Razor is so elegant and thorough by comparison.</li>
            <li>The lighter weight compared to the prior models is nice too.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my dad, he had to have one like his old one, and this fit the bill!</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I own the same razor</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with the battery life and believe that it is better than other razors that sell in the $50.00 range.</li>
            <li>This particular shaver in my opinion is very reasonably priced and I like it because I can rinse out the head and drive assembly (waterproof) under tap water which makes it easy.</li>
            <li>(right here on Amazon).</li>
            <li>Did not work, right out of the box.</li>
            <li>the evidence that even a superior electric can&#x27;t beat a conventional blade for closeness.</li>
            <li>is an efficient machine shaving, silent, easy to clean, no vibrations, is an excellence in razors</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t like it very much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It looks good on the bathroom counter while taking up little space standing in it&#x27;s counter top holder, has a strong motor, no fancy whistles or bells and doesn&#x27;t bog down when giving you a shave.  </li>
            <li>And yes, FWIW, close at hand, I have a new set of blades and currently find no need to replace the original set of blades.  :)</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll go through several cheap ones and won&#x27;t enjoy them as much as this one.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a Panasonic wet/dry shaver for many years, having only to replace the foil head and blades once.</li>
            <li>The color of the shaver is more of a silver than blue as shown.</li>
            <li>This is my third and this is by far the most comfortable.  </li>
            <li>But this shaver is mediocre at best.  </li>
            <li>It took the third shave to get the hang of it, but I am really pleased at the performance.  </li>
            <li>My last Norelco lasted 12 years, so I&#x27;m glad I stuck with another Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li>I keep my shavers for many years and have had 2 Braun shavers prior to this one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to get it as a present for my father.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now you gotta by a new COMPLETELY NEW HEAD, not just replace the blades IN the head, which would be more customer friendly and cost conscious, but</li>
            <li>This model has a good ergonomic design making it easy to get around facial contours without missing a hair.</li>
            <li>But in all I have been pleased with their products as long as the quality stays where it is</li>
            <li>Speaking of shakedowns, the merchants on here selling this model for over $300 are doing a good job of that too since this razor sold for less than 90 bucks new.</li>
            <li>In my case, the \\&quot;dual blade system\\&quot; and \\&quot;reflex action system\\&quot; probably contribute most of all to the relatively close and absolutely comfortable shave this razor offers</li>
            <li>Shaver is quiet, very easy to clean and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>The detachable head detaches too easily when cleaning or simply shaking out the cut hair</li>
            <li>It cleans up easily and stays charged for 2 weeks when used daily.</li>
            <li>FAST FAST FAST!</li>
            <li>They were certainly right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned only Norelco razors (3 in all)for the past 44 years and this by far the best yet.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver to replace an old Norelco Spectra shaver that works fine but was getting old.  </li>
            <li>Shaves close comfortably, charge last a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>Best part is you can wash it when it is dirty.</li>
            <li>I give this unit 5-stars because it shaves me very close.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely.    </li>
            <li>They should be ashamed at how much they charge for them.  </li>
            <li>much closer shave&lt;br /&gt;very</li>
            <li>Once my coordination had improved and my face had adjusted to the razor, I was getting a reasonably close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Norelco really has it all together.  </li>
            <li>During that time I&#x27;d once needed to replace the battery, so I&#x27;d say it was very reliable.  </li>
            <li>and it shaves very well, which is the biggest priority.  </li>
            <li>With no hassle at all, I was offered a free replacement by FedEx (which I received 3 days later) along with a free return label to send back the defective shaver (by dropping it off in a FedEx pickup box in my neighborhood).</li>
            <li>Very close shave.  </li>
            <li>The real surprise is how close and fast this shaves me.  </li>
            <li>and you can really see where you&#x27;re trimming - it&#x27;s not blocked by the shaving head.  </li>
            <li>and I am still waiting for the \\&quot;low battery\\&quot; light to come on.</li>
            <li>This Norelco product shaves as close as much more expensive shavers, and does a good job around more stuble resistant areas such as the upper lip area.  </li>
            <li>A one hour quick charge after the first initial charge of 12 hours.</li>
            <li>The shaver does an ok job of shaving you, but so does 10 other types of shavers.</li>
            <li>It also holds a charge longer than most other brands, keeping me well shaven for a two week vacation with no worry about having to recharge.  </li>
            <li>The whole new assy. is $75 to $80 depending on where you allow yourself to get ripped off!</li>
            <li>The new Norelco takes 1/3 the shaving time of the older one and wshes up well in hot water.</li>
            <li>PHILIPPS wouldn&#x27;t make as much money as selling you a whole new assembly.</li>
            <li>I know i will enjoy using this product for as long as its function</li>
            <li>This model is both smooth to use, no pullng, and provides a very close shave, nearly the same as a Fusion razor.</li>
            <li>Almost forgot how fast this shaver works with new blades.</li>
            <li>Easy to grip even with wet hands.</li>
            <li>They COULD have made it so the heads were replaceable like the older models</li>
            <li>so I decided that since I had an older Norelco Electric Razor I would search them out again for purchase.  </li>
            <li>than the head retaining clip, the build quality is decent.</li>
            <li>Battery life is similar and adequate.  </li>
            <li>this is like the older Phillips models, with a sideburn trimmer and no bells and whistles.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.ry shave.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this electric razor for anyone.</li>
            <li>With the price of blades as high as they are this</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this model.</li>
            <li>his shaver from early 70&#x27;s still works!!</li>
            <li>Great razor, can&#x27;t go wrong this unit and it shipped out ASAP from the vendor.</li>
            <li>I get as good a shave as any double edge razor I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>I find that I have to pass it over my hard to shave facial areas several times more than I would expect but very comfortable and no razor burn.  </li>
            <li>If this lasts as long as my past Norelco&#x27;s (after 18 years the last one finally died), I will be very happy.  </li>
            <li>The manual stated that it may take a while for my face to adjust to the new shaver and to not expect a clean shave the first few times.</li>
            <li>The motor is very quiet, it&#x27;s easy to clean, and it has a small stand to store the razor upright by your sink.</li>
            <li>I tried the new Braun shaver about 2 years ago</li>
            <li>I can live with that.  </li>
            <li>Stroking both straight-line and circular (both directions) may be a new thing for those new to Norelco.</li>
            <li>I am just begenning to get used to the new model.</li>
            <li>Shaves as close as (if not closer) than the safety razor I had to use while waiting for the new razor in the mail.  </li>
            <li>I did some research and saw the new shavers...but didnt want anything from China...</li>
            <li>put in new batteries and its still going strong!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see the point in the new arcitec models.  </li>
            <li>This one will likley out live me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While you can&#x27;t wet shave with this, you can clean it under running water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While you can&#x27;t wet shave with this, you can clean it under running water.</li>
            <li>But for the many who must deal with the common array of curves, ridges, swirls, nooks, crannies, along with a sag or two, this feature won&#x27;t help much - if at all.</li>
            <li>The only thing I very much dislike is the price gouging on replacement blades.  </li>
            <li>If you need to purchase a new shaver Norelco makes good products, but unless you want to settle for mediocrity you might want to consider other models.</li>
            <li>like my old does which I really like, but this new one is so much easier to open by just a push of a button.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is this:  If you have an average to above average beard (meaning not having a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at noon already) then this is a great razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d had a similar Norelco that I&#x27;d spent far more money on that</li>
            <li>A blade is not better and this is more versatile with the integrated trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Their old razors had 90 minute run time batteries while their new ones, even the over $200 models, have 50 minute batteries.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend pretty much any Panasonic if you&#x27;re looking for a wet shave in a foil</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend pretty much any Panasonic if you&#x27;re looking for a wet shave in a foil</li>
            <li>The HQ9 heads are a far better value -- you get 90% of the performance of the RQ12 heads at less than a third of the cost.</li>
            <li>This motor sounds like it is barely working compared to the old one, but it does give me a decent shave.</li>
            <li>This model is super quiet, amazingly fast, and like the other Norelco Speed Electric Razors lasts for years.  </li>
            <li>I clean the razor out every use by running water through the head areas and leave it open to dry for about an hour or so.  </li>
            <li>But it was clear that getting a close shave would take practice.</li>
            <li>I kept switching between my old Norelco and the Braun model.</li>
            <li>but like it so far.  </li>
            <li>It also comes with a plastic protective shaver heads cover just like my old one did.</li>
            <li>In fact, it offers the closest one that I have received to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He was surprised at all the extras from his old shaver.  </li>
            <li>Bought parts for my old one and use it for travel.  </li>
            <li>feel that  my old 688XL had.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again - unlike the old model I had.&lt;br /&gt;Seems engineers - always have to change something -</li>
            <li>I also like that you plug the charging cord directly into the razor and you don&#x27;t have to carry a charging stand around.</li>
            <li>husband has used a Norelco for years and was having some problems with his old one.</li>
            <li>I clean the shave head with a little alcohol before shaving and wash my face after and apply moisturizer.</li>
            <li>What seems to be true for this electric are: (1) the price, which is hefty, (2) the shaving comfort, which is exceptional, and, (3)</li>
            <li>the rasor is a big improvement over my much older model....</li>
            <li>I needed a new razor as the battery on the old razor finally gave up the ghost.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use some Face Saver (Remington) which makes a dry shave just as comfortable as a wet shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use some Face Saver (Remington) which makes a dry shave just as comfortable as a wet shave.</li>
            <li>Charges fast, and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>It gives him the shave he wants, has a trimmer for his moustache and lasts a long while on a charge.</li>
            <li>this new Norelco has a much larger shaving surface.</li>
            <li>The extra row of rings really makes a difference compared with the HQ8 (and lower) heads on the lower models, which have only one ring of slots and holes.</li>
            <li>The 8250XL was only $67.88 on Amazon which was about $30 cheaper than my old one!</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave without irritating the skin.</li>
            <li>&quot; That will be useful for those heroes with wide expanses of flat, taunt beard.</li>
            <li>It is so very quiet compared to my old one and gives me a closer shave to boot.</li>
            <li>&#x27;Immersible&#x27; apparently means &#x27;can be submerged in water.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>I have used electric razors for nearly two decades and can emphatically state that this is a solid shaver that provides a close shave.  </li>
            <li>I bought a Norelco re-chargeable wet razor and it performed very well for about 18 months.  </li>
            <li>the blades feel rough and practically tear at the stubble, so much so that I approach the task (of shaving) now with some steeling of the will.</li>
            <li>was likely 9-10 years old.  </li>
            <li>It works well and is very quiet compared to my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>Fast shave wet or</li>
            <li>Ill be glad if the new one lasts 10 yrs.</li>
            <li>The only negative thing to say about this electric shaver is that the trimmer collapses too easily.  </li>
            <li>(and you shouldn&#x27;t either) buy one of these pieces of junk as long as I live.</li>
            <li>It does not sound like the blades are spinning very quickly, but it works extremely well.  </li>
            <li>I keep one shaver in the car since Im a home health clinician and want to be clean shaven in late afternoon.</li>
            <li>I have an old Norelco 6613X that I have used constantly for 8 years now that is finally on</li>
            <li>I was looking for the &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; Norelco shavers since my model 5822XL (10 yrs old) finally left me; this one is similar but not the costly ones at all the stores.</li>
            <li>But major back surgery along with the accumulated indignities of advancing age prompted me to try an electric.</li>
            <li>My guess is they actually mean this is the time it takes to acquire needed physical coordination, this being important and non-trivial.</li>
            <li>This razor is much lighter than the Norelco I previously used for years.</li>
            <li>Most reviews were positive but there were a number of really bad ones.</li>
            <li>While mistreating customers may result in short term profit, pissing off loyal customers are the seeds of failure.</li>
            <li>The built-in trimmer is somewhat poor, but it&#x27;s hard to find a good trimmer on any electric razor.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> But every time I wash and clean my face, my shave is EXCELLENT.</li>
            <li> The cut is clean, and it trims perfectly.</li>

            <li> It is, however, effective.</li>
            <li> this on is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> Good way to cheap out Norelco.  </li>
            <li> When you old and get in your ways, leave it to Amazon to help find the perfect item.</li>
            <li> Most amazing electric razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very smooth when you shave and</li>
            <li> Norelco was very comfortable for shaving from Day One.</li>
            <li> When I was in a hurry, I often shaved without washing and cleaning my face and was not at all pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an electric razor and this Norelco did pretty awesome job.</li>
            <li> I am sure the 8240 will work as well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The on/off button and spring loaded trimmer require more force to operate than I</li>
            <li> I decided to try Philips Norelco for a change and I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for more from a razor.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for more from a razor.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to LOVE?</li>
            <li> I thought surely there would be an improvement in quality over time.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor in many  years.</li>
            <li> but it gives a better shave when your face gets used to it.  </li>
            <li> I could not believe the quietness and speed, but most of all the close shave this razor provided.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always enjoyed shaving with Philips Norelco electric razors.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer the trimmer to have more resistance from collapsing.</li>
            <li> and I was so pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I need something that works for more than the one-year-Chinese-shaver.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have a sideburn trimmer and cost more.  </li>
            <li> they just keep making them better.</li>
            <li> and lower-end Norelco models) the build quality is still not as good as their higher end models.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this one April 2012 and work great so far.</li>
            <li> unfortunatly I have found this product the  norelco 8240xl to compare most unfavorably with the norelco spectra 8831xl,which I consider to be  far superior to the latest, the Norelco arcitec.</li>
            <li> For me, a clean, satisfying shave which is what it&#x27;s all about day-after-day, six/seven days a week.  </li>
            <li> Price was comparable so having it delivered to our door made the decision easy.</li>
            <li> I wonder, though, if it is worth spending extra and getting the best.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very quick.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;and rinsing out under the sink means I clean it more often.  </li>
            <li> Although the release button is too easy to press by accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> still going strong.</li>
            <li> Good things, the use of down feeling good, and the price is very cheap, hope Amazon continues to launch cheap goodies.</li>
            <li> I replace the rotary shaving heads once a year (as recommended by Philips Norelco) and they are easy to get and cheap</li>
            <li> The shaver arrived in a timely manner and has worked just fine.</li>
            <li> I have another one, and it works fine.</li>
            <li> So I surprised him with this new one, a very happy man now!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the Philips Norelco Razor and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you can rinse the heads &amp; top assembly under hot tap water to clean.</li>
            <li> Its fantastic.</li>
            <li> I always get a smooth, close shave even in humid SW Florida.</li>
            <li> I have tried Remmington and Braun but neither was as comfortable or as close of a shave.  </li>
            <li> The slower blades do not give a smooth feel to shaving.</li>
            <li> Norelco was once the premier shaver manufacturer and the 9190XL was great, but now like this model they make only junk.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and feels comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to handle.</li>
            <li> This shaver leaves you&#x27;re face smooth</li>
            <li> Replacement blades easily available.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s only had it for a week, but he is happy with it.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Just had my first comfortable shave and am glad I took advantage of Amazon&#x27;s Deal of the Day price of $50.</li>
            <li> Further, it holds a charge for about 10 days, and is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used electric shavers for 25 years, off and on, this is BY FAR, the best one.</li>
            <li> so I asked for this new shaver for father&#x27;s day and let my say this one is way better!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure that certainly it&#x27;ll be as great as the previous one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the original blade set and getting what I consider to be a close shave.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great, just a newer version of my ancient one, except one minor gripe:</li>
            <li> I still have my original Norelco shaver from 1995...</li>
            <li> Yes, agreed, it&#x27;s a pain to clean the blades but doing so, for me, immediately restores the close shave feeling</li>
            <li> I do not need to worry about clean up.</li>
            <li> It did not give a clean shave.</li>
            <li> It runs great ; I never use it in the shower though as I alwatys shave in the dry.  </li>
            <li> This one shaves well and rinses clean under the faucet.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth operation and completely cordless.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, just pop the top open, run hot water through it, and you&#x27;re good</li>
            <li> Otherwise, just pop the top open, run hot water through it, and you&#x27;re good</li>
            <li> I am impressed so far with how long it goes without recharging.</li>
            <li> But I liked my old Norelco&#x27;s and decided to give them another shot.</li>
            <li> After much research and reading many reviews, I chose this razor.  </li>
            <li> The shave is faster, closer and more gentle.</li>
            <li> Not a bad razor at all.  </li>
            <li> Norelco has a plastic body and is very light weight compared to my older metal body Panasonic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to clean - the shaving head hinges up and gives you complete access.  </li>
            <li> The price was right on Amazon with free shipping</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quiet, comfortable, fast, close and cheap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quiet, comfortable, fast, close and cheap.</li>
            <li> It gives a FAST, SMOOTH, and COMFORTABLE shave.  </li>
            <li> so the dry shave is not as good as this model, but the wet shave is very nice.</li>
            <li> so the dry shave is not as good as this model, but the wet shave is very nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used pretty much every Norelco out there from the top of the line SensoTouch 3D to their bottom of the line 6000 series.</li>
            <li> To their credit they kept replacing it with a new one, however the original model was no longer available, and they tried to give me a lower value one.  </li>
            <li> Much better than my old Norelco and outclasses my newer Braun shaver.     </li>
            <li> These razors have lasted me years each which saves a bundle over buying disposables and is entirely worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> The first full charge seemed to last forever, I was impressed and charging time is minimal.</li>
            <li> I only take the heads out for a more detailed cleaning about once a month.</li>
            <li> I only take the heads out for a more detailed cleaning about once a month.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Noreco claims this model offers \\&quot;50% more shaving surface.\\</li>
            <li> After more than ten years of using a Braun, this gentle Philips Norelco Speed Electric Razor is so elegant and thorough by comparison.</li>
            <li> The lighter weight compared to the prior models is nice too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad, he had to have one like his old one, and this fit the bill!</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I own the same razor</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with the battery life and believe that it is better than other razors that sell in the $50.00 range.</li>
            <li> This particular shaver in my opinion is very reasonably priced and I like it because I can rinse out the head and drive assembly (waterproof) under tap water which makes it easy.</li>
            <li> (right here on Amazon).</li>
            <li> Did not work, right out of the box.</li>
            <li> the evidence that even a superior electric can&#x27;t beat a conventional blade for closeness.</li>
            <li> is an efficient machine shaving, silent, easy to clean, no vibrations, is an excellence in razors</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t like it very much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It looks good on the bathroom counter while taking up little space standing in it&#x27;s counter top holder, has a strong motor, no fancy whistles or bells and doesn&#x27;t bog down when giving you a shave.  </li>
            <li> And yes, FWIW, close at hand, I have a new set of blades and currently find no need to replace the original set of blades.  :)</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll go through several cheap ones and won&#x27;t enjoy them as much as this one.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a Panasonic wet/dry shaver for many years, having only to replace the foil head and blades once.</li>
            <li> The color of the shaver is more of a silver than blue as shown.</li>
            <li> This is my third and this is by far the most comfortable.  </li>
            <li> But this shaver is mediocre at best.  </li>
            <li> It took the third shave to get the hang of it, but I am really pleased at the performance.  </li>
            <li> My last Norelco lasted 12 years, so I&#x27;m glad I stuck with another Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> I keep my shavers for many years and have had 2 Braun shavers prior to this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to get it as a present for my father.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now you gotta by a new COMPLETELY NEW HEAD, not just replace the blades IN the head, which would be more customer friendly and cost conscious, but</li>
            <li> This model has a good ergonomic design making it easy to get around facial contours without missing a hair.</li>
            <li> But in all I have been pleased with their products as long as the quality stays where it is</li>
            <li> Speaking of shakedowns, the merchants on here selling this model for over $300 are doing a good job of that too since this razor sold for less than 90 bucks new.</li>
            <li> In my case, the \\&quot;dual blade system\\&quot; and \\&quot;reflex action system\\&quot; probably contribute most of all to the relatively close and absolutely comfortable shave this razor offers</li>
            <li> Shaver is quiet, very easy to clean and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> The detachable head detaches too easily when cleaning or simply shaking out the cut hair</li>
            <li> It cleans up easily and stays charged for 2 weeks when used daily.</li>
            <li> FAST FAST FAST!</li>
            <li> They were certainly right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned only Norelco razors (3 in all)for the past 44 years and this by far the best yet.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to replace an old Norelco Spectra shaver that works fine but was getting old.  </li>
            <li> Shaves close comfortably, charge last a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Best part is you can wash it when it is dirty.</li>
            <li> I give this unit 5-stars because it shaves me very close.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely.    </li>
            <li> They should be ashamed at how much they charge for them.  </li>
            <li> much closer shave&lt;br /&gt;very</li>
            <li> Once my coordination had improved and my face had adjusted to the razor, I was getting a reasonably close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Norelco really has it all together.  </li>
            <li> During that time I&#x27;d once needed to replace the battery, so I&#x27;d say it was very reliable.  </li>
            <li> and it shaves very well, which is the biggest priority.  </li>
            <li> With no hassle at all, I was offered a free replacement by FedEx (which I received 3 days later) along with a free return label to send back the defective shaver (by dropping it off in a FedEx pickup box in my neighborhood).</li>
            <li> Very close shave.  </li>
            <li> The real surprise is how close and fast this shaves me.  </li>
            <li> and you can really see where you&#x27;re trimming - it&#x27;s not blocked by the shaving head.  </li>
            <li> and I am still waiting for the \\&quot;low battery\\&quot; light to come on.</li>
            <li> This Norelco product shaves as close as much more expensive shavers, and does a good job around more stuble resistant areas such as the upper lip area.  </li>
            <li> A one hour quick charge after the first initial charge of 12 hours.</li>
            <li> The shaver does an ok job of shaving you, but so does 10 other types of shavers.</li>
            <li> It also holds a charge longer than most other brands, keeping me well shaven for a two week vacation with no worry about having to recharge.  </li>
            <li> The whole new assy. is $75 to $80 depending on where you allow yourself to get ripped off!</li>
            <li> The new Norelco takes 1/3 the shaving time of the older one and wshes up well in hot water.</li>
            <li> PHILIPPS wouldn&#x27;t make as much money as selling you a whole new assembly.</li>
            <li> I know i will enjoy using this product for as long as its function</li>
            <li> This model is both smooth to use, no pullng, and provides a very close shave, nearly the same as a Fusion razor.</li>
            <li> Almost forgot how fast this shaver works with new blades.</li>
            <li> Easy to grip even with wet hands.</li>
            <li> They COULD have made it so the heads were replaceable like the older models</li>
            <li> so I decided that since I had an older Norelco Electric Razor I would search them out again for purchase.  </li>
            <li> than the head retaining clip, the build quality is decent.</li>
            <li> Battery life is similar and adequate.  </li>
            <li> this is like the older Phillips models, with a sideburn trimmer and no bells and whistles.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.ry shave.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this electric razor for anyone.</li>
            <li> With the price of blades as high as they are this</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this model.</li>
            <li> his shaver from early 70&#x27;s still works!!</li>
            <li> Great razor, can&#x27;t go wrong this unit and it shipped out ASAP from the vendor.</li>
            <li> I get as good a shave as any double edge razor I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I find that I have to pass it over my hard to shave facial areas several times more than I would expect but very comfortable and no razor burn.  </li>
            <li> If this lasts as long as my past Norelco&#x27;s (after 18 years the last one finally died), I will be very happy.  </li>
            <li> The manual stated that it may take a while for my face to adjust to the new shaver and to not expect a clean shave the first few times.</li>
            <li> The motor is very quiet, it&#x27;s easy to clean, and it has a small stand to store the razor upright by your sink.</li>
            <li> I tried the new Braun shaver about 2 years ago</li>
            <li> I can live with that.  </li>
            <li> Stroking both straight-line and circular (both directions) may be a new thing for those new to Norelco.</li>
            <li> I am just begenning to get used to the new model.</li>
            <li> Shaves as close as (if not closer) than the safety razor I had to use while waiting for the new razor in the mail.  </li>
            <li> I did some research and saw the new shavers...but didnt want anything from China...</li>
            <li> put in new batteries and its still going strong!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the point in the new arcitec models.  </li>
            <li> This one will likley out live me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While you can&#x27;t wet shave with this, you can clean it under running water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While you can&#x27;t wet shave with this, you can clean it under running water.</li>
            <li> But for the many who must deal with the common array of curves, ridges, swirls, nooks, crannies, along with a sag or two, this feature won&#x27;t help much - if at all.</li>
            <li> The only thing I very much dislike is the price gouging on replacement blades.  </li>
            <li> If you need to purchase a new shaver Norelco makes good products, but unless you want to settle for mediocrity you might want to consider other models.</li>
            <li> like my old does which I really like, but this new one is so much easier to open by just a push of a button.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is this:  If you have an average to above average beard (meaning not having a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at noon already) then this is a great razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had a similar Norelco that I&#x27;d spent far more money on that</li>
            <li> A blade is not better and this is more versatile with the integrated trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Their old razors had 90 minute run time batteries while their new ones, even the over $200 models, have 50 minute batteries.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend pretty much any Panasonic if you&#x27;re looking for a wet shave in a foil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend pretty much any Panasonic if you&#x27;re looking for a wet shave in a foil</li>
            <li> The HQ9 heads are a far better value -- you get 90% of the performance of the RQ12 heads at less than a third of the cost.</li>
            <li> This motor sounds like it is barely working compared to the old one, but it does give me a decent shave.</li>
            <li> This model is super quiet, amazingly fast, and like the other Norelco Speed Electric Razors lasts for years.  </li>
            <li> I clean the razor out every use by running water through the head areas and leave it open to dry for about an hour or so.  </li>
            <li> But it was clear that getting a close shave would take practice.</li>
            <li> I kept switching between my old Norelco and the Braun model.</li>
            <li> but like it so far.  </li>
            <li> It also comes with a plastic protective shaver heads cover just like my old one did.</li>
            <li> In fact, it offers the closest one that I have received to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He was surprised at all the extras from his old shaver.  </li>
            <li> Bought parts for my old one and use it for travel.  </li>
            <li> feel that  my old 688XL had.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again - unlike the old model I had.&lt;br /&gt;Seems engineers - always have to change something -</li>
            <li> I also like that you plug the charging cord directly into the razor and you don&#x27;t have to carry a charging stand around.</li>
            <li> husband has used a Norelco for years and was having some problems with his old one.</li>
            <li> I clean the shave head with a little alcohol before shaving and wash my face after and apply moisturizer.</li>
            <li> What seems to be true for this electric are: (1) the price, which is hefty, (2) the shaving comfort, which is exceptional, and, (3)</li>
            <li> the rasor is a big improvement over my much older model....</li>
            <li> I needed a new razor as the battery on the old razor finally gave up the ghost.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use some Face Saver (Remington) which makes a dry shave just as comfortable as a wet shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use some Face Saver (Remington) which makes a dry shave just as comfortable as a wet shave.</li>
            <li> Charges fast, and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> It gives him the shave he wants, has a trimmer for his moustache and lasts a long while on a charge.</li>
            <li> this new Norelco has a much larger shaving surface.</li>
            <li> The extra row of rings really makes a difference compared with the HQ8 (and lower) heads on the lower models, which have only one ring of slots and holes.</li>
            <li> The 8250XL was only $67.88 on Amazon which was about $30 cheaper than my old one!</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave without irritating the skin.</li>
            <li> &quot; That will be useful for those heroes with wide expanses of flat, taunt beard.</li>
            <li> It is so very quiet compared to my old one and gives me a closer shave to boot.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Immersible&#x27; apparently means &#x27;can be submerged in water.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> I have used electric razors for nearly two decades and can emphatically state that this is a solid shaver that provides a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I bought a Norelco re-chargeable wet razor and it performed very well for about 18 months.  </li>
            <li> the blades feel rough and practically tear at the stubble, so much so that I approach the task (of shaving) now with some steeling of the will.</li>
            <li> was likely 9-10 years old.  </li>
            <li> It works well and is very quiet compared to my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> Fast shave wet or</li>
            <li> Ill be glad if the new one lasts 10 yrs.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing to say about this electric shaver is that the trimmer collapses too easily.  </li>
            <li> (and you shouldn&#x27;t either) buy one of these pieces of junk as long as I live.</li>
            <li> It does not sound like the blades are spinning very quickly, but it works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> I keep one shaver in the car since Im a home health clinician and want to be clean shaven in late afternoon.</li>
            <li> I have an old Norelco 6613X that I have used constantly for 8 years now that is finally on</li>
            <li> I was looking for the &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; Norelco shavers since my model 5822XL (10 yrs old) finally left me; this one is similar but not the costly ones at all the stores.</li>
            <li> But major back surgery along with the accumulated indignities of advancing age prompted me to try an electric.</li>
            <li> My guess is they actually mean this is the time it takes to acquire needed physical coordination, this being important and non-trivial.</li>
            <li> This razor is much lighter than the Norelco I previously used for years.</li>
            <li> Most reviews were positive but there were a number of really bad ones.</li>
            <li> While mistreating customers may result in short term profit, pissing off loyal customers are the seeds of failure.</li>
            <li> The built-in trimmer is somewhat poor, but it&#x27;s hard to find a good trimmer on any electric razor.</li>
            <li> $80) of my previous high end</li>
            <li> I am going to break down and get new blades for it after 5 years just to see if the close shave I&#x27;m getting can be improved.  </li>
            <li> The last battery charge didn&#x27;t seem to last long, and it had just stopped working.</li>
            <li> I have always used Remington micro-screen razors in the past and I must say this one is much easier on the face.</li>
            <li> Have not used long</li>
            <li> I went to empty it outside - and the God damned blades flipped out too!! :</li>
            <li> It also holds a charge for a long time (I get 5 shaves, sometimes</li>
            <li> It has long charging life.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to another long life together.</li>
            <li> It also holds a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;(The generic recharger/transformer is also a step down in flimsiness and clutter from the dedicated r/t on my last Norelco.)</li>
            <li> For me that&#x27;s not a big deal, since I use an electric to save time, and wet shaving takes twice as long as a dry shave.</li>
            <li> The last one of the same Norelco product (previous version)</li>
            <li> and they responded that if the stand allowed re-charging it would diminish the battery in the long term due to being constantly charging.  </li>
            <li> It performs poorly around my chin leaves certain whisker untouched, so I have to use my regular razor for touch up.</li>
            <li> Although these are made in The Netherlands (and not China as are other mid-</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;contour following system,\\&quot; on the other hand, may be just what the doctor ordered.</li>
            <li> It shaves as close or closer than other brands that I&#x27;ve tried and Amazon had it priced too low to pass up.  </li>
            <li> older Panasonic operates at 10,000 rpm and the Norelco seems to operate in slow motion by comparison.</li>
            <li> My old Spectra works better, and I should have merely purchased a new set of cutting heads for it.  </li>
            <li> After Amazon refused to match the price on a product I found for less shortly ater I purchased, and refused provide a credit insisting I return and reorder the product, I ultimately purchased it from a national competitor for 40% less.  </li>
            <li> Oftentimes the price of an entire 8000-series razor with HQ9 heads is less than the cost of just the replacement heads for a SensoTouch 3D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 3 foil heads do seem to make less irritation than the standard heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Foil shavers don&#x27;t last long and can really tear you&#x27;re face up when they fail.  </li>
            <li> I tiny bit different, but not so confusing.</li>
            <li> So, for the price, considering the alternatives on today&#x27;s drugstore shelves, money well spent.  </li>
            <li> My Panasonic gave a close shave when used as a wet</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll want to be careful when taking the heads out for cleaning so as not to break the retaining clip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> Should you prefer a wet shave and want to stay with a rotary, take a look at the Norelco AT830.</li>
            <li> Should you prefer a wet shave and want to stay with a rotary, take a look at the Norelco AT830.</li>
            <li> The stand was obviously designed to allow charging while the shaver is in the stand, but that feature is disabled in this model of shaver.  </li>
            <li> This gives the closest shave you&#x27;ll ever get with an electric while completing your shave in a minimal amount of time.  </li>
            <li> other thing you give up with this model is the ability to shave wet.</li>
            <li> Have 2 of these, one to leave at home and the other for travel.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will give me 5-10 years lijke my other Norelco.</li>
            <li> I recommend them over any other electric shaver product.</li>
            <li> What really ticks me off is that when the rotary blades get dull they&#x27;re REALLY dull and just quit shaving you.</li>
            <li> The 8250 has an unbelievably long battery life and a convenient low battery warning light but the shaving experience is brutal compared to the 688XL.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can figure is that the people who complained did not follow the manufactures recommendations before shaving.</li>
            <li> I have an average beard</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Probably the most annoying thing about this model is that you have no clue when the battery is going to run out.</li>
            <li> Has one on their $45 shaver, but Norelco is going to shake you down if you want to monitor the battery.  </li>
            <li> While there are more expensive Norelco&#x27;s on the market, you wont go wrong with this model.</li>
            <li> It does provide a closer shave with less razor burn.</li>
            <li> I have used this product slightly over a month.</li>
            <li> and I never get less than 10 years from one.</li>
            <li> It shaves as well as a blade, has a pop-up trimmer for sideburn,moustache and the odd mis-placed hair.</li>
            <li> At less than half the price (approx.</li>
            <li> He loves his Norelco razor and finds shaving much less trouble.</li>
            <li> Could I use this everyday?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not buy any of their rechargeable razors because they obviously have a problem with them and do not want to stand behind their defective products.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with razor burn on my neck at times, but not yet with this unit.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I dropped it and decided to replace it with one of these rather than try to get it fixed.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and charge it approx.</li>
            <li> This shaver was just plain dead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have used 2 previous Norelco shavers over the past 20 years.</li>
            <li> The 8250 is lighter than the previous ones and works just as well if not better (closer shave).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done with Norelco and will try and make sure I never buy anything from the merchants who are on here now trying to gouge people by selling this model at outrageous prices.</li>
            <li> So the included stand serves no greater function than to enable you to stand your shaver upright when it&#x27;s not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband has always used a safety razor and shave cream but no more.  </li>
            <li> some irritation was when I pressed too hard.  </li>
            <li> I bought a Norelco electric razor in like the late 1980&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> At least Amazon still sells what ever is still out there.</li>
            <li> I mean NEVER</li>
            <li> With my bad back I thought it would be easier to use the Norelco sitting than standing at a sink with a bladed razor.  </li>
            <li> If you have to shave every day and you have a thick beard, then this is the razor for you!  </li>
            <li> I have a tough beard.</li>
            <li> Neither shaver was ever dropped or handled roughly, and I conclude this is a bad model.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a thin plastic retainer system rather than a sturdy combination of metal and plastic in the 3D.</li>
            <li> not a great buy for the money.  </li>
            <li> So I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor in June 2012 and the battery failed in December 2012.  </li>
            <li> terribly underpowered, cant compare to cheaper versions; with my other norelco and also remington r835, sgaving takes 1/4 the time with</li>
            <li> Hopefully that will extend the life of the cutting heads.    </li>
            <li> disappointing, since ive used norelco and remingtom shavers like this one for 40 years</li>
            <li> Morello has gone crazy with greed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m mad as hell</li>

            <li> even if it is working.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. - Noreclo replaced the blades my mail - but the email customer survey - is all &#x27;Yes&#x27; or &#x27;No&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;No essay parts - and once each part is submitted - it can Not be redone. :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After Amazon refused to match the price on a product I found for less shortly ater I purchased, and refused provide a credit insisting I return and reorder the product, I ultimately purchased it from a national competitor for 40% less.  I no longer just buy from Amazon without checking prices.  This product is offered at $140 on Amazon.  I purchased at Bed Bath and Beyond for $80.  While mistreating customers may result in short term profit, pissing off loyal customers are the seeds of failure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have used 2 previous Norelco shavers over the past 20 years. I tried the new Braun shaver about 2 years ago but I didn&#x27;t like it very much. It pulled my beard and the foil broke after only a short period of use. I replaced the foil and blades for 40.00 (what a rip off)but I kept switching between my old Norelco and the Braun model. This year I decided to treat myself to the newer Norelco 8250 XL. Its fantastic. Much better than my old Norelco and outclasses my newer Braun shaver.     However. before buying this Norelco, I decided to read some personal reviews. Most reviews were positive but there were a number of really bad ones. So I was skeptical. But I liked my old Norelco&#x27;s and decided to give them another shot. I&#x27;m very glad I did.     Frankly, I cant understand the bad reviews. The only thing I can figure is that the people who complained did not follow the manufactures recommendations before shaving. When I was in a hurry, I often shaved without washing and cleaning my face and was not at all pleased with the results. Pulling my beard, scratchy feeling and some irritation. But every time I wash and clean my face, my shave is EXCELLENT. If you follow the recommendation of washing and cleaning your face you wont be disappointed. Kudo&#x27;s to Philips.     While there are more expensive Norelco&#x27;s on the market, you wont go wrong with this model. For the price, (I bought it at Macy&#x27;s for $79.99 and got a 10% discount with a coupon my wife had recieved in the mail), it was a steal.     Do yourself a big favor and buy this model or a similar Norelco model and you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> The shaver does an ok job of shaving you, but so does 10 other types of shavers. What really ticks me off is that when the rotary blades get dull they&#x27;re REALLY dull and just quit shaving you. Now you gotta by a new COMPLETELY NEW HEAD, not just replace the blades IN the head, which would be more customer friendly and cost conscious, but NO O O O O O O O . PHILIPPS wouldn&#x27;t make as much money as selling you a whole new assembly. They COULD have made it so the heads were replaceable like the older models but no! The whole new assy. is $75 to $80 depending on where you allow yourself to get ripped off! I...WILL...NEVER, I mean NEVER (and you shouldn&#x27;t either) buy one of these pieces of junk as long as I live. It&#x27;s just another example of BS commercialisim and I&#x27;m mad as hell and I&#x27;m not gonna take it any more!</li>
            <li> Have not used long but like it so far.  I&#x27;ve always liked Norelco so am optimistic it will be a great razor.</li>
            <li> I needed a new razor as the battery on the old razor finally gave up the ghost.  After much research and reading many reviews, I chose this razor.  I&#x27;ve had the razor for a bit over a month and have charged it twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks good on the bathroom counter while taking up little space standing in it&#x27;s counter top holder, has a strong motor, no fancy whistles or bells and doesn&#x27;t bog down when giving you a shave.  I find that I have to pass it over my hard to shave facial areas several times more than I would expect but very comfortable and no razor burn.  For me, a clean, satisfying shave which is what it&#x27;s all about day-after-day, six/seven days a week.  The razor holds a charge for over a week and makes for an excellent travel razor you can depend on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive?  Maybe.  But when you go into a drugstore to find an electric razor, junk stuff costs three-quarters of what this costs.  So, for the price, considering the alternatives on today&#x27;s drugstore shelves, money well spent.  After over a month of using this tiger, I won&#x27;t hesitate to give this razor a big thumbs up recommendation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(29APR12)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: For continued close shaves, I recommend brush cleaning the blade set every week or two.  Hair and debris builds up under the blades, raising the blades away from the skin in the process, preventing the closest possible shave.  Yes, agreed, it&#x27;s a pain to clean the blades but doing so, for me, immediately restores the close shave feeling I look for in an electric shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update information.  Recently (Mar 12) I used the razor on an eight day vacation and didn&#x27;t need to charge the razor.  I&#x27;m still using the original blade set and getting what I consider to be a close shave.  And yes, FWIW, close at hand, I have a new set of blades and currently find no need to replace the original set of blades.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope the above helps.</li>
            <li> is an efficient machine shaving, silent, easy to clean, no vibrations, is an excellence in razors</li>
            <li> This is a definite step up from the low end Norelco that I had. It does provide a closer shave with less razor burn. Unfortunately, my beard is so thick that nothing works great but this is the best that I have used.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an electric razor and this Norelco did pretty awesome job. The cut is clean, and it trims perfectly. I know i will enjoy using this product for as long as its function</li>
            <li> I have an old Norelco 6613X that I have used constantly for 8 years now that is finally on it&#x27;s last leg so I asked for this new shaver for father&#x27;s day and let my say this one is way better! It is so very quiet compared to my old one and gives me a closer shave to boot. I love the fact that you can rinse the heads &amp; top assembly under hot tap water to clean. Great idea! I has (2) LED lights that glow when charging and when the battery is low. It also has a pop-up trimmer, like my old does which I really like, but this new one is so much easier to open by just a push of a button. A one hour quick charge after the first initial charge of 12 hours. It comes with an upright stand, power/charging adapter, cleaning brush and travel pouch. The 8250XL was only $67.88 on Amazon which was about $30 cheaper than my old one! It also comes with a plastic protective shaver heads cover just like my old one did. In my opinion Norelco/Phillips shavers are the best you can buy and I would never buy anything else.</li>
            <li> unfortunatly I have found this product the  norelco 8240xl to compare most unfavorably with the norelco spectra 8831xl,which I consider to be  far superior to the latest, the Norelco arcitec.</li>
            <li> Bought two from big deals. It was really nice. Send one as gift to my dad and he likes it as well.&lt;br /&gt;It is very smooth when you shave and the noise is next to nothing. Best part is you can wash it when it is dirty. I do not need to worry about clean up.</li>
            <li> This shaver is described as &#x27;washable&#x27; and &#x27;immersible.&#x27;  &#x27;Immersible&#x27; apparently means &#x27;can be submerged in water.&#x27;  So can a rock.  And -- once you get to the instructions inside the bank vault-secure packaging -- that&#x27;s about the same condition in which the shaver is &#x27;immersible.&#x27;  No power connected.  Not switched on.  In no sense is this a wet-n-dry shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a mistake on my part to buy this shaver.  I feel the product descriptions were somewhat misleading.  Fool me once, Norelco...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The generic recharger/transformer is also a step down in flimsiness and clutter from the dedicated r/t on my last Norelco.)</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic Foil Razor that would not charge so I decided that since I had an older Norelco Electric Razor I would search them out again for purchase.  I researched both them and Remington Razors and always came back to Norelco.    I decided on the 8250 because it has a low charge indicator built in.  I am sure the 8240 will work as well.  The price was right on Amazon with free shipping so I got this one.    I give this unit 5-stars because it shaves me very close.  It does not sound like the blades are spinning very quickly, but it works extremely well.  Do I have the thickest beard in the world, no, but I do use this every weekend, and I use a regular blade razor throughout the week.  Could I use this everyday? Absolutely.    If there is one thing I semi-dislike it is that the Razor has it&#x27;s own stand but you cannot charge it in the stand.  I sent a question to Norelco when I registered it and they responded that if the stand allowed re-charging it would diminish the battery in the long term due to being constantly charging.  I can live with that.  I clean the razor out every use by running water through the head areas and leave it open to dry for about an hour or so.  Hopefully that will extend the life of the cutting heads.    Bottom line is this:  If you have an average to above average beard (meaning not having a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at noon already) then this is a great razor.  If you get it with free shipping you&#x27;ll be quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned NORELCO electric razors before but this on is by far the best.  I have an average beard and I only need to charge mine once a month, if that!  I always get a smooth, close shave even in humid SW Florida. I am going to break down and get new blades for it after 5 years just to see if the close shave I&#x27;m getting can be improved.  Spend the extra $$$ and get this razor. You&#x27;ll go through several cheap ones and won&#x27;t enjoy them as much as this one.  Your choice.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco electric razors for 18 years and they are consistently the best.  I have tried Remmington and Braun but neither was as comfortable or as close of a shave.  These razors have lasted me years each which saves a bundle over buying disposables and is entirely worth the investment.  The only thing I very much dislike is the price gouging on replacement blades.  They should be ashamed at how much they charge for them.  But in all I have been pleased with their products as long as the quality stays where it is I will continue to purchase Norelco razors every time.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Panasonic wet/dry shaver for many years, having only to replace the foil head and blades once. When it no longer functioned I decided to replace it with this $50 Norelco shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco has a plastic body and is very light weight compared to my older metal body Panasonic. The lighter shaver is easier to use and hold. But it has a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on/off button and spring loaded trimmer require more force to operate than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My older Panasonic operates at 10,000 rpm and the Norelco seems to operate in slow motion by comparison. The slower blades do not give a smooth feel to shaving. I could feel the blades pulling my hairs. It did not give a clean shave. The manual stated that it may take a while for my face to adjust to the new shaver and to not expect a clean shave the first few times. They were certainly right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do miss the wet/dry feature. My Panasonic gave a close shave when used as a wet shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco is acceptable. But you get what you pay for. Next time I will spend the extra money and get a wet/dry shaver again.</li>
            <li> terribly underpowered, cant compare to cheaper versions; with my other norelco and also remington r835, sgaving takes 1/4 the time with much closer shave&lt;br /&gt;very disappointing, since ive used norelco and remingtom shavers like this one for 40 years</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a rechargeable electric shaver because I needed to replace the third electric shaver that I have owned from another manufacturer of electric shavers. I decided to try Philips Norelco for a change and I am glad that I did. The first full charge seemed to last forever, I was impressed and charging time is minimal. I replace the rotary shaving heads once a year (as recommended by Philips Norelco) and they are easy to get and cheap (right here on Amazon). The shaving experience for me is very good with no irritation to my skin. The rotary heads do their job. This particular shaver in my opinion is very reasonably priced and I like it because I can rinse out the head and drive assembly (waterproof) under tap water which makes it easy. Just follow the manufactures guide and instructions. Very nice!</li>
            <li> I have used electric razors for nearly two decades and can emphatically state that this is a solid shaver that provides a close shave.  In fact, it offers the closest one that I have received to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the beard trimmer does not provide as close a trim as others which I have owned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used pretty much every Norelco out there from the top of the line SensoTouch 3D to their bottom of the line 6000 series. For my face, the HQ9 heads on the 8000 series continue to be the best the Norelco has ever produced. The extra row of rings really makes a difference compared with the HQ8 (and lower) heads on the lower models, which have only one ring of slots and holes. The shave is faster, closer and more gentle. I also find them to be preferable to the HQ10 heads on the Arcitec line (which I believe is no longer produced).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get as good a shave (and a bit of a better shave on the neck and jaw line) you have to go to the RQ12 heads for the SensoTouch 3D. The HQ9 heads are a far better value -- you get 90% of the performance of the RQ12 heads at less than a third of the cost. Oftentimes the price of an entire 8000-series razor with HQ9 heads is less than the cost of just the replacement heads for a SensoTouch 3D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you give up with this razor is some build quality. Although these are made in The Netherlands (and not China as are other mid- and lower-end Norelco models) the build quality is still not as good as their higher end models. This is especially seen in the way the combs and cutters are held into place - it&#x27;s just a thin plastic retainer system rather than a sturdy combination of metal and plastic in the 3D. You&#x27;ll want to be careful when taking the heads out for cleaning so as not to break the retaining clip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the head retaining clip, the build quality is decent. Easy to grip even with wet hands. The built-in trimmer is somewhat poor, but it&#x27;s hard to find a good trimmer on any electric razor. It comes with a stand, but it&#x27;s only for storage and not charging -- you have to take it out of the stand to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing you give up with this model is the ability to shave wet. For me that&#x27;s not a big deal, since I use an electric to save time, and wet shaving takes twice as long as a dry shave. In the summer months when it&#x27;s humid I&#x27;ll use some Face Saver (Remington) which makes a dry shave just as comfortable as a wet shave. Should you prefer a wet shave and want to stay with a rotary, take a look at the Norelco AT830. It has RQ8 heads so the dry shave is not as good as this model, but the wet shave is very nice. I&#x27;d recommend pretty much any Panasonic if you&#x27;re looking for a wet shave in a foil shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While you can&#x27;t wet shave with this, you can clean it under running water. I only take the heads out for a more detailed cleaning about once a month. Otherwise, just pop the top open, run hot water through it, and you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quiet, comfortable, fast, close and cheap. Can&#x27;t ask for more from a razor.

            <li> I bought a Norelco re-chargeable wet razor and it performed very well for about 18 months.  At that point, it wouldn&#x27;t turn off and the motor burned out.  Norelco replaced it under the two-year warranty.  About the same amount of time later, the replacement died about the same way.  This time, Norelco decided that the two-year warranty that came with the replacement did not apply because it was a replacement razor.  Their customer service folks were not at all helpful, even when I informed them I would never buy another Norelco product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy any of their rechargeable razors because they obviously have a problem with them and do not want to stand behind their defective products.</li>
            <li> I had used a blade razor all my life. But major back surgery along with the accumulated indignities of advancing age prompted me to try an electric. I bought two; neither was up to snuff. Eventually I bought this somewhat pricey Norelco Speed Shaver. (Norelco is circumspect about its model numbers. From examining the pictures and comparing features in the inclosed, multi-model instruction manual, my razor seems to be the 8250XL.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Norelco was very comfortable for shaving from Day One. But it was clear that getting a close shave would take practice. Stroking both straight-line and circular (both directions) may be a new thing for those new to Norelco. The instructions say your beard requires a 21 day acclimation period. My guess is they actually mean this is the time it takes to acquire needed physical coordination, this being important and non-trivial. Once my coordination had improved and my face had adjusted to the razor, I was getting a reasonably close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noreco claims this model offers \\&quot;50% more shaving surface.\\&quot; That will be useful for those heroes with wide expanses of flat, taunt beard. But for the many who must deal with the common array of curves, ridges, swirls, nooks, crannies, along with a sag or two, this feature won&#x27;t help much - if at all. The \\&quot;contour following system,\\&quot; on the other hand, may be just what the doctor ordered. In my case, the \\&quot;dual blade system\\&quot; and \\&quot;reflex action system\\&quot; probably contribute most of all to the relatively close and absolutely comfortable shave this razor offers up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, the Speed electric-XL claims a \\&quot;technology\\&quot; or \\&quot;system\\&quot; to meet whatever your shaving need might be. How this works out in practice will vary depending on your face and beard. What seems to be true for this electric are: (1) the price, which is hefty, (2) the shaving comfort, which is exceptional, and, (3) the evidence that even a superior electric can&#x27;t beat a conventional blade for closeness. Must of us know (3) but have our own reasons for preferring an electric device.us know (3) but have our own reasons for preferring an electric device.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave without irritating the skin. The color of the shaver is more of a silver than blue as shown.</li>
            <li> Good quality and great price</li>
            <li> Husband very happy with purchase.  He was surprised at all the extras from his old shaver.  Price was comparable so having it delivered to our door made the decision easy.</li>
            <li> I got this during the gold box offer before it runs out. Thank god i got it. A reliable brand from Philips and a good deal.</li>
            <li> I have owned Norelco shavers for years and this is THE BEST shaver I have EVER purchased!!  It is QUIET!!  It gives a FAST, SMOOTH, and COMFORTABLE shave.  I have trouble with razor burn on my neck at times, but not yet with this unit.  If your thinking about buying this item then STOP thinking, BUY!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my third and this is by far the most comfortable.  Bought parts for my old one and use it for travel.  This one stays home.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco for 10 years before it died.  Then, in 1-year I returned to the company 3!  To their credit they kept replacing it with a new one, however the original model was no longer available, and they tried to give me a lower value one.  It&#x27;s a shame.</li>
            <li> Extremely happy with both product and delivery.  Norelco really has it all together.  Battery life is great, cleaning is easy, and the confort of the shave is excellent.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco 9190XL for years and it was a great razor.  Unfortunately, I dropped it and decided to replace it with one of these rather than try to get it fixed.  Big mistake.  Norelco was once the premier shaver manufacturer and the 9190XL was great, but now like this model they make only junk.  Their old razors had 90 minute run time batteries while their new ones, even the over $200 models, have 50 minute batteries.  Good way to cheap out Norelco.  Probably the most annoying thing about this model is that you have no clue when the battery is going to run out. It just stops. To solve that problem, you have to spend over $200 to get a Norelco model with a battery indicator.  Of course, Conair can manage to put a digital battery indicator on their $20 trimmer and Remington Has one on their $45 shaver, but Norelco is going to shake you down if you want to monitor the battery.  Speaking of shakedowns, the merchants on here selling this model for over $300 are doing a good job of that too since this razor sold for less than 90 bucks new. I&#x27;m done with Norelco and will try and make sure I never buy anything from the merchants who are on here now trying to gouge people by selling this model at outrageous prices.</li>
            <li> I bought the Phillips Norelco 8250 as a replacement for my trusty Norelco 688XL the electronic of which had finally become too faulty after some ten years of use to sustain and charge the battery. The 8250 has an unbelievably long battery life and a convenient low battery warning light but the shaving experience is brutal compared to the 688XL. the blades feel rough and practically tear at the stubble, so much so that I approach the task (of shaving) now with some steeling of the will. It is, however, effective. The detachable head detaches too easily when cleaning or simply shaking out the cut hair but otherwise it delivers. I am looking for a model which has the comfort and luxurious feel that  my old 688XL had.</li>
            <li> This review written Oct 2013. I bought a Norelco electric razor in like the late 1980&#x27;s. It worked great. Eventually the battery died - and when I called Norelco - they said they never heard of it - can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t replace the sealed battery.&lt;br /&gt;So it went to a store (Name withheld)- but they &#x27;aim to please&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;I bought one of these &#x27;Speed&#x27; models - thinking &#x27;Great - I can shave faster&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;But the &#x27;Speed&#x27; label is a misnomer - the blades are just wider - this machine is NOT FASTER!!&lt;br /&gt;The stupid head is locked on - so when I flip it open - I have to hold it upside down.&lt;br /&gt;Once I went to empty it outside - and the God damned blades flipped out too!! :(&lt;br /&gt;Not like the old model - where I could just take the head off - empty it and clean.&lt;br /&gt;The shape of the body -- also makes it condusive to rolling around on a vanity or counter top.&lt;br /&gt;Again - unlike the old model I had.&lt;br /&gt;Seems engineers - always have to change something - even if it is working.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. - Noreclo replaced the blades my mail - but the email customer survey - is all &#x27;Yes&#x27; or &#x27;No&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;No essay parts - and once each part is submitted - it can Not be redone. :(</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. They are charging $199.00 for replacement blades. Morello has gone crazy with greed.</li>
            <li> After more than ten years of using a Braun, this gentle Philips Norelco Speed Electric Razor is so elegant and thorough by comparison. Just had my first comfortable shave and am glad I took advantage of Amazon&#x27;s Deal of the Day price of $50. It also has a 2 1/2 year warranty when you register your purchase online. What&#x27;s not to LOVE?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had a similar Norelco that I&#x27;d spent far more money on that was likely 9-10 years old.  During that time I&#x27;d once needed to replace the battery, so I&#x27;d say it was very reliable.  Saw this gold box deal and thought I might as well get it.  Overall it&#x27;s great, just a newer version of my ancient one, except one minor gripe: the release button is a hair trigger.  I&#x27;ve often brushed it and the razor opens up and dumps my trimmed facial hair out.  When I put it in a travel bag, it will almost always open during transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great price though and it shaves very well, which is the biggest priority.  Overall I approve.</li>
            <li> I received my shaver on March 27, 2012, and by May 27 it wouldn&#x27;t charge or work at all. The last battery charge didn&#x27;t seem to last long, and it had just stopped working. It wouldn&#x27;t work with the cord plugged in, and it wouldn&#x27;t charge. The lights had stopped working. This shaver was just plain dead. After reading my warranty and meandering through the Philips website I managed to get to a web chat (on May 28, Memorial Day) where I explained my problem. With no hassle at all, I was offered a free replacement by FedEx (which I received 3 days later) along with a free return label to send back the defective shaver (by dropping it off in a FedEx pickup box in my neighborhood). I could have done without the aggravation of having to use my warranty, but I must say my warranty service was excellent. As an update, let me add that the replacement shaver stopped holding a charge on Nov. 3 (2012) and can now only be used with the cord attached and plugged in. Neither shaver was ever dropped or handled roughly, and I conclude this is a bad model.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to replace an old Norelco Spectra shaver that works fine but was getting old.  I thought surely there would be an improvement in quality over time.  But this shaver is mediocre at best.  The closeness of the shave is not as good as the Spectra despite the newer floating head design of this shaver.  Battery life is similar and adequate.  An indicator will tell you when it is time to recharge.  The stand was obviously designed to allow charging while the shaver is in the stand, but that feature is disabled in this model of shaver.  So the included stand serves no greater function than to enable you to stand your shaver upright when it&#x27;s not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was disappointed with this shaver.  My old Spectra works better, and I should have merely purchased a new set of cutting heads for it.  If you need to purchase a new shaver Norelco makes good products, but unless you want to settle for mediocrity you might want to consider other models.</li>
            <li> I have used this product slightly over a month. It does not give a close shave even when used withe a pre-electric shave lotion. It performs poorly around my chin leaves certain whisker untouched, so I have to use my regular razor for touch up.</li>
            <li> I read multiple reviews of this shaver before making a purchase and the product has lived up to reviews.  This Norelco product shaves as close as much more expensive shavers, and does a good job around more stuble resistant areas such as the upper lip area.  Easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> I got this on the Deal of the Day and have been very pleased with its performance. The motor is very quiet, it&#x27;s easy to clean, and it has a small stand to store the razor upright by your sink. If you look for these on sale, they are great values; otherwise, I would wait to buy. I&#x27;ve owned several Norelco shavers and I can recommend this one.</li>
            <li> If you have to shave every day and you have a thick beard, then this is the razor for you!  This gives the closest shave you&#x27;ll ever get with an electric while completing your shave in a minimal amount of time.  It also holds a charge for a long time (I get 5 shaves, sometimes 6 from one charge) and only takes 10 minutes to fully charge, but you can also use the cord if the charge is gone.  Great razor, can&#x27;t go wrong this unit and it shipped out ASAP from the vendor.</li>
            <li> and I never get less than 10 years from one. Have 2 of these, one to leave at home and the other for travel. The lighter weight compared to the prior models is nice too.</li>
            <li> the rasor is a big improvement over my much older model....the two way rotation is good.  I should have gotten the three way, but this one will last me for some time. lt is still unclear what can be washed and what can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> not a great buy for the money.  i would consider trying a different brand before i would buy a norelco again.  i&#x27;m very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Works great. Very close shave.  It has long charging life. It holds a charge for 50 minutes.  It&#x27;s light and feels comfortable in your hand. Norelco has the best electric shavers.</li>
            <li> When you old and get in your ways, leave it to Amazon to help find the perfect item. I bought this for my dad, he had to have one like his old one, and this fit the bill! I tiny bit different, but not so confusing. He was very happy!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Didn&#x27;t think I would actually use this, but I did as the instructions said and used it exclusively for 3 weeks.  Now I can&#x27;t imagine that I will ever go back to a blade.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Doesn&#x27;t bother my skin. Charges fast, and holds a charge for a long time. Comfortable to handle. Excellent.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor in many  years. With my bad back I thought it would be easier to use the Norelco sitting than standing at a sink with a bladed razor.  It doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as a bladed razor but it gives a better shave when your face gets used to it.  The only time a got some irritation was when I pressed too hard.  I clean the shave head with a little alcohol before shaving and wash my face after and apply moisturizer. So far so good.</li>
            <li> Most amazing electric razor I have ever used. I could not believe the quietness and speed, but most of all the close shave this razor provided. I get as good a shave as any double edge razor I&#x27;ve used in the past. I highly recommend this electric razor for anyone.</li>
            <li> This razor was a good buy. It works well and is very quiet compared to my old Norelco. I have been pleased with the battery life and believe that it is better than other razors that sell in the $50.00 range.</li>
            <li> Finally got to use this razor for my birthday and it is a great deal for the price and performance.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in many years. After reading the reviews and finding this razor model on the \\&quot;Deal of the day\\&quot; I decided to buy it. It&#x27;s a great electric razor. This model has a good ergonomic design making it easy to get around facial contours without missing a hair. It shaves as well as a blade, has a pop-up trimmer for sideburn,moustache and the odd mis-placed hair. It cleans up easily and stays charged for 2 weeks when used daily. With the price of blades as high as they are this has the added benefit of saving money too! I&#x27;m very pleased with the Philips Norelco Razor and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this shaver. I have a tough beard. This model is both smooth to use, no pullng, and provides a very close shave, nearly the same as a Fusion razor. Further, it holds a charge for about 10 days, and is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used electric shavers for 25 years, off and on, this is BY FAR, the best one. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor in June 2012 and the battery failed in December 2012.  The company replaced it with model AT830/41.  I am just begenning to get used to the new model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned only Norelco razors (3 in all)for the past 44 years and this by far the best yet.  It took the third shave to get the hang of it, but I am really pleased at the performance.  Shaves as close as (if not closer) than the safety razor I had to use while waiting for the new razor in the mail.  If this lasts as long as my past Norelco&#x27;s (after 18 years the last one finally died), I will be very happy.  I highly recommend this model.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this razor -- he says it does a good job. I wonder, though, if it is worth spending extra and getting the best.</li>
            <li> If you can afford to buy one of these or any Norelco shaver just buy it don&#x27;t wait.  If you shave twice a day or even once this shaver will save you all kinds of greif.  Foil shavers don&#x27;t last long and can really tear you&#x27;re face up when they fail.  These rotary shavers will never injure you.  This shaver leaves you&#x27;re face smooth and it&#x27;s very quick.  I look foward to shaving.</li>
            <li> I was looking for the &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; Norelco shavers since my model 5822XL (10 yrs old) finally left me; this one is similar but not the costly ones at all the stores. It runs great ; I never use it in the shower though as I alwatys shave in the dry.  Hopefully it will give me 5-10 years lijke my other Norelco.</li>
            <li> This is my third Norelco.  The 8250 is lighter than the previous ones and works just as well if not better (closer shave).  Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> 50 years using Norelco shavers. This one shaves well and rinses clean under the faucet. Replacement blades easily available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always enjoyed shaving with Philips Norelco electric razors.  This is my 3rd one I owned.  The only negative thing to say about this electric shaver is that the trimmer collapses too easily.  I would prefer the trimmer to have more resistance from collapsing.</li>
            <li> Good things, the use of down feeling good, and the price is very cheap, hope Amazon continues to launch cheap goodies.</li>
            <li> My husband has had norelcos for years, and he seems to like this one.  He&#x27;s only had it for a week, but he is happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco products since hight school.  They&#x27;re unbeatable for close shaves and comfort.  I recommend them over any other electric shaver product.</li>
            <li> The shaver arrived in a timely manner and has worked just fine. It is a replacement of a Norelco I&#x27;ve had for over 20 yrs with no problems till the battery decided to call it quits. Looking forward to another long life together.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver that I have ever used.  Shaves close comfortably, charge last a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Shaver is quiet, very easy to clean and holds a charge for a long time. My last Norelco lasted 12 years, so I&#x27;m glad I stuck with another Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great for home or travel, easy to use. I&#x27;ve been using this one April 2012 and work great so far. The last one of the same Norelco product (previous version) I&#x27;ve used for 5 years and I was so pleased with it. I expect the same thing with this one and I&#x27;m sure that certainly it&#x27;ll be as great as the previous one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different brands and styles of electric razors and I always come back to the Norelco.  This model is super quiet, amazingly fast, and like the other Norelco Speed Electric Razors lasts for years.  It also holds a charge longer than most other brands, keeping me well shaven for a two week vacation with no worry about having to recharge.  It shaves as close or closer than other brands that I&#x27;ve tried and Amazon had it priced too low to pass up.  I&#x27;m a happy man with this model.</li>
            <li> Similar to my current electric razor.  Nice and smooth operation and completely cordless.  Easy to clean.  A really good price and value.</li>
            <li> I keep my shavers for many years and have had 2 Braun shavers prior to this one.  The real surprise is how close and fast this shaves me.  A blade is not better and this is more versatile with the integrated trimmer.  The trimmer pops up in the back and you can really see where you&#x27;re trimming - it&#x27;s not blocked by the shaving head.  It&#x27;s very easy to clean - the shaving head hinges up and gives you complete access.  It also holds a charge for a long time.  I use it everyday and charge it approx. once a week.  It&#x27;s tricky to shave around a gotee but that&#x27;s a technique issue that you&#x27;ll eventually figure out as I have.  At less than half the price (approx. $80) of my previous high end Braun shaver ($190), it&#x27;s the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> My husband has always used a safety razor and shave cream but no more.  He loves his Norelco razor and finds shaving much less trouble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to get it as a present for my father.&lt;br /&gt;He loved it!&lt;br /&gt;The price is about $50 when I got it, so it&#x27;s a deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my son and he is delighted with it. I own the same razor and I&#x27;m delighted with it also.</li>
            <li> Not a bad razor at all.  Have not had any problems with it.  I have always used Remington micro-screen razors in the past and I must say this one is much easier on the face.</li>
            <li> Did not work, right out of the box. I have another one, and it works fine. They did give me my money back though.</li>
            <li> I did some research and saw the new shavers...but didnt want anything from China...Im an American of Italian heritage with a beard closer to wire than hair!!  I need something that works for more than the one-year-Chinese-shaver. Doesnt even work for a doorstop!  NO MORE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dad loved Norelco, made in Holland.... his shaver from early 70&#x27;s still works!! I still have my original Norelco shaver from 1995...put in new batteries and its still going strong!&lt;br /&gt;BUT! this new Norelco has a much larger shaving surface. FAST FAST FAST! I keep one shaver in the car since Im a home health clinician and want to be clean shaven in late afternoon. The new Norelco takes 1/3 the shaving time of the older one and wshes up well in hot water. You wont be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SEPTEMBER 2013-Had the shaver around 6 months now....still going strong. Still the best razor I&#x27;ve ever had. Fast shave wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOVEMBER 2016-&lt;br /&gt;Finally decided to buy a replacement head. Almost forgot how fast this shaver works with new blades. Almost 3 years of daily use with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;My 1995 Norelco finally died. 21years of service. Ill be glad if the new one lasts 10 yrs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the point in the new arcitec models.  They don&#x27;t have a sideburn trimmer and cost more.  this is like the older Phillips models, with a sideburn trimmer and no bells and whistles.  The 3 foil heads do seem to make less irritation than the standard heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and rinsing out under the sink means I clean it more often.  Although the release button is too easy to press by accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;too bad they don&#x27;t make them like this anymore.  At least Amazon still sells what ever is still out there.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Norelco over a month ago. I am impressed so far with how long it goes without recharging. The last time I charged it was over two weeks ago and I am still waiting for the \\&quot;low battery\\&quot; light to come on. This razor is much lighter than the Norelco I previously used for years. This motor sounds like it is barely working compared to the old one, but it does give me a decent shave. I also like that you plug the charging cord directly into the razor and you don&#x27;t have to carry a charging stand around. Overall, I like it. It gives a fairly close shave, but I would not say it is a \\&quot;very\\&quot; close shave.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B006GQYSGE Philips Norelco AT830/41 Powertouch with Aquatec Electric Razor]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has used a Norelco for years and was having some problems with his old one. So I surprised him with this new one, a very happy man now!! It gives him the shave he wants, has a trimmer for his moustache and lasts a long while on a charge.</li>
            <li> My third Norelco over 40 years...they just keep making them better.This one will likley out live me. But maybe not</li>
