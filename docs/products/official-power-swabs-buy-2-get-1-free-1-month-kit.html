            <li>Does a great job.</li>
            <li>This product is remarkable.</li>
            <li>I had forgotten how truly effective these are!</li>
            <li>At most they are one shade lighter than when I began.</li>

            <li>They are just okay.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use,</li>
            <li>so this might have better results for me than someone else, however, I was really getting some yellowing that was becoming concerning</li>
            <li>I was quite excited and it never occurred to me that it might not work.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that I have also tried many other whitening products from Opalescence to Crest White Strips and this truly is the best product.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I am expecting too much!!</li>
            <li>I rubbed both on my teeth for longer than the 2 minutes even though that was what the directions suggested and could see very noticeable results after about 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It truly works really well without discomfort.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t notice much difference...</li>
            <li>Very powerful whitener, it can be used daily</li>
            <li>You can do better with a peroxide rinse prior to brushing and baking soda/toothpaste mix, on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Seems enough for my sparkling smile.</li>
            <li>My teeth are not super white or even bright white.</li>
            <li>Could actually tell a difference in my teeth after the first week.  </li>
            <li>also, seemed to swallow more of the product than what actually stayed on teeth due to saliva.  </li>
            <li>I have bonding on both sides of my 2 front teeth that is about 14 years old.</li>
            <li>No trays to mess with, takes only a few minutes and results are amazing!</li>
            <li>It works more slowly but internally so the results last so much longer.</li>
            <li>In the interest of full disclosure, I purchased via the radio commercials which play locally everyday, not on Amazon.</li>
            <li>With that being said, it was beginning to yellow near the gum line</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Just finished religiously applying this product yesterday completing the 7 day regimen.  In the interest of full disclosure, I purchased via the radio commercials which play locally everyday, not on Amazon. I purchased a few months ago and decided to save the kit until my daughters wedding next week. I was quite excited and it never occurred to me that it might not work. I&#x27;ve been listening to the Giniger commercials forever and assumed he must have a legit product to have continued on air for so long. After two days with no results the fear that this was bogus emerged. Still I swabbed for the remaining 5 days while using the toothpaste and mouthwash provided. Hope sprung eternal. I finished yesterday. My teeth are not super white or even bright white. At most they are one shade lighter than when I began. I still can&#x27;t believe it!</li>
            <li> Perhaps I am expecting too much!!</li>
            <li> Does a great job. I drink coffee and smoke cigarettes</li>
            <li> Could actually tell a difference in my teeth after the first week.  Had tried others before and wasn&#x27;t impressed.  This worked well &amp; I didn&#x27;t get any over sensitivity either.</li>
            <li> Phenomenal product. I have bonding on both sides of my 2 front teeth that is about 14 years old. With that being said, it was beginning to yellow near the gum line and I was looking at having to have it replaced with expensive Veneers  for about 18k. I did my research and saw that this was the only whitening product that worked on artificial dental work  and with some skepticism I ordered it. I used the stain remover and just 30 seconds after, applied the teeth whitening. I rubbed both on my teeth for longer than the 2 minutes even though that was what the directions suggested and could see very noticeable results after about 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t drink coffee, tea, or smoke so this might have better results for me than someone else, however, I was really getting some yellowing that was becoming concerning so I can say I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;I just LOVE this product.  Keep in mind that I have also tried many other whitening products from Opalescence to Crest White Strips and this truly is the best product. It works more slowly but internally so the results last so much longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not getting the results I expected.  Bummer.</li>
            <li> I personally did not experience a noticable change in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> This product is remarkable. It truly works really well without discomfort.</li>
            <li> Very powerful whitener, it can be used daily but I use it for a four days and then again every 2 weeks. Seems enough for my sparkling smile.</li>
            <li> I have used this 2 times in one year and I have crowns, veneers and fillings. Every time I use this product I get nothing but compliments from my students on how white my teeth are. Great Stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my teeth.</li>
            <li> This was my 2nd batch of Power Swabs. I had forgotten how truly effective these are! You won&#x27;t be disappointed. No trays to mess with, takes only a few minutes and results are amazing!</li>
            <li> A little more difficult to see the Stain Cleaner and Whitening being applied.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. Items were returned and awaiting promised refund.</li>
            <li> They are just okay.  The lifting action  does not last long and these swabs are pretty expensive.  You can do better with a peroxide rinse prior to brushing and baking soda/toothpaste mix, on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do whiteing as well as stated. Easy to use,</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t notice much difference...also, seemed to swallow more of the product than what actually stayed on teeth due to saliva.  Expensive for what it was.</li>
