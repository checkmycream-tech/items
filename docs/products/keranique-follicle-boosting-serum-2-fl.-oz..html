    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I loved it and received product before from the Keranique site and all was excellent!  </li>
            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>good part of hair care regimen for those who are losing hair</li>
            <li>Great grew my edges in 2 weeks love it</li>
            <li>Absolutely love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I find that my hair is getting thicker and I am pleased and will continue using this product.</li>
            <li>That makes me feel excited, when my hair seems to be disappearing.</li>
            <li>Seems manufacturers like to charge a lot of money for any product that will actually help you feel good about dealing with aging issues.</li>
            <li>I thought perhaps it was supposed to feel that way, so I did not wash it out as quickly as I should have.</li>
            <li>and  received  fairly  quickly.</li>
            <li>So far ir seems okay.  </li>
            <li>It takes a while, but there is new growth and it&#x27;s my original color (not gray)</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is suppose</li>
            <li>Not only does your hair grow some, but it feels thicker and more lush.  </li>
            <li>Since using this product I have noticed new hair growing with in the first month..</li>
            <li>this is a very good product… I own a small at home salon and bought this for one of my customers who had fine thin hair… she has tried other products to grow her hair and nothing helped..</li>
            <li>And being a female, i was starting to lose hair on both sides of my head like most males.</li>
            <li>I used this once almost two weeks ago, following the printed instructions exactly, and still suffer from scalp irritation.</li>
            <li>However, it takes consistent use and the 4 stars is due to the high cost of the product.  </li>
            <li>I tried discontinuing use of Keranique, only to find an increase in thinning at temples, where I had new growth while using it.  </li>
            <li>now I have been using this for a long time and I highly recommend for anyone with thinning hair.</li>

            <li> Been using this for 2wks with the stimulating shampoo and volume conditioner. My hair is starting to regrow back. And being a female, i was starting to lose hair on both sides of my head like most males. Take biotin , n take your vitamins. And you can fight this inside n out!</li>
            <li> Using product over 3 months now; noticed improvement with the amount of hair I was losing on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love, love, love this product.  Does exactly what it is suppose/advertising what it does.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I just started to us it.</li>
            <li> This product has done nothing for me, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have used the follicle boosting serum everyday for almost 2 months, I can see some new hair growth. That makes me feel excited, when my hair seems to be disappearing. I have purchased my 3rd bottle and will continue to use, forever.</li>
            <li> I used this once almost two weeks ago, following the printed instructions exactly, and still suffer from scalp irritation. The burn and itch was immediate. I thought perhaps it was supposed to feel that way, so I did not wash it out as quickly as I should have. I would have returned the product but did not try it until the return date had passed.</li>
            <li> It takes a while, but there is new growth and it&#x27;s my original color (not gray)</li>
            <li> good part of hair care regimen for those who are losing hair .don&#x27;t know if it boosts hair growth but it does help lessen hair loss.</li>
            <li> I  found  it  works  so  odered  and  received  fairly  quickly.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I did notice some hair growth with this product.  I went without using it for a few months and won&#x27;t do that again.  Not only does your hair grow some, but it feels thicker and more lush.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I loved it and received product before from the Keranique site and all was excellent!  Would indeed recommend to others!</li>
            <li> I tried discontinuing use of Keranique, only to find an increase in thinning at temples, where I had new growth while using it.  I try not to be without it.</li>
            <li> This serum seems to be helping me regrow hair in those areas above my temples that get thin with age and menopause.  However, it takes consistent use and the 4 stars is due to the high cost of the product.  Seems manufacturers like to charge a lot of money for any product that will actually help you feel good about dealing with aging issues.</li>
            <li> So far ir seems okay.  Like the fact that it&#x27;s not oily.  My main problem was with the small print of the directions.. I actually had to leave the bathroom and go find a magnifying glass.</li>
            <li> Using this serum is awkward and inconvenient. Also, I did not see any results and its expensive. I would not reorder.</li>
            <li> Would not ever order again. Bogus advertisement.</li>
            <li> I find that my hair is getting thicker and I am pleased and will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> this is a very good product… I own a small at home salon and bought this for one of my customers who had fine thin hair… she has tried other products to grow her hair and nothing helped.. Since using this product I have noticed new hair growing with in the first month.. I have also ordered a second on for another customer… I will be ordering it again for these ladies..</li>
            <li> Great grew my edges in 2 weeks love it</li>
            <li> Have been using for about two weeks....don&#x27;t see any change and/or improvement.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usuallu use anything on my hair.  Not sure I like how it feels.</li>
            <li> Works but not like one would hope.</li>
            <li> I would recommend I don&#x27;t have the hair breaking off I can see hairs coming thru the scalp now I have been using this for a long time and I highly recommend for anyone with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing happen, believe me. it&#x27;s 100% fraud</li>
