            <li>smells good too.  </li>
            <li>I will say the serum smells good and feels good when you put it on, but for me, it did not correct wrinkles or skin tone unevenness.</li>
            <li>It feels really good on my skin and softens my lines and makes my skin have a glow.</li>

            <li>Love all of Lancome products!  </li>
            <li>I love the scent too!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>But whether or not your own skin improves is also dependent on skin conditions that may be bacterial so this product doesnt fix that for you.</li>
            <li>This product is a nice moisture cream, but I have never seen any difference in my skins</li>
            <li>I had gotten a sample of this and tried it and decided to purchase the full size (great deal on Amazon).</li>
            <li>all in all it is the best I&#x27;ve found so far w no adverse issues</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 49 yrs old and have loved the sun for many years and this product makes my skin look and feel great.  </li>
            <li>Will reorder when gone for sure.</li>
            <li>I still have the enlarge pores but skins look softer and better.  </li>
            <li>i hope by the time passes by my skin would be better and better...</li>
            <li>I love that it is 30 or 50ml</li>
            <li>(I have more of an oily skin type).</li>
            <li>for sure it not a cream that would stop anyone from getting additional skin care if needed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I just bought more</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels and looks after I have used the product.</li>
            <li>It leaves her skin really smooth... Recomended!</li>
            <li>in fact I got more acne and worst!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is good, but, Results vs Cost....not worth it.</li>
            <li>but when I used the Visionnaire from Bon-Ton it was a more obviouse difference.  </li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t ask for more!!</li>
            <li>and I love it, however, I would strongly suggest buying it from a dept store that may have more accountability.</li>
            <li>The product also smells great and will make your skin baby soft-</li>
            <li>now i happen to like the scent, but it is a bit strong.</li>
            <li>it is perfect for anyone who wants that smooth soft face without the  slippy feel</li>
            <li>This is a silky smooth serum that helps to smooth out fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>HUGE MISTAKE.  </li>
            <li>now i&#x27;ve only been using it a week, and perhaps i just WANT to see changes, but it seems to be making my skin quite happy</li>
            <li>I guess for those that don&#x27;t like the fragrance they should make a fragrance free one .&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I use Visionaire primarily for this purpose, concentrating the product on acne scars and on acne.  </li>
            <li>it makes your skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>First time user of this, and I am amzed at the results!!</li>
            <li>and I am used to creme de la mer good stuff so far and TV network had on special for 124.00</li>
            <li>i am not yet bowled over, but i am not disappointed either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And as usual great price!</li>
            <li>, I wanted to make certain it really was a good product.  </li>
            <li>The very first night I tried it, I saw a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I am now able to just wear a light powder foundation since I don&#x27;t really require the full coverage of a liquid foundation and a powder.</li>
            <li>Need a special price.</li>
            <li>see it is a special treat on the days I use it.</li>
            <li>It really helps a woman in her 60&#x27;s skin look so much better.</li>
            <li>I will say that the real Visionnaire is a product that I love, it works well</li>
            <li>I have mature skin with some dryness and fine wrinkles, but otherwise healthy looking.</li>
            <li>first time i applied it, i found the consistency to be between serum and lotion, which suits me fine.</li>
            <li>It applies like a serum and absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I have been taking very good care of my skin for the past 5 yrs</li>
            <li>So would suggest you all to first try a sample of it which is available at no cost at any Macy&#x27;s store and then buy this product.</li>
            <li>i believed with time to adjust to the smell that it wouldn&#x27;t bother me as much, however there are times when it is most certainly overpowering.</li>
            <li>I thought it was worth every penny and some.  </li>
            <li>Plus irritated my Rosacea made my face red and feeling really warm.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of using this product, I can honestly say I look 10 years younger!!</li>
            <li>It is pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>it seemed to brighten my skin a bit right away (superficially), and i felt it hydrated without feeling sticky at all.</li>
            <li>this review started at four stars, but as of right now, i will have to change it to three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this review started at four stars, but as of right now, i will have to change it to three.  </li>
            <li>I notice improvement right away.  </li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>old face a more youthful appearance which is exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>However, just like when I purchased my Bare Minerals from a seller of Amazon and not direct the quality of the product doesn&#x27;t seem to be as great.  </li>
            <li>It is more red and irritated than ever before.    </li>
            <li>It seems this product delivers miracles the first week of use and tapers off into nothing thereafter.  </li>
            <li>or why it does this, but I am an avid beauty regimen user and have never seen this.    </li>
            <li>Their product works at first glance, but then does nothing after consistantly usage.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I first tried the product as a sample.  </li>
            <li>This product burns when I first put it on than goes away.</li>
            <li>but now I wish it was the first.  </li>
            <li>Makes my face feel silky soft &amp; smooth .</li>
            <li>Visionnaire really does work!  </li>
            <li>The only improvement would be a lower price, to make it more affordable.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a truly amazing thing and that Lancome should research this for other scar prevention</li>
            <li>I am 37, have pretty good skin with only a few fine lines around my eyes and some dryness.  </li>
            <li>This product in particular, for me, does not have a strong odor and makes me skin quite soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a long time Lancome fan, and this is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>The smell is musty and really quite gross-concerned as to what exactly I put on my face.  </li>
            <li>The lines around my eyes are more noticeable (probably due to the irritation) AND, while I did not have issues with my pores prior to using this product, they have become more noticeable after use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When i saw the product, i just noticed that it is very small, and since i have being using it i have noticed that my skin is soften than before, my spression lines are more soft, and my pores are kind of reduced....</li>
            <li>The packaging was standard (but that is easily done these days after re-opening).  </li>
            <li>The Lancome website has tons of rave reviews, so I went ahead and bought the large bottle ($105!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using it for over a month and have seen improvement in spots, fine lines and wrinkles but the biggest improvement has been in the reduction of pores which has definitely given my 54 yr.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i assume it will take two to four weeks to really decide how i feel about the effects, so i will update my review at that time with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.  </li>
            <li>This product never really made my skin feel significantly better.</li>
            <li>Buying it here is much cheaper than at Dillards</li>
            <li>I use this at night and the morning as my moisturizer- in the mornings I just follow with a light spray primer (Urban Decays B6 spray) before applying my powder.</li>
            <li>my skin doesn&#x27;t know how much I paid - so it is still aging skin...</li>
            <li>and I really notice my skin as softer and fresher.</li>
            <li>A bit high in price!</li>
            <li>Products are pricey but you do not have to use that much during each use.</li>
            <li>It has really helped.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that it is similar in consistency to Garnier skin brightening serum, however when I used the Garnier serum my skin looked markedly improved, and I received compliments on it by more than one person.</li>
            <li>However, after that first week I didn&#x27;t continue to notice new results.</li>
            <li>Applied to new acne, the blemishes heal to a light pink color that quickly disappears in days.  </li>
            <li>I use other Lancome products and I am satisfied with the products I use.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much difference if any on my pores, but I can live with that!</li>
            <li>I really did my research in advance because the cost was so high</li>
            <li>i tend to have oiler skin, so i am always apprehensive about trying new products, however this appears to have significant potential.</li>
            <li>and I feel like I have a whole new face.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this product from the ever so slight fragrance to the way it has benefited my face.</li>
            <li>After using this product consistently day and night, after the first initial use, I have seen nothing, and my skin has regressed.  </li>
            <li>It definitely has helped with hyperpigmentation from past acne breakouts, and really smooths the skin, leaving it luminous and bright.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Overall, given the very high price of Visionnaire, I really expected much more.</li>
            <li>- I usually broke out in blackheads and spots...not a good look when in mid 20s...</li>
            <li>It is never too early to think about slowing down the aging process, especially since this product provides so many additional benefits as well!</li>
            <li>I love this product it makes my face feel soft and tight</li>
            <li>I use just a tiny bit, and most of the time in the winter months - since we live at 10,000 ft and in winter it is very dry</li>
            <li>I purchased this directly from Macy&#x27;s the day it came out with high hopes as it had been advertised to work miracles.  </li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t help my very sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li>The cream is very soft.</li>
            <li>and i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Youth Code Texture Perfector from Loreal have nrealy the exact same ingredients.</li>
            <li>If you are uncertain definitely order the sample size first to try it.</li>
            <li>The youth code dark spot corrector is similar to lancome genifique, but it is different enough that it may not be as good.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is so clear and my wrinkle depth has probably been halved.</li>
            <li>it works for others!ring the price point) with the product so far.</li>
            <li>I bought the 30 ml size and it lasted nearly 5 months</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so soft.</li>
            <li>Also I am 27 years old</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 71 years old and this product made my skin smoother.  </li>
            <li>Applied on old scars, I see improvement after one night.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The women&#x27;s they use are young beauties</li>
            <li>I am 84 years old.</li>
            <li>This was $30 less than the &amp;#34;days special value&amp;#34; on one of the home shopping channels.  </li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to anyone who is starting to show signs of aging and want to start reversing the aging process!</li>
            <li>Now I have to work on getting my skin back to a some what normal state.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i would definitely suggest to anyone interested in purchasing this product to do so elsewhere until amazon starts carrying it at the actual retail price (which is far below the third party seller price at the time of this review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>purchased this product with doubt after trying it fixing to order my second bottle, it gose on the skin very light, my skin has improved the uneven skin coloring, the lines, I  am 53 and have been told look 10 years younger, will not be without this product except when waiting for delivery of next bottle.</li>
            <li>so I cannot relate to anyone with major skin damage.</li>
            <li>Moreover, I think that lancome products in general have improved my skin since I switched to their brand.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a serum, and even though I have oily sensitive skin, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with breakouts or extra oiliness.</li>
            <li>By all means try it for yourself, but my advise is to only buy direct.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, I did research other comparable items from these 2 brands, and people are pretty mistaken in thinking that they have all the same things.</li>
            <li>- So, as an update, my skin has still not improved, however, upon doing some research, I&#x27;ve learned that a lot of anti-aging skin care that changes the structure of the skin can initially cause skin to look worse before it gets better.  </li>
            <li>am sure it is not worth what I paid for it, so not sure I will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was just this product alone that caused it, but any benefits I saw in the first month rapidly disappeared until it just seemed like it was destroying my skin after a month.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i will continue to use this until the bottle is empty (partially because of the cost), and will update the review at that time, but as of right now, my opinion is such: while this may work for some out there, it has not worked at all for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It is a pricey product but absolutely worth it since you will be saving money on all the other products that you used to buy- such as foundation, skin clearing products, dark spot treatments, moisturizer, etc.</li>

            <li> It really helps a woman in her 60&#x27;s skin look so much better.</li>
            <li> I will say that the real Visionnaire is a product that I love, it works well</li>
            <li> I have mature skin with some dryness and fine wrinkles, but otherwise healthy looking.</li>
            <li> first time i applied it, i found the consistency to be between serum and lotion, which suits me fine.</li>
            <li> It applies like a serum and absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been taking very good care of my skin for the past 5 yrs</li>
            <li> So would suggest you all to first try a sample of it which is available at no cost at any Macy&#x27;s store and then buy this product.</li>
            <li> i believed with time to adjust to the smell that it wouldn&#x27;t bother me as much, however there are times when it is most certainly overpowering.</li>
            <li> I thought it was worth every penny and some.  </li>
            <li> Plus irritated my Rosacea made my face red and feeling really warm.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of using this product, I can honestly say I look 10 years younger!!</li>
            <li> It is pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> it seemed to brighten my skin a bit right away (superficially), and i felt it hydrated without feeling sticky at all.</li>
            <li> this review started at four stars, but as of right now, i will have to change it to three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this review started at four stars, but as of right now, i will have to change it to three.  </li>
            <li> I notice improvement right away.  </li>
            <li> , right?  </li>
            <li> old face a more youthful appearance which is exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> However, just like when I purchased my Bare Minerals from a seller of Amazon and not direct the quality of the product doesn&#x27;t seem to be as great.  </li>
            <li> It is more red and irritated than ever before.    </li>
            <li> It seems this product delivers miracles the first week of use and tapers off into nothing thereafter.  </li>
            <li> or why it does this, but I am an avid beauty regimen user and have never seen this.    </li>
            <li> Their product works at first glance, but then does nothing after consistantly usage.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I first tried the product as a sample.  </li>
            <li> This product burns when I first put it on than goes away.</li>
            <li> but now I wish it was the first.  </li>
            <li> Makes my face feel silky soft &amp; smooth .</li>
            <li> Visionnaire really does work!  </li>
            <li> The only improvement would be a lower price, to make it more affordable.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a truly amazing thing and that Lancome should research this for other scar prevention</li>
            <li> I am 37, have pretty good skin with only a few fine lines around my eyes and some dryness.  </li>
            <li> This product in particular, for me, does not have a strong odor and makes me skin quite soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time Lancome fan, and this is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> The smell is musty and really quite gross-concerned as to what exactly I put on my face.  </li>
            <li> The lines around my eyes are more noticeable (probably due to the irritation) AND, while I did not have issues with my pores prior to using this product, they have become more noticeable after use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When i saw the product, i just noticed that it is very small, and since i have being using it i have noticed that my skin is soften than before, my spression lines are more soft, and my pores are kind of reduced....</li>
            <li> The packaging was standard (but that is easily done these days after re-opening).  </li>
            <li> The Lancome website has tons of rave reviews, so I went ahead and bought the large bottle ($105!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over a month and have seen improvement in spots, fine lines and wrinkles but the biggest improvement has been in the reduction of pores which has definitely given my 54 yr.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i assume it will take two to four weeks to really decide how i feel about the effects, so i will update my review at that time with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.  </li>
            <li> This product never really made my skin feel significantly better.</li>
            <li> Buying it here is much cheaper than at Dillards</li>
            <li> I use this at night and the morning as my moisturizer- in the mornings I just follow with a light spray primer (Urban Decays B6 spray) before applying my powder.</li>
            <li> my skin doesn&#x27;t know how much I paid - so it is still aging skin...</li>
            <li> and I really notice my skin as softer and fresher.</li>
            <li> A bit high in price!</li>
            <li> Products are pricey but you do not have to use that much during each use.</li>
            <li> It has really helped.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that it is similar in consistency to Garnier skin brightening serum, however when I used the Garnier serum my skin looked markedly improved, and I received compliments on it by more than one person.</li>
            <li> However, after that first week I didn&#x27;t continue to notice new results.</li>
            <li> Applied to new acne, the blemishes heal to a light pink color that quickly disappears in days.  </li>
            <li> I use other Lancome products and I am satisfied with the products I use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much difference if any on my pores, but I can live with that!</li>
            <li> I really did my research in advance because the cost was so high</li>
            <li> i tend to have oiler skin, so i am always apprehensive about trying new products, however this appears to have significant potential.</li>
            <li> and I feel like I have a whole new face.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this product from the ever so slight fragrance to the way it has benefited my face.</li>
            <li> After using this product consistently day and night, after the first initial use, I have seen nothing, and my skin has regressed.  </li>
            <li> It definitely has helped with hyperpigmentation from past acne breakouts, and really smooths the skin, leaving it luminous and bright.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Overall, given the very high price of Visionnaire, I really expected much more.</li>
            <li> - I usually broke out in blackheads and spots...not a good look when in mid 20s...</li>
            <li> It is never too early to think about slowing down the aging process, especially since this product provides so many additional benefits as well!</li>
            <li> I love this product it makes my face feel soft and tight</li>
            <li> I use just a tiny bit, and most of the time in the winter months - since we live at 10,000 ft and in winter it is very dry</li>
            <li> I purchased this directly from Macy&#x27;s the day it came out with high hopes as it had been advertised to work miracles.  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t help my very sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> The cream is very soft.</li>
            <li> and i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Youth Code Texture Perfector from Loreal have nrealy the exact same ingredients.</li>
            <li> If you are uncertain definitely order the sample size first to try it.</li>
            <li> The youth code dark spot corrector is similar to lancome genifique, but it is different enough that it may not be as good.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is so clear and my wrinkle depth has probably been halved.</li>
            <li> it works for others!ring the price point) with the product so far.</li>
            <li> I bought the 30 ml size and it lasted nearly 5 months</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so soft.</li>
            <li> Also I am 27 years old</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 71 years old and this product made my skin smoother.  </li>
            <li> Applied on old scars, I see improvement after one night.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The women&#x27;s they use are young beauties</li>
            <li> I am 84 years old.</li>
            <li> This was $30 less than the &amp;#34;days special value&amp;#34; on one of the home shopping channels.  </li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this to anyone who is starting to show signs of aging and want to start reversing the aging process!</li>
            <li> Now I have to work on getting my skin back to a some what normal state.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i would definitely suggest to anyone interested in purchasing this product to do so elsewhere until amazon starts carrying it at the actual retail price (which is far below the third party seller price at the time of this review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> purchased this product with doubt after trying it fixing to order my second bottle, it gose on the skin very light, my skin has improved the uneven skin coloring, the lines, I  am 53 and have been told look 10 years younger, will not be without this product except when waiting for delivery of next bottle.</li>
            <li> so I cannot relate to anyone with major skin damage.</li>
            <li> Moreover, I think that lancome products in general have improved my skin since I switched to their brand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a serum, and even though I have oily sensitive skin, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with breakouts or extra oiliness.</li>
            <li> By all means try it for yourself, but my advise is to only buy direct.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, I did research other comparable items from these 2 brands, and people are pretty mistaken in thinking that they have all the same things.</li>
            <li> - So, as an update, my skin has still not improved, however, upon doing some research, I&#x27;ve learned that a lot of anti-aging skin care that changes the structure of the skin can initially cause skin to look worse before it gets better.  </li>
            <li> am sure it is not worth what I paid for it, so not sure I will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was just this product alone that caused it, but any benefits I saw in the first month rapidly disappeared until it just seemed like it was destroying my skin after a month.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i will continue to use this until the bottle is empty (partially because of the cost), and will update the review at that time, but as of right now, my opinion is such: while this may work for some out there, it has not worked at all for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i will continue to use this until the bottle is empty (partially because of the cost), and will update the review at that time, but as of right now, my opinion is such: while this may work for some out there, it has not worked at all for me.  </li>
            <li> It is a pricey product but absolutely worth it since you will be saving money on all the other products that you used to buy- such as foundation, skin clearing products, dark spot treatments, moisturizer, etc.</li>
            <li> OR at least right now (Feb 2012)</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t find the effects to be long lasting.</li>
            <li> Last month I meet up with some long not seen friends overseas.</li>
            <li> My skin is much clearer, my pores appear smaller, my dark spots have faded and my face gets a lot less shiny</li>
            <li> I have mixed skin - mostly very dry on my cheeks but oily on my nose and my chin..</li>
            <li> I keep waiting for this product to make a difference on my 52 year old skin… it might make a small difference in some way, I just simply can&#x27;t discern how or where.  </li>
            <li> Did not have any noticeable effect other than a regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I found no comparable moiturisers or other products that were the same.</li>
            <li> I am having a hard time believing that what was sent to me is authentic, unless it is extemely outdated.  </li>
            <li> I believe I use larger than average amounts(I do not nurse my product to save $).</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of ordering this to save $5 from the local dept store I typically purchase it from.  </li>
            <li> I have hyper-pigmentation that is very obvious above the lip, and a few dark spots from sun damage.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about noticeable differences, but it works well for my dry patches in place of a normal oily moisturizer which is not good on my oily patches.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not only not worth the money, it has caused my face to have pimples or bumps that I have never had !  </li>
            <li> but it made my skin patcy and dry ;so i will use it in other places not the face .</li>
            <li> I question my self, the person in charge of the propaganda Lamcome Visionnair .Thinksof</li>
            <li> Please be careful with this product.</li>
            <li> Some of the suggestions were to reduce the usage to every other day until your skin adjusts.  </li>
            <li> Actually the acne is worse now than it was in my teen years.</li>
            <li> only potentially negative thing i have to report is the scent.</li>
            <li> IT WAS SO NOT WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to expensive for my taste and at my age I really don&#x27;t want to deal with being a teenager again with acne.</li>
            <li> I recently had a nasty bout of acne and ordered nearly everything on the planet to get rid of the scars and prevent scars, and let me tell you nothing worked, and I discovered that there are many products out there that wil actually make your acne scars WORSE, like bensoyl peroxide (just dont do it!).  </li>
            <li> but I never see any change about my dark spot</li>
            <li> (for instance, i&#x27;ve noticed my pores are slightly</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t believe my pores have reduced in size as i had previously thought.</li>
            <li> I tried just one packet and caused my face to beak out all over lower half and chin.</li>
            <li> I had cyctic acne, peeling skin, bursting acne, just a mess.  </li>
            <li> In the beginning I used it every day for about 3 - 4 weeks and saw little to no difference....</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t WASTE my MONEY on this product at all.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I have tried everything out there including laser treatment for the uneven skin tone to no avail.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap, but</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks, definately noticed lighter freckles/skin spots on my face &amp; complexion appears smoother &amp; softer.</li>
            <li> i have had a couple of odd breakouts in the past week, and i believe it is from the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using any lancome skincare products that I can get my hands on for the past 2 years.</li>
            <li> You can pick the 30 ml size up at Macy&#x27;s for about 80 bucks which comes with a gift package, makeup, moisturizer, toner, another small bottle of the product.</li>
            <li> and it makes my pores so small.</li>
            <li> I read on a beauty blog that Visonaire prevents acne scars and didn&#x27;t believe it, so unfortunately it was the last product I tried,</li>
            <li> just waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> in all, i find myself a little disappointed (or a lot, considering the price point) with the product so far.</li>
            <li> Smell is hard on me after awhile.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a negative.  </li>
            <li> Really delicate and a pleasure to put on every morning and evening.</li>
            <li> at least good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin started looking dull and tired and eyes would burn for 10 mins after appying the cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and my skin looks worse.  </li>
            <li> i can see this being irritating for some folks, however it does not bother me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so maybe that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not seeing any dramatic results.</li>
            <li> This product is too expensive and it doesnt work.</li>
            <li> yet compact size - allowed on the aircraft and gives my skin the hydration it so badly needs without being oily...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear any base fondation anymore.</li>
            <li> I truly Don&#x27;t understand how this product could get a bad review!</li>
            <li> i will still finish this bottle, as it was so costly, but i am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> i will still finish this bottle, as it was so costly, but i am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After about 1.5 months of use, it caused all kinds of irritation, dryness, and acne, badly!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using any lancome skincare products that I can get my hands on for the past 2 years. I believe I use larger than average amounts(I do not nurse my product to save $). I do use Lancome products in combination or seperately. I have been taking very good care of my skin for the past 5 yrs so I cannot relate to anyone with major skin damage. This product in particular, for me, does not have a strong odor and makes me skin quite soft. I just started using it for 2 weeks and my forehead lines are finer. I do get ALOT of complements on my skin!! THANK YOU LANCOME!!!!</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product.  I really did my research in advance because the cost was so high, I wanted to make certain it really was a good product.  The Lancome website has tons of rave reviews, so I went ahead and bought the large bottle ($105!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and my skin looks worse.  I am 37, have pretty good skin with only a few fine lines around my eyes and some dryness.  This product made my skin red and irritated.  The lines around my eyes are more noticeable (probably due to the irritation) AND, while I did not have issues with my pores prior to using this product, they have become more noticeable after use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping that it may just be my skins initial reaction to the product (and since the cost was so prohibitive, I plan to give it another week or two before I give up.)  I will update this review if there are any changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 2 - So, as an update, my skin has still not improved, however, upon doing some research, I&#x27;ve learned that a lot of anti-aging skin care that changes the structure of the skin can initially cause skin to look worse before it gets better.  Some of the suggestions were to reduce the usage to every other day until your skin adjusts.  I&#x27;m going to try this for a week or so and see if there&#x27;s any improvement.  I will update again in a week or so.</li>
            <li> i had heard about this, then read about this, and i finally just relented and purchased it. i am not yet bowled over, but i am not disappointed either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so this product claims it works on three things i am personally concerned with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;pores&lt;br /&gt;evenness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the first time i applied it, i found the consistency to be between serum and lotion, which suits me fine. i tend to have oiler skin, so i am always apprehensive about trying new products, however this appears to have significant potential. it seemed to brighten my skin a bit right away (superficially), and i felt it hydrated without feeling sticky at all. now i&#x27;ve only been using it a week, and perhaps i just WANT to see changes, but it seems to be making my skin quite happy (for instance, i&#x27;ve noticed my pores are slightly smaller).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only potentially negative thing i have to report is the scent. now i happen to like the scent, but it is a bit strong. for instance, i applied it several hours ago, and i can still smell it on my face. i can see this being irritating for some folks, however it does not bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i assume it will take two to four weeks to really decide how i feel about the effects, so i will update my review at that time with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would definitely suggest to anyone interested in purchasing this product to do so elsewhere until amazon starts carrying it at the actual retail price (which is far below the third party seller price at the time of this review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** *** ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;two week update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it has now been two+ weeks that i have been using this religiously in the morning and at bedtime and i have yet to see results. i don&#x27;t believe my pores have reduced in size as i had previously thought. i believed with time to adjust to the smell that it wouldn&#x27;t bother me as much, however there are times when it is most certainly overpowering. i have had a couple of odd breakouts in the past week, and i believe it is from the product. in all, i find myself a little disappointed (or a lot, considering the price point) with the product so far. this review started at four stars, but as of right now, i will have to change it to three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will update this post again at the four week point. i hope this helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** *** ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;four week update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am still using this religiously in the morning and at bedtime, and have seen no changes (and believe me, i&#x27;m looking!). no change in evenness, pores, nothing. i have seen an increase in breakouts...so that&#x27;s a negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will continue to use this until the bottle is empty (partially because of the cost), and will update the review at that time, but as of right now, my opinion is such: while this may work for some out there, it has not worked at all for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** *** ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;six week update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no changes whatsoever. i will still finish this bottle, as it was so costly, but i am very disappointed. perhaps it will work for others out there, but for me i saw zero improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hopefully it works for others!ring the price point) with the product so far. this review started at four stars, but as of right now, i will have to change it to three.  i will update this post again at the four week point. i hope this helps!  *** *** ***  four week update:  i am still using this religiously in the morning and at bedtime, and have seen no changes (and believe me, i&#x27;m looking!). no change in evenness, pores, nothing. i have seen an increase in breakouts...so that&#x27;s a negative.  i will continue to use this until the bottle is empty (partially because of the cost), and will update the review at that time, but as of right now, my opinion is such: while this may work for some out there, it has not worked at all for me.  very disappointed.  *** *** ***  six week update:  no changes whatsoever. i will still finish this bottle, as it was so costly, but i am very disappointed. perhaps it will work for others out there, but for me i saw zero improvement.  hopefully it works for others!</li>
            <li> I purchased this directly from Macy&#x27;s the day it came out with high hopes as it had been advertised to work miracles.  The very first night I tried it, I saw a huge difference.  My skin had a glow effect.  I thought it was worth every penny and some.  After using this product consistently day and night, after the first initial use, I have seen nothing, and my skin has regressed.  It is more red and irritated than ever before.    It seems this product delivers miracles the first week of use and tapers off into nothing thereafter.  I do not know how or why it does this, but I am an avid beauty regimen user and have never seen this.    Hopefully Lancome will begin to disclose this info.  Their product works at first glance, but then does nothing after consistantly usage.</li>
            <li> Will reorder when gone for sure. It works....smells good too.  Wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.  Need a special price.</li>
            <li> This is a silky smooth serum that helps to smooth out fine lines and wrinkles. It works pretty well. I will keep using it!</li>
            <li> Used this product for over a year, was on auto-ship. Did not have any noticeable effect other than a regular moisturizer. For the cost, at the time it was $84.00, I wanted and waited for a miracle. Never happened.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 3 weeks with no noticeable results.  I will say the serum smells good and feels good when you put it on, but for me, it did not correct wrinkles or skin tone unevenness.</li>
            <li> This product feels Great going on! Its lightweight not oily and my skin feels like its glowing afterwards.  You can pick the 30 ml size up at Macy&#x27;s for about 80 bucks which comes with a gift package, makeup, moisturizer, toner, another small bottle of the product. OR at least right now (Feb 2012) you can pick up the 50 ml size for 105 with a great gift package. I bought the 30 ml size and it lasted nearly 5 months and yes, I was somewhat sparing on the application. I use it morning and night under moisturizer. No one product is going to fix everyone&#x27;s skin. The condition of your skin depends on age, health, genetics and how well you have cared for it over time. It also depends on whether you smoke or have smoked. Think of it like a reparative, its not going to fix every crack, but the overall improvement is noticeable. But whether or not your own skin improves is also dependent on skin conditions that may be bacterial so this product doesnt fix that for you. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Everything needs time to work, but I think I see a difference!!  This was $30 less than the &amp;#34;days special value&amp;#34; on one of the home shopping channels.  You can&#x27;t beat that with a wrinkle stick!</li>
            <li> Well I waited until I had used the entire bottle before reviewing this. I have mature skin with some dryness and fine wrinkles, but otherwise healthy looking. I had hoped for improvement in suppleness and evenness. This product never really made my skin feel significantly better. It applies like a serum and absorbs fairly quickly. There is an initial softness to the skin but I didn&#x27;t find the effects to be long lasting. I didn&#x27;t see an improvement in skin tone either. I also noticed that it is similar in consistency to Garnier skin brightening serum, however when I used the Garnier serum my skin looked markedly improved, and I received compliments on it by more than one person. But Garnier is wayyy cheaper, so I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll go back to it. Overall, given the very high price of Visionnaire, I really expected much more.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to share my experience. This product is too expensive and it doesnt work. I used it for 1 month but no results.  My skin started looking dull and tired and eyes would burn for 10 mins after appying the cream. The cream did reduce the size of pores on my face but that can be done by a cheaper alternative like a toner too. I have returned the product from where I bought it. So would suggest you all to first try a sample of it which is available at no cost at any Macy&#x27;s store and then buy this product.</li>
            <li> I first tried the product as a sample.  I notice improvement right away.  My skin looked brighter and younger.  I have used the product now for 2 weeks.  I don&#x27;t see my skin improving each time I use the product but my skin still looks brighter and younger.  I still have the enlarge pores but skins look softer and better.  I would recommed the product.  I use other Lancome products and I am satisfied with the products I use.</li>
            <li> When i saw the product, i just noticed that it is very small, and since i have being using it i have noticed that my skin is soften than before, my spression lines are more soft, and my pores are kind of reduced.... i just have two weeks using it since i bought it, so i hope by the time passes by my skin would be better and better...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i do recomend this product!!!</li>
            <li> It feels really good on my skin and softens my lines and makes my skin have a glow. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I feel it is really good. I don&#x27;t know about noticeable differences, but it works well for my dry patches in place of a normal oily moisturizer which is not good on my oily patches. It seems my skin tone does even out some. However I did some research and this and Youth Code Texture Perfector from Loreal have nrealy the exact same ingredients. So I will be buying that next. Keep in mind, I did research other comparable items from these 2 brands, and people are pretty mistaken in thinking that they have all the same things. The youth code dark spot corrector is similar to lancome genifique, but it is different enough that it may not be as good. I found no comparable moiturisers or other products that were the same.</li>
            <li> I have mixed skin - mostly very dry on my cheeks but oily on my nose and my chin..finding a face cream was a challenge - I usually broke out in blackheads and spots...not a good look when in mid 20s...I picked up Lancome Vissionnaire during an airport transit in Singapore last year - and have been using it ever since! I love that it is 30 or 50ml yet compact size - allowed on the aircraft and gives my skin the hydration it so badly needs without being oily...Last month I meet up with some long not seen friends overseas. They asked about my age which I did declare...both of them exclaimed \\&quot;B++H you look 10years younger\\&quot;...I guess this works for me...</li>
            <li> NOTHING HAPPENED AFTER I USED IT.&lt;br /&gt;PLS DONT BUY. ALL THE ADVERITISED EFFECT WERE UNSEEN.&lt;br /&gt;AND IT WAS SO NOT WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> I used this product in conjunction with the foam cleanser and once a week I still used my facial scrub. After two weeks my face was brighter and clearer...looked younger with smaller pores. Some people say they do not like the smell but I like the smell .it is very nice. I guess for those that don&#x27;t like the fragrance they should make a fragrance free one .&lt;br /&gt;But all in all it is the best I&#x27;ve found so far w no adverse issues</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my wife and she loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in a reasonable timeframe and was a few dollars cheaper than buying it at the local store.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It does everything it was designed to do and I purchased it at a great price!</li>
            <li> Buying it here is much cheaper than at Dillards and it makes my pores so small. My skin has never been so soft.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem like the same product I had received from the lancome counter. This one has a different consistency than the one. From lancome.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a sample of this and tried it and decided to purchase the full size (great deal on Amazon). I have used this product for about 3 weeks now and I feel like I have a whole new face. My skin is much clearer, my pores appear smaller, my dark spots have faded and my face gets a lot less shiny (I have more of an oily skin type). I am now able to just wear a light powder foundation since I don&#x27;t really require the full coverage of a liquid foundation and a powder. I use this at night and the morning as my moisturizer- in the mornings I just follow with a light spray primer (Urban Decays B6 spray) before applying my powder. It is a pricey product but absolutely worth it since you will be saving money on all the other products that you used to buy- such as foundation, skin clearing products, dark spot treatments, moisturizer, etc. If you are uncertain definitely order the sample size first to try it. The product also smells great and will make your skin baby soft- I am constantly getting compliments on my skin now and it has even been referred to as porcelain doll skin. Also I am 27 years old so it works for someone in their 20&#x27;s as well. It is never too early to think about slowing down the aging process, especially since this product provides so many additional benefits as well!</li>
            <li> I got 3 sample packets of this when I got something else. I tried just one packet and caused my face to beak out all over lower half and chin. Smell is hard on me after awhile. This didn&#x27;t help my very sensitive skin at all. I wouldn&#x27;t WASTE my MONEY on this product at all. Now I have to work on getting my skin back to a some what normal state. This product burns when I first put it on than goes away. It&#x27;s to expensive for my taste and at my age I really don&#x27;t want to deal with being a teenager again with acne. Actually the acne is worse now than it was in my teen years. Where I had only monthly break outs back than.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This caused me to get the red cystic like acne. Plus irritated my Rosacea made my face red and feeling really warm. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product is a nice moisture cream, but I have never seen any difference in my skins&lt;br /&gt;appearence.  I don&#x27;t think it corrects anything.  I use just a tiny bit, and most of the time in the winter months - since we live at 10,000 ft and in winter it is very dry here.&lt;br /&gt;I am sure it is not worth what I paid for it, so not sure I will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;I for sure it not a cream that would stop anyone from getting additional skin care if needed.&lt;br /&gt;I see it is a special treat on the days I use it. In the beginning I used it every day for about 3 - 4 weeks and saw little to no difference....so now I use it just here and there.&lt;br /&gt;I think I knew when I bought it that it was not a miracle cream, but just wanted to try.&lt;br /&gt;I like it, but my skin doesn&#x27;t know how much I paid - so it is still aging skin...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 71 years old and this product made my skin smoother.  I don&#x27;t wear any base fondation anymore. I would recomend this product to any woman.</li>
            <li> purchased this product with doubt after trying it fixing to order my second bottle, it gose on the skin very light, my skin has improved the uneven skin coloring, the lines, I  am 53 and have been told look 10 years younger, will not be without this product except when waiting for delivery of next bottle.</li>
            <li> I truly Don&#x27;t understand how this product could get a bad review! I also purchased as soon as it hit the shelves. I have hyper-pigmentation that is very obvious above the lip, and a few dark spots from sun damage. I also smoked for 20 years and have medium depth wrinkles on the sides of my mouth.. I have larger pores that just come with age..Anyway, I have tried everything out there including laser treatment for the uneven skin tone to no avail. After 2 weeks of using this product, I can honestly say I look 10 years younger!! My skin tone is so clear and my wrinkle depth has probably been halved. I haven&#x27;t seen much difference if any on my pores, but I can live with that! My Lancome rep has asked me to provide before and after photos to show customers. I really couldn&#x27;t ask for more!! It&#x27;s not a miracle treatment, or a cosmetic procedure, but it is the closest thing you are going to get under $100.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost EVERYTHING that promises to improve your skin, and this is one product that actually works and it has an added benefit that I have NEVER seen any product out there actually do:  prevent acne scars.  I recently had a nasty bout of acne and ordered nearly everything on the planet to get rid of the scars and prevent scars, and let me tell you nothing worked, and I discovered that there are many products out there that wil actually make your acne scars WORSE, like bensoyl peroxide (just dont do it!).  I read on a beauty blog that Visonaire prevents acne scars and didn&#x27;t believe it, so unfortunately it was the last product I tried, but now I wish it was the first.  Applied on old scars, I see improvement after one night.  Applied to new acne, the blemishes heal to a light pink color that quickly disappears in days.  I use Visionaire primarily for this purpose, concentrating the product on acne scars and on acne.  I think it&#x27;s a truly amazing thing and that Lancome should research this for other scar prevention application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;After about 1.5 months of use, it caused all kinds of irritation, dryness, and acne, badly!!!! I had cyctic acne, peeling skin, bursting acne, just a mess.  I don&#x27;t know if it was just this product alone that caused it, but any benefits I saw in the first month rapidly disappeared until it just seemed like it was destroying my skin after a month.  When I took it out of my regimen my skin started to improve again.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel silky soft &amp; smooth . This product will definitely be a part of my daily skin regime. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love all of Lancome products!  This one especially.  It really helps a woman in her 60&#x27;s skin look so much better.</li>
            <li> I question my self, the person in charge of the propaganda Lamcome Visionnair .Thinksof us as dummies if you all notice&lt;br /&gt;The women&#x27;s they use are young beauties&lt;br /&gt;That have no wrinkles, l leave every thing else to your imagination Iwill use to see if is going to work</li>
            <li> This product appears to be everything they claim it is.  I&#x27;ve only had it for 4 days.  The cream is very soft.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this product from the ever so slight fragrance to the way it has benefited my face. I have been using it for over a month and have seen improvement in spots, fine lines and wrinkles but the biggest improvement has been in the reduction of pores which has definitely given my 54 yr. old face a more youthful appearance which is exactly what I was hoping for. Highly recommend this to anyone who is starting to show signs of aging and want to start reversing the aging process!</li>
            <li> First time user of this, and I am amzed at the results!! Perfect with my Genefique purchase. And as usual great price!</li>
            <li> this is amazing !!!! it makes your skin so smooth. I just bought more it is perfect for anyone who wants that smooth soft face without the  slippy feel</li>
            <li> Please be careful with this product. I had an allergic reaction and I never had anything like that with any skincare products. My skin was red and itchy for a day. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month now and I really notice my skin as softer and fresher. I use it in the evening and morning after timing and them follow up with another moisturizer. It is pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels and looks after I have used the product. And will buy this again</li>
            <li> I love this product it makes my face feel soft and tight and i have very sensitive skin and this is awesome</li>
            <li> Seems that this is working and I am used to creme de la mer good stuff so far and TV network had on special for 124.00 I got a deal</li>
            <li> Helping my aging skin look younger and healthier.  A bit high in price! I would probably order again. Would recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> After a short period of time using this product there is a noticable softening of wrinkels and skin has a healthier look.</li>
            <li> This was for my mom... It&#x27;s not cheap, but since she loves it... She uses it almost every day. It leaves her skin really smooth... Recomended!</li>
            <li> Visionnaire really does work!  I am in my 60&#x27;s and find that this product truly does correct and beautify the skin tone.  I receive compliments all the time on the youthful appearance of my skin.  Moreover, I think that lancome products in general have improved my skin since I switched to their brand.  Products are pricey but you do not have to use that much during each use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time Lancome fan, and this is one of my favorite products. It&#x27;s a serum, and even though I have oily sensitive skin, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with breakouts or extra oiliness. It definitely has helped with hyperpigmentation from past acne breakouts, and really smooths the skin, leaving it luminous and bright. I love the scent too! Really delicate and a pleasure to put on every morning and evening. I always layer it under a moisturizer with sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of ordering this to save $5 from the local dept store I typically purchase it from.  HUGE MISTAKE.  The smell is musty and really quite gross-concerned as to what exactly I put on my face.  I am having a hard time believing that what was sent to me is authentic, unless it is extemely outdated.  The packaging was standard (but that is easily done these days after re-opening).  I will say that the real Visionnaire is a product that I love, it works well and I love it, however, I would strongly suggest buying it from a dept store that may have more accountability.</li>
            <li> I read all the review about this product so I gave it a try, I finished the bottle but I never see any change about my dark spot in fact I got more acne and worst!&lt;br /&gt;I guess this product is not for me, just waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for over 3 months.  Within a few weeks, definately noticed lighter freckles/skin spots on my face &amp; complexion appears smoother &amp; softer.</li>
            <li> I keep waiting for this product to make a difference on my 52 year old skin… it might make a small difference in some way, I just simply can&#x27;t discern how or where.  It&#x27;s Lancome, so it has to, right?  At the Lancome counter, the woman said you must pair with Genifique, which I have not, so maybe that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not seeing any dramatic results.</li>
            <li> Noticed results within a week.  However, after that first week I didn&#x27;t continue to notice new results. It is good, but, Results vs Cost....not worth it.</li>
            <li> For some reason when i got a sample it was good ;and then i bought the bottle and it seemed to work not as well &#x27;i don&#x27;t no why but it made my skin patcy and dry ;so i will use it in other places not the face .</li>
            <li> I love this product!  However, just like when I purchased my Bare Minerals from a seller of Amazon and not direct the quality of the product doesn&#x27;t seem to be as great.  I wouldn&#x27;t say I don&#x27;t see results bc I do but when I used the Visionnaire from Bon-Ton it was a more obviouse difference.  Could all be in my head.  By all means try it for yourself, but my advise is to only buy direct.</li>
            <li> I have been trying numerous products similar to this, and I thought because it was \\&quot;Lancome\\&quot; it would be at least good.&lt;br /&gt;It is not only not worth the money, it has caused my face to have pimples or bumps that I have never had !  Do NOT waste&lt;br /&gt;your money !!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products out there. I&#x27;m 49 yrs old and have loved the sun for many years and this product makes my skin look and feel great.  This is my second bottle and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I  see the improvements in my skin,almost immediately. The only improvement would be a lower price, to make it more affordable.</li>
            <li> It has really helped.  I am 84 years old. I have used Lancôme products for 40 years and I have great skin.  People think I am in my 60&#x27;s.</li>
    </ol>
