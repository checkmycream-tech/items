            <li>I find this perfume too strong.</li>

            <li>Too sweet and strong and scandalous</li>

I did not received the product at all and I tried to contact them several times and I had any response. This was supposed to be a Christmas gift so I had to bought it at a local store. Finally I contacted Amazon and they proceed to reimburse my psid order. Amazon have to consider to unsubscribe this provider from their associated sellers list.</li>

            <li> I get this for my daughter every christmas birthday and when she runs out because she cannot live without this stuff. It has become a staple in our house. When I smell it I know she is close by.</li>

            <li> Bought it for the wife who really likes this scent. Price was good. Ordering was simple and delivery was swift and secure.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the fact i love the Armani Code for Men, I had not smelled it for women but it was terrible! Really! Too sweet and strong and scandalous and it made me feel hot, terrible indeed. But the delivery and purchase was ok, fast, all good. Just the perfum i didnt like. I gave it as present to somebody else coz you know...its Armani after all but it was lousy!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the fragrance but it is a evening pufume.  Was very quick to arrive.</li>
            <li> My lady loves this, smells great</li>
            <li> So happy I found this, smells amazing and at a fraction of what I would have paid at sephora or another company</li>
            <li> I find this perfume too strong. I had purchased the lighter version before and am not regretting buying this. It&#x27;s too strong even with one single spray.</li>
            <li> This cologne is awesome. It works with my chemistry and smells different when I wear it than it does on others. Slight floral but overall wonderful and soft.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love the fragrance of this perfume.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume because I smelt it on someone else which smelt so good.  I asked her what it was and I was able to get it from here.  It smells really good.  I don&#x27;t like perfumes that are to strong, this one isn&#x27;t...</li>
            <li> Love this scent. Love ordering from Amazon. I don&#x27;t have to fight for a parking spot or walk through a mall to the fragrance counter and wait my turn. Easy shopping and a great product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.  When ever someone gives me a hug or kiss... They always say &amp;#34;you smell so good&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;❤️</li>
