            <li>I have had the charger for one week, and have been using my Philips sonicate flex care for more than a year, and before that the earlier Philips sonicate toothbrushes for more than 10 years.  </li>
            <li>but luckily I found the charger on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Great addition to the toothbrush, especially if you travel much.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly as advertised and works as it should.</li>
            <li>I have the Sonicare toothbrush with the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; settings and wasn&#x27;t positive that this would fit it, but bought it anyway.</li>
            <li>I looked and found this and its exactly what I needed and even came with a longer cord than the factory model!</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>Always nice to have two charges for two people to use in different bathrooms and also for going on trips.</li>
            <li>Works just fine with my new Healthy White Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It came very fast and was very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad it was offered individually.  </li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare and take it with me as often as possible.</li>

            <li>I needed an additional charger for travel and purchased this as an extra and I am pleased.</li>
            <li>It is exactly like the charger that came with the Philips Sonicare Airfloss.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly and was not as expensive as as the manufacturers site.</li>
            <li>integrated mains cable might ideally be a little longer (it&#x27;s about 100cm) for the charging environment in our bathrooms, but for many users it will be fine.</li>
            <li>I left my original charger at our summer place and needed a replacement quickly.</li>
            <li>Having an extra charger is good not only for home</li>
            <li>Fits easily into my luggage where it stays until the next trip.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather use it than the large one that came with it.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say about this product.</li>
            <li>much rather prefer my soniccare over a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>the charger is  smaller than the original and fits well into my travel case.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased a dual flosser which only came with one charger.</li>
            <li>It looks to be the same as the original charger in dimensions, chord length, material, etc.  </li>
            <li>Small and handy.  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d have to buy a whole new toothbrush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the identical &amp; was reasonably priced, def cheaper than a new one.</li>
            <li>As a traveler it is very convenient  that one unit stays home and the new one travels with me.</li>
            <li>Wish it would also charge my older Sonicare toothbrush&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have one of the sonicare bases that has a hole in the bottom (as opposed to the older style that fits into the &amp;#34;cup&amp;#34; type charger), then this will probably work for you.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend as an replacement.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it if you have a sonicare.</li>
            <li>it works, but the price a litter high</li>
            <li>It stayed charged for 18 days on the road and may have even a few more days as it was still working when i got home to the charger.</li>

            <li>Left my charger in a hotel room and dreaded having to buy a whole new system.</li>
            <li>Negative is that it has no pegs to hold the tooth brushes like the original one did, but I can live with that given I did not have to pay to replace my whole sonic device.</li>
            <li>No idea what happened to my old charger but this one works like a charm, no issues what so ever</li>
            <li>This model was the perfect replacement for a lost base.  </li>
            <li>It requires only a small space which I love.  </li>
            <li>had to go back to a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>try to eliminate as much as we can to make getting around as  simple as possible.</li>
            <li>was delighted to find a replacement base on Amazon at a reasonable price.</li>

            <li> I recently lost my Sonicare charger when family was leaving after the christmas holidays, and after a few weeks of hunting I gave up and ordered this.  </li>

            <li> The footprint of the base is smaller than that of the original charger supplied by Philips with the Sonicare brush, which means it&#x27;s a slightly less stable platform; on the other hand, you save some worktop space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure how long it takes to charge,</li>

            <li> I lost my previous charger at a hotel.  </li>

            <li> It takes up very little space, but charges well.</li>
            <li> I just put it in my small bag that holds my toothbrush stuff.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have had the charger for one week, and have been using my Philips sonicate flex care for more than a year, and before that the earlier Philips sonicate toothbrushes for more than 10 years.  In the earlier years, there was no dual voltage charger so I could not take the charger with me on travels, so my sonicare toothbrush would run out of power.  Now I can take the charger with me and be assured of a charged toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Works just fine with my new Healthy White Sonicare toothbrush.  I&#x27;m so glad it was offered individually.  I&#x27;d rather use it than the large one that came with it.</li>
            <li> Sonicare pakcages two devices with one charger...I nneded another charger for my travel kit.....JUST WHAT I NEEDED..and  the price was RIGHT&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the extra prong to help stabilize the brush, but I expected this from other reviews.  Still works like a charm.  Just sit on flat surface and no issues with charging your brush.  Great for a back up and for travel.  Great service from vendor - quick shipment.  Arrived in 2 days.</li>
            <li> Bought this charger as a replacement for one that was literally lost at Sea.  Works great, being it is OEM.  Can&#x27;t say enough about it. Would highly recommend as an replacement.</li>
            <li> Needed a second travel charger and this being its identical twin, works like a champ. Would recommend to anyone who needs an extra or lost the one that comes with the Philips toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The product was what I needed. It came very fast and was very reasonably priced.I would buy this product from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size charger for home or travel. A little pricey but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I need the sonicare toothbrush and got one from my periodontist as part of the huge fees she charges!  Somehow, when my husband was &amp;#34;cleaning up&amp;#34; he &amp;#34;disappeared&amp;#34; my charger in spite of the fact I have told him many times to leave my stuff alone!  I was happy to be able to find another one without having to buy the entire package, toothbrush and all.  Works fine and was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> This travel charger is the perfect size to travel with but it&#x27;s also just fine for home use.  I love my Sonicare and take it with me as often as possible.</li>
            <li> I lost my charger for my sonic care, the price was good, even though it shipped form china, I got it fast and in good working order, nothing to complain about here.</li>
            <li> I wanted a 2nd charger to take on trips rather then search for a travel tooth brush. the charger is  smaller than the original and fits well into my travel case. It charges the my electric toothbrush just fine.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to report about this device, save that it functions as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The integrated mains cable might ideally be a little longer (it&#x27;s about 100cm) for the charging environment in our bathrooms, but for many users it will be fine. The footprint of the base is smaller than that of the original charger supplied by Philips with the Sonicare brush, which means it&#x27;s a slightly less stable platform; on the other hand, you save some worktop space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, &#x60;it does what it says on the tin&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This charger works great.  I&#x27;ve used it extensively for multiple trips and I&#x27;ve yet to have any issues with it. I&#x27;ve had it for over a year and a half.  It charges my sonicare very quickly and is also easy to pack.  Highly recommend it if you have a sonicare. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Great Replacement for the original. I purchased the replacement charger for my Sonicare toothbrush and it was an exact replacement.</li>
            <li> Thus far it works great.  I haven&#x27;t tried using it in Thailand yet.  The one that came in my original packaging didn&#x27;t work.  So hopefully this one will :)</li>
            <li> missed having this for a few months.  had to go back to a normal toothbrush.  just not as nice and clean as with the philips!</li>
            <li> I lost my charger in a move so I ordered this as a replacement.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Great for travel, convenient, doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room in your bag.  Makes a good home tooth brush a travel companion</li>
            <li> This is a perfect extra charger. It takes up very little space, but charges well. Good purchase if you need an extra charger. I recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li> I left my original charger at our summer place and needed a replacement quickly. Amazon delivered in 2 days and it works! It recharged the unit in about 2 hours.</li>
            <li> Description was accurate.  This model was the perfect replacement for a lost base.  Grateful I didn&#x27;t have to purchase a complete new toothbrush set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,  Christine Davis</li>
            <li> I needed an additional charger for travel and purchased this as an extra and I am pleased. I originally purchased a dual flosser which only came with one charger.</li>
            <li> The only criticism I have is that I thought it was much smaller.  It&#x27;s almost the same size as the one that came with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have the Sonicare toothbrush with the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; settings and wasn&#x27;t positive that this would fit it, but bought it anyway. To my relief, it fit perfectly! It works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up, use, and travels well. Who wouldn&#x27;t love it. I just put it in my small bag that holds my toothbrush stuff.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about this product. It charges my toothbrush. Not sure how long it takes to charge, but I let it go overnight and it&#x27;s full in the morning. My one complaint is that I had to pay around twenty-five bucks for it. I&#x27;m pretty sure they could knock a good $10 off that. All in all, since it&#x27;s my only choice, it does the job!</li>
            <li> Product was what was in picture that i wanted to purchase.  The price was market rate. I wish sonicare carried spare toothbrush chargers on the market like they do cell phone chargers. I couldn&#x27;t locate one locally in a brick and mortar. I&#x27;ve had two go out on me in 3 yrs!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this chrager for my bf cuz he lost his original charger. It works perfectly with his toothbrush!!! He loves it!</li>
            <li> I recently lost my Sonicare charger when family was leaving after the christmas holidays, and after a few weeks of hunting I gave up and ordered this.  I have the healthy white model, and this charges perfectly.  It looks to be the same as the original charger in dimensions, chord length, material, etc.  I&#x27;ve charged my toothbrush a couple times with this, and I&#x27;ve had a friend use it as well, and it works perfectly.  Shipping was prompt as well.</li>
            <li> I was traveling and my toothbrush died - ordered this delivered to the hotel, and it worked out great - now I have an extra that stays in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> We bought one Philips Sonicare travel charger from this seller because we can&#x27;t find ours. The seller&#x27;s description said it&#x27;s \\&quot;Brande New\\&quot;, but the arrived item looks 100% used. There are obvious water stains on the charger, and blue/green-ish stain on the wire (toothpaste?!?!). It feels so disgusting imagining the toothbrush charger has been used by others.</li>
            <li> When my Flexcare charger died I called the company and was told they don&#x27;t sell chargers alone.  I thought I&#x27;d have to buy a whole new toothbrush but luckily I found the charger on Amazon.  It&#x27;s the identical &amp; was reasonably priced, def cheaper than a new one.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son when the original base was dropped, breaking off the charging tip. This base is exactly the same and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Functions  Beautifully</li>
            <li> I had purchased a two pack of sonicare toothbrushes at Sams Club but they only came with the one charger.  Since my kids use different bathrooms, a second charger was needed.</li>
            <li> We have two Philips Sonicare Airflossers. Having an extra charger is good not only for home but when we travel.</li>
            <li> Works great. Bought it used, came with a little wear.  No complaints about the charger. Worked for my outlet and charges fine</li>
            <li> I was not aware that additional charging bases could be purchased.  I see that Phillips includes two charging bases with some dual power handle sets.  As a traveler it is very convenient  that one unit stays home and the new one travels with me.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite way to clean between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;it is very efficient.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean and to recharge.</li>
            <li> Great addition to the toothbrush, especially if you travel much.</li>
            <li> Outstanding value on this toothbrush. It stayed charged for 18 days on the road and may have even a few more days as it was still working when i got home to the charger. There also was a definite whitening of my teeth after a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> When I moved apartments, I didn&#x27;t realize my toothbrush charger had gone missing until my toothbrush had completely run out of power. Luckily I was able to find the right Philips charger and have it shipped to me quickly!</li>
            <li> I was stupid and left my charger in a hotel room.  Ordered this and haven&#x27;t missed a brushing session yet.</li>
            <li> Upon arrival home in the USA, I discovered I had left the charger base to my Sonicare toothbrush in a hotel in Switzerland.&lt;br /&gt;I was delighted to find a replacement base on Amazon at a reasonable price. It arrived quickly as advertised and works as it should.</li>
            <li> Definitely did meet my expectations. It will be great for traveling, and don&#x27;t have to worry about cords, etc. to take up more room.</li>
            <li> I left my sonicare tootbrush charger in Nashville, TN and when I got back to MI I needed to find one. I looked and found this and its exactly what I needed and even came with a longer cord than the factory model! Good buy</li>
            <li> I have two Philips Sonicare Airfloss and needed another charger. The package that I bought only had one charger with it. It is exactly like the charger that came with the Philips Sonicare Airfloss.</li>
            <li> Small and handy.  Fits easily into my luggage where it stays until the next trip.Glad I got it when I did.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as featured and works great.  It requires only a small space which I love.  Sonic makes great products.</li>
            <li> Works great. It replaced another one that died on me.</li>
            <li> Looks good &amp; well made. Does its job. Wish it would also charge my older Sonicare toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed; it is small, very light, dual voltage, great for travel. I am so glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Love the compact size. As an international traveler, the size makes it perfect for those multi-week trips abroad. It will be coming with me on all trips in the future.</li>
            <li> Easy and compact way to charge the Sonic Care Water Pic. Just plug inb and set the Pic onto this base and in only moments the Pic is charged.</li>
            <li> Works awesome. Just as good as the factory charger. I haven&#x27;t had a single issue with it. Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> works great, same as the original one. glad i got it as a travel charger. not much more to say</li>
            <li> worked pefectly. lost my original and this inexpensive replacement was worth every penny. much rather prefer my soniccare over a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Philips packages a two pack of their airflossers (bought from Amazon), the blister pack has indents for TWO chargers, but guess what - there&#x27;s only one! So you end up buying an extra to make up for Philip&#x27;s (and reseller&#x27;s) cheating packaging and marketing. Shame on you Philips.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and Amazon Customer Service? Go ahead, try clicking through and getting anywhere.</li>
            <li> it works, but the price a litter high</li>
            <li> No idea what happened to my old charger but this one works like a charm, no issues what so ever</li>
            <li> just like the one that comes with the toothbrushes, i just needed a second one..  works well just as expected</li>
            <li> Received the item very quickly.  Needed a second charger for the other item I purchased. Always nice to have two charges for two people to use in different bathrooms and also for going on trips.</li>
            <li> I got this because I lost my original charger for my sonicare.  I am happy to say that this one is a fantastic replacement and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li> I lost my previous charger at a hotel.  It was great to be able to replace it without buying a new brush also.</li>
            <li> My wife and I use electric toothbrushes and when we travel we used to bring the stand that comes with the toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;We try to eliminate as much as we can to make getting around as  simple as possible.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for my old charger that stopped working. There&#x27;s not much more to say other than that since it&#x27;s exactly the same as the charger you&#x27;re probably looking to replace. If you have one of the sonicare bases that has a hole in the bottom (as opposed to the older style that fits into the &amp;#34;cup&amp;#34; type charger), then this will probably work for you.</li>
            <li> The charger is identical to the one you receive when you purchase the dual tooth brush from Costco. It works perfectly and was not as expensive as as the manufacturers site. thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> Left my charger in a hotel room and dreaded having to buy a whole new system. Found this inexpensive charger on Amazon and it works great. Negative is that it has no pegs to hold the tooth brushes like the original one did, but I can live with that given I did not have to pay to replace my whole sonic device.</li>
            <li> This charger came within 48hrs of ordering the product. Its not the original charger that came with the product so I was slightly hesitant if it would work. But it works great with no issues!</li>
