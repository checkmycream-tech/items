            <li>it is a winner in my book:)</li>

            <li>Friends love the product line, and  I am going to try another product in this same line to see if I find one better suited for me.</li>

            <li>Great product left my hair soft and shiny with no build up yet.</li>
            <li>It drys pretty quick.</li>
            <li>I have used this as a styling aid for years and is the only hair product of any kind I have used consistently.</li>

            <li>I love this product and hope I can find it in my local beauty supply store</li>
            <li>I love this setting lotion it holds my curls and crinkles for a very long time.....</li>
            <li>This is the only product I need to braid my hair at night which makes it easy.</li>
            <li>I did not care for this product as it was very drying on my hair.  </li>
            <li>It dries much faster than hair gels with no build up.  </li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, I used the whole bottle in one sitting because of the lack of foam for coverage.</li>
            <li>It has worked very well on my sisterlocks.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend it for two strand twists.</li>
            <li>I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair now and it makes her curls really come through, soft and shiny..</li>
            <li>Leaves no build up in my natural nappy locs and gives very defined curls.</li>
            <li>The bottle is too small and I get more for my money buying setting lotion from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it smells not to hard on the hair.</li>
            <li>I have been natural for twelve years and thought this product would work as it claims to be \\&quot;natrual.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>It also can be used on dry loc&#x27;s or for a curl emergency on a loc that didn&#x27;t quite curl or crimp with the rest because it dries fast!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It also can be used on dry loc&#x27;s or for a curl emergency on a loc that didn&#x27;t quite curl or crimp with the rest because it dries fast!</li>
            <li> The first day after using it, my hair feels a little dry</li>
            <li> This product, leaked in teh packaging, but it did provide long lasting hold and didn&#x27;t cause any flaking or stiffness of my sisterlocs.  </li>
            <li> The hold is not as hard as if using a gel, however I prefer my hair to be light and soft with a slightly undefined twist, unlike the hard definition you can get with some gels.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this and the other products to others.</li>
            <li> For my LOC&#x27;S (dreads) I used it while my hair was wet to set curls, and it left me with a tight curl that lasted all day</li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pretty expensive</li>
            <li> I also appreciate the fact there is no glycerin (a humectant), mineral oil (which is in some of her other products), or petroleum.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it as it was drying, flaked and left my hair hard.  </li>
            <li> I use it with my loc loops and my curls last for at least 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair firm but shiny.</li>
            <li> So, if you are looking for a styling aid to give you a firm hold on style for free-flowing hair, this may NOT be the one.</li>
            <li> (I usually just let my locks air</li>
            <li> I have tried several of her other products and was greatly disappointed.</li>
            <li> It holds my braid outs for a least a week - probably</li>
            <li> My 4C hair is thick, and has lots of shrinkage.</li>
            <li> Not good on course hair</li>
            <li> The humidity is horrible now and this helps so I do not get as much shrinkage.</li>

            <li> I love this product so much! I received so many complements on my curled locs! They set quickly too! Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;I tried this some time back from a friend and liked it. I have to try to get the larger bottle, it&#x27;s pretty expensive</li>
            <li> I did not care for this product as it was very drying on my hair.  I have been natural for twelve years and thought this product would work as it claims to be \\&quot;natrual.\\&quot;  I would not recommend it as it was drying, flaked and left my hair hard.

This is the only product I need to braid my hair at night which makes it easy. I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair now and it makes her curls really come through, soft and shiny.. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while now as well as the shampoo and conditioner.  It dries much faster than hair gels with no build up.  I highly recommend it for two strand twists.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time to day and I love the way it smells not to hard on the hair.</li>
            <li> Love this. Great for flat twists. Leaves hair firm but shiny. Amazing product.</li>
            <li> .  Great product left my hair soft and shiny with no build up yet. I have used about 4x since buying. The only con is i wish it was humidity proof.</li>
            <li> I use this to flat twist my hair and it works great. The humidity is horrible now and this helps so I do not get as much shrinkage.</li>
            <li> This product is just okay. The bottle is too small and I get more for my money buying setting lotion from Sally&#x27;s. It&#x27;s a lot more and cost less.</li>
            <li> I love this styling lotion.  I use it with my loc loops and my curls last for at least 2-3 weeks. My sister has traditional locks and she uses this lotion also. I would definitely recommend this and the other products to others.</li>
            <li> This product, leaked in teh packaging, but it did provide long lasting hold and didn&#x27;t cause any flaking or stiffness of my sisterlocs.  I would recommedn it.  I would just suggest better packaging.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my Sisterlocks! It provides great curl and leaves ZERO residue in my locs. I would have given the product 5 stars if it came in a bigger bottle! I can&#x27;t get enough. Very good product, very happy with my purchase, very satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> I was expecting more foam from the styling lotion and I found myself using more just to cover my locs.  As a matter of fact, I used the whole bottle in one sitting because of the lack of foam for coverage.</li>
            <li> I love this setting lotion it holds my curls and crinkles for a very long time.....longer than even gel does.  I love this product and hope I can find it in my local beauty supply store so I wont have to order from online.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years.  It is light and non-greasy.  It&#x27;s foamy so a little goes a long way. It has worked very well on my sisterlocks.</li>
            <li> Not good on course hair</li>
            <li> I have used this as a styling aid for years and is the only hair product of any kind I have used consistently. For my LOC&#x27;S (dreads) I used it while my hair was wet to set curls, and it left me with a tight curl that lasted all day (I work 13 hr days so literally all day!). It also can be used on dry loc&#x27;s or for a curl emergency on a loc that didn&#x27;t quite curl or crimp with the rest because it dries fast! Now that my loc&#x27;s are out, and i have FREE-FLOWING 4C HAIR i use it for twists out without any water. The hold is not as hard as if using a gel, however I prefer my hair to be light and soft with a slightly undefined twist, unlike the hard definition you can get with some gels. I also appreciate the fact there is no glycerin (a humectant), mineral oil (which is in some of her other products), or petroleum. On top of all that, it smells great, like coconuts, but light and will not compete with perfumes or body lotions. So, if you are looking for a styling aid to give you a firm hold on style for free-flowing hair, this may NOT be the one. If you want a soft fluffy twist out or curl on your natural hair, this is it. For styling loc&#x27;s, a definite, YAS! It is a great product to use in addition to wet-sets for loc&#x27;s, and dries quickly, with NO BUILD UP. All in all it is a winner in my book:)</li>
            <li> no residue or build up, excellent hold, a lot of body, quick drying, wish there was more in the bottle!</li>
            <li> Light and easy to use. Leaves no build up in my natural nappy locs and gives very defined curls. It also dries fast so there is no need for additional drying time. Awesome hair styling product which I love and would recommend.</li>
            <li> This product made my daughters loc hair style last for weeks!</li>
            <li> Used it once, wasn&#x27;t convinced if I like it or not just yet. There was no &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34; factor as I thought there would be.  Friends love the product line, and  I am going to try another product in this same line to see if I find one better suited for me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Crinkles and Curls. I&#x27;ve had sisterlocks for 17 months now and I am very pleased with the results I get from using Crinkles and Curls. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It smells wonderful! Like coconut.&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s foamy and light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my locks down.&lt;br /&gt;3. When it dries, I haven&#x27;t experienced any flaking, stickiness, crunchiness or residue. The first day after using it, my hair feels a little dry but as the days go on, it begins to feel softer and softer.&lt;br /&gt;4. It drys pretty quick. (I usually just let my locks air dry.)&lt;br /&gt;5. The hold is incredible. It holds my braid outs for a least a week - probably more.&lt;br /&gt;6. The price is right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be using Crinkles and Curls for years to come!</li>
            <li> The product did just what it said it would do.  I will buy this again.!!!&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could get it locally.</li>
