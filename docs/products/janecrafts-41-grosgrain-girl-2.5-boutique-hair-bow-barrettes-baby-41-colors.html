            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>Very cute and well made, the colors are really nice.</li>
            <li>cheaply made...not happy at all...</li>
            <li>Still, they&#x27;re cute and a great price for so many bows</li>
            <li>Nice assortment of colors.</li>
            <li>When I got the package, I noticed it was kind of smashed, after opening it, I tested to see how  durable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that there&#x27;s a lot</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and very nice bows.</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>I could have made them better.</li>
            <li>LOVE these.  </li>
            <li>Cute and sturdy clips.</li>
            <li>These are much better quality.</li>
            <li>The ribbons are safe and do not dig into your childs scalp.</li>
            <li>and I love them, the clip is actually effective at keeping my bangs back and it is a great way to add and adorable accent to my pixie cut.</li>
            <li>I could have made my own bows of I would have know it was just used with super glue...</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my toddler because the price was fairly cheap, and there was a ton of colors.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for -alligator clip (with ribbon covering the top of the clip but not the bottom</li>
            <li>SUPER CUUUTE,</li>
            <li>Pretty cheap for the amount of bows you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is very thin and fine and these bows are perfect for sweeping her bangs and hair to the side.  </li>
            <li>Very nice bows for little girls</li>
            <li>One bow didn&#x27;t even have a clasp right out of the package.</li>
            <li>The ones that have ribbon on both sides of the clip tend to just slide right out of my daughter&#x27;s hair).  </li>
            <li>However, they work perfectly after I&#x27;ve pulled her hair back with a little hair elastic and then add the bow.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t hold her hair back very well on their own.</li>
            <li>Love how they hold on tight to my baby&#x27;s fine hair but don&#x27;t hurt her.</li>
            <li>These come with a large selection of colors and don&#x27;t pull her hair.</li>
            <li>They are the perfect size for my 11 month old, not too big and not too small.</li>
            <li>the only clips that really hold in my daughters soft hair.</li>
            <li>These are a lot smaller then 2.5&amp;#34; and i can&#x27;t really use them for anything.</li>
            <li>I got these for my one year old.</li>
            <li>old granddaughter loves them.</li>
            <li>Not really a big deal, but fresh out of the box, one of the clips was virtually broken, it didn&#x27;t really close, it is stuck open, but the other 40 have very strong clips, and hold well.</li>

            <li> These took over a month to get here which was slightly disappointing and it looks like I may have received a couple of duplicates but it&#x27;s hard to tell. Still, they&#x27;re cute and a great price for so many bows</li>
            <li> Bought for daughter at Christmas and she loves them. Great variety of colors</li>
            <li> Great quality with a great selection of colors! Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> every color is different ! love</li>
            <li> Great assortment of colors! Love how they hold on tight to my baby&#x27;s fine hair but don&#x27;t hurt her. Perfect size! What a great price too! I&#x27;ve paid $3.99 for just one bow. This is a great deal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give no stars if possible. bows are falling apart. I could have made them better. One bow didn&#x27;t even have a clasp right out of the package.</li>
            <li> LOVE these.  They are beautifully made.  There is a rainbow of colors... can&#x27;t imagine needing a color that is not in this package.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is very thin and fine and these bows are perfect for sweeping her bangs and hair to the side.  I would definitely recommend these bows!</li>
            <li> Cute and sturdy clips. I bought these after buying other clips that fell apart. These are much better quality. Nice assortment of colors.</li>
            <li> Very nice bows for little girls, that do not have lots of hair</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my toddler because the price was fairly cheap, and there was a ton of colors. When I got the package, I noticed it was kind of smashed, after opening it, I tested to see how  durable the box was, and it was almost like they dropped a microwave or something onto the box. Not really a big deal, but fresh out of the box, one of the clips was virtually broken, it didn&#x27;t really close, it is stuck open, but the other 40 have very strong clips, and hold well. I would definitely buy this again. The only thing I would change, would be to have a set with matching colors for doubles, but getting 41 different colors, you&#x27;re guaranteed to have one for every outfit.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t even last an hour on her hair with out the bows falling apart...I could have made my own bows of I would have know it was just used with super glue...cheaply made...not happy at all...</li>
            <li> Perfect size bows and made well!</li>
            <li> Pretty cheap for the amount of bows you&#x27;re getting. If you go to the stores to buy bows, they&#x27;re like $5 for just 1 bow. These are medium sized bows. It&#x27;s nice that there&#x27;s a lot so you can match with your outfits.</li>
            <li> These are a lot smaller then 2.5&amp;#34; and i can&#x27;t really use them for anything. I really  wasted my money on these. a couple of the clips on the back even broke off. left me disappointed.. but saying that if you have shorter hair these might work quite nice but they didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> I got these for my one year old. She hates hair bands and we needed something to pull her hair back. These come with a large selection of colors and don&#x27;t pull her hair. We couldn&#x27;t find anything close to these for the cost in stores. We would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Great value, well made.</li>
            <li> These are perfect. Exactly what I was looking for -alligator clip (with ribbon covering the top of the clip but not the bottom The ones that have ribbon on both sides of the clip tend to just slide right out of my daughter&#x27;s hair).  I will be ordering a second set for pigtails!</li>
            <li> It literally took a month for my product to arrive and quite a few of the bows were double (same color) I didn&#x27;t get 41 different bows, I received maybe 27 bows and the rest were the same color.</li>
            <li> Great variety of colors, perfect size and good quality! My 14 yr. old granddaughter loves them.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this collection of hair bows! Their size is perfect for clipping my daughter&#x27;s hair away from her face on one side. She has a lot of hair, so these hair bows don&#x27;t hold her hair back very well on their own. However, they work perfectly after I&#x27;ve pulled her hair back with a little hair elastic and then add the bow. These bows are very nicely made and truly come in just about every color we could ever need to match all of her clothes.</li>
            <li> There is almost every color (&amp; variations)  in there ! Love them!</li>
            <li> Very cute and well made, the colors are really nice.</li>
            <li> How big are these clips ?</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and very nice bows. Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> SUPER CUUUTE, PERFECT! This seller knows how to make hair ribbon clips well.The ribbons are safe and do not dig into your childs scalp. I looove these!</li>
            <li> awesome hair clips! the only clips that really hold in my daughters soft hair. They come in every color you can imagine. They are the perfect size for my 11 month old, not too big and not too small. perfect!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these for myself even though they are ment for babies and I love them, the clip is actually effective at keeping my bangs back and it is a great way to add and adorable accent to my pixie cut.</li>
