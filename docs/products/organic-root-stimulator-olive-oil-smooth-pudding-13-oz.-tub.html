            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>One thing though - this is a product that works best on un-relaxed or &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair and tends to make the hair look somewhat &amp;#34;curly&amp;#34; - so I wouldn&#x27;t use as a moisturizer on relaxed or straightened hair unless the hair is blow-dried after using.</li>

            <li>It also smells great.</li>

            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>and i used it in my sisters hair for a twist out and the results were amazing...</li>
            <li>Its amazing.</li>
            <li>This product costs more than what I would normally spend, but it is absolutely awesome.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried tons of different stuff from mouse to some kind of water based stuff from Canada and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found to date.</li>
            <li>Using the hair lotion after this product (if used sparingly) will give satisfying results.</li>
            <li>Choose it, wear it, and love it on your style.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this hair</li>
            <li>applied a dime-sized portion (most of the time) to each section of hair (about an inch to 1.5 inches each), combed it through from root to end  </li>
            <li>Some dullness and flaking of product when more than the dime-sized was applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I then either wrap my hair with a scarf if I&#x27;m staying in or I just smooth and go!      </li>
            <li>I discovered this product yesterday &amp; im soo in love with it.</li>
            <li>I use ORS Pudding mostly as a styling gel</li>
            <li>If someone that had finer or straightened hair in the first place this would be amazing!</li>
            <li>um, its pretty good, i just thought it would hold better</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, this is the first pudding of any type I&#x27;ve used on my hair, so there are no puddings with which to compare.  </li>
            <li>love this product good for non relaxed and all natural hair, it do not gum up nor leave sticky residue on the hair and it is easy to use for all kind of styles</li>
            <li>Very lightweight, pleasant smelling and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very Good for your edges and especially the temple area.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like this product read the back, it says ideal for ponytails, not wetsets, not braidouts, twist or anything of that nature.</li>
            <li>great for when I twist my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>This product washes out easily as well.</li>
            <li>My hair feels nice and soft after use and it smells so nice.</li>
            <li>this product is fine, but if you want to moisturize, NO.</li>
            <li>I use this product to smooth my edges and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li>i bought the organic smooth and hold puddin</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did smooth my hair</li>
            <li>Organic Root Stimulator Smooth and Hold Pudding</li>
            <li>the product is light weight and doesn&#x27;t leave residue on your hair.</li>
            <li>My expectations were that the product smooth my hair and provide hold for longer than two days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After washing and spritzing on a leave-in conditioner, I apply an ample amount of this product and brush it smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have a pixie but have used this as edge control and to smooth my updos.  </li>
            <li>This might be a great need to have if i ever go back to the hair crack.</li>
            <li>Helps smooth those flyaway strands and lightly holds those edges in place.  </li>
            <li>Firstly, don&#x27;t purchase this item from Amazon, unless you are okay with scraping your product out from the FLIMSY paper package it comes</li>
            <li>but i am looking forward to use this product more once i become more natural.</li>
            <li>; The edge control came first, and while i liked that product, it really isnt a gel, just a specically made product for the edges.</li>
            <li>It has a really, spoiled berry, sent... not as pleasing as I am sure they intended for it to be.</li>
            <li>Overall it smells good</li>
            <li>Also the smell seemed a bit strong at first</li>
            <li>The latest innovative product on the market for those times when you want shine, moisture, and moderate hold for your edges and updos.</li>
            <li>Whenever I see something new from them I make sure to buy it.</li>
            <li>From the FIRST use, I was a fan!  </li>
            <li>It gives my twist outs a more define look and my ends are soft and adds sheen!</li>
            <li>The hold was more effective on the relaxed half of my hair.  </li>
            <li>This produt leaves your hair smooth, soft, supple, and easy to touch.</li>
            <li>My hair is now super shiny and soft and looks better then it ever has.</li>
            <li>The product was applied to freshly washed and conditioned damp hair.  </li>
            <li>so far this product has kept my edges smooth!</li>
            <li>So I buzzed it all off for a fresh start</li>
            <li>right know and work out often.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten the best results on wet hair when i am about to air dry.</li>
            <li>But low and bewhole this product right here is perfect, no type of flakes, but reading the product it does contain a little alchohol.</li>
            <li>and I loved it since I first tried it in New York while on a working trip last year.</li>
            <li>She now uses the product daily and has only great reviews for it.</li>
            <li>I have light brown very kinky hair that gets very fuzzy.</li>
            <li>This works great and it does not make my hair hard.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it for your short styles and stubborn edges.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft, has light hold and shiny yet non-greasy look.</li>
            <li>For those with natural hair, I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li>A great alternative to using those hard protein gels!</li>
            <li>Also make sure hair is completely dry.</li>
            <li>The curls look great and have actually stayed in place all day when I expected them to fall by now which is normal when i do a twist out.</li>
            <li>Nice pattern not to tight and does not flake.</li>
            <li>, my hair is a bit coarse at times but it smooths my edges down and leaves it with a refreshing scent love love love will recommend this to anyone that wants an alternative to hair gel that leaves your hair hard, this leaves it managable and soft</li>
            <li>Natural, relaxed, or color treated hair all benefit when a fresh tamed finish style is desired.  </li>
            <li>, that could&#x27;ve been because I was using too much...</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really linger.</li>
            <li>The morning after I did my hair, even tho I had used wrap strips n d whole works, d</li>
            <li>but if I did I&#x27;d definitely use this product on my children&#x27;s hair as well because of it&#x27;s primary organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>(If you just want to smooth back your hair or your edges</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have dandruff issue.</li>
            <li>It is getting much healthier and softer.</li>
            <li>Product is very moist and feels like pudding.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this and would recommend especially for natural hair.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff soo much i cant explain, honestly i always thought that ors products were kinda expensive</li>
            <li>, I just thought it would hold right at that moment, yet sensing that I am natural</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair softer after washing and sitting under the dryer better  than any other product I have used before.  </li>
            <li>My hair stays in place, lays flat, looks smooth and non greasy.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great solution for dry, hard-to-manage natural hair that makes the hair soft and healthy-looking - plus easier to brush and style.</li>
            <li>In the final analysis - it appears to smooth relaxed hair better than my course Type 4B natural hair and has minimal hold unless combined with setting lotion.</li>
            <li>sometimes less is more than enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly reccommended for those in-between times when you are between your touch up and your shampoo, when you want your hair to \\&quot;lay down\\&quot; and cooperate.</li>
            <li>and I just wish it would hold a little better</li>
            <li>I am in the transitioning stage from relaxed hair to natural so at this point I do not have enough natural hair to get the full benefits</li>
            <li>After using the ORS Hold Pudding my hair felt very soft to the touch</li>
            <li>My hair is better protected from heat styling, especially for later flat ironing my hair.  </li>
            <li>Not stiff and sticky.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than gel because it is moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave the hair hard or cakey.</li>
            <li>I love it works really well and does not leave my short hair feeeling hard and brittle , will buy again if I can&#x27;t find it in the store&#x27;s</li>
            <li>but I would use for natural hair as well.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to any one wither natural pressed, relaxed or permed.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, not flaky, this white \\&quot;gel\\&quot; is very un-gel like.</li>
            <li>If you have naturally curly or Kinky yet relaxed hair (permed)...</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>: like Jello pudding, but a bit more watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold: next to none- without setting lotion, there is only a two-day hold to twists with careful sleeping.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the process of trying to transition to natural and</li>
            <li>My daughter was introduced to the product when she decided to go natural.</li>
            <li>Now i have been all natural and therefore this did not stick like a healthy-gel which is what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>Hair feels soft.  </li>
            <li>However, it looked so cool on the self, i broke down and brought it away.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s also a moisturizer that works very well for dry, brittle hair because it makes the hair easier to comb and style plus has a &amp;#34;setting&amp;#34; effect as well</li>
            <li>It will last longer than regular hair gels, so you save money and get real results.  </li>
            <li>I am left with a soft hold and it never leaves flakes in my hair.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to someone trying to create various hairstyles on natural hair.</li>
            <li>I have natural kinky dry afro textured hair.</li>

            <li> Natural, relaxed, or color treated hair all benefit when a fresh tamed finish style is desired.  </li>
            <li> , that could&#x27;ve been because I was using too much...</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really linger.</li>
            <li> The morning after I did my hair, even tho I had used wrap strips n d whole works, d</li>
            <li> but if I did I&#x27;d definitely use this product on my children&#x27;s hair as well because of it&#x27;s primary organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> (If you just want to smooth back your hair or your edges</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have dandruff issue.</li>
            <li> It is getting much healthier and softer.</li>
            <li> Product is very moist and feels like pudding.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this and would recommend especially for natural hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff soo much i cant explain, honestly i always thought that ors products were kinda expensive</li>
            <li> , I just thought it would hold right at that moment, yet sensing that I am natural</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair softer after washing and sitting under the dryer better  than any other product I have used before.  </li>
            <li> My hair stays in place, lays flat, looks smooth and non greasy.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great solution for dry, hard-to-manage natural hair that makes the hair soft and healthy-looking - plus easier to brush and style.</li>
            <li> In the final analysis - it appears to smooth relaxed hair better than my course Type 4B natural hair and has minimal hold unless combined with setting lotion.</li>
            <li> sometimes less is more than enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly reccommended for those in-between times when you are between your touch up and your shampoo, when you want your hair to \\&quot;lay down\\&quot; and cooperate.</li>
            <li> and I just wish it would hold a little better</li>
            <li> I am in the transitioning stage from relaxed hair to natural so at this point I do not have enough natural hair to get the full benefits</li>
            <li> After using the ORS Hold Pudding my hair felt very soft to the touch</li>
            <li> My hair is better protected from heat styling, especially for later flat ironing my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not stiff and sticky.  </li>
            <li> I like it better than gel because it is moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave the hair hard or cakey.</li>
            <li> I love it works really well and does not leave my short hair feeeling hard and brittle , will buy again if I can&#x27;t find it in the store&#x27;s</li>
            <li> but I would use for natural hair as well.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any one wither natural pressed, relaxed or permed.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, not flaky, this white \\&quot;gel\\&quot; is very un-gel like.</li>
            <li> If you have naturally curly or Kinky yet relaxed hair (permed)...</li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> : like Jello pudding, but a bit more watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold: next to none- without setting lotion, there is only a two-day hold to twists with careful sleeping.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the process of trying to transition to natural and</li>
            <li> My daughter was introduced to the product when she decided to go natural.</li>
            <li> Now i have been all natural and therefore this did not stick like a healthy-gel which is what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> Hair feels soft.  </li>
            <li> However, it looked so cool on the self, i broke down and brought it away.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s also a moisturizer that works very well for dry, brittle hair because it makes the hair easier to comb and style plus has a &amp;#34;setting&amp;#34; effect as well</li>
            <li> It will last longer than regular hair gels, so you save money and get real results.  </li>
            <li> I am left with a soft hold and it never leaves flakes in my hair.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to someone trying to create various hairstyles on natural hair.</li>
            <li> I have natural kinky dry afro textured hair.</li>
            <li> It does not make the hair hard or stiff and doesn&#x27;t flake up like most hair gels.</li>
            <li> Normally, i just lay my hair down with water and a creamy leave-in conditioner, because i don&#x27;t like the way gel feels in my hair.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan and just wanted to let other curious non black girls know it works, try it!</li>
            <li> Also, this product has a build-up effect in the hair but it works well for me because I wash my hair once a week and because of the way I usually style my hair - brushed and pulled back in a bun alot (too much).  </li>
            <li> I was using the ORS lock and twist gel for my twist outs and other natural hair styles</li>
            <li> Perfection in a jar especially for natural black haircare.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an alternative to the wet sticky traditional gel that often gives you an initial onset of hardness but later produces those flaky dandruff like hails.</li>
            <li> My previous loc journey was rough and difficult and I had gone through many different products in the attempt to lock my hair.  </li>

            <li> I am Hispanic, non black with naturally straight thick hair.</li>
            <li> and I use it to wet my hair during my rolling process.</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> not for extreme hold though.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair(non black) and I put it in wet hair to keep my curly from frizzing.</li>
            <li> it was slicked down n looking like when I just stepped out of d salon.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a hard time finding a hair product for my type of hair which is short and thick.</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for something that would tame (control)</li>
            <li> It held my hair in place NEATLY, without flaking and without a sticky mess!  </li>
            <li> but I just used it this past wkend.</li>
            <li> I also learnt that those heavy protein gel are not good for your hair.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard.  </li>
            <li> I was appalled to receive this and read the ingredients which include a large variety of harmful chemicals including:&lt;br /&gt;Blue</li>

            <li> I was appalled to receive this and read the ingredients which include a large variety of harmful chemicals including:&lt;br /&gt;Blue #1&lt;br /&gt;Yellow #5&lt;br /&gt;Benzyl Benzoate&lt;br /&gt;Methylchloroisothiazolinone&lt;br /&gt;Methylisothiazolinone&lt;br /&gt;Polysorbate 60&lt;br /&gt;Cetyl alcohol&lt;br /&gt;and the list goes on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company should be sued.</li>
            <li> I use this product to smooth my edges and it works like a charm. I am left with a soft hold and it never leaves flakes in my hair.It also smells great.Another staple from the Organic Root Stimulator product line. A great alternative to using those hard protein gels!</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for something that would tame (control) my edges and finally I found this product.</li>
            <li> i bought the organic smooth and hold puddin and i used it in my sisters hair for a twist out and the results were amazing...her hair was shiny, its non greasy, it holds and it was just a great styling produst to use...it doesnt leave any buildups either.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and the hair lotion when I was out of town and didn&#x27;t have the products I regularly use.  This product costs more than what I would normally spend, but it is absolutely awesome.  I currently have relaxed hair but I would use for natural hair as well.  It does the job of my Ampro protein gel when I wrap my hair.  It leaves my hair softer after washing and sitting under the dryer better  than any other product I have used before.  My hair is better protected from heat styling, especially for later flat ironing my hair.  Using the hair lotion after this product (if used sparingly) will give satisfying results.</li>
            <li> The latest innovative product on the market for those times when you want shine, moisture, and moderate hold for your edges and updos. You get the best in the Organic Root Stimulator Olive Oil Smooth-n-Hold Pudding.  It&#x27;s an alternative to the wet sticky traditional gel that often gives you an initial onset of hardness but later produces those flaky dandruff like hails. Natural, relaxed, or color treated hair all benefit when a fresh tamed finish style is desired.  Perfection in a jar especially for natural black haircare.  A creamy alternative for a textured look without chemical additives.  You&#x27;ll love it for your short styles and stubborn edges.  An ideal product when you want quantity and quality with a worthwhile price point.  It will last longer than regular hair gels, so you save money and get real results.  Choose it, wear it, and love it on your style.  Happy hair do&#x27;s without the worry of the don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using olive oil products for a while now and when i seen this I gave it a try and its GREAT!!!!! It does not make the hair hard or stiff and doesn&#x27;t flake up like most hair gels. It has a good smell I even use it in my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this hair pudding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did smooth my hair but I found it to be too moist, that could&#x27;ve been because I was using too much... sometimes less is more than enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might try it again for an overnight style to see what the morning results would be before just giving up on this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff soo much i cant explain, honestly i always thought that ors products were kinda expensive but then again i am a bit frugal. the size of the jar is matching to the price so i had to get it, my hair is a bit coarse at times but it smooths my edges down and leaves it with a refreshing scent love love love will recommend this to anyone that wants an alternative to hair gel that leaves your hair hard, this leaves it managable and soft</li>
            <li> I love organic root stimulator, there products are the best. Whenever I see something new from them I make sure to buy it. I bought this today because I always need something to control my edges. This works great and it does not make my hair hard. My hair feels nice and soft after use and it smells so nice. I opened the jar and I could not stop smelling the gel, it smells like perfume. Try it, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> So i bought this, and the edge control over amazon.com.; The edge control came first, and while i liked that product, it really isnt a gel, just a specically made product for the edges. But low and bewhole this product right here is perfect, no type of flakes, but reading the product it does contain a little alchohol. Maybe thats to balance all the wondefull oils it contains. If you don&#x27;t like this product read the back, it says ideal for ponytails, not wetsets, not braidouts, twist or anything of that nature. I would recommend this to any one wither natural pressed, relaxed or permed.</li>
            <li> Organic Root Stimulator Smooth and Hold Pudding is a very good product for those times when you want to smooth those stubborn waves (or kinks) in place. Very Good for your edges and especially the temple area. Very lightweight, pleasant smelling and easy to use. Not greasy, not flaky, this white \\&quot;gel\\&quot; is very un-gel like. This produt leaves your hair smooth, soft, supple, and easy to touch. Great product! Highly reccommended for those in-between times when you are between your touch up and your shampoo, when you want your hair to \\&quot;lay down\\&quot; and cooperate. Buy this and be amazed!</li>
            <li> If you have naturally curly or Kinky yet relaxed hair (permed)... this is a great product to get your hair in a curly style. I have natural hair and I use it to wet my hair during my rolling process. It has a really, spoiled berry, sent... not as pleasing as I am sure they intended for it to be. One benefit is that I am not allergic to it! It is also thick and creamy and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. I have used products that look flaky. If I find this product for cheaper then I will purchase again, but otherwise...nope!</li>
            <li> the product is light weight and doesn&#x27;t leave residue on your hair. not for extreme hold though. its more a product to do touch up and prevent fly aways</li>
            <li> This product is great for smoothing ponytails and buns. I&#x27;ve gotten the best results on wet hair when i am about to air dry. I like it better than gel because it is moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave the hair hard or cakey. One downside is that if used daily it does leave like a greasy build up. Not a big deal if you shampoo 1x a week. Also the smell seemed a bit strong at first but it doesn&#x27;t really linger. I&#x27;ve heard that the ors girl&#x27;s pudding had a nicer smell.</li>
            <li> After watching a negative review about this product i was a little afraid to try it. However, it looked so cool on the self, i broke down and brought it away. And i love it! Normally, i just lay my hair down with water and a creamy leave-in conditioner, because i don&#x27;t like the way gel feels in my hair. I also learnt that those heavy protein gel are not good for your hair. But i have to say that this stuff is great. After using the ORS Hold Pudding my hair felt very soft to the touch but yet still combable.</li>
            <li> I am finishing a 13-oz.container of the ORS Root Stimulator and the following conclusions have been drawn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin, I am five months post-relaxer and use the pudding for two-strand twists. The product was applied to freshly washed and conditioned damp hair.  My expectations were that the product smooth my hair and provide hold for longer than two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied a dime-sized portion (most of the time) to each section of hair (about an inch to 1.5 inches each), combed it through from root to end  (detangling a bit) and either securing the ends with either a roller or a roller clip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: a blend of cucumber and coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency: like Jello pudding, but a bit more watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold: next to none- without setting lotion, there is only a two-day hold to twists with careful sleeping.  Also make sure hair is completely dry. The hold was more effective on the relaxed half of my hair.  Minimal hold on the natural roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other: Some dullness and flaking of product when more than the dime-sized was applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, this is the first pudding of any type I&#x27;ve used on my hair, so there are no puddings with which to compare.  In the final analysis - it appears to smooth relaxed hair better than my course Type 4B natural hair and has minimal hold unless combined with setting lotion.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I&#x27;m wearing my hair short right know and work out often.  I wash my hair 3-4 times a week and this produce is a necessity.  After washing and spritzing on a leave-in conditioner, I apply an ample amount of this product and brush it smooth.  I then either wrap my hair with a scarf if I&#x27;m staying in or I just smooth and go!      It does not leave a greasy buildup on your hair nor does it flake.  I&#x27;m in the process of trying to transition to natural and so far this product has kept my edges smooth!</li>
            <li> I discovered this product when at a local drugstore.  I was looking for something to restart my dreadlocks and was a bit skeptical about whether it would work.  My previous loc journey was rough and difficult and I had gone through many different products in the attempt to lock my hair.  From the FIRST use, I was a fan!  It held my hair in place NEATLY, without flaking and without a sticky mess!  I am one month into my loc voyage and it&#x27;s time to get some more!  For those with natural hair, I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this several weeks ago but I just used it this past wkend. I have short-cut, relaxed hair. The morning after I did my hair, even tho I had used wrap strips n d whole works, d back of my hair was sticking up and I applied this 2 d area that was sticking up n brushed it n voila it was slicked down n looking like when I just stepped out of d salon. Luv it!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter was introduced to the product when she decided to go natural. She now uses the product daily and has only great reviews for it.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product yesterday &amp; im soo in love with it. I have natural kinky dry afro textured hair. I used it to do my twist out and also put rollers(rods) on the twisted hair and took my hair down in the morning. The curls look great and have actually stayed in place all day when I expected them to fall by now which is normal when i do a twist out. I would definitely recommend this product to someone trying to create various hairstyles on natural hair.</li>
            <li> I have a pixie but have used this as edge control and to smooth my updos.  I love it!  No flakes and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard.  If your hair is short, u must have this product!</li>
            <li> great for when I twist my natural hair.  Nice pattern not to tight and does not flake.</li>
            <li> I love it works really well and does not leave my short hair feeeling hard and brittle , will buy again if I can&#x27;t find it in the store&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to combat my stray ends after the application an Outre half wig. It works good as a stand-alone product are in conjunction with the Organic R/S Root Stimulator Olive Oil Edge Control hair gel.</li>
            <li> I have this product on hand now - discovered and purchased about three months ago - and a little goes a long way.  I use ORS Pudding mostly as a styling gel and it&#x27;s also a moisturizer that works very well for dry, brittle hair because it makes the hair easier to comb and style plus has a &amp;#34;setting&amp;#34; effect as well that keeps the hair in place. One thing though - this is a product that works best on un-relaxed or &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair and tends to make the hair look somewhat &amp;#34;curly&amp;#34; - so I wouldn&#x27;t use as a moisturizer on relaxed or straightened hair unless the hair is blow-dried after using. Also, this product has a build-up effect in the hair but it works well for me because I wash my hair once a week and because of the way I usually style my hair - brushed and pulled back in a bun alot (too much).  Overall this is a great solution for dry, hard-to-manage natural hair that makes the hair soft and healthy-looking - plus easier to brush and style. I don&#x27;t have kids but if I did I&#x27;d definitely use this product on my children&#x27;s hair as well because of it&#x27;s primary organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> (If you just want to smooth back your hair or your edges this product is fine, but if you want to moisturize, NO. I think its the alcohol content that does it.) That was my initial reaction. Turns out my hair was the culprit! So I buzzed it all off for a fresh start and now I can say enough about this pudding. My hair is soft, has light hold and shiny yet non-greasy look.</li>
            <li> love this product good for non relaxed and all natural hair, it do not gum up nor leave sticky residue on the hair and it is easy to use for all kind of styles</li>
            <li> I am in the transitioning stage from relaxed hair to natural so at this point I do not have enough natural hair to get the full benefits but i am looking forward to use this product more once i become more natural.</li>
            <li> I buy this stuff at Walmart or Target for about $6. I have curly hair(non black) and I put it in wet hair to keep my curly from frizzing. I&#x27;ve tried tons of different stuff from mouse to some kind of water based stuff from Canada and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found to date. It doesn&#x27;t leave flakes so you don&#x27;t have the no I really don&#x27;t have dandruff issue. Plus it doesn&#x27;t make your hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; which I absolutely hate. My hair is now super shiny and soft and looks better then it ever has.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd bottle and I loved it since I first tried it in New York while on a working trip last year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a hard time finding a hair product for my type of hair which is short and thick. In order to keep my hair down I have to use a ton of gel, hairspray, or any of the between products. Usually, it&#x27;s a mess. This stuff is weighty enough to keep my hair down, but not greasy. It also doesn&#x27;t stain any cloth (e.g. pillowcases) and doesn&#x27;t run off my head if I&#x27;m sweating.</li>
            <li> I was using the ORS lock and twist gel for my twist outs and other natural hair styles but sometimes it would leave a white residue. I seen this and decided to give this a try.......LOVE IT!! It gives my twist outs a more define look and my ends are soft and adds sheen! I absolutely love this and would recommend especially for natural hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just did not know how to use this but it had a consistency of somewhat like water. Now i have been all natural and therefore this did not stick like a healthy-gel which is what i was looking for. If someone that had finer or straightened hair in the first place this would be amazing! This might be a great need to have if i ever go back to the hair crack.</li>
            <li> I have light brown very kinky hair that gets very fuzzy. A friend recommended this product. I am amazed. I no linger have to use my straightener on my hair to keep the fuzz out. It is getting much healthier and softer. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Not stiff and sticky.  Product is very moist and feels like pudding.  Helps smooth those flyaway strands and lightly holds those edges in place.  Hair feels soft.  A little goes a long way. I like it.</li>
            <li> Firstly, don&#x27;t purchase this item from Amazon, unless you are okay with scraping your product out from the FLIMSY paper package it comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, why would you place it in a paper package? My product was EVERYWHERE. The lid was off and the seal underneath was broken. Had this been in a BOX, it might have made it to my house in one piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I&#x27;m just so upset with how my item arrived, I would give 0 stars if possible, just to be a jerk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I do purchase this again, it will be psychically from a store! Get it together, eStores!!</li>
            <li> I am Hispanic, non black with naturally straight thick hair. I am growing my hair out and it is in an awkward choppy in between stage. I am required to wear my hair pulled back in a bun for work and I was drying my hair out and getting flakes with traditional gel. A co-worker suggested I try this product. I never used a black hair care product before and was skeptical but I am a believer now. I have no idea how it works but it does. Its amazing. My hair stays in place, lays flat, looks smooth and non greasy. This product washes out easily as well. I am a huge fan and just wanted to let other curious non black girls know it works, try it!</li>
            <li> waas rly nice n good product for hair n beard</li>
            <li> um, its pretty good, i just thought it would hold better but it does its job when I put a scarf on at night, I just thought it would hold right at that moment, yet sensing that I am natural I guess I can&#x27;t expect it to just hold it like it would if I as relaxed. Overall it smells good and I just wish it would hold a little better</li>
            <li> great price and great deal</li>
