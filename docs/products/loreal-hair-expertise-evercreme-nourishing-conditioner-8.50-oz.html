            <li>, IT WAS PACKAGES IN A WAY THAT IT ARRIVED IN PERFECT CONDITION, I HAVE NOW USED ALMOST EVERY PRODUCT IN THIS LINE AND HAVE NOTHING TO SAY</li>

            <li>this is a great conditioner!  </li>
            <li>Very good prooduct.</li>
            <li>I loved it, but I don&#x27;t know why you no longer deliver to Saudi Arabia?!</li>
            <li>Definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is a wonderful product to smooth and condition my highlighted, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>It might work not so good for me.</li>
            <li>This conditioner provided great slip in the shower and made detangling very easy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what this product does, but my hair sure looks and feels healthier!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great silicone free shampoo for us with wavy or curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Works as good and even better than salon brands</li>
            <li>BUT GOOD THINGS, I LOVE ALL OF THE PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s suitable for color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li>I also love the scent.</li>
            <li>and I like to smell like a guy, mostly because women like and expect me to smell like a guy.  </li>
            <li>Works great, doesn&#x27;t leave hair oily or greasy, just soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I love this rich creamy shampoo.</li>
            <li>feels light after washes.</li>
            <li>only happy hair days ahead..</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so smooth.</li>
            <li>the smell is more like a perfume though, not crazy about that</li>
            <li>I bought this based on the good reviews, but, for me, it created too much build-up within the first 4 uses.</li>
            <li>But it also washes thoroughly and rinses away clean.</li>
            <li>Also its silicone free, which for all natural lovers is a huge plus, if you are looking for more silicone free products</li>
            <li>my new product from now on:)</li>
            <li>Definitely buying more of this!</li>
            <li>I am still waiting for one of my male coworkers to walk into the room and ask who smells so nice</li>
            <li>While I like the Intense conditioner better, this one still is worth your money if you have normal to oily hair.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>My hair gets really frizzy and usually doesn&#x27;t look all that great in the wintertime.  </li>
            <li>But this made my hair so smooth and soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with L&#x27;Oreal</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It is mild and makes my hair feel very soft.</li>
            <li>only gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because the scent is so strong.  </li>
            <li>Sulfate free, great low price especially through amazon, makes hair soft and shiny, smells nice&lt;br /&gt;Cons: rich and heavy</li>
            <li>I have very thick, course hair and a good conditioner is extremely important for me and this did not leave my hair feeling soft at all.</li>
            <li>If you have severely dry/damaged hair, try the intense conditioner in the EverCreme line - this one might not cut it for you.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say which ingredients are responsible for the condition of my hair.  </li>
            <li>My deodorant and body spray are matched so that I have a uniform smell, this stuff really throws off the scent and I am worried about how the ladies might perceive me.  </li>
            <li>one of the best conditioners in the game, the third ingredient is sunflower oil</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can see the full ingredients list by zooming in on the second product image.  </li>
            <li>It makes hair very soft and shiny and smells lovely, however is still pretty heavy.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have remarked, it seems to build-up very quickly.</li>
            <li>I tried this conditioner trying to find something that was a little more natural but unfortunately, it really doesn&#x27;t condition that well.  </li>
            <li>and I was really surprised to find that something so inexpensive did so much for my hair.  </li>
            <li>love it , already see a difference in a few uses.smells god.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic on my dry, coarse, very curly hair.</li>
            <li>, they&#x27;ll be surprised when I speak up!  </li>
            <li>Over the past couple of years, I&#x27;ve become much more aware of the the type of chemicals that are in our every day household items, such as cleaners and toiletries.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This smells nice, similar to the Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi Repairing products, although not exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>It goes flat easily, and tends to be slightly dry.</li>
            <li>(I did also use a detangling spray and a small amount of hair oil, but I&#x27;d been using those same products along with a different shampoo and conditioner and my hair didn&#x27;t feel and look as good as with this</li>
            <li>My hair has improved since using this conditioner, so much so that I opted to try the \\&quot;Intense\\&quot; version in the same line.  </li>
            <li>I wash my hair every other day because of its texture and by wash day, it was ratty and very tangled.</li>
            <li>Extra dry natural curly hair using the CG method ....</li>

            <li> love it , already see a difference in a few uses.smells god. feels light after washes. my new product from now on:)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what this product does, but my hair sure looks and feels healthier!</li>
            <li> Works fantastic on my dry, coarse, very curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has improved since using this conditioner, so much so that I opted to try the \\&quot;Intense\\&quot; version in the same line.  While I like the Intense conditioner better, this one still is worth your money if you have normal to oily hair.  (Even for those of you with an oily scalp - the rest of your hair needs to be conditioned.)  My hair felt thicker and smoother after using this product.  I do a lot of styling (with and without heat) so my hair needed a stronger conditioner.  If you have severely dry/damaged hair, try the intense conditioner in the EverCreme line - this one might not cut it for you.</li>
            <li> Extra dry natural curly hair using the CG method ....on a budget! this conditioner does it all with 10/10 results.  I have found what  I have been looking for the past two years.  only happy hair days ahead..</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells like buttery cookies.  It&#x27;s a great silicone free shampoo for us with wavy or curly hair.  Makes my hair so smooth. I love it!</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo and conditioner together for the past couple months. It makes hair very soft and shiny and smells lovely, however is still pretty heavy. I usually wash my hair every other day or even once every three days if it doesn&#x27;t look greasy. Halfway through the second day in the summer, my hair looks like it could use a wash again. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy but it starts to look very flat and a bit too oily. I might save the other half of this bottle for the dry winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Sulfate free, great low price especially through amazon, makes hair soft and shiny, smells nice&lt;br /&gt;Cons: rich and heavy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my review helped you, please hit the &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; button below:</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the good reviews, but, for me, it created too much build-up within the first 4 uses. I have short, very thick hair and this just isn&#x27;t helping.</li>
            <li> I burned my hair with a curling iron, and it was breaking. This conditioner is a wonderful product to smooth and condition my highlighted, frizzy hair. I use the ever cream shampoo also.</li>
            <li> I have waist-length, wavy/curly hair that tends to get nasty knots at the tips. This conditioner provided great slip in the shower and made detangling very easy. However, my hair looked dull after drying. I wash my hair every other day because of its texture and by wash day, it was ratty and very tangled. As other reviewers have remarked, it seems to build-up very quickly.</li>
            <li> Works as good and even better than salon brands and I&#x27;ve used them all.  I also love the scent. Definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li> I love this rich creamy shampoo. It is mild and makes my hair feel very soft. But it also washes thoroughly and rinses away clean.</li>
            <li> Works well but can&#x27;t tell any difference from my Suave products.</li>
            <li> THIS ARRIVED THE VERY NEXT DAY AFTER I ORDERED IT, IT WAS PACKAGES IN A WAY THAT IT ARRIVED IN PERFECT CONDITION, I HAVE NOW USED ALMOST EVERY PRODUCT IN THIS LINE AND HAVE NOTHING TO SAY BUT GOOD THINGS, I LOVE ALL OF THE PRODUCTS. THANK YOU FOR OFFERING THIS LINE FOR AN AMOUNT I COULD AFFORD!! I WILL BE BACK TO REORDER!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this condition for about one month. And I found there was no difference with my hair. It might work not so good for me.</li>
            <li> Very good prooduct. Recommend it</li>
            <li> I used this along with the shampoo from the same line and I was really surprised to find that something so inexpensive did so much for my hair.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot, so my expectations were definitely exceeded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry, color-treated hair and it&#x27;s been quite cold here lately.  My hair gets really frizzy and usually doesn&#x27;t look all that great in the wintertime.  But this made my hair so smooth and soft and silky.  (I did also use a detangling spray and a small amount of hair oil, but I&#x27;d been using those same products along with a different shampoo and conditioner and my hair didn&#x27;t feel and look as good as with this conditioner.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smells nice, similar to the Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi Repairing products, although not exactly the same.  The scent doesn&#x27;t linger, though, and this rinses out without leaving residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see the full ingredients list by zooming in on the second product image.  I can&#x27;t say which ingredients are responsible for the condition of my hair.  This is sulfate-free so it&#x27;s suitable for color-treated hair.  Definitely buying more of this!</li>

            <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t leave hair oily or greasy, just soft and manageable.  Didn&#x27;t cause any scalp irritation which some brands do for me.  This is my first experience with L&#x27;Oreal and I would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because the scent is so strong.  I am a guy with long hair and I like to smell like a guy, mostly because women like and expect me to smell like a guy.  My deodorant and body spray are matched so that I have a uniform smell, this stuff really throws off the scent and I am worried about how the ladies might perceive me.  I am still waiting for one of my male coworkers to walk into the room and ask who smells so nice, they&#x27;ll be surprised when I speak up!  ;)</li>
            <li> one of the best conditioners in the game, the third ingredient is sunflower oil so you know it has plenty of moisture. Also its silicone free, which for all natural lovers is a huge plus, if you are looking for more silicone free products try their other conditioner in this line and their evercurl conditioner. These are the only conditioners I will use.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! I have fine dark blonde highlighted hair, with a slight wave, but it is fairly thick (lots of strands). It goes flat easily, and tends to be slightly dry. I have found this conditioner to be the perfect balance of hydrating and volumizing, which is just what I need. My daughter who has thick stranded red curly hair with a tendency to frizz, dislikes this conditioner, so I would not chose this conditioner if you have her hair type!</li>
            <li> this is a great conditioner!  the smell is more like a perfume though, not crazy about that but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> Over the past couple of years, I&#x27;ve become much more aware of the the type of chemicals that are in our every day household items, such as cleaners and toiletries.

            <li> I loved it, but I don&#x27;t know why you no longer deliver to Saudi Arabia?!</li>
