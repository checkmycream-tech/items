            <li>Was it successful?</li>
            <li>This razor did a good job on my face, but quality wise after two weeks of use it was already rusting.  </li>
            <li>My guess is for long-term you would get about six months to one year out of it, but for a good shave as an entry-level razor</li>
            <li>A good choice travel.</li>

            <li>The razor is good for the money</li>

            <li>Very pleased with the razor.</li>
            <li>still an excellent and economical shave</li>
            <li>However , quality and good looks are there, nice piece to have in your drawer</li>
            <li>The razor itself is pretty much perfect.  </li>
            <li>man, I still love your TV show!]</li>
            <li>Easy to use great product  </li>
            <li>great fit and finish.</li>
            <li>Nice weight.</li>
            <li>so I just cleaned up the razor as nice as I could.</li>
            <li>but the use is effective.</li>
            <li>Love it works good shaves to the bone,&lt;br /&gt;Takes all hair off my face and head</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to find this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The original blade that came with this razor provided a great shave.  </li>
            <li>Some will note that this isn&#x27;t the greatest quality razor, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be, it&#x27;s a great way to get started in wet shaving.</li>
            <li>Good razor for the price, operates smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and hefty, glides nicely across the skin and is easy to maneuver around tricky areas.  </li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this a a great razor, and a great gift idea for any man in your family, especially your sons.</li>
            <li>Easy to use,clean, and has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li>ok if you want to peal your face</li>
            <li>Better yet this one is 1/3 the price.</li>
            <li>My husband love this.  </li>
            <li>Your journey is just beginning :).</li>
            <li>I thought this might be ok.</li>
            <li>and I have enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t ask for any more then that</li>
            <li>...gotten more.</li>
            <li>Spend 8-10 more get a better razor</li>
            <li>Pleased with the results, I decided to move up to a easier to load butterfly type razor.  </li>
            <li>Goes to show newer isn&#x27;t always better.</li>
            <li>Love this razor.  </li>
            <li>Took a couple of shaves to adjust and I discovered that shaving soap and a brush is infinitely better than canned foam.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try using a safety razor without spending $50 or more on gear--took a chance on this razor</li>
            <li>This razor was inexpensive but performs like razors that cost so much more.</li>
            <li>They work better than anything I have shaved with before.</li>
            <li>DOES NOT GRAB BLADES SECURELY!  </li>
            <li>, glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>As my first step into DE shaving, I picked this up off of Amazon as because it was dirt cheap but still had great reviews.  </li>
            <li>and after two strokes changed to a blade that worked pretty good for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s efficient and cost effective over the use of disposals , with the added bonus , its easy to clean</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are no lube and comfort strips on it, so you will need to make sure your face and whiskers are warm and moist, which took me a couple of days to get right.</li>
            <li>and I am thrilled to be able to be so positive about a product!</li>
            <li>It seems to work just as good as the high dollar cartridge razors, maybe even better when I relearn how to use it.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this product it does a very good job, and my overall cost for razors will for sure go down.</li>
            <li>it is nice to be able to get back to a close shave and feel good doing it.</li>
            <li>RAZOR works great so far.</li>
            <li>Way better than cheap disposables or over-priced 5-bladed razors.</li>
            <li>but if you are wanting to be a real man this is a good start.</li>
            <li>Really nice, worth the price.</li>
            <li>All in all, for less than $10, this razor has good weight, is nicely built, and gave me a good shave and free blades</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Surprisingly easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-Easy</li>
            <li>housing opens with an easy twist, blade is easy to insert/remove</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and change the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s just better to stick to the tried and true.</li>
            <li>Good choice for new shaver.</li>
            <li>Easy smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The shave is alot smoother and with this razor not as smooth.</li>
            <li>Shold have listen to the reviews,didn&#x27;t last,hubby not at all happy purchased something else locally</li>
            <li>This is as cheap as it comes.</li>
            <li>I must use a light touch to avoid cuts,but I&#x27;m getting the results I wanted.</li>
            <li>Well, then I figured I&#x27;d check it out on Amazon since these were obviously available</li>
            <li>Got this for 13$ with free shipping.</li>
            <li>Blade that came with razor did not give comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Came damage and it is just a cheap piece of junk.</li>
            <li>Then it read that it&#x27;s a great razor, but needs a different blade.</li>
            <li>The handle is quite long, but the razor balances beautifully.  </li>
            <li>But, so far so good.</li>
            <li>You should be able to glide right through hair without it pulling any.</li>
            <li>It gave me a close, clean and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d give the original safety</li>
            <li>I purchased new blades and it is working amazingly.</li>
            <li>This razor gives a nice shave (then again the shave is most likely dependent upon the type of razors you purchased, I purchased 100 Wilkinson Sword blades to go with it) for a non-brand razor.</li>
            <li>The twist to open action works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Remember you must go a great deal slower when shaving with a single blade.</li>
            <li>I paid more for this than I wanted to because I liked the one in the picture and the seller lived in the same state, so I figured shipping would be quick.</li>
            <li>weight, good size and looks pretty classy too.</li>
            <li>I may step up to another razor later, but for now I&#x27;m pretty happy.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work like the old fashioned kind.</li>
            <li>My wife says my skin is way smoother now and after figuring out how a real razor worked, I was able to make it work like a boss.  </li>
            <li>There are also many Merkur&#x27;s that are very affordable in the $40-$60 range.  </li>
            <li>This feels and looks like it should cost a whole lot more.</li>
            <li>No, it doesn&#x27;t say that anywhere in the listing, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the cost.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Not a bad razor.</li>
            <li>and I recommend this shaver over the previous shaver I bought although it too is good but requires more finesse to prevent nicking.</li>
            <li>the blade didn&#x27;t fit right then.  </li>
            <li>I love the smooth action of replacing the blades.</li>
            <li>Low quality gray aluminum middle membrane  instead of real good quality metal membrane covered with chrome.</li>
            <li>You might get a better shave if you spend more than that, but that should be enough to beat any of those3, 4, 5, 17, or however-many bladed razors you see at the</li>
            <li>Right after replyng to their e-mail they were restocked with the one I originally wanted.</li>
            <li>My face was smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt and not a drop of blood first time.</li>
            <li>With this razor I just loosen the blade, rinse it off, and viola, no clogs and a nice clean shave with only one blade.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting better shaves and feel cleaner after using it rather than new razors that leave gel or soap on you face.</li>
            <li>love my new razor.</li>
            <li>Item received in fine  box thanks</li>
            <li>Its cheap, loads quickly and easily, heavy and good quality.  </li>
            <li>These are the razors I have always used, any butterfly double edge shaves the best and has great control for cutting in.</li>
            <li>It is well balanced, operates smoothly and has been a real pleasure to use.  </li>
            <li>It would be well worth it at over twice that</li>
            <li>I used double edged razors 30 years ago and they were effective if unremarkable.  </li>
            <li>and I can shave for two years for the cost of a months worth of cartridges.</li>
            <li>Old school safe, to use would recommend.</li>
            <li>Emailed me right away that the razor was out of stock.</li>
            <li>This is a razor that should be sold at a .99 cent store,but that is what i think,i beleave no matter what you pay for something it should work right and</li>
            <li>and was prices right.</li>
            <li>I ordered this item and you know what they were right.</li>
            <li>Overall very pleased with the seller and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This one works just as well, and is REALLY easier to clean than any of those multi-blade razors that get blocked up.</li>
            <li>Presto -- it&#x27;s clean, ready to continue.</li>
            <li>I think I would like one with a little longer of a handle, but this one has a nice feel and works fine.</li>
            <li>Even more exciting I still have 4 unopened packs of derby blades that I purchased at the same time!!</li>
            <li>I really do hope that the guys who are reviewing this at 5-stars will soon figure out what they&#x27;re missing, because a great shave is a sensory experience that every man deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For around $20, I now have a great razor and enough blades to last for years.</li>
            <li>the razor does hold the blade good and tight so it does work for shaving,get some stuff to stop cuts from bleeding im</li>
            <li>This was the type we first used.</li>
            <li>10 first quality blades.  </li>
            <li>BTW this razor looks identical to the &#x27;One&#x27; razor that costs twice as much!</li>
            <li>The item is exactly as it was described, and works how the item should work.  </li>
            <li>Just finished shaving with this razor for the first time.</li>
            <li>Mine looks exactly as chrome-like as the rest of the razor.  </li>
            <li>Arrive 3 days late but the quality is great.</li>
            <li>This is my first review with Amazon</li>
            <li>, I recommend washing your face as hot as you can get your water or wash cloth, start with the goatee areas under the nose, since those are the hardest areas, finish with the cheeks, which are the easiest.</li>
            <li>wish, though, is that somehow I will be able to kick the habit of a 6 blade system and the poorhouse that it will ultimately put me into.</li>
            <li>Buy a better one, this one goes back.</li>
            <li>I see nothing wrong with this razor and it works perfect</li>
            <li>Sure, there wasn&#x27;t any hair left on my face.</li>
            <li>I rinse this razor in hot water when done</li>
            <li>you call within the next 10 minutes, we&#x27;ll give you 10 of these and all you pay is additional shipping&amp;#34; :-)  </li>
            <li>However I love the challenge and feel of shaving with the double edge safety razor.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fantastic (as far as I know.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a woman, so my tricky areas are ankles and elbows--the nice long handle is very helpful for me.  </li>
            <li>This is my first DE razor and it is not too shabby.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Razor is almost exactly what I wa expecting.</li>
            <li>Must admit modern technology wins.</li>
            <li>As a noob to DE shaving, I can&#x27;t say that I could compare this razor to a higher end one, because I bought this one for the purpose of trying my hand at this type of shaving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK says it all, it meets the minimum standard I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The multi-blade razors all cut more smoothly with less care to avoid cuts.</li>
            <li>If you are new to this style of shaving like I was, this is not a bad razor at all to begin with.</li>
            <li>I typically shave after showering, with regular shaving cream, and I have loved how smooth my face and neck feel, with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>This thing is not even useful as an cheap experiment to see if you like DE shaving, since you can&#x27;t use it with proper technique.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s an old fashioned kind of guy and always preferred the double edge razors, like this one.  </li>
            <li>I was ready to flame this razor after my first shave.</li>
            <li>This is not what is advertised coupled with the fact that the upper portion stains easily.</li>
            <li>Cheaply built easy to cut yourself&lt;br /&gt;Better off paying a little more&lt;</li>
            <li>A single blade does cut easier and better than the others.</li>
            <li>I must have forgotten that they even made single blade, butterfly twist-to-open razors anymore, but I am so glad I did some research and found this one.</li>
            <li>Pure bait and switch.</li>
            <li>Very much like the older one my father use to use.  </li>
            <li>So, I popped in a Derby blade with the butterfly open top (which worked totally fine), and got to shaving for the first time, ever so carefully, with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent razor for the price, I love the long handle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-If blade is clean and dry before you put it away, it should give you about aweeks worth of</li>
            <li>And, while you&#x27;re at it, but the huge discounted package of the brand name double edged razor blades.  </li>
            <li>This unit caused much loss of blood.</li>
            <li>It does the job very well.</li>
            <li>I get a really close shave with this razor, much closer  than the multi blade razors.</li>
            <li>light weight, sturdy and as simple a razor as you can get, and</li>
            <li>Way too much blade exposure to shave with.</li>
            <li>I was simply looking for something cheap to use to get used to this style of shaving before i go into buying a razor</li>
            <li>I could tell it was used because it wasn&#x27;t very shiny</li>
            <li>Doubling up on blades helps keep the blades from moving so much.</li>
            <li>Wish I had spent more</li>
            <li>One end of the razor did not close all the way exposing too much blade angle.  </li>
            <li>Not as close as some modern shaving blades, but so inexpensive to use.</li>
            <li>That means this razor is made from a cheap regular steel material, but not made from alloy zinc, or brass covered with chrome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m shaving in real style now, ... and have yet to need a stepic pencil.  </li>
            <li>If you can use a straight razor</li>
            <li>This razor does work and appears as advertised, but it&#x27;s too light to work the way double edge razors are made to work.  </li>
            <li>Guess they&#x27;ve been using electrics they&#x27;re whole lives.</li>
            <li>just as described in stainless steal blade doesnt wobble recomend it</li>
            <li>MY HUSBAND SEEMS TO REALLY LIKE THEM.</li>
            <li>I will be upgrading to a better razor in the near future.</li>
            <li>i used a double edge razor most of my adult life</li>
            <li>With this razor, my shave was looking good for at least 18 hours.  </li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve been buying a shaving soap from Walmart made by Van Der Hagen called Scented Luxury Shave Soap which works nice for shaving, the scent isn&#x27;t too heavy</li>
            <li>It also has the brand&#x27;s logo, which is in possibly Japanese, but I wouldn&#x27;t know, engraved on the top near the dent.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s almost universally agreed to be a great starter DE, and even some really experienced hobbiests who have tried dozens of other razors still rank it in their top 3 shavers).  </li>
            <li>gave it this rating because it to bulky on top when you use it,it seems like it does not conform  to the area that your shaving have to push harder.tried 6 other types safety razors in it</li>
            <li>Comparing to my other DE razors this one does create more skin irritation too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s adjustable, works well, shaves pretty much as the old Gillette one did.  </li>
            <li>Being new to double edge shaving, I purchased a cheap razor to tryout.  </li>
            <li>I have large hands, so I wish the handle was a little longer, but I am satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li>(like someone had used it), and on the under side of it there was rusting in certain parts of it also indicating that it wasn&#x27;t a brand new razor.</li>
            <li>I save so much money by using these and they shave clearly better than even the most expensive disposable razors or electronic.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be plated with stainless steel and have a cheap feeling..</li>
            <li>Works just like I remember the older ones worked.</li>
            <li>Threw it away after two weeks of trying to get a decent shave.</li>
            <li>neither should you, because if you&#x27;re buying a razor for show and not practicality, you better invest in a more expensive one.</li>
            <li>So, lay out a little more for a decent starter razor, find out what you like, and then, if you feel like it, you can invest more in a luxury shaver down the road.  </li>
            <li>I guess i just got to use to the high tech razors that are out there now.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>the 1st razor the box lid was broke and when you opened up the razor to install a new blade it would not stay open all the way, if you was alittle shakey the top would open and close</li>
            <li>Used this type razor when I was in the Marines, same great razor, same great shave, the only thing I see is wrong is the handle is to short.</li>
            <li>So now that I&#x27;ve decided that I&#x27;m sticking with a DE, I will spend a little more and get a nicer one that&#x27;s adjustable.</li>
            <li>Went back to the old cheaper razor and a clean shave without drawing blood.</li>
            <li>I found it a little light at first.</li>
            <li>I bought thinking I might save money due to cleaning of blade easily.</li>
            <li>In fact, there are no negative points.&lt;br</li>
            <li>one has some tiny metal parts that may not last very long, but it is a good, inexpensive starter razor for those trying out the old school.</li>
            <li>Came in quickly and to my surprise is the EXACT same razor that Rick Harrison does a commercial for.</li>
            <li>The closeness of the shave cannot be matched by any multiblade shaver, after many years of using multiblades I am going back to the single blade razor</li>
            <li>so you have the right idea of how to use it since it is different than disposables.</li>
            <li>I might not even step up to a more expensive one, this one works fine.</li>
            <li>,i emailed the seller and he sent me another unit with a new box(i did not complain about the razor as it did work)</li>
            <li>Have tried all the new disposable razors--double edge, triple edge, floating head, etc.</li>
            <li>I went back to Mercur stainless steel straight blade.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s more advanced and expensive.</li>
            <li>Order a set of blades because the one that comes with the razor is very flimsy and not sharp</li>
            <li>With it, a small bottle of shaving oil, and your favorite blades, you&#x27;re set.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a safety razor without going and buying something expensive and to be honest this razor is more than I expected.</li>
            <li>but that was the first and last shave with this razor.  </li>
            <li>The item arrived on time and works fine, I like the butterfly operation, my previous razor requires some disassembly for replacing the blade.</li>
            <li>My only problem with it is after three weeks of use the top has begun to rust (which other reviews have mentioned as well).</li>
            <li>those men who are like my husband and just don&#x27;t like the overly expensive new razors that are on the market or, disposable razors because none of those work the same, to you or for you, as the old fashioned double edged razor, this would be your best choice.  </li>
            <li>The razor itself has a very nice heavy feel to it, which allowed me drag, with the smallest amount of press, the razor and have it get all hair without a second run by.</li>
            <li>Well, I tried the new razor with the blade that shipped with it, it was marked Nanjie, not a name blade.  </li>
            <li>But, for good or bad, I have never been very aggressive, so with the Dorco blades (around $5/100), I started fairly carefully, and my shaves have been smooth and very close.</li>
            <li>The one shipped to me is a cheap knockoff with a black plastic handle - just what I tried to avoid.</li>
            <li>The mid aluminum membrane certainly doesn&#x27;t appear to be.. aluminum.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, mine razor was not the best one and came directly from China, but not from Japan as it was previously presented by seller.&lt;br /&gt;New update (February 27,2014) - after shaving with this razor about 3 months in a row I confirmed the note of other reviewers - it is started to rust internal surface of head&#x27;s doors of butterfly mechanism.</li>
            <li>I had a razor that I had to completely take  apart to change the blade..</li>
            <li>Stay far away</li>
            <li>a 53 year old man</li>
            <li>Wow, what a shave.</li>
            <li>However I began using a shower gel soap combination of Shea Butter and Almond Oil to shave with and the 5 blader cleans up completely.</li>
            <li>I will probably still end up ordering another more expensive well built razor (such as Parker or Edwin Jagger that I&#x27;ve been looking into) in the future just to see if the shave is better, and also because I would like an unused razor.</li>
            <li>By the way, no blood so far.</li>
            <li>Nothing unexpected which is the surprise.</li>
            <li>I can say this it takes a lot longer to shave, but I will never go back to modern razors.</li>
            <li>I was curious to find out how an item i had used many years back would compare to the present choices.</li>
            <li>But again, I didn&#x27;t care much about the razor&#x27;s looks, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, it is NOT nearly as heavy  as it should be, as a mini razor.</li>
            <li>Skin is too soft, I think.</li>
            <li>This featherweight (due to the cheap aluminum construction) forces you to pull, since its weight is not enough to get through the hair, leading to tugging, irritation and cuts.  </li>
            <li>I also tried different prep creams and lather during this test, none significantly altered the skin drag felt by this style razor.</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this razor after seeing Rick Harrison&#x27;s ad for the Microtouch razor, and becoming nostalgic about my very first razor--my Dad&#x27;s--long ago.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may just be a one-off Chinese factory defect (or, maybe not according to some of the other reviews) but the blade does not seat securely in the shaver and moves around while shaving.  </li>
            <li>True, I am new to DE shaving myself, but it&#x27;s plain as day that this thing is a piece of junk.  </li>
            <li>This is my first single edge razor (and I&#x27;m 59).  </li>
            <li>If you want a decent shaving experience, buy a standard, long-handled razor, and expect to pay $15-20 for it.</li>
            <li>If you were thinking about going back to or trying safety razors I highly recommend that you start with this affordable razor from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The butterfly opening keeps the blade firmly in place, and the razor is heavy enough not to feel cheap, and to encourage shaving with a light touch, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>While there might be a little looseness when it&#x27;s fully opened, as far as the &amp;#34;butterflies&amp;#34;, once closed with the blade secured, I don&#x27;t think it could be any better.  </li>
            <li>Once you do that, though, you are actually less likely to cut yourself than you would be with a cheap disposable or knock-off</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s no big deal and not a negative point.  </li>
            <li>If you look at all the 5-star reviews, they are almost entirely written by people new to using a safety razor.  </li>
            <li>And also it is super heavy, just what you want from a safety razor.</li>
            <li>is higher than the other one.</li>
            <li>Not even the least bit usable.. cheap.. plastic... practically a toy.</li>
            <li>It also came with unexpected items such as a travel case and two packs of blades..</li>
            <li>Simple workings,  Direct function proven design and I am finding the weight in hand works for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mini razor, and it&#x27;s a little more than half the size of a full-sized razor.</li>
            <li>I got this not expecting more than the razor itself in a cardboard box, but it actually came in a little blue holding box with a mirror on it, and a single not-known-to-me brand of DE blade.</li>
            <li>Initially the name for this product was \\&quot;Long Handle Super Heavyweight Butterfly Open Double Edge Safety Razor\\&quot;, which was changed to actual one after my proposal as soon as I put my review and pictures.</li>
            <li>Right down to same name on the blade.</li>
            <li>At the same time as I ordered this, I got TWO ~1950s Gem Micromatic SE razors on eBay for under $12, shipping included, and have gotten 2 smooth, cut-free, zero-irritation shaves with them since, even though I have basically no more wet-shaving experience than I did when I tried this one, which left me bleeding and irritated.  </li>
            <li>The old timey number has a small metal parts and at first the pointy, jagged points on it are intimidating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Very economical if the shaver can last a few years&lt;br /&gt;-Easy</li>
            <li>It does work, but only barely.</li>
            <li>burn and wasting money on quick to clog and dull razors.</li>
            <li>I myself am new to the DE method of shaving, and didn&#x27;t want to spent a lot in case</li>
            <li>That was only true complaint.</li>
            <li>I shaved completely with only one little nick by my ankle (but in all honesty, I do that on occasion with a normal razor).</li>
            <li>It has short , but not a long handle.</li>
            <li>This razor is a little heavier and the guide allows for easier use without as much concern for nicking.</li>
            <li>I have several straight razors that I enjoy shaving with, and can do it without cutting myself.</li>

            <li> This razor did a good job on my face, but quality wise after two weeks of use it was already rusting.  </li>
            <li> My guess is for long-term you would get about six months to one year out of it, but for a good shave as an entry-level razor</li>

            <li> Love it works good shaves to the bone,&lt;br /&gt;Takes all hair off my face and head</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to find this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The original blade that came with this razor provided a great shave.  </li>
            <li> Some will note that this isn&#x27;t the greatest quality razor, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be, it&#x27;s a great way to get started in wet shaving.</li>

            <li> Better yet this one is 1/3 the price.</li>
            <li> My husband love this.  </li>
            <li> Your journey is just beginning :).</li>
            <li> I thought this might be ok.</li>
            <li> and I have enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t ask for any more then that</li>
            <li> ...gotten more.</li>
            <li> Spend 8-10 more get a better razor</li>
            <li> Pleased with the results, I decided to move up to a easier to load butterfly type razor.  </li>
            <li> Goes to show newer isn&#x27;t always better.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.  </li>
            <li> Took a couple of shaves to adjust and I discovered that shaving soap and a brush is infinitely better than canned foam.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try using a safety razor without spending $50 or more on gear--took a chance on this razor</li>
            <li> This razor was inexpensive but performs like razors that cost so much more.</li>
            <li> They work better than anything I have shaved with before.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT GRAB BLADES SECURELY!  </li>
            <li> , glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> As my first step into DE shaving, I picked this up off of Amazon as because it was dirt cheap but still had great reviews.  </li>
            <li> and after two strokes changed to a blade that worked pretty good for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s efficient and cost effective over the use of disposals , with the added bonus , its easy to clean</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are no lube and comfort strips on it, so you will need to make sure your face and whiskers are warm and moist, which took me a couple of days to get right.</li>
            <li> and I am thrilled to be able to be so positive about a product!</li>
            <li> It seems to work just as good as the high dollar cartridge razors, maybe even better when I relearn how to use it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product it does a very good job, and my overall cost for razors will for sure go down.</li>
            <li> it is nice to be able to get back to a close shave and feel good doing it.</li>
            <li> RAZOR works great so far.</li>
            <li> Way better than cheap disposables or over-priced 5-bladed razors.</li>
            <li> but if you are wanting to be a real man this is a good start.</li>
            <li> Really nice, worth the price.</li>
            <li> All in all, for less than $10, this razor has good weight, is nicely built, and gave me a good shave and free blades</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Surprisingly easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-Easy</li>
            <li> housing opens with an easy twist, blade is easy to insert/remove</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and change the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s just better to stick to the tried and true.</li>
            <li> Good choice for new shaver.</li>
            <li> Easy smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The shave is alot smoother and with this razor not as smooth.</li>
            <li> Shold have listen to the reviews,didn&#x27;t last,hubby not at all happy purchased something else locally</li>
            <li> This is as cheap as it comes.</li>
            <li> I must use a light touch to avoid cuts,but I&#x27;m getting the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> Well, then I figured I&#x27;d check it out on Amazon since these were obviously available</li>
            <li> Got this for 13$ with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Blade that came with razor did not give comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Came damage and it is just a cheap piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Then it read that it&#x27;s a great razor, but needs a different blade.</li>
            <li> The handle is quite long, but the razor balances beautifully.  </li>
            <li> But, so far so good.</li>
            <li> You should be able to glide right through hair without it pulling any.</li>
            <li> It gave me a close, clean and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d give the original safety</li>
            <li> I purchased new blades and it is working amazingly.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a nice shave (then again the shave is most likely dependent upon the type of razors you purchased, I purchased 100 Wilkinson Sword blades to go with it) for a non-brand razor.</li>
            <li> The twist to open action works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Remember you must go a great deal slower when shaving with a single blade.</li>
            <li> I paid more for this than I wanted to because I liked the one in the picture and the seller lived in the same state, so I figured shipping would be quick.</li>
            <li> weight, good size and looks pretty classy too.</li>
            <li> I may step up to another razor later, but for now I&#x27;m pretty happy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like the old fashioned kind.</li>
            <li> My wife says my skin is way smoother now and after figuring out how a real razor worked, I was able to make it work like a boss.  </li>
            <li> There are also many Merkur&#x27;s that are very affordable in the $40-$60 range.  </li>
            <li> This feels and looks like it should cost a whole lot more.</li>
            <li> No, it doesn&#x27;t say that anywhere in the listing, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the cost.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Not a bad razor.</li>
            <li> and I recommend this shaver over the previous shaver I bought although it too is good but requires more finesse to prevent nicking.</li>
            <li> the blade didn&#x27;t fit right then.  </li>
            <li> I love the smooth action of replacing the blades.</li>
            <li> Low quality gray aluminum middle membrane  instead of real good quality metal membrane covered with chrome.</li>
            <li> You might get a better shave if you spend more than that, but that should be enough to beat any of those3, 4, 5, 17, or however-many bladed razors you see at the</li>
            <li> Right after replyng to their e-mail they were restocked with the one I originally wanted.</li>
            <li> My face was smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt and not a drop of blood first time.</li>
            <li> With this razor I just loosen the blade, rinse it off, and viola, no clogs and a nice clean shave with only one blade.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting better shaves and feel cleaner after using it rather than new razors that leave gel or soap on you face.</li>
            <li> love my new razor.</li>
            <li> Item received in fine  box thanks</li>
            <li> Its cheap, loads quickly and easily, heavy and good quality.  </li>
            <li> These are the razors I have always used, any butterfly double edge shaves the best and has great control for cutting in.</li>
            <li> It is well balanced, operates smoothly and has been a real pleasure to use.  </li>
            <li> It would be well worth it at over twice that</li>
            <li> I used double edged razors 30 years ago and they were effective if unremarkable.  </li>
            <li> and I can shave for two years for the cost of a months worth of cartridges.</li>
            <li> Old school safe, to use would recommend.</li>
            <li> Emailed me right away that the razor was out of stock.</li>
            <li> This is a razor that should be sold at a .99 cent store,but that is what i think,i beleave no matter what you pay for something it should work right and</li>
            <li> and was prices right.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and you know what they were right.</li>
            <li> Overall very pleased with the seller and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This one works just as well, and is REALLY easier to clean than any of those multi-blade razors that get blocked up.</li>
            <li> Presto -- it&#x27;s clean, ready to continue.</li>
            <li> I think I would like one with a little longer of a handle, but this one has a nice feel and works fine.</li>
            <li> Even more exciting I still have 4 unopened packs of derby blades that I purchased at the same time!!</li>
            <li> I really do hope that the guys who are reviewing this at 5-stars will soon figure out what they&#x27;re missing, because a great shave is a sensory experience that every man deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For around $20, I now have a great razor and enough blades to last for years.</li>
            <li> the razor does hold the blade good and tight so it does work for shaving,get some stuff to stop cuts from bleeding im</li>
            <li> This was the type we first used.</li>
            <li> 10 first quality blades.  </li>
            <li> BTW this razor looks identical to the &#x27;One&#x27; razor that costs twice as much!</li>
            <li> The item is exactly as it was described, and works how the item should work.  </li>
            <li> Just finished shaving with this razor for the first time.</li>
            <li> Mine looks exactly as chrome-like as the rest of the razor.  </li>
            <li> Arrive 3 days late but the quality is great.</li>
            <li> This is my first review with Amazon</li>
            <li> , I recommend washing your face as hot as you can get your water or wash cloth, start with the goatee areas under the nose, since those are the hardest areas, finish with the cheeks, which are the easiest.</li>
            <li> wish, though, is that somehow I will be able to kick the habit of a 6 blade system and the poorhouse that it will ultimately put me into.</li>
            <li> Buy a better one, this one goes back.</li>
            <li> I see nothing wrong with this razor and it works perfect</li>
            <li> Sure, there wasn&#x27;t any hair left on my face.</li>
            <li> I rinse this razor in hot water when done</li>
            <li> you call within the next 10 minutes, we&#x27;ll give you 10 of these and all you pay is additional shipping&amp;#34; :-)  </li>
            <li> However I love the challenge and feel of shaving with the double edge safety razor.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fantastic (as far as I know.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman, so my tricky areas are ankles and elbows--the nice long handle is very helpful for me.  </li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor and it is not too shabby.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Razor is almost exactly what I wa expecting.</li>
            <li> Must admit modern technology wins.</li>
            <li> As a noob to DE shaving, I can&#x27;t say that I could compare this razor to a higher end one, because I bought this one for the purpose of trying my hand at this type of shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK says it all, it meets the minimum standard I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The multi-blade razors all cut more smoothly with less care to avoid cuts.</li>
            <li> If you are new to this style of shaving like I was, this is not a bad razor at all to begin with.</li>
            <li> I typically shave after showering, with regular shaving cream, and I have loved how smooth my face and neck feel, with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> This thing is not even useful as an cheap experiment to see if you like DE shaving, since you can&#x27;t use it with proper technique.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s an old fashioned kind of guy and always preferred the double edge razors, like this one.  </li>
            <li> I was ready to flame this razor after my first shave.</li>
            <li> This is not what is advertised coupled with the fact that the upper portion stains easily.</li>
            <li> Cheaply built easy to cut yourself&lt;br /&gt;Better off paying a little more&lt;</li>
            <li> A single blade does cut easier and better than the others.</li>
            <li> I must have forgotten that they even made single blade, butterfly twist-to-open razors anymore, but I am so glad I did some research and found this one.</li>
            <li> Pure bait and switch.</li>
            <li> Very much like the older one my father use to use.  </li>
            <li> So, I popped in a Derby blade with the butterfly open top (which worked totally fine), and got to shaving for the first time, ever so carefully, with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent razor for the price, I love the long handle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-If blade is clean and dry before you put it away, it should give you about aweeks worth of</li>
            <li> And, while you&#x27;re at it, but the huge discounted package of the brand name double edged razor blades.  </li>
            <li> This unit caused much loss of blood.</li>
            <li> It does the job very well.</li>
            <li> I get a really close shave with this razor, much closer  than the multi blade razors.</li>
            <li> light weight, sturdy and as simple a razor as you can get, and</li>
            <li> Way too much blade exposure to shave with.</li>
            <li> I was simply looking for something cheap to use to get used to this style of shaving before i go into buying a razor</li>
            <li> I could tell it was used because it wasn&#x27;t very shiny</li>
            <li> Doubling up on blades helps keep the blades from moving so much.</li>
            <li> Wish I had spent more</li>
            <li> One end of the razor did not close all the way exposing too much blade angle.  </li>
            <li> Not as close as some modern shaving blades, but so inexpensive to use.</li>
            <li> That means this razor is made from a cheap regular steel material, but not made from alloy zinc, or brass covered with chrome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shaving in real style now, ... and have yet to need a stepic pencil.  </li>
            <li> If you can use a straight razor</li>
            <li> This razor does work and appears as advertised, but it&#x27;s too light to work the way double edge razors are made to work.  </li>
            <li> Guess they&#x27;ve been using electrics they&#x27;re whole lives.</li>
            <li> just as described in stainless steal blade doesnt wobble recomend it</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND SEEMS TO REALLY LIKE THEM.</li>
            <li> I will be upgrading to a better razor in the near future.</li>
            <li> i used a double edge razor most of my adult life</li>
            <li> With this razor, my shave was looking good for at least 18 hours.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve been buying a shaving soap from Walmart made by Van Der Hagen called Scented Luxury Shave Soap which works nice for shaving, the scent isn&#x27;t too heavy</li>
            <li> It also has the brand&#x27;s logo, which is in possibly Japanese, but I wouldn&#x27;t know, engraved on the top near the dent.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s almost universally agreed to be a great starter DE, and even some really experienced hobbiests who have tried dozens of other razors still rank it in their top 3 shavers).  </li>
            <li> gave it this rating because it to bulky on top when you use it,it seems like it does not conform  to the area that your shaving have to push harder.tried 6 other types safety razors in it</li>
            <li> Comparing to my other DE razors this one does create more skin irritation too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s adjustable, works well, shaves pretty much as the old Gillette one did.  </li>
            <li> Being new to double edge shaving, I purchased a cheap razor to tryout.  </li>
            <li> I have large hands, so I wish the handle was a little longer, but I am satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li> (like someone had used it), and on the under side of it there was rusting in certain parts of it also indicating that it wasn&#x27;t a brand new razor.</li>
            <li> I save so much money by using these and they shave clearly better than even the most expensive disposable razors or electronic.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be plated with stainless steel and have a cheap feeling..</li>
            <li> Works just like I remember the older ones worked.</li>
            <li> Threw it away after two weeks of trying to get a decent shave.</li>
            <li> neither should you, because if you&#x27;re buying a razor for show and not practicality, you better invest in a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> So, lay out a little more for a decent starter razor, find out what you like, and then, if you feel like it, you can invest more in a luxury shaver down the road.  </li>
            <li> I guess i just got to use to the high tech razors that are out there now.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> the 1st razor the box lid was broke and when you opened up the razor to install a new blade it would not stay open all the way, if you was alittle shakey the top would open and close</li>
            <li> Used this type razor when I was in the Marines, same great razor, same great shave, the only thing I see is wrong is the handle is to short.</li>
            <li> So now that I&#x27;ve decided that I&#x27;m sticking with a DE, I will spend a little more and get a nicer one that&#x27;s adjustable.</li>
            <li> Went back to the old cheaper razor and a clean shave without drawing blood.</li>
            <li> I found it a little light at first.</li>
            <li> I bought thinking I might save money due to cleaning of blade easily.</li>
            <li> In fact, there are no negative points.&lt;br</li>
            <li> one has some tiny metal parts that may not last very long, but it is a good, inexpensive starter razor for those trying out the old school.</li>
            <li> Came in quickly and to my surprise is the EXACT same razor that Rick Harrison does a commercial for.</li>
            <li> The closeness of the shave cannot be matched by any multiblade shaver, after many years of using multiblades I am going back to the single blade razor</li>
            <li> so you have the right idea of how to use it since it is different than disposables.</li>
            <li> I might not even step up to a more expensive one, this one works fine.</li>
            <li> ,i emailed the seller and he sent me another unit with a new box(i did not complain about the razor as it did work)</li>
            <li> Have tried all the new disposable razors--double edge, triple edge, floating head, etc.</li>
            <li> I went back to Mercur stainless steel straight blade.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s more advanced and expensive.</li>
            <li> Order a set of blades because the one that comes with the razor is very flimsy and not sharp</li>
            <li> With it, a small bottle of shaving oil, and your favorite blades, you&#x27;re set.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a safety razor without going and buying something expensive and to be honest this razor is more than I expected.</li>
            <li> but that was the first and last shave with this razor.  </li>
            <li> The item arrived on time and works fine, I like the butterfly operation, my previous razor requires some disassembly for replacing the blade.</li>
            <li> My only problem with it is after three weeks of use the top has begun to rust (which other reviews have mentioned as well).</li>
            <li> those men who are like my husband and just don&#x27;t like the overly expensive new razors that are on the market or, disposable razors because none of those work the same, to you or for you, as the old fashioned double edged razor, this would be your best choice.  </li>
            <li> The razor itself has a very nice heavy feel to it, which allowed me drag, with the smallest amount of press, the razor and have it get all hair without a second run by.</li>
            <li> Well, I tried the new razor with the blade that shipped with it, it was marked Nanjie, not a name blade.  </li>
            <li> But, for good or bad, I have never been very aggressive, so with the Dorco blades (around $5/100), I started fairly carefully, and my shaves have been smooth and very close.</li>
            <li> The one shipped to me is a cheap knockoff with a black plastic handle - just what I tried to avoid.</li>
            <li> The mid aluminum membrane certainly doesn&#x27;t appear to be.. aluminum.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, mine razor was not the best one and came directly from China, but not from Japan as it was previously presented by seller.&lt;br /&gt;New update (February 27,2014) - after shaving with this razor about 3 months in a row I confirmed the note of other reviewers - it is started to rust internal surface of head&#x27;s doors of butterfly mechanism.</li>
            <li> I had a razor that I had to completely take  apart to change the blade..</li>
            <li> Stay far away</li>
            <li> a 53 year old man</li>
            <li> Wow, what a shave.</li>
            <li> However I began using a shower gel soap combination of Shea Butter and Almond Oil to shave with and the 5 blader cleans up completely.</li>
            <li> I will probably still end up ordering another more expensive well built razor (such as Parker or Edwin Jagger that I&#x27;ve been looking into) in the future just to see if the shave is better, and also because I would like an unused razor.</li>
            <li> By the way, no blood so far.</li>
            <li> Nothing unexpected which is the surprise.</li>
            <li> I can say this it takes a lot longer to shave, but I will never go back to modern razors.</li>
            <li> I was curious to find out how an item i had used many years back would compare to the present choices.</li>
            <li> But again, I didn&#x27;t care much about the razor&#x27;s looks, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, it is NOT nearly as heavy  as it should be, as a mini razor.</li>
            <li> Skin is too soft, I think.</li>
            <li> This featherweight (due to the cheap aluminum construction) forces you to pull, since its weight is not enough to get through the hair, leading to tugging, irritation and cuts.  </li>
            <li> I also tried different prep creams and lather during this test, none significantly altered the skin drag felt by this style razor.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this razor after seeing Rick Harrison&#x27;s ad for the Microtouch razor, and becoming nostalgic about my very first razor--my Dad&#x27;s--long ago.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may just be a one-off Chinese factory defect (or, maybe not according to some of the other reviews) but the blade does not seat securely in the shaver and moves around while shaving.  </li>
            <li> True, I am new to DE shaving myself, but it&#x27;s plain as day that this thing is a piece of junk.  </li>
            <li> This is my first single edge razor (and I&#x27;m 59).  </li>
            <li> If you want a decent shaving experience, buy a standard, long-handled razor, and expect to pay $15-20 for it.</li>
            <li> If you were thinking about going back to or trying safety razors I highly recommend that you start with this affordable razor from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The butterfly opening keeps the blade firmly in place, and the razor is heavy enough not to feel cheap, and to encourage shaving with a light touch, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> While there might be a little looseness when it&#x27;s fully opened, as far as the &amp;#34;butterflies&amp;#34;, once closed with the blade secured, I don&#x27;t think it could be any better.  </li>
            <li> Once you do that, though, you are actually less likely to cut yourself than you would be with a cheap disposable or knock-off</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s no big deal and not a negative point.  </li>
            <li> If you look at all the 5-star reviews, they are almost entirely written by people new to using a safety razor.  </li>
            <li> And also it is super heavy, just what you want from a safety razor.</li>
            <li> is higher than the other one.</li>
            <li> Not even the least bit usable.. cheap.. plastic... practically a toy.</li>
            <li> It also came with unexpected items such as a travel case and two packs of blades..</li>
            <li> Simple workings,  Direct function proven design and I am finding the weight in hand works for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mini razor, and it&#x27;s a little more than half the size of a full-sized razor.</li>
            <li> I got this not expecting more than the razor itself in a cardboard box, but it actually came in a little blue holding box with a mirror on it, and a single not-known-to-me brand of DE blade.</li>
            <li> Initially the name for this product was \\&quot;Long Handle Super Heavyweight Butterfly Open Double Edge Safety Razor\\&quot;, which was changed to actual one after my proposal as soon as I put my review and pictures.</li>
            <li> Right down to same name on the blade.</li>
            <li> At the same time as I ordered this, I got TWO ~1950s Gem Micromatic SE razors on eBay for under $12, shipping included, and have gotten 2 smooth, cut-free, zero-irritation shaves with them since, even though I have basically no more wet-shaving experience than I did when I tried this one, which left me bleeding and irritated.  </li>
            <li> The old timey number has a small metal parts and at first the pointy, jagged points on it are intimidating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Very economical if the shaver can last a few years&lt;br /&gt;-Easy</li>
            <li> It does work, but only barely.</li>
            <li> burn and wasting money on quick to clog and dull razors.</li>
            <li> I myself am new to the DE method of shaving, and didn&#x27;t want to spent a lot in case</li>
            <li> That was only true complaint.</li>
            <li> I shaved completely with only one little nick by my ankle (but in all honesty, I do that on occasion with a normal razor).</li>
            <li> It has short , but not a long handle.</li>
            <li> This razor is a little heavier and the guide allows for easier use without as much concern for nicking.</li>
            <li> I have several straight razors that I enjoy shaving with, and can do it without cutting myself.</li>
            <li> came in a plain mylar pouch, no case, and I ordered 100 replacement blades, so in all it set me back about as much as a couple of replacement magazines for my former 5-blade shaver.</li>
            <li> general statement is: it does not matter how cheap or how expensive is the razor, but if made from a low quality metal such as regular rusted steel and aluminum material then it is not a safety razor anymore.</li>
            <li> The convenient butterfly model will easily last long enough for you to see if it&#x27;s for you.</li>
            <li> I was a little wary given how inexpensive it was, and given some of the reviews of this kind of razor--some razor burn and some nicking, especially if you are &amp;</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the same as the ones you can buy in a store, butat FAR less the price, here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve personally already decided to drop $300 on two rare high-end razors on eBay, but that&#x27;s just due to my taste, and due to a bad case of RAD :).  </li>
            <li> I may have to upgrade to a $30+ one later, but this will do in the meantime, as long as it lasts a year or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Buy the 100 pack of Wilkinson Sword Double Edge Safety Razor Blades  and this razor to be set for shaving comfort for a long time.</li>
            <li> This razor is well built and should last a long time.</li>
            <li> , ... open it a bit and let it air dry ...</li>
            <li> If you decide that you want to switch to her safety razors then you can start looking at some nicer razors to take you through the long term.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t see that happening with this one for a long while.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time DE shaver</li>
            <li> wonder why I waited so long.</li>
            <li> Kept getting cut, no matter how slow or gentle I was.</li>
            <li> My father is so contempt with these blades, he grows thick hair fast and with these blades hes amazed that he doesnt need to shave every other day or have stubble immediately the next day.</li>
            <li> If you do a quick search for \\&quot;safety razors ranked by weight\\&quot;, and pull up the Badger and Blade wiki post, you will see that comes in right around the weight of the plastic crap</li>
            <li> Also, the blade sticks out a bit further on one side than on the other.</li>
            <li> The only flaw being that when I got it, it was a little dented on the top, and I mean a very small dent.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use, the handles requires enormous amounts of pressure in order to be open.</li>
            <li> I am not new to safety razor</li>
            <li> I never had so man nicks and cuts until I tried this single edge blade.</li>
            <li> Individuals can probably use the single blade with no problem</li>
            <li> The only thing in my case that I really disliked, was when I ordered the razor I thought I was going to get a brand new razor because you know, who wants a used razor, but unfortunately that was what I get it.</li>
            <li> Shouldn&#x27;t have surprised me since I usually luck out with Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Though I tried and tried, I never got used to having to toilet paper my face due to all the nicks I got from this razor and single-edge blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too short of handle an blades arent very sharp</li>
            <li> Holds the blade  securely enough but it just messes with my OCD a little.  </li>
            <li> The handle is a little short too.</li>
            <li> The short handle takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> It is too light, and the blade it comes with is just dangerous.  </li>
            <li> Rough Finnish.</li>
            <li> not much to say, its durrable and does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> Been wet shaving for about 6 months and using a Edwin Jagger DE89LBL and went through a sampler of DE blades to find what did and didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully I&#x27;m only out a few bucks.  </li>
            <li> The butterfly mechanism is rough and doesn&#x27;t close every time you turn the screw handle.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer noted, it isn&#x27;t heavy enough to allow its weight to slide it across your face, as it should.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes if I twist it a little too tight one of the sides will pop open, but as long as I am not over-turning it, no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, shaving with this razor was certainly not a pleasurable experience.</li>
            <li> If you could care less about name brand and price, as long as it gets the job done, this is the razor for you.</li>
            <li> I barely Knicked myself once.but no more than any other razor</li>
            <li> It has also a bad smell when you rinse the razor under hot water, because mid membrane which separates two doors of the razor&#x27;s head is made from a simple cast aluminum.</li>
            <li> It is regular, but not a super heavy weight razor because of aluminum weight included into product.  </li>
            <li> Hey, I had one similar to this in the past.  </li>
            <li> I use mine every other day.  </li>
            <li> And in comparison to a Mach 3 or the other cartridge razors, this may indeed be a step up.  </li>
            <li> and I still get a closer shave than any other razor I&#x27;ve used before just by switching to this style of razor.</li>
            <li> I saw a commercial that was talking about how 3 razors are not better than one.</li>
            <li> Not exactly a close shave.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll spring for a more expensive American-made quality piece of steel, rather than this rather useless piece of aluminium.</li>
            <li> Not inside that box, it even came with a small pack of 5 Derby Extra blades.</li>
            <li> However other blades did.</li>
            <li> not worth 25 cents.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> one was not worth my time.</li>
            <li> You can even go on eBay and pick up a vintage razor for under $10 that will give you a better shave than the item I am reviewing here, or any plastic piece of crap you&#x27;ll find on the shelf at the grocery store, and then pay PENNIES for the replacement blades.  </li>
            <li> It is poorly made, it doesn&#x27;t even come close to the old one I use to have.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> UPSIDE DOWN.  </li>
            <li> Edges of head&#x27;s doors of my razor are not smooth, but sharp.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and several recommended blades to compare with the current expensive razors on the market.</li>
            <li> It took a week and a half to move it across the state, and when I got the razor, it looked nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li> *edit after less than 2 months</li>
            <li> So any women looking into safety razor shaving, I&#x27;d highly recommend, it&#x27;s not as scary as it looks.</li>
            <li> Not worth even the few bucks I paid for it.</li>
            <li> this razor must not hold the blade tight because it feels like it vibrates as you stroke.  </li>
            <li> Other than that the butterfly mechanism isn&#x27;t bad and it locks the razor blade right in place</li>
            <li> You can not shave as quickly because you will nick yourself badly if you try.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, a five stat review is earned when the product exceeds expectations and little to no defects are found in the reviewer&#x27;s eye.</li>
            <li> Like expensive whiskey, once you use the current generation of razors, it&#x27;s hard to go back to the inexpensive ones.</li>
            <li> waste of your money.</li>
            <li> Heavy weight and the mechanism&lt;</li>
            <li> If you wish to shave this way go for the $20 brass heavy model on Amazon</li>
            <li> but it works well without leaving my face a BLOODY MESS like the other [more expensive]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d seen these olde timey safety razors before, but had long assumed they were obsolete relics, rendered unnecessary by affordable razors.</li>
            <li> A little slow on shipping.  </li>
            <li> you can write a small review</li>
            <li> No more disposables for me.</li>
            <li> This is not perfect, there seems to be different spacing of the blade on the two sides</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is because this is a butterfly design</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my pictures of this razor were taken away next day after I placed my review.</li>
            <li> A WASTE OF MY MONEY!  </li>
            <li> nostalgic shaver, like I remember using way back in the 40s.</li>
            <li> My beard is thick and stiff and is usually looking sloppy within six hours of shaving.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t file a complaint or return the razor because I was too eager to try DE shaving</li>
            <li> and I have at least 200</li>
            <li> Basically if you feel razor drag then you are at the wrong angle.</li>
            <li> What does this mean as a buyer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had it less than a month!!!  </li>
            <li> Arrived broken poor quality waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this to get away from the ridiculous prices of cartridge blades.</li>
            <li> and mustache areas are a little bit difficult</li>
            <li> This is NOT a good razor.</li>
            <li> At one point I saw how wide with pain and fear of cutting myself, my eyes were.</li>
            <li> The poor quality of the build has forced me to change my rating.</li>
            <li> First, throw that blade away - it&#x27;s terrible.  </li>
            <li> Poorly made.</li>
            <li> nt i get tired of this on EBAY</li>
            <li> I SO wanted to drop the multi-blade rip-off.  </li>
            <li> I was raised on those gimmickry &#x27;twin-blade&#x27; razors and got tired of the increase in cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused by the people talking about a learning curve.</li>
            <li> That would definitely be worse than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The two &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; of the butterfly don&#x27;t close in unison, the shave is painful compared to my other safety razors.  </li>
            <li> Shaved almost half of face, was bleeding bad.</li>
            <li> The combination of the razor that does not keep the blade from wobbling and dull razors make for a dangerous shave.  </li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Needless to say by the end of the shave I looked like I was in a knife fight.  </li>
            <li> However, the replacements (same brand) are giving me horrible shaves.  </li>
            <li> After 9 months the opening mechanism ceased functioning; unable to change blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried another, so I suppose I could be wrong.)  </li>
            <li> So even before using it, it had exceeded expectations, but still had room to fail me when it got to shaving time.</li>
            <li> I like it, but unfortunately had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> the razor is useless.</li>
            <li> Completely useless a razor.</li>
            <li> Very poor work in making this razor.</li>
            <li> very poorly made.</li>
            <li> All have been disappointing in terms of blade life and close shave.</li>
            <li> One last thing, the blade that comes with it, throw it away, do not use it, otherwise you will think using a safety razor is horrible because the blade that comes with it is horrible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bad, bad bad.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for, and in this case, that&#x27;s a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> Bad choice.</li>
            <li> It allows you to make mistakes and not bleed too bad from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It hurt so badly.</li>
            <li> Tried it with identical blades and preparation, still painful and nick-prone.  </li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m a girl, and didn&#x27;t buy this for my face, but for my legs, because I&#x27;m sick of razor</li>
            <li> If you buy it, you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> piece of gumball machine crap.</li>
            <li> The knob at the base of the handle screw came off&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband hated this razor.</li>
            <li> However it shaved me to close and was very painful not cuts just to close.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I tried another safety razor and it was HORRIBLE.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Easy to use great product  ****UPDATE**** I&#x27;ve been using this razor for over 2 years now and its amazing!! I&#x27;ve been getting better shaves and feel cleaner after using it rather than new razors that leave gel or soap on you face. Even more exciting I still have 4 unopened packs of derby blades that I purchased at the same time!! There were 50 blades 10 packs of 5 blades for $7. That&#x27;s 0.14 cents per blade and in over two years the cost is $4.20 for 2 years of shaving. I was spending $20 a month on replacement heads!!!</li>
            <li> I never had so man nicks and cuts until I tried this single edge blade.</li>
            <li> not what i expected/cheaply made</li>
            <li> If you were thinking about going back to or trying safety razors I highly recommend that you start with this affordable razor from Amazon.  Buy this razor with an assortment pack of razor blades and try it to see if using a safety razor is for you.  If you choose not to switch to safety razors you&#x27;ll only be out about $15-$20. If you decide that you want to switch to her safety razors then you can start looking at some nicer razors to take you through the long term.  This razor did a good job on my face, but quality wise after two weeks of use it was already rusting.  My guess is for long-term you would get about six months to one year out of it, but for a good shave as an entry-level razor I am giving it three stars. One last thing, the blade that comes with it, throw it away, do not use it, otherwise you will think using a safety razor is horrible because the blade that comes with it is horrible.</li>
            <li> Great Product!!! My Grandpa Loves it</li>
            <li> I cut my self to offen!</li>
            <li> Cheaply made. Rough Finnish. Difficulty in opening and then closing once blade is inserted. Do not trust this to use on your face. Try on your legs.</li>
            <li> This unit caused much loss of blood. So I went back to my multi-blade shavers and no blood loss.</li>
            <li> This razor is great buy for the money works great,is well balanced.I love the smooth action of replacing the blades.</li>
            <li> Poorly made. Not USA made.</li>
            <li> starting to rust and I haven&#x27;t owned it a year yet.</li>
            <li> waste of your money. ok if you want to peal your face</li>
            <li> Just what I looked for.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like the old fashioned kind. Couldn&#x27;t even get one use out of it.</li>
            <li> I found it a little light at first.After using several times finally pairing it up with Dorco ST300 Platinum Extra Double Razor Blades it shaves like a Barber!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the price. I myself am new to the DE method of shaving, and didn&#x27;t want to spent a lot in case I didn&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s a decent razor for the price, I love the long handle. But my only beef with it is that its not adjustable. So now that I&#x27;ve decided that I&#x27;m sticking with a DE, I will spend a little more and get a nicer one that&#x27;s adjustable.</li>
            <li> Wonderful old-fashion razor.  It does the job very well. My husband won&#x27;t use anything else ever. This was the type we first used.</li>
            <li> I had a razor that I had to completely take  apart to change the blade..I can open the razor part way and rinse the blade clean.blades are cheaper and last longer.the razor does not tarnish or rust</li>
            <li> Order a set of blades because the one that comes with the razor is very flimsy and not sharp</li>
            <li> Not even the least bit usable.. cheap.. plastic... practically a toy.</li>
            <li> When i grew up these were the only razors we had. I guess i just got to use to the high tech razors that are out there now. The shave is alot smoother and with this razor not as smooth.</li>
            <li> piece of gumball machine crap. not worth 25 cents.</li>
            <li> Beautytoolz is a first-rate operation.  I ordered a generic, made-in-China safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, the vendor ran short of stock and substituted a top-of-the-line, Japan-made&lt;br /&gt;Misaki safety razor which normaly sells for twice the price of the one I ordered!  Not only&lt;br /&gt;that, it arrived from the west coast to the east in 2 days for a low shipping fee.  Shop&lt;br /&gt;with confidence!  The razor itself is pretty much perfect.  Heavy weight and the mechanism&lt;br /&gt;is rock solid.  The handle is quite long, but the razor balances beautifully.  They even&lt;br /&gt;included 10 first quality blades.  Forget the junky razor that Rick Harrison is hawking&lt;br /&gt;[sorry man, I still love your TV show!] and go for a Misaki for about the same price.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> 1St the vendor was great. Emailed me right away that the razor was out of stock. They offered a replacement model and expedited shipping to make up for it. Right after replyng to their e-mail they were restocked with the one I originally wanted. Came in quickly and to my surprise is the EXACT same razor that Rick Harrison does a commercial for. Right down to same name on the blade. Better yet this one is 1/3 the price. Great vendor. Very good quality razor.</li>
            <li> A good choice travel. With it, a small bottle of shaving oil, and your favorite blades, you&#x27;re set. I gave it 4 stars because it does have a short handle and my hands are x-large, that&#x27;s not the razors fault. BTW this razor looks identical to the &#x27;One&#x27; razor that costs twice as much!</li>
            <li> Hey, I had one similar to this in the past.  This one works just as well, and is REALLY easier to clean than any of those multi-blade razors that get blocked up.</li>
            <li> The item is exactly as it was described, and works how the item should work.  Stop getting ripped off by multiple blade razors, they are not necessary</li>
            <li> But, so far so good. Just finished shaving with this razor for the first time. It gave me a close, clean and comfortable shave. So far I&#x27;m very satisfied. Great razor for the price.</li>
            <li> Used this type razor when I was in the Marines, same great razor, same great shave, the only thing I see is wrong is the handle is to short.</li>
            <li> Easy to use,clean, and has a nice weight to it. Good choice for new shaver. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I have carved up my legs with this razor.  Maybe I&#x27;ll save it for Thanksgiving and try it on the turkey.&lt;br /&gt;Bad, bad bad.</li>
            <li> The razor works as advertised.  While there might be a little looseness when it&#x27;s fully opened, as far as the &amp;#34;butterflies&amp;#34;, once closed with the blade secured, I don&#x27;t think it could be any better.  The chrome looks perfect.  The mid aluminum membrane certainly doesn&#x27;t appear to be.. aluminum. Mine looks exactly as chrome-like as the rest of the razor.  I use mine every other day.  It works.  If it breaks, I&#x27;ll buy another DE safety razor but I can&#x27;t see that happening with this one for a long while.  Frankly I think I lucked out finding this product.</li>
            <li> works good wye do we have to write a book on every review it works or it dont i get tired of this on EBAY you can write a small review&lt;br /&gt;and it works.</li>
            <li> My husband love this.  Now he can save money.  He want me to purchase one for his friends for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Very much like the older one my father use to use.  Very pleased with this.  Packaging was excellent.  A little slow on shipping.  Beats those throw away razor that was clapping my skin</li>
            <li> I get a really close shave with this razor, much closer  than the multi blade razors. I would have given it 5 stars, but the blade is not&lt;br /&gt;even on both sides. I will be upgrading to a better razor in the near future. This was a good starter safety razor.</li>
            <li> i used a double edge razor most of my adult life but it got diffacult to find blades for a while so i used throw away razors but i found this razor on amazon and bought it and it has preformed like it should. it is nice to be able to get back to a close shave and feel good doing it. love my new razor.</li>
            <li> Nice weight. Good feel. Looks good. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Feels more expensive than its cost. Would buy again, but don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be wearing this one out any time soon.</li>
            <li> Item received in fine  box thanks</li>
            <li> Started to rust after 3 weeks, buy something else. This razor is junk. Stay far away it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> the 1st razor the box lid was broke and when you opened up the razor to install a new blade it would not stay open all the way, if you was alittle shakey the top would open and close,i emailed the seller and he sent me another unit with a new box(i did not complain about the razor as it did work) the 2nd box broke after openning it 2 times,and the razor was the same shape as the 1st razor and i was told to just keep the 1st razor and box. It comes with 1 blade through it away! This is a razor that should be sold at a .99 cent store,but that is what i think,i beleave no matter what you pay for something it should work right and mine did not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. the razor does hold the blade good and tight so it does work for shaving,get some stuff to stop cuts from bleeding im a 53 year old man and i cut myself open with the 1st swipe(useing the free thin blade that came with it).</li>
            <li> The best shave I&#x27;ve ever had!  My wife says my skin is way smoother now and after figuring out how a real razor worked, I was able to make it work like a boss.  No more disposables for me.</li>
            <li> Started to show some rust where the handle connects to the head. Otherwise-Worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t believe Jeter is retiring. Class act</li>
            <li> Shold have listen to the reviews,didn&#x27;t last,hubby not at all happy purchased something else locally</li>
            <li> Wow, what a shave. This razor is attractive, light weight, sturdy and as simple a razor as you can get, and you save a ton of money. Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> As my first step into DE shaving, I picked this up off of Amazon as because it was dirt cheap but still had great reviews.  Well, I should have known, you get what you pay for!  If you look at all the 5-star reviews, they are almost entirely written by people new to using a safety razor.  And in comparison to a Mach 3 or the other cartridge razors, this may indeed be a step up.  MAYBE.. if you worked at it.  But this razor is not designed to let you use the technique that safety razors were designed to be used with: that is, NO pressure, and let the weight of the razor do the work.  This featherweight (due to the cheap aluminum construction) forces you to pull, since its weight is not enough to get through the hair, leading to tugging, irritation and cuts.  I gave it one shave and decided immediately to send it back.  True, I am new to DE shaving myself, but it&#x27;s plain as day that this thing is a piece of junk.  It feels like a happy-meal toy in the hand; no heft. I weighed it at home at 1.2oz &#x3D; 34 grams.  If you do a quick search for \\&quot;safety razors ranked by weight\\&quot;, and pull up the Badger and Blade wiki post, you will see that comes in right around the weight of the plastic crap you are trying to get AWAY from by switching to traditional shaving.  This thing is not even useful as an cheap experiment to see if you like DE shaving, since you can&#x27;t use it with proper technique.  I&#x27;ll say it again: you get what you pay for, and in this case, that&#x27;s a bad thing.  I really do hope that the guys who are reviewing this at 5-stars will soon figure out what they&#x27;re missing, because a great shave is a sensory experience that every man deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what should you get instead?  I see the Edwin Jagger DE89 listed here on Amazon for only $33!  It would be well worth it at over twice that (it&#x27;s almost universally agreed to be a great starter DE, and even some really experienced hobbiests who have tried dozens of other razors still rank it in their top 3 shavers).  There are also many Merkur&#x27;s that are very affordable in the $40-$60 range.  You can even go on eBay and pick up a vintage razor for under $10 that will give you a better shave than the item I am reviewing here, or any plastic piece of crap you&#x27;ll find on the shelf at the grocery store, and then pay PENNIES for the replacement blades.  At the same time as I ordered this, I got TWO ~1950s Gem Micromatic SE razors on eBay for under $12, shipping included, and have gotten 2 smooth, cut-free, zero-irritation shaves with them since, even though I have basically no more wet-shaving experience than I did when I tried this one, which left me bleeding and irritated.  So, lay out a little more for a decent starter razor, find out what you like, and then, if you feel like it, you can invest more in a luxury shaver down the road.  I&#x27;ve personally already decided to drop $300 on two rare high-end razors on eBay, but that&#x27;s just due to my taste, and due to a bad case of RAD :).  And if you don&#x27;t know what the abbreviation RAD stands for... I envy you.  Your journey is just beginning :).</li>
            <li> RAZOR works great so far. Going back to this type of shaving is a money savor. Should have done it years ago.</li>
            <li> This is as cheap as it comes. I went back to Mercur stainless steel straight blade. This is not what is advertised coupled with the fact that the upper portion stains easily.</li>
            <li> Works just like they did &amp;#34;way back when&amp;#34;... closer shave-less money.  Sometimes it&#x27;s just better to stick to the tried and true.</li>
            <li> This is a good safety razor for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes if I twist it a little too tight one of the sides will pop open, but as long as I am not over-turning it, no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good weight, good size and looks pretty classy too. Way better than cheap disposables or over-priced 5-bladed razors.</li>
            <li> Way too much blade exposure to shave with. If you wish to shave this way go for the $20 brass heavy model on Amazon</li>
            <li> I purchased this and several recommended blades to compare with the current expensive razors on the market. Just no comparison. The multi-blade razors all cut more smoothly with less care to avoid cuts. Yes, I practiced using this for several months before making this evaluation. I will return to the more expensive razors and save this one for emergency shaves. I also tried different prep creams and lather during this test, none significantly altered the skin drag felt by this style razor. Like expensive whiskey, once you use the current generation of razors, it&#x27;s hard to go back to the inexpensive ones.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken poor quality waste of money. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband...after two shaves he said it was a piece of junk and through it in the trash.</li>
            <li> I thought this might be ok. However it shaved me to close and was very painful not cuts just to close. I bought thinking I might save money due to cleaning of blade easily. Bad choice. However I began using a shower gel soap combination of Shea Butter and Almond Oil to shave with and the 5 blader cleans up completely. the blades last longer because they are not clogged.&lt;br /&gt;some Individuals can probably use the single blade with no problem it&#x27;s not for everybody.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use, the handles requires enormous amounts of pressure in order to be open.</li>
            <li> I tried another safety razor and it was HORRIBLE.  This is not perfect, there seems to be different spacing of the blade on the two sides but it works well without leaving my face a BLOODY MESS like the other [more expensive] razor did.  Not sure if it is because this is a butterfly design but I will keep using this.  Wish the handle was longer but it works.</li>
            <li> If you are new to this style of shaving like I was, this is not a bad razor at all to begin with. I was simply looking for something cheap to use to get used to this style of shaving before i go into buying a razor that&#x27;s more advanced and expensive. This razor gives a nice shave (then again the shave is most likely dependent upon the type of razors you purchased, I purchased 100 Wilkinson Sword blades to go with it) for a non-brand razor. The only thing in my case that I really disliked, was when I ordered the razor I thought I was going to get a brand new razor because you know, who wants a used razor, but unfortunately that was what I get it. I didn&#x27;t file a complaint or return the razor because I was too eager to try DE shaving so I just cleaned up the razor as nice as I could. I could tell it was used because it wasn&#x27;t very shiny (like someone had used it), and on the under side of it there was rusting in certain parts of it also indicating that it wasn&#x27;t a brand new razor. That was only true complaint. Other than that the butterfly mechanism isn&#x27;t bad and it locks the razor blade right in place and it doesn&#x27;t slide or anything like that. Like I said, it&#x27;s good for the price and I still get a closer shave than any other razor I&#x27;ve used before just by switching to this style of razor. If you could care less about name brand and price, as long as it gets the job done, this is the razor for you. I will probably still end up ordering another more expensive well built razor (such as Parker or Edwin Jagger that I&#x27;ve been looking into) in the future just to see if the shave is better, and also because I would like an unused razor.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the cost. I would prefer a longer handle but the use is effective.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a safety razor without going and buying something expensive and to be honest this razor is more than I expected. I expected it to be plated with stainless steel and have a cheap feeling.. This is not the case this is an excellent razor if you want to ditch the disposables but have some comfort in knowing you aren&#x27;t going to peel your skin off. It also came with unexpected items such as a travel case and two packs of blades.. I bought derby blades because they are suppose to be among the best in the industry but if you are wanting to be a real man this is a good start. I was worried about the 30 degree angle of shave and how I didn&#x27;t think I could do that but it sets the angle for you.. Before you use it though I recommend watching a YouTube video or two so you have the right idea of how to use it since it is different than disposables. Overall very pleased with the seller and fast shipping. I will purchase from them in the future.</li>
            <li> not much to say, its durrable and does what it is supposed to. and was prices right.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product it does a very good job, and my overall cost for razors will for sure go down.</li>
            <li> It was a good razor to start with. It was as described. Solid construction and I have enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> I just got this Nanjie razor in the mail so I tried it out.  Been wet shaving for about 6 months and using a Edwin Jagger DE89LBL and went through a sampler of DE blades to find what did and didn&#x27;t work for me.  Well, I tried the new razor with the blade that shipped with it, it was marked Nanjie, not a name blade.  First, throw that blade away - it&#x27;s terrible.  I started using it and after two strokes changed to a blade that worked pretty good for me.  Next thing this razor must not hold the blade tight because it feels like it vibrates as you stroke.  Needless to say by the end of the shave I looked like I was in a knife fight.  Those who say this is a good razor has never used a good razor before.  I did get a close shave but that was the first and last shave with this razor.  Thankfully I&#x27;m only out a few bucks.  If you are just starting out this razor will make you think twice about DE shaving.  Spend the bucks and get a good razor to start.</li>
            <li> I saw a commercial that was talking about how 3 razors are not better than one. I ordered this item and you know what they were right. A single blade does cut easier and better than the others. I need to order another one.</li>
            <li> Love it works good shaves to the bone,&lt;br /&gt;Takes all hair off my face and head and you can&#x27;t ask for any more then that</li>
            <li> I have searched shaving specialty stores and examined the razors drawing the conclusion that I can&#x27;t justify spending $40.00+ on a razor.  I used double edged razors 30 years ago and they were effective if unremarkable.  This razor was offered at a fair price and after using it the first time, I realized the best shave I have experienced in more than 35 years.  My beard is thick and stiff and is usually looking sloppy within six hours of shaving.  With this razor, my shave was looking good for at least 18 hours.  Very pleased with the razor.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a good razor. If you want to cut up your face, buy this.</li>
            <li> Budget device and it works great.</li>
            <li> Get this razor.  Its cheap, loads quickly and easily, heavy and good quality.  Will last a lifetime</li>
            <li> Great product. Arrive 3 days late but the quality is great. My father is so contempt with these blades, he grows thick hair fast and with these blades hes amazed that he doesnt need to shave every other day or have stubble immediately the next day.</li>
            <li> This is my first review with Amazon and I am thrilled to be able to be so positive about a product! I decided to purchase this razor after seeing Rick Harrison&#x27;s ad for the Microtouch razor, and becoming nostalgic about my very first razor--my Dad&#x27;s--long ago. I must have forgotten that they even made single blade, butterfly twist-to-open razors anymore, but I am so glad I did some research and found this one. I was a little wary given how inexpensive it was, and given some of the reviews of this kind of razor--some razor burn and some nicking, especially if you are &amp;#34;too aggressive.&amp;#34; But, for good or bad, I have never been very aggressive, so with the Dorco blades (around $5/100), I started fairly carefully, and my shaves have been smooth and very close. I typically shave after showering, with regular shaving cream, and I have loved how smooth my face and neck feel, with no nicks or cuts. The butterfly opening keeps the blade firmly in place, and the razor is heavy enough not to feel cheap, and to encourage shaving with a light touch, if that makes sense. For around $20, I now have a great razor and enough blades to last for years. As for the travel case it comes in--cheap plastic, but who cares? It holds the razor, and stays shut, which is all I need it to do. In my opinion, this a a great razor, and a great gift idea for any man in your family, especially your sons. What a great tradition to pass on to them!</li>
            <li> Very nice Razor! Very good price!</li>
            <li> Meh. Not exactly a close shave. Not a bad product, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Rust???...  and I&#x27;ve had it less than a month!!!  Would be just fine, if not for the danger in it!!</li>
            <li> I paid more for this than I wanted to because I liked the one in the picture and the seller lived in the same state, so I figured shipping would be quick. It took a week and a half to move it across the state, and when I got the razor, it looked nothing like the picture. The one shipped to me is a cheap knockoff with a black plastic handle - just what I tried to avoid. Pure bait and switch. I would avoid this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Works just like I remember the older ones worked. I save so much money by using these and they shave clearly better than even the most expensive disposable razors or electronic.</li>
            <li> gave it this rating because it to bulky on top when you use it,it seems like it does not conform  to the area that your shaving have to push harder.tried 6 other types safety razors in it had same problem</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d seen these olde timey safety razors before, but had long assumed they were obsolete relics, rendered unnecessary by affordable razors. Now that the shaver manufacturers charge over $20 for overengineered blade cartridges (anything beyond 3 blades is wasteful gimmickry--stop the madness!), and with blades of diminishing quality, I wound up using my cartridges longer than I should have, in hopes of saving money, and my face suffered for it. I figured I&#x27;d give the original safety a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine came in a plain mylar pouch, no case, and I ordered 100 replacement blades, so in all it set me back about as much as a couple of replacement magazines for my former 5-blade shaver. The old timey number has a small metal parts and at first the pointy, jagged points on it are intimidating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no lube and comfort strips on it, so you will need to make sure your face and whiskers are warm and moist, which took me a couple of days to get right. Once you do that, though, you are actually less likely to cut yourself than you would be with a cheap disposable or knock-off multiblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, I recommend washing your face as hot as you can get your water or wash cloth, start with the goatee areas under the nose, since those are the hardest areas, finish with the cheeks, which are the easiest. After the shave, douse with rubbing alcohol and finish with a lotion. I don&#x27;t use foam or cream, but use whatever works best for your skin and beard type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one has some tiny metal parts that may not last very long, but it is a good, inexpensive starter razor for those trying out the old school. I may have to upgrade to a $30+ one later, but this will do in the meantime, as long as it lasts a year or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Surprisingly easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;-Butterfly housing opens with an easy twist, blade is easy to insert/remove&lt;br /&gt;-If blade is clean and dry before you put it away, it should give you about aweeks worth of shaves&lt;br /&gt;-Very economical if the shaver can last a few years&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to get replacement blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Not great fit and finish. The knob at the base of the handle screw came off&lt;br /&gt;-You must use a different shaving technique, which takes some getting used to&lt;br /&gt;-Chin and mustache areas are a little bit difficult&lt;br /&gt;-Handle could use another inch</li>
            <li> I had forgotten how good it feels to shave!  Why did we buy double, triple and quadriple blades?  They clog up.  If the butterfly gets clogged, you simply loosen the blade and rinse!  Presto -- it&#x27;s clean, ready to continue.</li>
            <li> The original blade that came with this razor provided a great shave.  However, the replacements (same brand) are giving me horrible shaves.  The combination of the razor that does not keep the blade from wobbling and dull razors make for a dangerous shave.  Doubling up on blades helps keep the blades from moving so much. After 9 months the opening mechanism ceased functioning; unable to change blades. IT BECAME A DISPOSABLE RAZOR!</li>
            <li> Really nice, worth the price.</li>
            <li> Good Purchase!  Works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time DE shaver and I bought this as a second razor to keep in the shower and to travel with.  It is too light, and the blade it comes with is just dangerous.  Wish I had spent more...gotten more.</li>
            <li> Workmanship of this device is functional.  The two &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; of the butterfly don&#x27;t close in unison, the shave is painful compared to my other safety razors.  Tried it with identical blades and preparation, still painful and nick-prone.  For the price, I guess it&#x27;s acceptable.</li>
            <li> I guess single-blade shaving is not for me!  I SO wanted to drop the multi-blade rip-off.  Though I tried and tried, I never got used to having to toilet paper my face due to all the nicks I got from this razor and single-edge blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wish, though, is that somehow I will be able to kick the habit of a 6 blade system and the poorhouse that it will ultimately put me into.</li>
            <li> Works well for LOW price</li>
            <li> One end of the razor did not close all the way exposing too much blade angle.  Can actually see the bend in the holder.  Probably Chinese junk. Buy a better one, this one goes back.</li>
            <li> I see nothing wrong with this razor and it works perfect I barely Knicked myself once.but no more than any other razor would  it looks really great and came in really good condition .mine didn&#x27;t come with the razor blades . I ordered some persona blades  with it</li>
            <li> I recently bought this razor and shaved with it a couple times. Was it successful? Well, let&#x27;s define our terms. Sure, there wasn&#x27;t any hair left on my face. But, shaving with this razor was certainly not a pleasurable experience. I have several straight razors that I enjoy shaving with, and can do it without cutting myself. With this razor, I had numerous cuts and razor burn. The butterfly mechanism is rough and doesn&#x27;t close every time you turn the screw handle. Also, the blade sticks out a bit further on one side than on the other. But I suppose that&#x27;s what I get for buying a ten dollar razor made in Asia. The packaging itself was printed in Japanese(?). Next time I&#x27;ll spring for a more expensive American-made quality piece of steel, rather than this rather useless piece of aluminium.</li>
            <li> I bought this to get away from the ridiculous prices of cartridge blades. I&#x27;m using it as an entry level razor. It seems to work just as good as the high dollar cartridge razors, maybe even better when I relearn how to use it. It&#x27;s been thirty some years. Checked the price of blades online and I can shave for two years for the cost of a months worth of cartridges. I may step up to another razor later, but for now I&#x27;m pretty happy. By the way, no blood so far.</li>
            <li> These are the razors I have always used, any butterfly double edge shaves the best and has great control for cutting in.</li>
            <li> Not as close as some modern shaving blades, but so inexpensive to use.</li>
            <li> Spend 8-10 more get a better razor</li>
            <li> one shave and the thing started rusting</li>
            <li> Shaved almost half of face, was bleeding bad. I threw it in trash.</li>
            <li> Initially the name for this product was \\&quot;Long Handle Super Heavyweight Butterfly Open Double Edge Safety Razor\\&quot;, which was changed to actual one after my proposal as soon as I put my review and pictures. Unfortunately, my pictures of this razor were taken away next day after I placed my review. Here is a description of razor which I bought from Bristlegrass seller. It has short , but not a long handle. It is regular, but not a super heavy weight razor because of aluminum weight included into product.  Low quality gray aluminum middle membrane  instead of real good quality metal membrane covered with chrome.It has also a bad smell when you rinse the razor under hot water, because mid membrane which separates two doors of the razor&#x27;s head is made from a simple cast aluminum. Edges of head&#x27;s doors of my razor are not smooth, but sharp. Blade is not balanced well inside the razor&#x27;s head and one edge of the blade is higher than the other one. After reading all reviews and comments (view all 5 answers) for the question where the razor was made, I conclude, that different sellers sell different quality products for the same item. Unfortunately, mine razor was not the best one and came directly from China, but not from Japan as it was previously presented by seller.&lt;br /&gt;New update (February 27,2014) - after shaving with this razor about 3 months in a row I confirmed the note of other reviewers - it is started to rust internal surface of head&#x27;s doors of butterfly mechanism. That means this razor is made from a cheap regular steel material, but not made from alloy zinc, or brass covered with chrome. Comparing to my other DE razors this one does create more skin irritation too.&lt;br /&gt;My general statement is: it does not matter how cheap or how expensive is the razor, but if made from a low quality metal such as regular rusted steel and aluminum material then it is not a safety razor anymore.</li>
            <li> This product is amazingly perfect. The twist to open action works perfectly. And also it is super heavy, just what you want from a safety razor. And there is no beating the price. This feels and looks like it should cost a whole lot more.</li>
            <li> This is my first single edge razor (and I&#x27;m 59).  I was raised on those gimmickry &#x27;twin-blade&#x27; razors and got tired of the increase in cost. Went on Amazon searching and found this.  It is well balanced, operates smoothly and has been a real pleasure to use.  Since mine came WITHOUT a blade,  I needed to purchase some and I did so from my local pharmacy, where I also purchased a shaving brush with soap.  I&#x27;m shaving in real style now, ... and have yet to need a stepic pencil.  I rinse this razor in hot water when done, ... open it a bit and let it air dry ... UPSIDE DOWN.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with this razor, ... wonder why I waited so long.</li>
            <li> Being new to double edge shaving, I purchased a cheap razor to tryout.  Pleased with the results, I decided to move up to a easier to load butterfly type razor.  Every time I used it, I drew blood and needed the septic pencil, changed blades, same results.  Went back to the old cheaper razor and a clean shave without drawing blood.</li>
            <li> I amy be sending this back. It is poorly made, it doesn&#x27;t even come close to the old one I use to have.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion it is junk</li>
            <li> THIS RAZOR STARTED TO RUST TWO WEEKS AFTER I RECIEVED IT. IT IS JUNK.</li>
            <li> Exellent quality for ten bucks!</li>
            <li> Have tried all the new disposable razors--double edge, triple edge, floating head, etc. All have been disappointing in terms of blade life and close shave. Finally went back to open double edge style. I must use a light touch to avoid cuts,but I&#x27;m getting the results I wanted. Goes to show newer isn&#x27;t always better.</li>
            <li> Not a bad razor. Well constructed. Takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Just like the one I used 50+ years ago!</li>
            <li> My husband loves it.  He&#x27;s an old fashioned kind of guy and always preferred the double edge razors, like this one.  He had a Gillette one before this but one day when he dropped it on the ceramic tiled bathroom floor, it dented the edge of the shaver and the blade didn&#x27;t fit right then.  He would constantly cut his face while shaving.  We tried to replace it but couldn&#x27;t find any.  Saw a commercial on TV but was apprehensive to order it that way......you know, the commercials that say, &amp;#34;If you call within the next 10 minutes, we&#x27;ll give you 10 of these and all you pay is additional shipping&amp;#34; :-)  Well, then I figured I&#x27;d check it out on Amazon since these were obviously available somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to find this on Amazon.  Shouldn&#x27;t have surprised me since I usually luck out with Amazon.  Read the reviews and decided to order it.  Gave it to my husband as a, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s the thought that counts&amp;#34; gift for some occasion, along with the package of (I think it was) 100 razor blades that I bought at the same time on this site.  It&#x27;s everything it said it was.  It&#x27;s adjustable, works well, shaves pretty much as the old Gillette one did.  It&#x27;s lighter in weight though and that took some getting used to for him but that&#x27;s no big deal and not a negative point.  In fact, there are no negative points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those men who are like my husband and just don&#x27;t like the overly expensive new razors that are on the market or, disposable razors because none of those work the same, to you or for you, as the old fashioned double edged razor, this would be your best choice.  Believe me, my husband wouldn&#x27;t have neglected to tell me he doesn&#x27;t like it if he didn&#x27;t like it.  If you&#x27;re reading this review, then you obviously also prefer this type of razor so, go for this one.  It&#x27;s a good choice.  And, while you&#x27;re at it, but the huge discounted package of the brand name double edged razor blades.  They&#x27;re the same as the ones you can buy in a store, butat FAR less the price, here.</li>
            <li> Too short of handle an blades arent very sharp</li>
            <li> Some will note that this isn&#x27;t the greatest quality razor, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be, it&#x27;s a great way to get started in wet shaving. The convenient butterfly model will easily last long enough for you to see if it&#x27;s for you.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.  I bought it for my husband and he said he loves it.  It is easy to use and change the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to a friend.  Very good value.</li>
            <li> Good razor for the price, operates smoothly.  Took a couple of shaves to adjust and I discovered that shaving soap and a brush is infinitely better than canned foam.  The only gripe I have is that one edge of one of the doors doesn&#x27;t close evenly.  Holds the blade  securely enough but it just messes with my OCD a little.  I&#x27;d buy another one and I would recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time and works fine, I like the butterfly operation, my previous razor requires some disassembly for replacing the blade. This razor is a little heavier and the guide allows for easier use without as much concern for nicking. The closeness of the shave cannot be matched by any multiblade shaver, after many years of using multiblades I am going back to the single blade razor and I recommend this shaver over the previous shaver I bought although it too is good but requires more finesse to prevent nicking. Buy the 100 pack of Wilkinson Sword Double Edge Safety Razor Blades  and this razor to be set for shaving comfort for a long time. Also, I&#x27;ve been buying a shaving soap from Walmart made by Van Der Hagen called Scented Luxury Shave Soap which works nice for shaving, the scent isn&#x27;t too heavy and it seems to have a good amount of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Very happy. Just  as described. It took a while for my skin to get accustomed to the blade.  Once it did it gave me a great shave. It is very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s efficient and cost effective over the use of disposals , with the added bonus , its easy to clean</li>
            <li> I use this as a backup to the multi-blade razors I have used and continue to use.  Remember you must go a great deal slower when shaving with a single blade. You can not shave as quickly because you will nick yourself badly if you try.  However I love the challenge and feel of shaving with the double edge safety razor.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try using a safety razor without spending $50 or more on gear--took a chance on this razor and it&#x27;s fantastic (as far as I know.  I&#x27;ve never tried another, so I suppose I could be wrong.)  It&#x27;s nice and hefty, glides nicely across the skin and is easy to maneuver around tricky areas.  I&#x27;m a woman, so my tricky areas are ankles and elbows--the nice long handle is very helpful for me.  All in all, a great experience.  I just bought a backup, since I wouldn&#x27;t know where to get another if Amazon sells out.</li>
            <li> Works good. I think I would like one with a little longer of a handle, but this one has a nice feel and works fine.</li>
            <li> Cheaply built easy to cut yourself&lt;br /&gt;Better off paying a little more&lt;br /&gt;This went into the trash&lt;br /&gt;Really a piece of junk</li>
            <li> Nothing unexpected which is the surprise. Simple workings,  Direct function proven design and I am finding the weight in hand works for me.</li>
            <li> Spend your money elsewhere. Threw it away after two weeks of trying to get a decent shave. Rust throughout the upper assembly. JUNK</li>
            <li> Works just need to get quality blades and you are good to go.  I recommend to try it and you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> If you can use a straight razor there&#x27;s a two second learning curve. Holds the blade just like Papaw had.</li>
            <li> This razor does work and appears as advertised, but it&#x27;s too light to work the way double edge razors are made to work.  So the low rating is for the product, not the person selling.  I have no issues with the seller.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor and it is not too shabby. My only problem with it is after three weeks of use the top has begun to rust (which other reviews have mentioned as well). The handle is a little short too. But otherwise it provides a great shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*&lt;br /&gt;The rust spots found appear to be from the blade that came with the razor. I purchased new blades and it is working amazingly. Updating to 5 stars from 4</li>
            <li> Old school safe, to use would recommend.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This razor is well built and should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused by the people talking about a learning curve. Guess they&#x27;ve been using electrics they&#x27;re whole lives. My face was smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt and not a drop of blood first time. The short handle takes a little getting used to. Why did I let them rip me off for over priced blades all this time? Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Razor is almost exactly what I wa expecting. I have large hands, so I wish the handle was a little longer, but I am satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li> I began shaving again after forty years. This razor was inexpensive but performs like razors that cost so much more.</li>
            <li> Got this for 13$ with free shipping. I can say this it takes a lot longer to shave, but I will never go back to modern razors. I have used everything from 2 to 5 blades and still got irritation. This is not even mentioning the cost of those 5 blades...man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this and Dorco ST301 platinum Extra Double Edge razor blades. They work better than anything I have shaved with before. 18$ and I have at least 200+ shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a learning curve to use the properly. If done correctly you wont get any nicks or irritation. Basically if you feel razor drag then you are at the wrong angle. You should be able to glide right through hair without it pulling any. I also advise a good shave oil. It allows you to make mistakes and not bleed too bad from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid construction. If mine breaks I will definitely be buying another. Got my package 2 days after ordering!!!</li>
            <li> I was curious to find out how an item i had used many years back would compare to the present choices. Must admit modern technology wins. However , quality and good looks are there, nice piece to have in your drawer</li>
            <li> just as described in stainless steal blade doesnt wobble recomend it</li>
            <li> BEST RAZOR EVER.  This is the way I learned how to shave, not with a bunch of blades that clog up all the time.  With this razor I just loosen the blade, rinse it off, and viola, no clogs and a nice clean shave with only one blade.  The entire head and face after a month of no shaves.  ONLY ONE BLADE, AND STILL BEING USED.  I BOUGHT 100 BLADES FROM THE WEB FOR ONLY 13 BUCKS.  Now thats the way to save money.</li>
            <li> As a noob to DE shaving, I can&#x27;t say that I could compare this razor to a higher end one, because I bought this one for the purpose of trying my hand at this type of shaving. In my opinion, a five stat review is earned when the product exceeds expectations and little to no defects are found in the reviewer&#x27;s eye. I got this not expecting more than the razor itself in a cardboard box, but it actually came in a little blue holding box with a mirror on it, and a single not-known-to-me brand of DE blade. Not inside that box, it even came with a small pack of 5 Derby Extra blades. The only flaw being that when I got it, it was a little dented on the top, and I mean a very small dent. I didn&#x27;t care about this though, and neither should you, because if you&#x27;re buying a razor for show and not practicality, you better invest in a more expensive one. It also has the brand&#x27;s logo, which is in possibly Japanese, but I wouldn&#x27;t know, engraved on the top near the dent. But again, I didn&#x27;t care much about the razor&#x27;s looks, especially for the price. So even before using it, it had exceeded expectations, but still had room to fail me when it got to shaving time. Now, I&#x27;m a girl, and didn&#x27;t buy this for my face, but for my legs, because I&#x27;m sick of razor burn and wasting money on quick to clog and dull razors. So, I popped in a Derby blade with the butterfly open top (which worked totally fine), and got to shaving for the first time, ever so carefully, with a safety razor. The razor itself has a very nice heavy feel to it, which allowed me drag, with the smallest amount of press, the razor and have it get all hair without a second run by. So any women looking into safety razor shaving, I&#x27;d highly recommend, it&#x27;s not as scary as it looks. I shaved completely with only one little nick by my ankle (but in all honesty, I do that on occasion with a normal razor). All in all, for less than $10, this razor has good weight, is nicely built, and gave me a good shave and free blades I wasn&#x27;t expecting to get. I might not even step up to a more expensive one, this one works fine.</li>
            <li> Very nice butterfly opening Razer.....ditched disposable forever</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t close properly. Blade is sticking out on one side which will cut your face. Glade  that I checked it before I shaved. I will not use this razor. Very poor work in making this razor.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT GRAB BLADES SECURELY!  MY SCRAP0ES MAY NOT LEAVE SCARS!!!!!  A WASTE OF MY MONEY!  IT WAS THROWN AWAY AFTER ONE SWIPE!</li>
            <li> I rated this 2 stars because 1 star is the lowest option available, and I can imagine a worse safety razor. Maybe some all-plastic thing that is 100% a child&#x27;s toy, but still accepts razor blades. That would definitely be worse than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this is NOT a full-size razor. It&#x27;s a mini razor, and it&#x27;s a little more than half the size of a full-sized razor. No, it doesn&#x27;t say that anywhere in the listing, but it&#x27;s true.Furthermore, it is NOT nearly as heavy  as it should be, as a mini razor. As another reviewer noted, it isn&#x27;t heavy enough to allow its weight to slide it across your face, as it should. You&#x27;re going to have to pull it, and apply A LOT of pressure if you want it to cut anything at all (compared to the pressure you should have to use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tl;DR -or- What does this mean as a buyer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this razor if you want to, but be warned, it will not give you a shaving experience that is anything at all like a safety razor should. If you want a decent shaving experience, buy a standard, long-handled razor, and expect to pay $15-20 for it. You might get a better shave if you spend more than that, but that should be enough to beat any of those3, 4, 5, 17, or however-many bladed razors you see at the supermarket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor, however, is not. It does work, but only barely. If you buy it, you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Blade that came with razor did not give comfortable shave. However other blades did.</li>
            <li> Came damage and it is just a cheap piece of junk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK says it all, it meets the minimum standard I was looking for.</li>
            <li> My husband hated this razor. He cut himself often and he did not feel like it was a good shave.</li>
            <li> Rust spots appeared within a month....</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND SEEMS TO REALLY LIKE THEM.</li>
            <li> Not worth even the few bucks I paid for it. This was a what-the-heck, how-bad-could-it-be? cheap-o &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; to My Cart when purchasing a different brand razor.  I am not new to safety razor shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may just be a one-off Chinese factory defect (or, maybe not according to some of the other reviews) but the blade does not seat securely in the shaver and moves around while shaving.  That equals pulls and nicks.  I tried varying the tightness of the handle and I also tried different blades than the ones that came with the razor and the results were the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one was not worth my time.</li>
            <li> very poorly made. Used it once and trashed it.</li>
            <li> Handle could be a bit longer for larger hands.</li>
            <li> The razor is good for the money</li>
            <li> I like it, but unfortunately had to stop using it. Kept getting cut, no matter how slow or gentle I was. Skin is too soft, I think.</li>
            <li> * edit at bottom.  I was ready to flame this razor after my first shave. It hurt so badly. At one point I saw how wide with pain and fear of cutting myself, my eyes were. I stopped shaving and laughed. I was going to chuck it the trash, glad I didn&#x27;t. I read one if the questions about altering the angle of the blade. The answer is you can&#x27;t. Then it read that it&#x27;s a great razor, but needs a different blade. I swapped out the blade it came with to one of my Astra blades and that changed everything. Easy smooth shave.  *edit after less than 2 months the razor is useless. One of the corners has come apart. Completely useless a razor. The poor quality of the build has forced me to change my rating.</li>
            <li> nostalgic shaver, like I remember using way back in the 40s. still an excellent and economical shave</li>
            <li> It is a piece of junk. I would rather shave with a hand saw from my work shop!!!!</li>
            <li> The best shave I have had in years!</li>
