            <li> Since I was a little girl....</li>
            <li> I usually get the SSS insect repellant</li>
            <li> when i didnt use it i was gnawed on by the creepy crawlers and flying beasties-ick.</li>

            <li> Avon Skin So Soft products is so great that I remember my mom used it on me as a young child. It smelled so good that I would love it when I got up to go to school the next morning feeling rested. I love this shower gel that I ordered two more bottles.</li>
            <li> Love this shower gel.  It leaves such a clean, fresh feeling and smell.  For my money, its the best out there.</li>
            <li> I have used Avon&#x27;s Skin So Soft shower Gel for several years and absolutely love it!  The fragrance is heavenly and it cleanses the skin without drying it out.  I hope they NEVER discontinue this product...don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do.  They&#x27;ve added one or two other fragrances in this shower gel line, but the original moisturizing gel is the most sensuous fragrance.</li>
            <li> This shower gel is pleasant. It lathers up nicely and is light in a fragrance. It was not expensive for the quality that it provides.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product. Takes all dry skin worries away. Price is excellent. Bottle top broke when it fell in the shower. There&#x27;s got to be a better way to package.</li>
            <li> This product is adequate for quick showers but it was not as gentle as I thought it would be. I love the skin so soft body oil and use it regularly but will not purchase the shower gel again.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the Avon Skin So soft moisturizing shower gel; it has a light fragrance that last&lt;br /&gt;throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the bottle isn&#x27;t bigger but I love the smell and it does make my skin softer.</li>
            <li> Feels great &amp; makes the shower smell wonderful.  Have used the skin so soft spray for years to moisturize after a shower.</li>
            <li> I really prefer my body wash to have a little more sudsing action. This one was just a little bit too much on the thin and watery side, for my taste.</li>
            <li> Whenever I go somewhere that I think I may need some mosquito repellant, I shower with Skin So Soft. I usually get the SSS insect repellant so I layer them, I haven&#x27;t been bitten.  Since I don&#x27;t want to slather sticky and ill-smelling repellants, this works best, it works for me.</li>
            <li> keeps the skin soft... and the bugs away. who knew. nice scent and great hanging packaging... the lid leaks a bit, but you don&#x27;t have to keep it in that container.</li>
            <li> what can you say about skin so soft it is awesome wife loves it smells great fast shipping well packaged better to buy this way more ounces for you money.</li>
            <li> I use this shower gel all year long.  It&#x27;s great in the summer for a fresh smell and it keeps bugs away when we are at horse shows and out late at night.  I have dry skin and in the winter this is great for dry skin.  I use the SOS lotion along with this and my skin is never dry.  I love this product and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this skin so soft shower gel would do the same as their other skin so soft in keeping the mosquitos away. It does! I was not sure after rinsing it off and toweling dry, but no worries it works great! Normally my husband says he knows the mosquitos bypass him and go for me so he knows if I am around he won&#x27;t get bit. Not anymore, lol.  I offered him a container of my gel but he turned me down, ( ah well all for me )&lt;br /&gt;Love not getting bit!!!!</li>
            <li> I keep this in our RV shower.  Hopefully the scent will help prevent bug bites.  Use this with the oil and lotion, can always reach for the deet but would prefer to skip the chemicals until needed.</li>
            <li> living in bug heaven aka arizona- bugs galore- it kept the nasties off me- when i didnt use it i was gnawed on by the creepy crawlers and flying beasties-ick.</li>
            <li> Since I was a little girl.... I&#x27;ve loved the smell of AVON&#x27;s SSS.  This is delicious and smooth and hangs nicely in the shower on the towel rack.</li>
            <li> I live in SW Georgia.  I use this in the summer along with Skin So Soft oil to keep the gnats &amp; Mosquitos off.  It works!</li>
            <li> Skin So Soft has been around so long and I always only liked the smell of this product.  I started using it as it was supposed to discourage mosquitos but it smells so good as a shower gel I am enjoying it.  I will look for the moisturizing stick as  cant take perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to ad a PS as there is not a spot on the site to tell about experiences with Amazon they have been so nice and easy to talk with and very helpful.  Even if there is a problem with the other seller they help work things out and that is so much appreciated.  They offer such a wide range of products that it makes it possible to buy almost exclusively through them.  Some times I notice the price is very good and sometimes it is just what you can get anywhere else but still I love what Amazon does and their extreme kindness to customers.  CAD</li>
            <li> I have always really liked Avon products, my aunt used them religiously. The original scent is my favorite and it truly does leave your skin feeling amazing.</li>

            <li> I use this before I go to outdoor events because I seem to not have as much problems with mosquitos and ticks, plus I get soft skin and the product smells better than most bug sprays. Works well as a shampoo. A friend uses this on her horses and uses the bath oil as well to keep the horse flies away.</li>
            <li> Great shower gel with the benefit of also acting as insect repellent - would like to see it in a larger size.</li>
            <li> not worth the money -- seems to dry out my skin and doesn&#x27;t smell very good -- will not try this gel again</li>
