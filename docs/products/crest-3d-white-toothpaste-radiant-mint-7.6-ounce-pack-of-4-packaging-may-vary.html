            <li>but i shop amazon for the best price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s excellent for whitening, no doubt.  </li>
            <li>this wasn&#x27;t the best idea.  </li>
            <li>( My dental hygienist and dentist are both impressed with the results.)</li>
            <li>Amazon had the best price for a multi-pack.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I picked up a tube of Crest 3D toothpaste on a whim and am totally impressed.  </li>
            <li>Great buy!</li>
            <li>Works awesome with whitening.</li>
            <li>Best with crest toothbrush</li>
            <li>Wonderful price for this toothpaste!!  </li>
            <li>So happy with it that I signed up for the subscribe &amp; save program !</li>
            <li>The taste and consistency of the toothpaste is very good.</li>
            <li>It tastes great, makes my teeth shine, and tastes great!  </li>
            <li>The product works great tho no complaints about the product.</li>
            <li>It will make your teeth whiter, and it has a great minty flavor.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to purchase the mouthwash and strips that go with the toothpaste because I am so happy with the toothpaste alone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product to use IN ADDITION to your whitening regimen.  </li>
            <li>You also have to be committed to brushing well three times a day to see really great results.    </li>
            <li>The service is great.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste did a great job at whitening my teeth; however, I just couldn&#x27;t get used to the taste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product with amazing results!  </li>
            <li>Seems like others have had good whitening results, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li>The good.</li>
            <li>It does taste good for both adults and kids.  </li>
            <li>(yup the government told you that Sodium fluoride was GOOD for you, remember?)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the patience to use strips or trays, and I&#x27;ve been using SuperSmile, which works fairly well.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the Crest product through Amazon three weeks ago and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>The subscribe and save price is an amazing deal.</li>
            <li>a nice taste&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest</li>
            <li>I use the 3D mouth wash with much better results.  </li>
            <li>It whitens better than any OTC product I have used.  </li>
            <li>and I got even better results.    </li>
            <li>It sits at 260, 4th most abrasive toothpaste known to exist...</li>
            <li>They said what I ordered was in stock and 2) they never asked if it was OK to change my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the best whitening toothpaste I&#x27;ve found - better than Colgate Optic White, IMHO.  </li>
            <li>I drink a lot of coffee and tea and have experimented with many tooth whitening products.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite toothpaste and buying in stock like this saves me a ton.</li>
            <li>Finding it in the larger size, though, was the best thing since sliced bread!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a smoker but have drank colas for many years and since I&#x27;ve started using it everybody keeps asking if I&#x27;ve had my teeth whitened.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a year now.</li>
            <li>but then your teeth get used to it and will love you for it.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t regret it. :]</li>
            <li>bigger set of these are awesome</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I bought this a week ago I&#x27;m unbelievably pleased with the whitening results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very smooth toothpaste, easy to brush with.  </li>
            <li>Crest does a pretty good job though.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, higher stars if it were cheaper</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen results very quickly.</li>
            <li>but the peppermint is too strong.  </li>
            <li>we were very pleased with both the speed of the shipping (very timely) and the product itself.  </li>
            <li>It really did a fine job of whitening my teeth, and I was very pleased with that.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste works fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD&lt;br /&gt;- available on Subscribe &amp; Save, buy in bulk and never run out&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying the Colgate Optic White instead and had great results.</li>
            <li>I try to take very good care of my teeth, due to the fact that I haven&#x27;t been to a dentist since I was about 5 or 6</li>
            <li>It has a fresh minty taste without being too minty hot, and helps keep my smile bright.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel smooth and clean, and began looking whiter after just a couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth a try!</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is good and comparable to most other forms of Crest.</li>
            <li>That way I have sparkly bright white teeth throughout the day but no aches or pains anymore.</li>
            <li>*0 being the least threat and 4 being the greatest threat</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong the first couple uses</li>
            <li>I love buying in bulk, and this is such a great price, especially for prime members.</li>
            <li>The tube for Crest 3D is huge and very generous.</li>
            <li>but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>I noticed results within 5 days of having this toothpaste, and 14 days in as they recommend, it looks to me more like a professional whiting job.  </li>
            <li>This tastes better than those sensitive toothpastes, too.  </li>
            <li>I think I have seen more results than many other people because of how I use it.</li>
            <li>saw results pretty quickly (3 or 4 days), and have continued to see whitening effects for my teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the cheapest toothpaste out there, but it&#x27;s worth the higher price tag.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I brush, spit, and then apply a little more toothpaste to the front of the teeth just to be sure it keeps whitening.</li>
            <li>I gave this toothpaste 4 stars because it truly does do as advertised - significantly whitens teeth in a decent amount of time - however if you are already experiencing any tooth sensitivity at all, I STRONGLY advise you to stay FAR away from this.</li>
            <li>Since then, been using consistently for about a month.</li>
            <li>I saw results with this toothpaste after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I said, do be aware that this isn&#x27;t \\&quot;3D</li>
            <li>If you look on the box, the directions say that if you ingest more than a pea sized amount to seek medical attention.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically this toothpaste is supposed to whiten teeth but at the same time it&#x27;ll literally eat away the most dentin/enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so my teeth get stains I use this product more to prevent further staining then to make my teeth whiter yet even with my soda drinking the product does make my teeth whiter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The longer you use it the better the results will be and it will maintain white teeth.</li>
            <li>I love this Crest 3d White Toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>Refreshing and actually whitens.</li>
            <li>Even my own breath blowing on my teeth is sending shivers down my spine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that I have very sensitive teeth/gums</li>
            <li>It is a nice gel with little crystals in the paste...</li>
            <li>so I could compare and see how different they look --- huge difference now.  </li>
            <li>Its not to much</li>
            <li>but in a couple weeks,  you should see some real progress.</li>
            <li>I really had no desire to whiten my teeth when I bought this toothpaste (even though I really needed it.)  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended by me!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this toothpaste for a while now, and it really does whiten.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it - it works!</li>
            <li>Going back to the Crest ProHealth Clean Mint.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of toothpastes on the market that claims to aid in the process of keeping your smile a nice pearl white color, but few live up to the claim.</li>
            <li>though it isn&#x27;t the \\&quot;3D\\&quot; level of whitening, it is decent</li>
            <li>Decent toothpaste but way overpriced.  </li>
            <li>For me it really keeps your teeth white and breath fresh.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe I will go through so many in such a short time!</li>
            <li>and I still highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothpaste if whitening is your goal.</li>
            <li>It is caustic and has caused significant adverse reactions, to include lip swelling (looking a lot like Charo these days), reddening (more like purpling), and numbness.</li>
            <li>The whitening action is thorough and much faster than with SuperSmile, and it&#x27;s about 90% cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I switched to a normal toothpaste maybe two-three nights during that period.....</li>
            <li>it is NOT good for you, get fluoride free toothpaste instead (completely fluoride free,</li>
            <li>Thought it was an anomaly, but used a new brush and it occurred again.</li>
            <li>quite live up to their hype.  </li>
            <li>well until I get my new toothpaste in the mail.</li>
            <li>I love the product just pretty disappointed that I bought so many</li>
            <li>, not I haven&#x27;t noticed that it has made my teeth any more white than other brands.</li>
            <li>The mint flavor is strong and burns a little bit</li>
            <li>had the tendency initially to leave my teeth feeling pretty sensitive, but after a week or two of use that problem faded away.</li>
            <li>her remark was &amp;#34;really, because your teeth are in the range that we go for when we do the professional whitening.&amp;#34;  I drink tons of coffee all day, I also drink red wine and this toothpaste seems to counteract those stains pretty well.  </li>
            <li>My results are based on natural tooth surfaces (no caps or anything) stained by coffee and wine.</li>
            <li>It really cleans and I believe it does actually do some whitening, I am using it with an Oral B toothbrush (electric)&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>but after eating and stuff they wont really stay white.</li>
            <li>It really does what it promises: my teeth are naturally white.</li>
            <li>They stay so white regardless of what you eat or how much coffee you drink.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 25, come from a very low-income home, never had health insurance, and currently have a minimum wage job),</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste for it&#x27;s cleaning properties and taste and last time I went to the Dentist</li>
            <li>repeated use does leave your smile noticeably brighter, even if not used in conjunction with other Crest whitening products</li>
            <li>The chemical fire diamond, a widely used method for identifying hazardous materials  rates Sodium Fluoride as a 3/0/0 Health (blue) Flammability (red) and Reactivity (yellow) respectively</li>
            <li>it is a little too sweet for</li>
            <li>Of all the various toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried, this Crest 3D really maintains white teeth.  </li>
            <li>In a nutshell, here&#x27;s what I thought of the Crest 3D White Vivid</li>
            <li>Of course we use Vivid White anyway.  </li>
            <li>B004VGSVHS Crest 3D White Vivid Anticavity Toothpaste]].</li>
            <li>It does clean with a fresh taste, but I was not impressed with the whitening at all.  </li>
            <li>I usually only brush my teeth for about 40 seconds and not vigorously, but after seeing these results, I spent a little more time brushing</li>
            <li>but I do like the feel and scent and the brand Crest in general.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that it would help much with very yellow teeth without some type of other professional intervention.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised to see how much my teeth whitened within a few days of using this.  </li>
            <li>It has caused gum burns and general oral tissue sloughing, especially in the front.</li>
            <li>Oddly, it also seems to cause the toothbrush bristles to become stiff after first use, too, which any dentist will tell you is not good for healthy oral hygiene.</li>

            <li> I love this Crest 3d White Toothpaste!  </li>
            <li> Refreshing and actually whitens.</li>
            <li> Even my own breath blowing on my teeth is sending shivers down my spine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that I have very sensitive teeth/gums</li>
            <li> It is a nice gel with little crystals in the paste...</li>
            <li> so I could compare and see how different they look --- huge difference now.  </li>
            <li> Its not to much</li>
            <li> but in a couple weeks,  you should see some real progress.</li>
            <li> I really had no desire to whiten my teeth when I bought this toothpaste (even though I really needed it.)  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended by me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothpaste for a while now, and it really does whiten.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it - it works!</li>
            <li> Going back to the Crest ProHealth Clean Mint.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of toothpastes on the market that claims to aid in the process of keeping your smile a nice pearl white color, but few live up to the claim.</li>
            <li> though it isn&#x27;t the \\&quot;3D\\&quot; level of whitening, it is decent</li>
            <li> Decent toothpaste but way overpriced.  </li>
            <li> For me it really keeps your teeth white and breath fresh.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe I will go through so many in such a short time!</li>
            <li> and I still highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothpaste if whitening is your goal.</li>
            <li> It is caustic and has caused significant adverse reactions, to include lip swelling (looking a lot like Charo these days), reddening (more like purpling), and numbness.</li>
            <li> The whitening action is thorough and much faster than with SuperSmile, and it&#x27;s about 90% cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I switched to a normal toothpaste maybe two-three nights during that period.....</li>
            <li> it is NOT good for you, get fluoride free toothpaste instead (completely fluoride free,</li>
            <li> Thought it was an anomaly, but used a new brush and it occurred again.</li>
            <li> quite live up to their hype.  </li>
            <li> well until I get my new toothpaste in the mail.</li>
            <li> I love the product just pretty disappointed that I bought so many</li>
            <li> , not I haven&#x27;t noticed that it has made my teeth any more white than other brands.</li>
            <li> The mint flavor is strong and burns a little bit</li>
            <li> had the tendency initially to leave my teeth feeling pretty sensitive, but after a week or two of use that problem faded away.</li>
            <li> her remark was &amp;#34;really, because your teeth are in the range that we go for when we do the professional whitening.&amp;#34;  I drink tons of coffee all day, I also drink red wine and this toothpaste seems to counteract those stains pretty well.  </li>
            <li> My results are based on natural tooth surfaces (no caps or anything) stained by coffee and wine.</li>
            <li> It really cleans and I believe it does actually do some whitening, I am using it with an Oral B toothbrush (electric)&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> but after eating and stuff they wont really stay white.</li>
            <li> It really does what it promises: my teeth are naturally white.</li>
            <li> They stay so white regardless of what you eat or how much coffee you drink.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 25, come from a very low-income home, never had health insurance, and currently have a minimum wage job),</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste for it&#x27;s cleaning properties and taste and last time I went to the Dentist</li>
            <li> repeated use does leave your smile noticeably brighter, even if not used in conjunction with other Crest whitening products</li>
            <li> The chemical fire diamond, a widely used method for identifying hazardous materials  rates Sodium Fluoride as a 3/0/0 Health (blue) Flammability (red) and Reactivity (yellow) respectively</li>
            <li> it is a little too sweet for</li>
            <li> Of all the various toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried, this Crest 3D really maintains white teeth.  </li>
            <li> In a nutshell, here&#x27;s what I thought of the Crest 3D White Vivid</li>
            <li> Of course we use Vivid White anyway.  </li>
            <li> B004VGSVHS Crest 3D White Vivid Anticavity Toothpaste]].</li>
            <li> It does clean with a fresh taste, but I was not impressed with the whitening at all.  </li>
            <li> I usually only brush my teeth for about 40 seconds and not vigorously, but after seeing these results, I spent a little more time brushing</li>
            <li> but I do like the feel and scent and the brand Crest in general.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that it would help much with very yellow teeth without some type of other professional intervention.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised to see how much my teeth whitened within a few days of using this.  </li>
            <li> It has caused gum burns and general oral tissue sloughing, especially in the front.</li>
            <li> Oddly, it also seems to cause the toothbrush bristles to become stiff after first use, too, which any dentist will tell you is not good for healthy oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> I know there are other people that complain about the side effect of sensitivity, but this toothpaste has never made my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s enough toothpaste to last a LONG time...</li>
            <li> only drawback I&#x27;ve found is that regular use makes my teeth a little sensitive.  </li>
            <li> My vanity can be set on the back burner any day, as long as I never have to feel like this again.</li>
            <li> I have tried other whitening toothpastes, trays and strips that were more expensive and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It took awhile to rule out other causes, to pinpoint the Crest 3D White products.</li>
            <li> The taste is no different than other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste works very well, but be careful and don&#x27;t brush too hard with it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not really as above the average toothpaste as it claims to be.&lt;br /&gt;-Maybe</li>
            <li> Using the paste in the way I have described has similar results with almost no greater effort than regular brushing.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just looking for a gradual, small change from your teeth&#x27;s current color, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> so damn much gets exhausting.</li>
            <li> (there is no real reason this would be a \\&quot;premium\\&quot; priced toothpaste).</li>
            <li> One drawback, I&#x27;ve also noticed that my bathroom towels have become bleached in spots where they&#x27;ve come in contact with toothpaste residue, so be careful of your linens around this product.</li>
            <li> And it was not easy to make them like that because I have a yellow enamel.</li>
            <li> Category 3 health risk chemicals are fatally toxic and according to this classification \\&quot;Short exposure could cause serious temporary or moderate residual injury\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I would recommend Arm and Hammer Extreme Whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m simply brushing my teeth as I usually do and still getting results.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use any of the other products they recommend, just the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think it has the \\&quot;stannous flouride\\&quot; that the other crest pro health toothpastes have in it.  </li>
            <li> this is shallow but the name sounds so dumb, especially when said fast.</li>
            <li> I recommend the toothpaste highly for whitening, but if you have bad or sensitive spots, please use cautiously, and don&#x27;t use with an electric.</li>
            <li> I try to get a lot of fluids before brushing, especially any coffee or tea, so I won&#x27;t need to drink anything for at least a couple hours after brushing.</li>
            <li> and the hygienist made a few remarks about how rough the surfaces of my teeth had become.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my being tired of the 3D fad in general, but hearing the term \\&quot;3D\\&quot; get thrown around</li>
            <li> the traditional toothpaste tube design means it can be difficult to get the last few drops out</li>
            <li> The weren&#x27;t horribly stained - but had that gross yellow tint to them,  and my two front teeth had two yellow stains near the tops.</li>
            <li> You may notice a little residue but if it&#x27;s there then it&#x27;s making your teeth whiter</li>
            <li> I used this product for a little over two weeks.</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of coffee and had noticed that me teeth were looking a little stained.</li>
            <li> would definitely give Crest 3D White a try, its much less annoying than white strips!</li>
            <li> Not too heavy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been hours now, and the pain is still excruciating, to the point of crying on bathroom floor.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few toothpastes I can use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- works pretty well without leaving a bad taste in your mouth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this whitening tooth paste for the past few years.  </li>
            <li> I bought this and have been using it for the past two weeks.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if there is a whitener in this toothpaste, I should probably check.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and can&#x27;t do cold stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have used white strips before and don&#x27;t like them because they are inconvenient to wear for a half hour twice a day</li>
            <li> I also found out that if I&#x27;ve eaten something that irritates my teeth that I can use this toothpaste with some baking soda (I dip my toothbrush in the baking soda) and my teeth aren&#x27;t so hard to brush.</li>
            <li> It happened slowly, culminating tonight.</li>
            <li> I got to a point where i hated brushing because it was too much.  </li>
            <li> I recently decided to give up eating sugar,  after spending the majority of my youth being a junk food addict - and unfortunately my teeth had taken a beating from my bad habits.       </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not enough to be really annoying</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s not good for you either!)</li>
            <li> Hey it&#x27;s not as bad as when \\&quot;HD\\&quot; was in every product name, at least.</li>
            <li> I would still be unhappy since 1)</li>
            <li> The drawbacks to SuperSmile are that it&#x27;s very expensive for toothpaste, you have to mix two products and you have to brush your teeth for two minutes at a time.  </li>
            <li> The bad.</li>
            <li> Just found out this has a bad RDA rating, beyond FDA(200) recommended limit and ADA(250) recommended limit.</li>
            <li> At times it&#x27;s downright painful.  </li>
            <li> Try it for yourself, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed in the results.</li>
            <li> Now there are heaps of scientific literature that say that it is devastatingly toxic.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> i found out that i am over paying for my paste, i noticed it is always on sale around me and when i did the math im am over paying by 2 dollars. Its not to much but i shop amazon for the best price. The product works great tho no complaints about the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this and have been using it for the past two weeks. It has noticeably whitened my teeth. My smile went from below average to above average. I think I have seen more results than many other people because of how I use it. The key is to spit after brushing and to wipe off the mouth but not rinse out the mouth in any way. If you rinse it out of your mouth then it won&#x27;t keep whitening after you brush. I try to get a lot of fluids before brushing, especially any coffee or tea, so I won&#x27;t need to drink anything for at least a couple hours after brushing. Sometimes I brush, spit, and then apply a little more toothpaste to the front of the teeth just to be sure it keeps whitening. You may notice a little residue but if it&#x27;s there then it&#x27;s making your teeth whiter and that&#x27;s the point.     I have used white strips before and don&#x27;t like them because they are inconvenient to wear for a half hour twice a day and they actually hurt my teeth. They makes them ultra-sensitive. Using the paste in the way I have described has similar results with almost no greater effort than regular brushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a year or so, and I get compliments all the time on my pearly whites. It&#x27;s not the cheapest toothpaste out there, but it&#x27;s worth the higher price tag. It will make your teeth whiter, and it has a great minty flavor. I know there are other people that complain about the side effect of sensitivity, but this toothpaste has never made my teeth sensitive. Try it for yourself, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed in the results.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to give up eating sugar,  after spending the majority of my youth being a junk food addict - and unfortunately my teeth had taken a beating from my bad habits.       The weren&#x27;t horribly stained - but had that gross yellow tint to them,  and my two front teeth had two yellow stains near the tops. So I decided to start trying different products, to see if I could get them white again - and after seeing a commercial for this one, I gave it a shot.      It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks now, and I can defiantly see a difference. I actually took a before picture of my teeth so I could compare and see how different they look --- huge difference now.  So now that I know it works, I&#x27;m going to keep on using it and also start doing some spot treatments with whitening gel to get rid of those places that are being stubborn.        Over all though,  this toothpaste is defiantly working for me.   You have to keep at it,  don&#x27;t expect a miracle over night - but in a couple weeks,  you should see some real progress.</li>
            <li> The tube for Crest 3D is huge and very generous. It stands on its head which helps keep things organized. It is a nice gel with little crystals in the paste...it has a cooling effect and after using it for 2-weeks, I did have some sensitivity only in the mornings. I switched to a normal toothpaste maybe two-three nights during that period.....Since then, been using consistently for about a month. I am not yet noticing a lot of whitening effect but I do like the feel and scent and the brand Crest in general. Worth a try!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks and it seems to work well</li>
            <li> The toothpaste works fine but the peppermint is too strong.  I got to a point where i hated brushing because it was too much.  Going back to the Crest ProHealth Clean Mint.</li>
            <li> I saw results with this toothpaste after the first use.  It&#x27;s excellent for whitening, no doubt.  But, I have several cavities and have let my teeth go over the years (I know, I know, no lectures, please....) and in two weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a drastic difference in sensitivity.  Even my own breath blowing on my teeth is sending shivers down my spine.  At times it&#x27;s downright painful.  I must say that I used this toothpaste in conjunction with an electric brush, so obviously in hindsight this wasn&#x27;t the best idea.  I recommend the toothpaste highly for whitening, but if you have bad or sensitive spots, please use cautiously, and don&#x27;t use with an electric.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Has a nice taste&lt;br /&gt;-As though it isn&#x27;t the \\&quot;3D\\&quot; level of whitening, it is decent&lt;br /&gt;-Affordable&lt;br /&gt;-Can be found anywhere&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-It must be what they put in the toothpaste, but do show restraint with this, as it can create sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;-Like I said, do be aware that this isn&#x27;t \\&quot;3D White\\&quot; (or whatever the hell that is)- it&#x27;s not really as above the average toothpaste as it claims to be.&lt;br /&gt;-Maybe this is shallow but the name sounds so dumb, especially when said fast. Maybe it&#x27;s my being tired of the 3D fad in general, but hearing the term \\&quot;3D\\&quot; get thrown around so damn much gets exhausting. Hey it&#x27;s not as bad as when \\&quot;HD\\&quot; was in every product name, at least.</li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t whiten at all.  I have fairly white teeth to begin with, but this stuff seemed to make them yellow or dingy.  It does clean with a fresh taste, but I was not impressed with the whitening at all.  I use the 3D mouth wash with much better results.  I think I&#x27;ll go back to the regular Crest extra whitening with tartar protection.  Seems like others have had good whitening results, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I saw a noticeable difference in the whiteness of my teeth after two uses. I didn&#x27;t realize how stained my teeth were from drinking coffee and wine. I have tried other whitening toothpastes, trays and strips that were more expensive and didn&#x27;t work. This does and all you have to do is brush your teeth twice a day. The mint flavor is strong and burns a little bit but the results are worth it. I don&#x27;t need to purchase the mouthwash and strips that go with the toothpaste because I am so happy with the toothpaste alone. My results are based on natural tooth surfaces (no caps or anything) stained by coffee and wine.</li>
            <li> The good. It whitens better than any OTC product I have used.  The bad. It is caustic and has caused significant adverse reactions, to include lip swelling (looking a lot like Charo these days), reddening (more like purpling), and numbness. It has caused gum burns and general oral tissue sloughing, especially in the front. It took awhile to rule out other causes, to pinpoint the Crest 3D White products. Oddly, it also seems to cause the toothbrush bristles to become stiff after first use, too, which any dentist will tell you is not good for healthy oral hygiene. Thought it was an anomaly, but used a new brush and it occurred again. Will not use again unless formulation is changed and the company acknowledges aforementioned issues.</li>
            <li> Decent toothpaste but way overpriced.  It does taste good for both adults and kids.  Would really only buy it if it is on sale again.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste does NOT whiten teeth! It&#x27;s a shame that we bought a 4 pack. I would recommend Arm and Hammer Extreme Whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of toothpastes on the market that claims to aid in the process of keeping your smile a nice pearl white color, but few live up to the claim. Crest does a pretty good job though. In a nutshell, here&#x27;s what I thought of the Crest 3D White Vivid Toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD&lt;br /&gt;- available on Subscribe &amp; Save, buy in bulk and never run out&lt;br /&gt;- works pretty well without leaving a bad taste in your mouth&lt;br /&gt;- repeated use does leave your smile noticeably brighter, even if not used in conjunction with other Crest whitening products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD&lt;br /&gt;- the traditional toothpaste tube design means it can be difficult to get the last few drops out&lt;br /&gt;- like any toothpaste, if it falls off your toothbrush and sticks to the side of your sink, it can be a pain to remove</li>
            <li> It really cleans and I believe it does actually do some whitening, I am using it with an Oral B toothbrush (electric)&lt;br /&gt;and the whitening strips.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a little over two weeks. It really did a fine job of whitening my teeth, and I was very pleased with that. Coincidentally, I had my six month dental checkup and the hygienist made a few remarks about how rough the surfaces of my teeth had become. The only change in my daily brushing routine within the six month time period was the use of this toothpaste.    You make the call...</li>
            <li> I really had no desire to whiten my teeth when I bought this toothpaste (even though I really needed it.)  I just grabbed it off the shelf while I was in a hurry.    I was really surprised to see how much my teeth whitened within a few days of using this.  I usually only brush my teeth for about 40 seconds and not vigorously, but after seeing these results, I spent a little more time brushing and I got even better results.    It&#x27;s a great product to use IN ADDITION to your whitening regimen.  My teeth are not completely white but they definitely lightened up after using this.  You also have to be committed to brushing well three times a day to see really great results.    If you&#x27;re just looking for a gradual, small change from your teeth&#x27;s current color, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product.  I&#x27;m not wasting extra time trying to figure out strips, pastes, and swabs.  I&#x27;m simply brushing my teeth as I usually do and still getting results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Crest product for a couple of years now.  Of all the various toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried, this Crest 3D really maintains white teeth.  The results are boosted if you will use the Crest 3D Whitening Strips once or twice a year, too. ( My dental hygienist and dentist are both impressed with the results.)</li>
            <li> stuff does what it says. but after eating and stuff they wont really stay white. but they go back white all day after brushing.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Crest product through Amazon three weeks ago and have been very pleased. The taste and consistency of the toothpaste is very good.</li>
            <li> For me it really keeps your teeth white and breath fresh.  I like the Crest brand for me none of the others quite live up to their hype.  Also like the fact that it is in the 7.6oz size.</li>
            <li> The chemical fire diamond, a widely used method for identifying hazardous materials  rates Sodium Fluoride as a 3/0/0 Health (blue) Flammability (red) and Reactivity (yellow) respectively *0 being the least threat and 4 being the greatest threat*.  Category 3 health risk chemicals are fatally toxic and according to this classification \\&quot;Short exposure could cause serious temporary or moderate residual injury\\&quot;. If you look on the box, the directions say that if you ingest more than a pea sized amount to seek medical attention. This is a testament to just how toxic this stuff is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s in your water too (yup the government told you that Sodium fluoride was GOOD for you, remember?) Now there are heaps of scientific literature that say that it is devastatingly toxic.  DO NOT buy this product. it is NOT good for you, get fluoride free toothpaste instead (completely fluoride free, NO STANNOUS FLOURIDE, that&#x27;s not good for you either!)</li>
            <li> saw results pretty quickly (3 or 4 days), and have continued to see whitening effects for my teeth. had the tendency initially to leave my teeth feeling pretty sensitive, but after a week or two of use that problem faded away. bought the 4 pack and that&#x27;s enough toothpaste to last a LONG time...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this whitening tooth paste for the past few years.  It has a fresh minty taste without being too minty hot, and helps keep my smile bright.  The subscribe and save price is an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> Just found out this has a bad RDA rating, beyond FDA(200) recommended limit and ADA(250) recommended limit. It sits at 260, 4th most abrasive toothpaste known to exist...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically this toothpaste is supposed to whiten teeth but at the same time it&#x27;ll literally eat away the most dentin/enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste since it came out and I will never use it again....well until I get my new toothpaste in the mail. Might as well be brushing with anything as abrasive that you could think of.</li>
            <li> Instead of getting 4 units (of 7.6 oz) I got 5 units of a smaller size (5.5 oz).  Even if the total net weight did match up (which it didn&#x27;t, I am still short) I would still be unhappy since 1) They said what I ordered was in stock and 2) they never asked if it was OK to change my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very unprofessional.  I will never buy from Daily Market again.</li>
            <li> This is the best whitening toothpaste I&#x27;ve found - better than Colgate Optic White, IMHO.  Amazon had the best price for a multi-pack.</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of coffee and tea and have experimented with many tooth whitening products. I don&#x27;t have the patience to use strips or trays, and I&#x27;ve been using SuperSmile, which works fairly well.  The drawbacks to SuperSmile are that it&#x27;s very expensive for toothpaste, you have to mix two products and you have to brush your teeth for two minutes at a time.  Two minutes is a loooong time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up a tube of Crest 3D toothpaste on a whim and am totally impressed.  The whitening action is thorough and much faster than with SuperSmile, and it&#x27;s about 90% cheaper.  My teeth feel smooth and clean, and began looking whiter after just a couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback I&#x27;ve found is that regular use makes my teeth a little sensitive.  It&#x27;s not enough to be really annoying and I still highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the product just pretty disappointed that I bought so many and they expire in January 2015... I don&#x27;t believe I will go through so many in such a short time!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if there is a whitener in this toothpaste, I should probably check. however, ever since i started using this toothpaste i have been getting lots of compliments about how white my teeth are. everyone likes a compliment and likes white teeth. yeah, i will take that</li>
            <li> I noticed results within 5 days of having this toothpaste, and 14 days in as they recommend, it looks to me more like a professional whiting job.  I didn&#x27;t use any of the other products they recommend, just the toothpaste.  HIGHLY recommended by me!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste works very well, but be careful and don&#x27;t brush too hard with it.  It has led to sensitivity in my back molars that makes my teeth just ache.  I&#x27;ve found that brushing with Crest 3D White in the morning, then using Sensodyne at night and rinsing with ACT Restoring mouthwash helps.  That way I have sparkly bright white teeth throughout the day but no aches or pains anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothpaste for a while now, and it really does whiten. I drink a lot of diet pepsi so my teeth get stains I use this product more to prevent further staining then to make my teeth whiter yet even with my soda drinking the product does make my teeth whiter.&lt;br /&gt;I brush for the 2 minutes recommended by dentists and I don&#x27;t use the toothpaste sparingly so it works under those conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely give Crest 3D White a try, its much less annoying than white strips!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. The taste is no different than other toothpastes. The longer you use it the better the results will be and it will maintain white teeth. I did not have any sensitivity issues with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toothpaste and buying in stock like this saves me a ton. Great buy! Works awesome with whitening.</li>
            <li> I picked up a tube of this stuff because it was on clearance.  It&#x27;s a very smooth toothpaste, easy to brush with.  Not too heavy and I don&#x27;t think it has the \\&quot;stannous flouride\\&quot; that the other crest pro health toothpastes have in it.  Good stuff, higher stars if it were cheaper (there is no real reason this would be a \\&quot;premium\\&quot; priced toothpaste).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothpaste if whitening is your goal. I&#x27;ve seen results very quickly. I drink a lot of coffee and had noticed that me teeth were looking a little stained. This toothpaste is helping to correct that problem. One drawback, I&#x27;ve also noticed that my bathroom towels have become bleached in spots where they&#x27;ve come in contact with toothpaste residue, so be careful of your linens around this product.</li>
            <li> we were very pleased with both the speed of the shipping (very timely) and the product itself.  Of course we use Vivid White anyway.  Finding it in the larger size, though, was the best thing since sliced bread!</li>
            <li> I drink coffee daily and I get compliment often on my teeth. Best with crest toothbrush I think so cause it is what I&#x27;ve been using for years</li>
            <li> I love this Crest 3d White Toothpaste!  I&#x27;m not a smoker but have drank colas for many years and since I&#x27;ve started using it everybody keeps asking if I&#x27;ve had my teeth whitened.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a year now. It really does what it promises: my teeth are naturally white. And it was not easy to make them like that because I have a yellow enamel. I highly recommend it - it works!</li>
            <li> It is all i use. Refreshing and actually whitens. The service is great. I have no complaints at all. Go ahead and try it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong the first couple uses but then your teeth get used to it and will love you for it. They stay so white regardless of what you eat or how much coffee you drink. I made the switch to Crest 3D White and I cannot go back to another toothpaste brand. Friends always ask me what I use and I refer them as well. Try it! You won&#x27;t regret it. :]</li>
            <li> As of 5/29/13 the picture on this page doesn&#x27;t show the correct product. You are buying Crest 3D White Toothpaste NOT [[ASIN:B004VGSVHS Crest 3D White Vivid Anticavity Toothpaste]]. They are actually two different products.</li>
            <li> bigger set of these are awesome they came in a 4 pack unwarp but in a bag and re warp in the bag.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  It tastes great, makes my teeth shine, and tastes great!  I noticed results shortly after using it, and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful price for this toothpaste!!  Great product with amazing results!  So happy with it that I signed up for the subscribe &amp; save program !</li>
            <li> This toothpaste did a great job at whitening my teeth; however, I just couldn&#x27;t get used to the taste.&lt;br /&gt;To be honest it is a little too sweet for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying the Colgate Optic White instead and had great results.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is good and comparable to most other forms of Crest. It does well, not I haven&#x27;t noticed that it has made my teeth any more white than other brands.</li>
            <li> I love buying in bulk, and this is such a great price, especially for prime members. I will never run out of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this a week ago I&#x27;m unbelievably pleased with the whitening results. My teeth are 2 to 3 times whiter, but it came with a price. I try to take very good care of my teeth, due to the fact that I haven&#x27;t been to a dentist since I was about 5 or 6 (I&#x27;m 25, come from a very low-income home, never had health insurance, and currently have a minimum wage job), but of course still got multiple cavities and, subsequently, tooth sensitivity. After over a year of care and precaution I managed to reverse the sensitivity, only to be knocked back to square one after week with this toothpaste. It happened slowly, culminating tonight. It&#x27;s been hours now, and the pain is still excruciating, to the point of crying on bathroom floor. I gave this toothpaste 4 stars because it truly does do as advertised - significantly whitens teeth in a decent amount of time - however if you are already experiencing any tooth sensitivity at all, I STRONGLY advise you to stay FAR away from this. My vanity can be set on the back burner any day, as long as I never have to feel like this again.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few toothpastes I can use.  I have sensitive teeth and can&#x27;t do cold stuff.  This tastes better than those sensitive toothpastes, too.  I also found out that if I&#x27;ve eaten something that irritates my teeth that I can use this toothpaste with some baking soda (I dip my toothbrush in the baking soda) and my teeth aren&#x27;t so hard to brush.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste for it&#x27;s cleaning properties and taste and last time I went to the Dentist she actually asked me what I was using to whiten my teeth.  When I told her it was only this toothpaste her remark was &amp;#34;really, because your teeth are in the range that we go for when we do the professional whitening.&amp;#34;  I drink tons of coffee all day, I also drink red wine and this toothpaste seems to counteract those stains pretty well.  That said, I was genetically blessed with relatively white teeth, so I don&#x27;t think that it would help much with very yellow teeth without some type of other professional intervention.  But for maintenance, it seems to be doing it&#x27;s job.  It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that I have very sensitive teeth/gums and I have no problem using this toothpaste.</li>
