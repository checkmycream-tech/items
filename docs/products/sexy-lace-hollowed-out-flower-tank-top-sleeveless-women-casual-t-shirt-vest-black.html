            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit at all.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s super cute and fits true to size.</li>
            <li>My blouse is beautiful but with details like loose threads ...</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and delivered fairly fast.</li>
            <li>True to size.</li>
            <li>I ordered this shirt it came a lot faster then the date amazon gave me which was cool</li>
            <li>This shirt surprised me it is very good quality especially coming from China.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me</li>
            <li>️ regular but look good...;)))</li>
            <li>Looks exactly as pictured!</li>
            <li>Nice fit buy black.</li>
            <li>Just like everyone else says it run a little on the smaller size but it fits my wife perfectly.</li>
            <li>but almost fit my 10 year old.</li>
            <li>thank u;)</li>
            <li>It looks exactly how I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Love the product and would definitely order from them again!</li>
            <li>The crochet stitching is really pretty</li>
            <li>It is hot here where we live and she can wear it under a low cut top during the summer and still stay cool.</li>
            <li>This shirt is so cheap  and crappy that it is not even worth my money to pay for the shipping to send it back.</li>
            <li>This shirt fit more like that for a small child, need to order about 3 sizes too big in order to find the right fit.</li>
            <li>this is very very super tiny .....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a size medium or large depending on the shirt.  </li>
            <li>Looks just like the picture..came within a few weeks,but I had a big order..fits great..</li>
            <li>It fits definitely like a small hood thing I&#x27;m skinny but definitely not the best quality</li>
            <li>love them so much thought it would be made of actual lace on the back</li>
            <li>I ordered a small and it fits nice and</li>
            <li>material is high quality</li>
            <li>They use very skinny models in order to fool you and you believe is large enough.</li>
            <li>I loved the back but the stitching sucks.</li>
            <li>this is a size small at best, maybe even an extra small.  </li>
            <li>Very cute but very small I order a medium it fit like it was a small</li>
            <li>If your a large it fits a size smaller.</li>
            <li>Looks cute but too small for someone that&#x27;s petite and weighs around 130lbs!</li>
            <li>and this fit like a small.</li>
            <li>If you plan on buying order 2 sizes larger than you normally are.</li>
            <li>The back lace part has a huge hole in it and the hems are cut unevenly.</li>
            <li>Either way when it came I could barely wait to wash it and wear it.</li>
            <li>The material feels like it has no flexibility and the top where the lace meets the rest of the fabric is poorly sewn.</li>
            <li>Fits true to size/a bit small.</li>
            <li>Super small.</li>
            <li>tank tops fit well in a medium not this one a waste of money such a small package took over a month to arrive very dissatisfied</li>
            <li>The top of the tank top is sewed together so badly that the straps are literally hanging on by only a few strings.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m a large an this shirt would fit maybe a four year old very very small!!!</li>
            <li>I used to think most tanks were created the same, but this design certainly proved me very, very wrong.</li>
            <li>I wear a large shirt and this did not fit me</li>

            <li> I usually wear a large in tank tops</li>
            <li> this is really for really small ppl</li>
            <li> This is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> The material is very thin and obviously cheap.</li>
            <li> Short and tight.</li>
            <li> For the price I spent can&#x27;t beat it ...</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It does run small because this is Asian size.</li>
            <li> Thin, too short in the waist and is overall a disapointment and no return shipping</li>
            <li> Overly tight even for an average size person.</li>
            <li> This is for extremely small petite not very curvy girls.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t wear bra but the little nipple cover ups work well</li>
            <li> 125 and the shirt looks like it was made for little girls from ages 6-10.</li>
            <li> Did not fit</li>
            <li> Does not fit all.</li>
            <li> And it does not fit all sizes.</li>
            <li> Does not fit women USA sizes -- fits US Jr. Size and then take away another size after that.</li>
            <li> and they weren&#x27;t very tight</li>
            <li> This runs extremely small and the material isn&#x27;t stretchy.</li>
            <li> Way too small.</li>
            <li> if you have a small head I wouldn&#x27;t buy them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wicked small.</li>
            <li> For a medium it looked like small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a small person</li>
            <li> IS VERY SMALL</li>
            <li> Very, very, very small.</li>
            <li> but this is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> This was my 2nd mistake and it is crazy expensive to return.</li>
            <li> and it is very thin material to begin with.</li>
            <li> I am extremely unhappy and will never order from this company again.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> When I received this shirt it smelled terrible and was nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li> I HATE THIS!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They need to say kids sizes or juniors.  This runs extremely small and the material isn&#x27;t stretchy. I usually wear a large in tank tops and this fit like a small. On me it was also short It fit almost like a croptop. I&#x27;m all for form fitting tops but this was not my favorite.  I loved the back but the stitching sucks. It&#x27;s a  unfinished edge. I am a curvy girl but this is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Way too small. didn&#x27;t know one size fits all meant 13 year olds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a size medium or large depending on the shirt.  this is a size small at best, maybe even an extra small.  Did not fit but almost fit my 10 year old.</li>
            <li> My blouse is beautiful but with details like loose threads ... always order size bigger since I read the reviews before. IS VERY SMALL</li>
            <li> Super cute!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Sexy! It looks the same as picture. Have yet to give to my daughter.but was very pleased</li>
            <li> awesome, fits perfect!</li>
            <li> Cute but not as cute as picture when on</li>
            <li> This sexy lace fits well</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife for her birthday she loved it</li>
            <li> Just revived my shirt. It fits definitely like a small hood thing I&#x27;m skinny but definitely not the best quality</li>
            <li> Slightly different then the picture, the back is slimmer but I like it a lot anyways</li>
            <li> This was a great tank top for my stepdaughter. I used to think most tanks were created the same, but this design certainly proved me very, very wrong.</li>
            <li> Sexy with jeans. I love it!</li>
            <li> This shirt fit more like that for a small child, need to order about 3 sizes too big in order to find the right fit.</li>
            <li> I like it...❤️ regular but look good...;))) thank u;)</li>
            <li> I absolutly LOVE this shirt!! It looks exactly how I thought it would. It looks great by itself or under something. It is a great buy!!</li>
            <li> Very cute with the bat wing shirts!</li>
            <li> Looks cute but too small for someone that&#x27;s petite and weighs around 130lbs! Looks exactly as pictured!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the cut or the fabric</li>
            <li> Love this tank!! For the price I spent can&#x27;t beat it ... Going in my suitcase for my trip love it</li>
            <li> Cheap ... Wal-Mart sells better</li>
            <li> Love this tank! Very comfortable and delivered fairly fast. Took maybe a week. Either way when it came I could barely wait to wash it and wear it. Love the product and would definitely order from them again!</li>
            <li> Looks like a regular tank in the front but the back is a surprise. Great for dressing up a maxi skirt or jeans. Stretches to fit better. True to size.</li>
            <li> I ordered one shirt and some how got 2! I love this shirt it&#x27;s different!</li>
            <li> Does not fit all. If your a large it fits a size smaller. Great looking tank. If you don&#x27;t mind the tightness then spend the money.</li>
            <li> Super sexy and comfortable!</li>
            <li> Ehh, material is ok. Hand wash only. Looks better in picture.</li>
            <li> New fav shirt :)  very cute slim fitting and packaged neatly. Overall happy with purchase</li>
            <li> These turned out really cute. Lucky for me I have a big head and they weren&#x27;t very tight very.&lt;br /&gt;So if you have a small head I wouldn&#x27;t buy them.</li>
            <li> Nice fit buy black. You can&#x27;t wear bra but the little nipple cover ups work well</li>

            <li> Very cute. Fits great.</li>
            <li> this is very very super tiny .....this is really for really small ppl</li>
            <li> Part was not sowed together....</li>
            <li> When I received this shirt it smelled terrible and was nothing like the picture. The material is very thin and obviously cheap.

            <li> Why to tight...doesn&#x27;t look like the pic at all</li>
            <li> Size way smaller than says. Doesn&#x27;t fit at all. The quality of stitch from front to back is short. Total waste of money. Ruined gift surprise.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shirt it came a lot faster then the date amazon gave me which was cool but I&#x27;m a large an this shirt would fit maybe a four year old very very small!!! Very nice shirt just not my size!!!</li>
            <li> Very, very, very small. I don&#x27;t know why they lie to people. They use very skinny models in order to fool you and you believe is large enough. I HATE THIS!!! I WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN FROM THEM.</li>
            <li> Thin, too short in the waist and is overall a disapointment and no return shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m &amp;#34;5.4&amp;#34; 125 and the shirt looks like it was made for little girls from ages 6-10. Doesn&#x27;t stretch like I thought it would. Overly tight even for an average size person. And it does not fit all sizes.</li>
            <li> Nice and fix well on my girl</li>
            <li> Love this shirt fits great and looks good</li>
            <li> The cut isn&#x27;t quite the same as it is in the picture. The material feels like it has no flexibility and the top where the lace meets the rest of the fabric is poorly sewn.</li>
            <li> Super small. Yes I did read all the words and ordered accordingly but I couldn&#x27;t wear it without over stretching it and it is very thin material to begin with. Wont order these clothing items again. This was my 2nd mistake and it is crazy expensive to return.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wicked small. Short and tight.</li>
            <li> love them so much thought it would be made of actual lace on the back</li>
            <li> Get a larger size but it wasn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> I love this tank top! It&#x27;s super cute and fits true to size. I ordered a small and it fits nice and snuck.&lt;br /&gt;The material is high quality and I love the detail pattern on the back.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, this is a fab price. If you are thinking if getting this -- Get it!</li>
            <li> This shirt surprised me it is very good quality especially coming from China. Just like everyone else says it run a little on the smaller size but it fits my wife perfectly.</li>
            <li> This beautiful tank top arrived quickly and as described. It does run small because this is Asian size. I wear a large shirt and this did not fit me but I gave it to a friend and she loves it the back is so pretty&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided</li>
            <li> Nice quality lace, and cotton front. Fits true to size/a bit small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not stretchy at all. For a medium it looked like small. I had to return it.</li>
            <li> Does not fit women USA sizes -- fits US Jr. Size and then take away another size after that. This is for extremely small petite not very curvy girls. I ended up giving it to my daughter and it&#x27;s too big for her so she will have to wait to grow into. The crochet stitching is really pretty I got one that has hearts stitched but if this is not hand washed it will fall apart after going thru a machine. If you plan on buying order 2 sizes larger than you normally are.</li>
            <li> Arrived a week before it said it would. Fits just like I thought, looks great.  I&#x27;m happy with it especially for the price, would recommend.</li>
            <li> Very cute but very small I order a medium it fit like it was a small I&#x27;m a small person tank tops fit well in a medium not this one a waste of money such a small package took over a month to arrive very dissatisfied</li>
            <li> Daughter in law loves this shirt. It is hot here where we live and she can wear it under a low cut top during the summer and still stay cool.</li>
