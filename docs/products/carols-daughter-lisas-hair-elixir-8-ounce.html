            <li>As a hot oil treatment this product is excellent!</li>
            <li>EVEN BETTER!  </li>
            <li>It is best used as a hot oil treatment in my opinion.</li>
            <li>love it!  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>It also smells absolutely AMAZING, like eucalyptus and rosemary and something else I can&#x27;t quite place.</li>
            <li>the kind that was in Grandma&#x27;s purse for three months before she offered it to you.   </li>
            <li>This oil combined with the  [[ASIN:B000WJ5XNI Carol&#x27;s Daughter Hair Balm 4 oz]] keeps my hair nice through the all period..</li>
            <li>I smelled it at Macy&#x27;s, and liked the smell.  </li>
            <li>I had read many good reviews about both products before purchasing.  </li>
            <li>BUT IT IS GREAT FOR A GOOD MASSAGE OR HOT OIL TREATMENT...    </li>
            <li>I get comments of how great my hair looks, and how soft it is and how great it smells.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit strong, but it&#x27;s sooooo good for your hair, I don&#x27;t even care.  </li>
            <li>This is a very light oil and absorbs nicely but has a very strong menthol smell.  </li>
            <li>A GOOD HOT OIL TREATMENT !!    </li>
            <li>Honestly this products does have a strong odor</li>
            <li>it smellls really refreshing and it levels out after i wash and cond.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Make sure you are not allergic to any of the botanical oils in this product.</li>
            <li>Now I lose none, or sometimes 4 to 5 strands of hair :).     </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad.  </li>
            <li>But I do love the lemon smell it has.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used her products before and have been quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>but if you must have her products make sure you get it from here.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re way more legitimate than the official website.</li>
            <li>On top of that, the scent it gave off throughout the day didn&#x27;t effect me at all.</li>
            <li>It seem to me to be more suttle than some Pantene products I have used.     </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to use more.</li>
            <li>I love Carol&#x27;s Daughter.</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t give up on CD&#x27;s products, today, we both use the healthy hair butter and the korhet amen oil, I use the korhet amen shampoo and conditioner, and my daughter is using the tui shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT ECSPECIALLY</li>
            <li>Love this oil, smell no problem.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>If I use more than the 3-4 drops</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>The scent was too overwhelming for me.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Product is OK, it adds shine and manageability.</li>
            <li>I truly love everything in her line.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li>oh how do i love love love Lisa&#x27;s Hair Elixir.</li>
            <li>but I love the results.</li>
            <li>But overall awesome product.</li>
            <li>and my scalp is healthy and itch free!</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the Healthy Hair Butter, but this product is worth its weight in gold!!</li>
            <li>Great on natural hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a great value for the amount of product you receive (compared to the 4 ounce bottle CD now offers).  </li>
            <li>Received it very quickly after ordering.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair texture, but this did nothing &amp; it smelled too strongly.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong herbal smell either once it soaks in.</li>
            <li>Carol&#x27;s daughter for creating such a great product.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I would recommend that you get a sample or even purchase it from the beauty chain (that has a money-back guarantee) where her products are available to try it out.</li>
            <li>Smell is lovely (to me) and my hair is shiney, full of body, and looks super healty.</li>
            <li>It really does work !!!</li>
            <li>I was excited about purchasing this product along with the hair balm.  </li>
            <li>Great for moisturing dry itchy scalp, and sealing in moisture.</li>
            <li>This has made my hair so much stronger and my sensitive/itchy scalp feel so much better.</li>
            <li>I love really Lisa&#x27;s Hair Elixir.</li>
            <li>I then cover it with a plastic cap and towel and let it sit for an hour or more (depending on how much time I have.)</li>
            <li>I have been using the elixir as a hot oil treatment for the past 2 months (apply to scalp before washing and sit underneath the dryer for 15 - 20 mins) and it is wonderful!</li>
            <li>While the Elixir moisturizes very well, the smell is strong and even offensive.</li>
            <li>I find this oil to be the best kept secret for hair growth.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take many shampoos to wash it out completely (just 2), the smell doesn&#x27;t linger after the shampoo and there was ZERO hair loss in the shower after using this product.</li>
            <li>I think that this product deserves a 10 rating because it&#x27;s worth every penny that this product costs.</li>
            <li>Since Carol&#x27;s Daughter is a line mostly targeted towards women of color with natural hair, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Being that I had heard so many great things about CD&#x27;s products, I lastly tried it as a hot oil treatment in my hair, because using it the other way was just not helping my hair at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I had put a little more effort and research into the products&#x27; usage the results would have improved.  </li>
            <li>This oil also smells really nice if you want to wear it on your dry hair.</li>
            <li>I am bi-racial with long fine hair that heat destroys easily.</li>
            <li>It grows and breaks off very fast</li>
            <li>But do try this, you just may love it, it can have an overwhelming \\&quot;peppermint like\\&quot; smell if you use too much, so a little does go a long way, and it smells OK.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m aware of my pretty hair these days.</li>
            <li>The Carol&#x27;s Daughter site says you can use this as a hot oil treatment or style your hair with it.   </li>
            <li>I would love to try the vanilla hair smoothie and shampoo next.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I&#x27;m not polyethnic</li>
            <li>I automatically smelled a pretty scent.</li>
            <li>and this was the first time I purchased from the Macy&#x27;s storefront.</li>
            <li>My hair is instantly softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>I like to apply it to her damp hair, twist it or braid it, and by the next day her hair is much more manageable.</li>
            <li>I have purchased plenty of CD&#x27;s items and I have been satified with all, not completely satisfied with everything, but more satisfied than not.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even used as part of a hot oil/deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>This is not my first time using this product.</li>
            <li>I used it regularly at first but now use it just afew times a month</li>
            <li>To keep it straight all week,  at night, I wrap it up, tie it down with a scarf and in the morning my hair is shiny, straigth and smells so good.</li>
            <li>I splashed on a few spritz of the Black Vanilla Leave in Conditioner and it looked great!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who has even slightly dry hair, or wants more manageable curls, but I don&#x27;t recommend it for anyone with oily hair.</li>
            <li>but since I didn&#x27;t want to have to submit it too so much heat every week, I had to extend that to the 2 weeks period.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very herbal:  </li>
            <li>Really gives hair what it needs.</li>
            <li>I think it also balances my scalp&#x27;s pH since I can wear it in buns for much longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The peppermint oil really tingles and stimulates the scalp.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Carol&#x27;s Daughters products!</li>
            <li>As a women of color, I really wanted to like this line of products.  </li>
            <li>I put the oil on warm then cover with a shower cap and did a few house chores.</li>
            <li>Especially since I heard CD&#x27;s products are geared more towards natural hair.  </li>
            <li>this bottle will last me a year or so, which makes the price reasonable for a year&#x27;s worth of hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li>The oil is actually very light and does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>When I first started using the hair elixir I had relaxed hair and now I have natural.</li>
            <li>and I was able to use with this with no problems, but I did hear about one lady who had an allergic reaction which left her scalp red and irritated.     </li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to purchase this at first hearing how the scent was too strong, but being the product juncky that I am, I went for it</li>
            <li>I was not a fan of the scent, but I figured that like most oils, the scent would disappear after a few hours.</li>
            <li>I have mixed hair - a combination of fine, Indian hair and coarse, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I bounced and with a little of the Hair Milk from this line, her natural hair was wavy and more defined.</li>
            <li>I combed through my hair and played with it in the mirrior like a child with a new toy.</li>
            <li>Please know, before using this product, she had no breakage, and just a mild form of dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who is going natural or otherwise.  </li>
            <li>and I used it last night for the first time.</li>
            <li>I thought about going natural!</li>
            <li>Why not a small box with bubble packing?</li>
            <li>I use it as a hot oil treatment on my short, coily, natural hair and normally wear my hair in twist out styles or wash and go&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>My hair turns out soft and silky with lots of body!</li>
            <li>the scent is a little strong</li>
            <li>I tried using a small amount daily to help shield my hair from the bitter winter of the Great Lakes, but it did not help.</li>
            <li>it helps leave my hair soft and shiney and curly, not frizzy anymore.</li>
            <li>Not for allergy sufferers or those sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>As a naturalist, I prefer natural fragrance-free products.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It gave my hair a soft, luxurious feel.</li>
            <li>My hair&#x27;s natural texture is wavy and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>The bottle was shipped in a soft sided envelope and of course what happened?  </li>
            <li>This product just did not work for my relaxed hair, or for my 12 year old daughters natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;M TRANSITION TO NATURAL HAIR</li>
            <li>Maybe it just was not intended for my natural hair type.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve used this item and it works really well on my hair</li>
            <li>I bought this product fo rmy 16 year old daughter who has natural hair.  </li>
            <li>It last a long time ive had it for 3 months and my bottle is still 3/4 full..</li>
            <li>I decided to take one more chance,(I really wanted this to work, if not for me, at least for someone I knew), so I tried this on my 12 year old daughters natural hair, and dry scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying again, but luckily this bottle will last me a very long time!</li>
            <li>after using it as an hot oil treatment, my mind was completely made up that I was no longer going to use this product on my hair, because my dry scalp got even more irritated and my hair breakage got even worse,</li>
            <li>I wet my hair first then apply the oil to my hair root to tip while massaging it into my scalp.</li>
            <li>I applied 3 drops to my hair, and at first my pressed natural hair was shiny and had lots of \\&quot;slip.\\&quot;  However, later on, my hair was tangled, dry, and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li>Used this product for over a month now, and it just doesn&#x27;t do much for my dry scalp, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in the breakage in my hair either.</li>
            <li>I have dry and brittle hair during the winter and this product really woke my hair up.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I feel the bottle should have a spray top.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for roughly two years, and this has been one of my go to products the whole while.</li>
            <li>If you use the right amount, your hair won&#x27;t get oily and won&#x27;t be weighed down.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like this &amp; am not sure why it gets so much hype.</li>
            <li>As if I had an extra early salon visit that morning.</li>
            <li>However, I was a bit annoyed with Amazon because I ordered two products totaling more than $25.00 and when one item was unavailable I had to pay the shipping charges on this product.  </li>
            <li>She had extreme dry scalp and within 2 weeks of using it for hot oil treatments, in addition to a new shampoo, we see a 50% change in the dryness in her scalp.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical about this product, but when I tried this product for the first time, I was really amazed at how fast this product started working on my brittle hair.</li>
            <li>Just like other oils don&#x27;t use tooo much or else</li>
            <li>I really regrew my hair on the sides that had come out due to perms.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to weigh it down.</li>
            <li>We do incorporate other non CD products in our routine, but overall, these particular products work in our hair, without any irritation.</li>
            <li>It smells good, but there&#x27;s a lot of less expensive oils at the beauty supply that will do the same.</li>

            <li> Make sure you are not allergic to any of the botanical oils in this product.</li>
            <li> Now I lose none, or sometimes 4 to 5 strands of hair :).     </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad.  </li>
            <li> But I do love the lemon smell it has.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used her products before and have been quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> but if you must have her products make sure you get it from here.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re way more legitimate than the official website.</li>
            <li> On top of that, the scent it gave off throughout the day didn&#x27;t effect me at all.</li>
            <li> It seem to me to be more suttle than some Pantene products I have used.     </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use more.</li>
            <li> I love Carol&#x27;s Daughter.</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t give up on CD&#x27;s products, today, we both use the healthy hair butter and the korhet amen oil, I use the korhet amen shampoo and conditioner, and my daughter is using the tui shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT ECSPECIALLY</li>
            <li> Love this oil, smell no problem.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> If I use more than the 3-4 drops</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> The scent was too overwhelming for me.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Product is OK, it adds shine and manageability.</li>
            <li> I truly love everything in her line.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> oh how do i love love love Lisa&#x27;s Hair Elixir.</li>
            <li> but I love the results.</li>
            <li> But overall awesome product.</li>
            <li> and my scalp is healthy and itch free!</li>
            <li> and I really love it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the Healthy Hair Butter, but this product is worth its weight in gold!!</li>
            <li> Great on natural hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a great value for the amount of product you receive (compared to the 4 ounce bottle CD now offers).  </li>
            <li> Received it very quickly after ordering.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair texture, but this did nothing &amp; it smelled too strongly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong herbal smell either once it soaks in.</li>
            <li> Carol&#x27;s daughter for creating such a great product.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I would recommend that you get a sample or even purchase it from the beauty chain (that has a money-back guarantee) where her products are available to try it out.</li>
            <li> Smell is lovely (to me) and my hair is shiney, full of body, and looks super healty.</li>
            <li> It really does work !!!</li>
            <li> I was excited about purchasing this product along with the hair balm.  </li>
            <li> Great for moisturing dry itchy scalp, and sealing in moisture.</li>
            <li> This has made my hair so much stronger and my sensitive/itchy scalp feel so much better.</li>
            <li> I love really Lisa&#x27;s Hair Elixir.</li>
            <li> I then cover it with a plastic cap and towel and let it sit for an hour or more (depending on how much time I have.)</li>
            <li> I have been using the elixir as a hot oil treatment for the past 2 months (apply to scalp before washing and sit underneath the dryer for 15 - 20 mins) and it is wonderful!</li>
            <li> While the Elixir moisturizes very well, the smell is strong and even offensive.</li>
            <li> I find this oil to be the best kept secret for hair growth.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take many shampoos to wash it out completely (just 2), the smell doesn&#x27;t linger after the shampoo and there was ZERO hair loss in the shower after using this product.</li>
            <li> I think that this product deserves a 10 rating because it&#x27;s worth every penny that this product costs.</li>
            <li> Since Carol&#x27;s Daughter is a line mostly targeted towards women of color with natural hair, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Being that I had heard so many great things about CD&#x27;s products, I lastly tried it as a hot oil treatment in my hair, because using it the other way was just not helping my hair at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if I had put a little more effort and research into the products&#x27; usage the results would have improved.  </li>
            <li> This oil also smells really nice if you want to wear it on your dry hair.</li>
            <li> I am bi-racial with long fine hair that heat destroys easily.</li>
            <li> It grows and breaks off very fast</li>
            <li> But do try this, you just may love it, it can have an overwhelming \\&quot;peppermint like\\&quot; smell if you use too much, so a little does go a long way, and it smells OK.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m aware of my pretty hair these days.</li>
            <li> The Carol&#x27;s Daughter site says you can use this as a hot oil treatment or style your hair with it.   </li>
            <li> I would love to try the vanilla hair smoothie and shampoo next.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m not polyethnic</li>
            <li> I automatically smelled a pretty scent.</li>
            <li> and this was the first time I purchased from the Macy&#x27;s storefront.</li>
            <li> My hair is instantly softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> I like to apply it to her damp hair, twist it or braid it, and by the next day her hair is much more manageable.</li>
            <li> I have purchased plenty of CD&#x27;s items and I have been satified with all, not completely satisfied with everything, but more satisfied than not.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used as part of a hot oil/deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> This is not my first time using this product.</li>
            <li> I used it regularly at first but now use it just afew times a month</li>
            <li> To keep it straight all week,  at night, I wrap it up, tie it down with a scarf and in the morning my hair is shiny, straigth and smells so good.</li>
            <li> I splashed on a few spritz of the Black Vanilla Leave in Conditioner and it looked great!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has even slightly dry hair, or wants more manageable curls, but I don&#x27;t recommend it for anyone with oily hair.</li>
            <li> but since I didn&#x27;t want to have to submit it too so much heat every week, I had to extend that to the 2 weeks period.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very herbal:  </li>
            <li> Really gives hair what it needs.</li>
            <li> I think it also balances my scalp&#x27;s pH since I can wear it in buns for much longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The peppermint oil really tingles and stimulates the scalp.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Carol&#x27;s Daughters products!</li>
            <li> As a women of color, I really wanted to like this line of products.  </li>
            <li> I put the oil on warm then cover with a shower cap and did a few house chores.</li>
            <li> Especially since I heard CD&#x27;s products are geared more towards natural hair.  </li>
            <li> this bottle will last me a year or so, which makes the price reasonable for a year&#x27;s worth of hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li> The oil is actually very light and does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> When I first started using the hair elixir I had relaxed hair and now I have natural.</li>
            <li> and I was able to use with this with no problems, but I did hear about one lady who had an allergic reaction which left her scalp red and irritated.     </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase this at first hearing how the scent was too strong, but being the product juncky that I am, I went for it</li>
            <li> I was not a fan of the scent, but I figured that like most oils, the scent would disappear after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have mixed hair - a combination of fine, Indian hair and coarse, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I bounced and with a little of the Hair Milk from this line, her natural hair was wavy and more defined.</li>
            <li> I combed through my hair and played with it in the mirrior like a child with a new toy.</li>
            <li> Please know, before using this product, she had no breakage, and just a mild form of dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who is going natural or otherwise.  </li>
            <li> and I used it last night for the first time.</li>
            <li> I thought about going natural!</li>
            <li> Why not a small box with bubble packing?</li>
            <li> I use it as a hot oil treatment on my short, coily, natural hair and normally wear my hair in twist out styles or wash and go&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> My hair turns out soft and silky with lots of body!</li>
            <li> the scent is a little strong</li>
            <li> I tried using a small amount daily to help shield my hair from the bitter winter of the Great Lakes, but it did not help.</li>
            <li> it helps leave my hair soft and shiney and curly, not frizzy anymore.</li>
            <li> Not for allergy sufferers or those sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> As a naturalist, I prefer natural fragrance-free products.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It gave my hair a soft, luxurious feel.</li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s natural texture is wavy and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was shipped in a soft sided envelope and of course what happened?  </li>
            <li> This product just did not work for my relaxed hair, or for my 12 year old daughters natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;M TRANSITION TO NATURAL HAIR</li>
            <li> Maybe it just was not intended for my natural hair type.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve used this item and it works really well on my hair</li>
            <li> I bought this product fo rmy 16 year old daughter who has natural hair.  </li>
            <li> It last a long time ive had it for 3 months and my bottle is still 3/4 full..</li>
            <li> I decided to take one more chance,(I really wanted this to work, if not for me, at least for someone I knew), so I tried this on my 12 year old daughters natural hair, and dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying again, but luckily this bottle will last me a very long time!</li>
            <li> after using it as an hot oil treatment, my mind was completely made up that I was no longer going to use this product on my hair, because my dry scalp got even more irritated and my hair breakage got even worse,</li>
            <li> I wet my hair first then apply the oil to my hair root to tip while massaging it into my scalp.</li>
            <li> I applied 3 drops to my hair, and at first my pressed natural hair was shiny and had lots of \\&quot;slip.\\&quot;  However, later on, my hair was tangled, dry, and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> Used this product for over a month now, and it just doesn&#x27;t do much for my dry scalp, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in the breakage in my hair either.</li>
            <li> I have dry and brittle hair during the winter and this product really woke my hair up.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I feel the bottle should have a spray top.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for roughly two years, and this has been one of my go to products the whole while.</li>
            <li> If you use the right amount, your hair won&#x27;t get oily and won&#x27;t be weighed down.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this &amp; am not sure why it gets so much hype.</li>
            <li> As if I had an extra early salon visit that morning.</li>
            <li> However, I was a bit annoyed with Amazon because I ordered two products totaling more than $25.00 and when one item was unavailable I had to pay the shipping charges on this product.  </li>
            <li> She had extreme dry scalp and within 2 weeks of using it for hot oil treatments, in addition to a new shampoo, we see a 50% change in the dryness in her scalp.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical about this product, but when I tried this product for the first time, I was really amazed at how fast this product started working on my brittle hair.</li>
            <li> Just like other oils don&#x27;t use tooo much or else</li>
            <li> I really regrew my hair on the sides that had come out due to perms.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to weigh it down.</li>
            <li> We do incorporate other non CD products in our routine, but overall, these particular products work in our hair, without any irritation.</li>
            <li> It smells good, but there&#x27;s a lot of less expensive oils at the beauty supply that will do the same.</li>
            <li> let it dry then get up extra early the next morning to flat iron it and look decent for my class in the next few hours.</li>
            <li> Reading these reviews can make you more than a little skeptical about trying a new product.</li>
            <li> Keeping in mind that my hair is fine, thin and long (past the bra strap when have it straight)</li>
            <li> I hurried to the bathroom and noticed I didn&#x27;t even need to bother pluging the flat iron.</li>
            <li> After blowing drying,I apply CD Macadamia Hair Serum (quarter size amount) and flat iron.</li>
            <li> Now for the price I paid for this, I was dissapointed, even more so that it is now not being used, months later, I just don&#x27;t have the guts to toss it, and I won&#x27;t even give it to someone else to try, as I am afraid what would happen to their hair.  </li>
            <li> and I would stop cold turkey to try to get my hair back in healthy condition.</li>
            <li> It works especially well for someone with dry, lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> I have a relaxer in my hair and usually blow dry it straight.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in mid to late October of 2010, and by the mid to end November 2010, I knew I had to completely stop using it.  </li>
            <li> All natural ingredients and not too heavy.</li>
            <li> but since it is grey we cannot perm her hair to help her maintain it.</li>
            <li> The combination of working out, wearing my hair in buns (I&#x27;m a professional), and the harsh Chicago weather can cause my scalp to get dry and irritated.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing my hair natural and  for the past month I&#x27;ve been straightening them every two weeks (blow dry + flat iron combo).</li>
            <li> When my scalp start getting itchy in the middle of the second week, I apply a little oil</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s why, in my relaxed hair, which at the time was beginning to break along with having a dry scalp</li>
            <li> In conclusion, I would not recommend this product to someone who has already begun to have breakage problems with their hair, or even to someone with dry scalp, period.</li>
            <li> It is no longer dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with dry itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> Then I blow dry it and straighten it, and it&#x27;s soft and manageable, no more frizzies.</li>
            <li> I then tried it as a hot oil treatment and it made my dry scalp worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet for the hair milk as I&#x27;m not seeing any wow factor to it.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It left my hair weighed down, even after shampooing.  </li>
            <li> I little bit goes a long way and folks can smell you from a long way too.</li>
            <li> My scalp was dry and extremely flaky.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it nearly every day now for at least a month, and I do not see any difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful with what I put in my hair.</li>
            <li> It now sits in the bathroom cabinet until I have the guts to throw the remainder of the $19 I spent in the trash.</li>
            <li> I left it wet and added the Elixir, as it dried over night as soon as i awoke in the morning</li>
            <li> but it a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but all of our representatives are assisting other customers.</li>
            <li> I cant think of any other products that meet the standards of these.</li>
            <li> DUE TO THE ROSEMARY OIL...</li>
            <li> This oil as well as other products from this line do not agree with my hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so be careful unless you want your hair to end up feeling like an oil slick.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, thick, very slightly wavy, short hair, and I&#x27;m Caucasian, and this worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I must admit it itches my scalp like crazy and for some reason my scalp forms a crust, but it has filled in some bald spots I had throughout my scalp and my hair is getting so thick</li>
            <li> A little goes a loooooooooooong way.</li>
            <li> I lover her hair the way it is now with all of her little waves running through it.</li>
            <li> so try a little at a time until you find the amount that works for you.</li>
            <li> As for the oil itself, whether I used a little or a lot, it did nothing but irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have not tried it as a hair oil treatment, but just applying it to my scalp twice a week and a little on the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> It is no fib when I say, it was almost unreal to see how fast my daughters hair started breaking and how badly her already dry scalp became agitated by this.  </li>
            <li> so much so, that I was afraid that with continued use</li>
            <li> A few drops of the Elixer with a nickle sized amount of the Hair Milk</li>
            <li> and I finished wth a few spritz of the Leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> seemed to have gotten worse after daily use.</li>
            <li> I honestly wasted money with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I unwrapped my hair and it actually fell, almost like a dramatic movie scene.</li>
            <li> and if your serious about growing long thick hair then this is the oil for you</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> then wash and condition as usual.</li>
            <li> I usually  wash my hair weekly</li>
            <li> I suffer from ezcema and found that adding a small drop of the elixir to an unscented moisturizer, soothes my skin and keeps me moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> I have no more flakes</li>
            <li> I get it done every two weeks, and when it starts to get towards the end of that two week period, and my hair is dull and doesn&#x27;t wanna hold a style, i just put 6 or 7 drops of the elixir in my hands, rub it around, and run it through my hair.  </li>
            <li> With that said I dont agree with the negative reviews this time..</li>
            <li> Long,fine and thin</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> BUT unfortunately I was unimpressed with the hair elixer.</li>
            <li> Seems Carol&#x27;s Daughter is out with our secret on HSN-Go Girl!</li>
            <li> I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> Sad to say, I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> As a consumer i base alot of my purchases on customer experience.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have purchased this product several time and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and how it makes my scalp feel.  Great product to purchase for anyone looking for a great oil to use in their hair.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m looking for a deep conditioner w/out harmful chemicals. i use it once a week while i swim. i don&#x27;t put my head under the water. leave it on maybe for a hour [cause i have the time to] to deep cond. then wash and condition as usual. some say the smell is medicinal, but it&#x27;s predominent smell is peppermint which i do like a lot. it smellls really refreshing and it levels out after i wash and cond. my hair after my swim. it helps leave my hair soft and shiney and curly, not frizzy anymore. i&#x27;m aware of my pretty hair these days. it&#x27;s a good product for me. aloha and mahalo nui loa...dixie...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this &amp; am not sure why it gets so much hype. Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair texture, but this did nothing &amp; it smelled too strongly.</li>
            <li> I find this oil to be the best kept secret for hair growth.  my hair stopped breaking when I started using the elixir and it grew thicker and longer.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is going natural or otherwise.  and if your serious about growing long thick hair then this is the oil for you</li>
            <li> While the Elixir moisturizes very well, the smell is strong and even offensive. Not for allergy sufferers or those sensitive to smells. As a naturalist, I prefer natural fragrance-free products. This one is not for me.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful hair care product.  My only complaint is that I feel the bottle should have a spray top.  It&#x27;s great as a sheen as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve bought it twice now. My hair loves it. Smells mentholated and so scalp breathes. All natural ingredients and not too heavy. I get an instant sheen!</li>
            <li> Awesome is the best way to describe this product.  The smell takes some getting use to but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I have type 3C hair. Long,fine and thin so I have to be careful with what I put in my hair. It doesn&#x27;t take much to weigh it down. The Carol&#x27;s Daughter site says you can use this as a hot oil treatment or style your hair with it.   CONS   #1. I don&#x27;t like the smell. Smells like spearmint gum....the kind that was in Grandma&#x27;s purse for three months before she offered it to you.   #2. For styling I do not recommend this product. Its WAYYYYYY to greasy. The oil sits on your hair. When I used this oil (as a sheen on my hair) HOURS later, if you rubbed your hand on my hair you would get this shiny residue on there. And again, the smell of the product is overbearing.   #3. Make sure you are not allergic to any of the botanical oils in this product. I have sensitive skin and I was able to use with this with no problems, but I did hear about one lady who had an allergic reaction which left her scalp red and irritated.     PROS   #1. As a hot oil treatment this product is excellent! It strengthens the hair. I put the oil on warm then cover with a shower cap and did a few house chores. I washed it out 15 or 20 mins later. It didn&#x27;t take many shampoos to wash it out completely (just 2), the smell doesn&#x27;t linger after the shampoo and there was ZERO hair loss in the shower after using this product. Before using Lisa&#x27;s hair elixir I was loosing a lot of hair in the shower and through regular combing. Now I lose none, or sometimes 4 to 5 strands of hair :).     #2. A little goes a loooooooooooong way. Keeping in mind that my hair is fine, thin and long (past the bra strap when have it straight) this bottle will last me a year or so, which makes the price reasonable for a year&#x27;s worth of hot oil treatments. If you have type 1 hair it may even last you longer than that.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical about this product, but when I tried this product for the first time, I was really amazed at how fast this product started working on my brittle hair. Before I started using this product, my hair used to break all the time. Even though I was using some really great products, it just didn&#x27;t seem like anything was solving my ends from breaking off. This product is the only product that I have ever used that actually put a stop to my hair breakage. I think that this product deserves a 10 rating because it&#x27;s worth every penny that this product costs. Thank you, thank you, thank you Carol&#x27;s daughter for creating such a great product. I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the Healthy Hair Butter, but this product is worth its weight in gold!!</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase this at first hearing how the scent was too strong, but being the product juncky that I am, I went for it and I&#x27;m glad.  I&#x27;m wearing my hair natural and  for the past month I&#x27;ve been straightening them every two weeks (blow dry + flat iron combo). I usually  wash my hair weekly but since I didn&#x27;t want to have to submit it too so much heat every week, I had to extend that to the 2 weeks period. This oil combined with the  [[ASIN:B000WJ5XNI Carol&#x27;s Daughter Hair Balm 4 oz]] keeps my hair nice through the all period..The oil is actually very light and does not weigh my hair down. When my scalp start getting itchy in the middle of the second week, I apply a little oil and it&#x27;s good to go. To keep it straight all week,  at night, I wrap it up, tie it down with a scarf and in the morning my hair is shiny, straigth and smells so good. I&#x27;m not sure yet for the hair milk as I&#x27;m not seeing any wow factor to it.[[ASIN:B000V1YEI2 Carol&#x27;s Daughter Hair Milk, 8 oz.]] But I do love the lemon smell it has.  I would love to try the vanilla hair smoothie and shampoo next. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used her products before and have been quite satisfied. This was recommended by my daughter and I used it last night for the first time. It gave my hair a soft, luxurious feel. However, I was a bit annoyed with Amazon because I ordered two products totaling more than $25.00 and when one item was unavailable I had to pay the shipping charges on this product.  Had I known I could have picked it up at my neighborhood mall and not have to pay shipping charges.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on the Carol&#x27;s Daughter hype.  I smelled it at Macy&#x27;s, and liked the smell.  It&#x27;s very herbal:  lavender/mint/chamomile.  I applied 3 drops to my hair, and at first my pressed natural hair was shiny and had lots of \\&quot;slip.\\&quot;  However, later on, my hair was tangled, dry, and unmanageable.  My hair&#x27;s natural texture is wavy and frizzy.  I have not had a relaxer in over a year.</li>
            <li> I wish I could tell you about the product but I never received it! I made my order and kept checking and checking the order status and there was never any order status or shipping information. I soon called customer service and there was a message that said \\&quot;Im sorry but all of our representatives are assisting other customers. to leave a message press 1. Otherwise hold on the line.\\&quot; I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I never got through to anyone so I left a message. I still haven&#x27;t received a call back from anyone. At this point I want to cancel my order but I can&#x27;t because no one will answer the phone. Don&#x27;t buy from such an unprofessional company like that but if you must have her products make sure you get it from here. They&#x27;re way more legitimate than the official website. I wish I could give it no stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit strong, but it&#x27;s sooooo good for your hair, I don&#x27;t even care.  It&#x27;s expensive but a little goes a long way.  Unfortunately I&#x27;m not polyethnic so I won&#x27;t be buying anything from Carol&#x27;s Daughter ever again.</li>
            <li> I was excited about purchasing this product along with the hair balm.  I had read many good reviews about both products before purchasing.  Let me just say for me, personally speaking, the products are too greasy.  I have mixed hair - a combination of fine, Indian hair and coarse, curly hair.  I&#x27;m sure if I had put a little more effort and research into the products&#x27; usage the results would have improved.  I believe this is still a great product, just not for me.</li>
            <li> It leaves me speechless. I ordered this product after I read about it in Seventeen Magazine. I would wash my hair let it dry then get up extra early the next morning to flat iron it and look decent for my class in the next few hours. With this product, it has greatly helped my damaged hair to repair. As soon as I got my hair permed I left it wet and added the Elixir, as it dried over night as soon as i awoke in the morning I automatically smelled a pretty scent. I unwrapped my hair and it actually fell, almost like a dramatic movie scene. I hurried to the bathroom and noticed I didn&#x27;t even need to bother pluging the flat iron. I combed through my hair and played with it in the mirrior like a child with a new toy. It was my hair and it was BEAUTIFUL! I splashed on a few spritz of the Black Vanilla Leave in Conditioner and it looked great! As if I had an extra early salon visit that morning. On top of that, the scent it gave off throughout the day didn&#x27;t effect me at all. It seem to me to be more suttle than some Pantene products I have used.     EVEN BETTER!  My great grandmother who is going on 83 has the thickest hair I have ever seen. It grows and breaks off very fast but since it is grey we cannot perm her hair to help her maintain it. every now and then we greese her scalp and comb through it to take care of it. This time we greesed her scalp with the Elixir and almost instantly nothing else needed to be done. I bounced and with a little of the Hair Milk from this line, her natural hair was wavy and more defined. I lover her hair the way it is now with all of her little waves running through it. Her breakaged stopped when we added some of the Elixir to the ends(as suggested by another customer). It may seem like I added alot of the products to her hair but it a little goes a long way. A few drops of the Elixer with a nickle sized amount of the Hair Milk and I finished wth a few spritz of the Leave in conditioner. Her hair looked so good I thought about going natural! I feel as if I now have an addiction to the products! I cant think of any other products that meet the standards of these. This is truly a blessing. I can&#x27;t wait to use more.</li>
            <li> I bought the elixir after rave reviews on Carol&#x27;s Daughter site. I must admit that it&#x27;s not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be. I have been using it nearly every day now for at least a month, and I do not see any difference in my hair. It smells good, but there&#x27;s a lot of less expensive oils at the beauty supply that will do the same.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the hair. I love Carol&#x27;s Daughter. Did not have any issues at all with delivery! I will reorder &amp; use again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the elixir twice and this was the first time I purchased from the Macy&#x27;s storefront. If you want to try the elixir I suggest you purchase from Carol&#x27;s Daughter or Sephora - both of which have storefronts on amazon. The bottle was shipped in a soft sided envelope and of course what happened?  I opened the package and the inside of the envelope is oily, the order form and samples are oily. Why not a small box with bubble packing? or biodegradable peanuts? Sephora and Carol&#x27;s Daughter packed correctly and Macy&#x27;s didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This product just did not work for my relaxed hair, or for my 12 year old daughters natural hair.  I purchased this product in mid to late October of 2010, and by the mid to end November 2010, I knew I had to completely stop using it.  Here&#x27;s why, in my relaxed hair, which at the time was beginning to break along with having a dry scalp seemed to have gotten worse after daily use. But I did not won&#x27;t to give up, so I thought I must need a deeper sense of penetration with this product, because this product is simply listed to aid with the breakage of hair. Being that I had heard so many great things about CD&#x27;s products, I lastly tried it as a hot oil treatment in my hair, because using it the other way was just not helping my hair at all.  Behold...after using it as an hot oil treatment, my mind was completely made up that I was no longer going to use this product on my hair, because my dry scalp got even more irritated and my hair breakage got even worse, so much so, that I was afraid that with continued use I&#x27;d end up bald, with a torn up scalp!  Still, not wanting to give up just yet,and thinking maybe it is just me and my scalp issues with my relaxed hair. I decided to take one more chance,(I really wanted this to work, if not for me, at least for someone I knew), so I tried this on my 12 year old daughters natural hair, and dry scalp. Especially since I heard CD&#x27;s products are geared more towards natural hair.  It is no fib when I say, it was almost unreal to see how fast my daughters hair started breaking and how badly her already dry scalp became agitated by this.  Please know, before using this product, she had no breakage, and just a mild form of dry scalp.  Now for the price I paid for this, I was dissapointed, even more so that it is now not being used, months later, I just don&#x27;t have the guts to toss it, and I won&#x27;t even give it to someone else to try, as I am afraid what would happen to their hair.  In conclusion, I would not recommend this product to someone who has already begun to have breakage problems with their hair, or even to someone with dry scalp, period. However, I didn&#x27;t give up on CD&#x27;s products, today, we both use the healthy hair butter and the korhet amen oil, I use the korhet amen shampoo and conditioner, and my daughter is using the tui shampoo and conditioner. We do incorporate other non CD products in our routine, but overall, these particular products work in our hair, without any irritation. It could have just been our scalps, but bottom line this didn&#x27;t work for us, therefore I can not recommend.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT ECSPECIALLY AS A SCALP TREATMENT.. GOTTA USE IT SPARINGLY DUE TO THE ROSEMARY OIL... BUT IT IS GREAT FOR A GOOD MASSAGE OR HOT OIL TREATMENT...    I USE IT WITH SOME OLIVE OIL AND GIVE MYSELF A GOOD HOT OIL TREATMENT !!    JUST ORDERED THE HAIR BALM &amp; HAIR BUTTER  CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO TRY MY FAV STYLES ON IT !!!    I&#x27;M TRANSITION TO NATURAL HAIR SO I USUSALLY ROCK BRAID OUTS AND TWIST OUTS...</li>
            <li> I am a big Carol&#x27;s Daughter fan and supporter...especially when it comes to the bath/body products... BUT unfortunately I was unimpressed with the hair elixer. Maybe it just was not intended for my natural hair type. I honestly wasted money with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great on natural hair.  Conditions and shine.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it. Did nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> Lisa&#x27;s Hair Elixir works great for me.  I have a relaxer in my hair and usually blow dry it straight. I get it done every two weeks, and when it starts to get towards the end of that two week period, and my hair is dull and doesn&#x27;t wanna hold a style, i just put 6 or 7 drops of the elixir in my hands, rub it around, and run it through my hair.  My hair is instantly softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> Love this oil, smell no problem.  Really gives hair what it needs. Great product. Seems Carol&#x27;s Daughter is out with our secret on HSN-Go Girl!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. I have dyed my hair too often and decided enough was enough and I would stop cold turkey to try to get my hair back in healthy condition. I have very dry, thick, very slightly wavy, short hair, and I&#x27;m Caucasian, and this worked wonders for me. All I do is wash and condition my hair, and use literally 3-4 DROPS of this stuff. I rub it in my hands and scrunch it into my hair. Then I blow dry it and straighten it, and it&#x27;s soft and manageable, no more frizzies. If I use more than the 3-4 drops it&#x27;s too oily, but I do have short hair (above my ears) so try a little at a time until you find the amount that works for you. If you use the right amount, your hair won&#x27;t get oily and won&#x27;t be weighed down. It also smells absolutely AMAZING, like eucalyptus and rosemary and something else I can&#x27;t quite place. I get comments of how great my hair looks, and how soft it is and how great it smells. I would recommend this to anyone who has even slightly dry hair, or wants more manageable curls, but I don&#x27;t recommend it for anyone with oily hair. I&#x27;ll be buying again, but luckily this bottle will last me a very long time!</li>
            <li> My daughter has coarse/kinky hair. I like to apply it to her damp hair, twist it or braid it, and by the next day her hair is much more manageable.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s awesome that I can still buy the full sized bottle from Amazon at the price it used to be from Carol&#x27;s Daughter.  It is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great oil for my hair. Was very good for my texture hair and helped with adding moisture and sheen. Great product.</li>
            <li> your hair will feel so refresh i have been using this product for over 4 years now.</li>
            <li> Since Carol&#x27;s Daughter is a line mostly targeted towards women of color with natural hair, I decided to give it a try. I was not a fan of the scent, but I figured that like most oils, the scent would disappear after a few hours. I was so wrong. The scent was too overwhelming for me. As for the oil itself, whether I used a little or a lot, it did nothing but irritate my scalp. I tried using a small amount daily to help shield my hair from the bitter winter of the Great Lakes, but it did not help. I then tried it as a hot oil treatment and it made my dry scalp worse. All in all, my hair and scalp did not like this oil. It now sits in the bathroom cabinet until I have the guts to throw the remainder of the $19 I spent in the trash. This oil as well as other products from this line do not agree with my hair. I would recommend that you get a sample or even purchase it from the beauty chain (that has a money-back guarantee) where her products are available to try it out. That way, if you dislike it, you will not lose out on your hard-earned money.</li>
            <li> This is a very light oil and absorbs nicely but has a very strong menthol smell.  I little bit goes a long way and folks can smell you from a long way too.</li>
            <li> This is a great value for the amount of product you receive (compared to the 4 ounce bottle CD now offers).  I have been using the hair elixir for 8 years and I keep coming back to it because it works for me and my hair/skin type.  I use it as a hot oil treatment on my short, coily, natural hair and normally wear my hair in twist out styles or wash and go&#x27;s.  I also used the elixir when I had shoulder length relaxed hair or wore braids.  I suffer from ezcema and found that adding a small drop of the elixir to an unscented moisturizer, soothes my skin and keeps me moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> The combination of working out, wearing my hair in buns (I&#x27;m a professional), and the harsh Chicago weather can cause my scalp to get dry and irritated.  This oil has been a Godsend.  It prevents scalp irritations and keeps the hair moisturized. I think it also balances my scalp&#x27;s pH since I can wear it in buns for much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It doesn&#x27;t have a strong herbal smell either once it soaks in. This is the only oil you need. I love it.</li>
            <li> One of Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s Best products. I have used this product for years and it never disappoints. It is best used as a hot oil treatment in my opinion. The peppermint oil really tingles and stimulates the scalp. This oil also smells really nice if you want to wear it on your dry hair.Just like other oils don&#x27;t use tooo much or else the hair will be greasy. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Product is OK, it adds shine and manageability. Used this product for over a month now, and it just doesn&#x27;t do much for my dry scalp, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in the breakage in my hair either. I will try the Khoret Amen oil, and hopefully I will get the results I am seeking. But do try this, you just may love it, it can have an overwhelming \\&quot;peppermint like\\&quot; smell if you use too much, so a little does go a long way, and it smells OK. I have purchased plenty of CD&#x27;s items and I have been satified with all, not completely satisfied with everything, but more satisfied than not.  Therefore, I will continue to buy and try out her products because the ones that do work for me are excellent!</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> I have been using the elixir as a hot oil treatment for the past 2 months (apply to scalp before washing and sit underneath the dryer for 15 - 20 mins) and it is wonderful! My scalp was dry and extremely flaky.  I have no more flakes and my hair looks and feels healthier.</li>
            <li> Reading these reviews can make you more than a little skeptical about trying a new product. As a consumer i base alot of my purchases on customer experience. With that said I dont agree with the negative reviews this time..I looooove this product. I am bi-racial with long fine hair that heat destroys easily. This has made my hair so much stronger and my sensitive/itchy scalp feel so much better. It last a long time ive had it for 3 months and my bottle is still 3/4 full..I suggest using sparingly along with the macadamia gloss.Great shine, scalp condition and heat protection.</li>
            <li> I have been using Carol&#x27;s Daughter products for over 20yrs prior to her offering haircare or face products. I truly love everything in her line. I love really Lisa&#x27;s Hair Elixir. I actually purchased a 8oz tint bottle and I do a 50/50 mix with the hair elixir and evoo. I wet my hair first then apply the oil to my hair root to tip while massaging it into my scalp. I then cover it with a plastic cap and towel and let it sit for an hour or more (depending on how much time I have.) I rinse it out with just water,shampoo and condition with CD Tui line. I finish off with her Tui Leave in conditioner. After blowing drying,I apply CD Macadamia Hair Serum (quarter size amount) and flat iron. My hair turns out soft and silky with lots of body! I get so many compliments. I have relaxed hair. I highly recommend Carol&#x27;s Daughters products!</li>
            <li> oh how do i love love love Lisa&#x27;s Hair Elixir. I&#x27;ve been natural for roughly two years, and this has been one of my go to products the whole while. Great for moisturing dry itchy scalp, and sealing in moisture. I&#x27;ve even used as part of a hot oil/deep conditioning treatment. A little goes a long way, so be careful unless you want your hair to end up feeling like an oil slick. Smell is lovely (to me) and my hair is shiney, full of body, and looks super healty.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the greatest smell in my opinion. I have not tried it as a hair oil treatment, but just applying it to my scalp twice a week and a little on the rest of my hair. If you have heat damaged hair it will help to strengthen the hair. When I first started using the hair elixir I had relaxed hair and now I have natural. It works in both hair type.</li>
            <li> Honestly this products does have a strong odor but it&#x27;s not overbearing.  I must admit it itches my scalp like crazy and for some reason my scalp forms a crust, but it has filled in some bald spots I had throughout my scalp and my hair is getting so thick so I rate it a 4 out of 5 because it is working on filling in my bald spots and keeps my hair from shedding as it once did.</li>
            <li> I have dry and brittle hair during the winter and this product really woke my hair up. It is no longer dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> As a women of color, I really wanted to like this line of products.  The Hair Elixir was my 4th Carol&#x27;s Daughter purchase, I&#x27;ve also tried the skin care line.  Sad to say, I was disappointed.  I used the Elixir as a hair and scale treatment.  It left my hair weighed down, even after shampooing.  And, I didn&#x27;t care for the smell.  The skin care products made me break out.  I will not purchase from this line again.  I will continue to use the WEN hair care products, more expensive but I love the results.</li>
            <li> This is not my first time using this product. It works especially well for someone with dry, lifeless hair. It moisturizers and keeps hair shiny. Unfortunately, CD recently discontinued this product in this package size. What a shame. But overall awesome product.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with dry itchy scalp.  This product is the answer to all your problems....love it!  I used it regularly at first but now use it just afew times a month and my scalp is healthy and itch free!</li>
            <li> good. but after using this product, my hairs look not took a wash hairs.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  Received it very quickly after ordering.</li>
            <li> I have used Carol&#x27;s daughter for a year now and I really love it. I really regrew my hair on the sides that had come out due to perms. It really does work !!!</li>
            <li> the scent is a little strong</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve used this item and it works really well on my hair</li>
            <li> I bought this product fo rmy 16 year old daughter who has natural hair.  She had extreme dry scalp and within 2 weeks of using it for hot oil treatments, in addition to a new shampoo, we see a 50% change in the dryness in her scalp.</li>
