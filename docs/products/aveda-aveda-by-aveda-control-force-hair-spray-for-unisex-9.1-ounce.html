    <ol>
            <li>best hairspray i ever used--</li>
            <li>excellent product.</li>
            <li>Overall...the best aerosol hairspray I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>Best spray ever!</li>
            <li>Great can hold!</li>
            <li>I like a good hold!)</li>
            <li>I was hoping this Aveda one would win me over.</li>
            <li>Great hold without the weight</li>
            <li>Not that great.</li>
            <li>Smells great also.</li>
            <li>Excellent Product; however, the nozzle clogs very easily..</li>
            <li>I feel Aveda is over rated, Davines is WAY better! !</li>
            <li>love this hair spray holds very good and brushes out well will definately keep using it</li>
            <li>All Aveda smells so good, but this one does not.</li>
            <li>I dont understand this price on the site, people want good deals and this is a rip off.</li>
            <li>Love this hairspray and it smells great.</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Aveda Control Force Hair Spray is amazing.</li>
            <li>What is nice is it has a matte finish.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ve been through many.  </li>
            <li>I read many reviews for this product before purchase.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK but will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li>I buy this in the summer and when I vacation to the south where weather is more humid.  </li>
            <li>I was using non aerosol pumps all summer, having the hairdresser leave more on the top.</li>
            <li>It smells like pine, and you can layer for more hold.</li>
            <li>uses.\\&quot; Love Aveda, Love Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this hairspray, hoping I&#x27;d love it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t finish my free sample and will continue to buy Kenra.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>You could also use it for light hold as well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this hairspray for 3 months I have noticed that it is a light, non-sticky spray with long-lasting hold.</li>
            <li>Its light texture allows you to keep a style for days at a time, or change their style throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Aveda since the Horst Rechelbacher days, and will always enjoy Aveda, even if it creeps into the synthetic Estee Lauder protocol over time.</li>
            <li>I bought this hairspray originally for a wedding to hold an updo.</li>
            <li>The first purchase seemed to hold better, this one doesn&#x27;t seem to have the holding power</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got money to burn, get the original aerosol.</li>
            <li>There is another one called AirControl by Aveda that is much lighter  and better for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Love this hair spray--holds very well.</li>
            <li>This does tend to happen about once a month; however, you can easily fix this issue by running the nozzle under hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This hair spray is great, it holds your hair in place but doesn&#x27;t look glue down.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t afford 2 cans, so I got this one, minus the pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>but so worth it.  </li>
            <li>Holds great without being stiff.  </li>
            <li>works well at first but wears of quickly.</li>
            <li>Super firm hold, smells pleasant and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too crusty.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny and its much higher at the salon.</li>
            <li>nice hold but looks soft and natural.  </li>
            <li>Seller was super fast and item was exactly how it had been shown</li>
            <li>and I ended up going back to my favorite hair spray by bed head.</li>
            <li>Who wants hairspray that smells like bug spray!</li>
            <li>My husband and son both use it the most to hold their short do&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>was able to get a refund, as I had had it only a week or so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a male with thinning at the top.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong hold, but does not crust and flake when dry.</li>
            <li>its at aveda salons for 26$ why pay more when you can get it at the salon at full price for less.</li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;m very picky about my hold-</li>
            <li>Since then my whole family seems to have use for it.</li>
            <li>This was too much like helmet hair, though the scent is lovely.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and well packaged.</li>
            <li>This spray will freeze my hair in whatever position I like and hold strong all day long.</li>
            <li>It stands up to high wind and never falters.</li>
            <li>I think the price is a bit high</li>
            <li>If you have thick, very straight hair like mine, you will love this hair spray.  </li>
            <li>great hairspray, expensive for what you get but cheaper than at Aveda.</li>
            <li>Compared to other high-quality sprays, it is only $2-$3 more, and with Control Force you are getting an all-natural</li>
            <li>excellent hold with without extreme stiffness (stiff for few minutes</li>
            <li>The only hairspray thats really works for any style.</li>
            <li>Since this product is from Aveda, it does have the noticeable Aveda aromas, which are natural, and non-chemical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely found my new hair spray!</li>
            <li>you are looking for an all-natural, high quality, firm hold spray, I highly recommend purchasing Aveda Control Force Hairspray.</li>

            <li> you are looking for an all-natural, high quality, firm hold spray, I highly recommend purchasing Aveda Control Force Hairspray.</li>
            <li> which is why I marked down one star.</li>
            <li> This product is a little expensive in my opinion, but it is worth it because I live in a very humid environment and this product always keeps my curls (or other style) under control!!</li>
            <li> I Like Aveda Products, but this is a little too stiff and heavy for fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I had 80&#x27;s hair long ago</li>
            <li> Not attractive or worth the $.</li>
            <li> I use all Aveda products, but use Kenra #25 hairspray and was anxious to try the new Aveda.</li>
            <li> Firm hold, but creates major crunchy hair.....</li>
            <li> Because I like to use all natural products, I thought that it would be difficult to find a product that is natural, and has a long lasting hold.</li>
            <li> It had a rancid sour smell</li>
            <li> A little spray will do the trick.</li>
            <li> This may seem expensive for a hairspray, but the cans will last 5-6 months.</li>
            <li> I live in Texas and summers are brutal for hair styles and this is not the answer.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, and use hairspray to hold in all day curl, to maintain volume, and to help battle frizz.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too stiff, sprays out hard - so it messes up what you just styled, and the smell is horrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Terrible.  Tree it out.  Nozzle didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> best hairspray i ever used--and i&#x27;ve been through many.  nice hold but looks soft and natural.  excellent product.</li>
            <li> The smell alone made me dislike it.  It had a rancid sour smell and I ended up going back to my favorite hair spray by bed head.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this hairspray, hoping I&#x27;d love it. I use all Aveda products, but use Kenra #25 hairspray and was anxious to try the new Aveda. I didn&#x27;t like it at all. It&#x27;s too stiff, sprays out hard - so it messes up what you just styled, and the smell is horrible. All Aveda smells so good, but this one does not. I didn&#x27;t finish my free sample and will continue to buy Kenra. Bummer..I was hoping this Aveda one would win me over. Also, for the amount you get, it is over priced in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Who wants hairspray that smells like bug spray! It&#x27;s all you can smell and I feel like I just left a camp site. Not attractive or worth the $. I feel Aveda is over rated, Davines is WAY better! !</li>
            <li> I did not like this hair spray not the hold I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I had 80&#x27;s hair long ago so I know my hairspray.  This stuff is fantastic. Great hold without the weight and it&#x27;s not sticky. I would recommend to anyone. Believe me - I have tried them all over the years and this is the only one I go to.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Seller was super fast and item was exactly how it had been shown</li>
            <li> As I try to find beauty/hair products that don&#x27;t have ingredients that research is showing can be harmful to our health, this hairspray was recommended to me.  It holds well (and I&#x27;m very picky about my hold-I like a good hold!) but isn&#x27;t overly clumpy.  You could also use it for light hold as well.  I&#x27;ve definitely found my new hair spray!</li>
            <li> I bought this hairspray originally for a wedding to hold an updo. Since then my whole family seems to have use for it. It has a very strong hold, but does not crust and flake when dry. My husband and son both use it the most to hold their short do&#x27;s. Overall...the best aerosol hairspray I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> I Like Aveda Products, but this is a little too stiff and heavy for fine hair.  There is another one called AirControl by Aveda that is much lighter  and better for fine hair.</li>
            <li> love this hair spray holds very good and brushes out well will definately keep using it</li>
            <li> Holds great without being stiff.  No helmet head.  You can brush and they spray again. As I said, it&#x27;s pricey but so worth it.  Holds up  even in wind.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray and it smells great.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product; however, the nozzle clogs very easily..</li>
            <li> Aveda Control Force Hair Spray is amazing. This spray will freeze my hair in whatever position I like and hold strong all day long. It stands up to high wind and never falters. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Super firm hold, smells pleasant and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too crusty.  I think the price is a bit high which is why I marked down one star.</li>
            <li> This product is a little expensive in my opinion, but it is worth it because I live in a very humid environment and this product always keeps my curls (or other style) under control!!</li>
            <li> If you have thick, very straight hair like mine, you will love this hair spray.  You spray in the morning, and don&#x27;t worry about the hold again the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> excellent hold with without extreme stiffness (stiff for few minutes but the hold is all day, so no one who touches your hair knows that you used any spray. WISH THE SHAMPURE SCENT WOULD BE ON ALL THEIR PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> works well at first but wears of quickly. What is nice is it has a matte finish.</li>
            <li> Not that great. I read many reviews for this product before purchase.  It&#x27;s OK but will not purchase this again. I live in Texas and summers are brutal for hair styles and this is not the answer.</li>
            <li> Firm hold, but creates major crunchy hair.....won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> great hairspray, expensive for what you get but cheaper than at Aveda.</li>
            <li> The only hairspray thats really works for any style. But i would NEVER BUY it on amazon. its at aveda salons for 26$ why pay more when you can get it at the salon at full price for less. I dont understand this price on the site, people want good deals and this is a rip off.</li>
            <li> This was too much like helmet hair, though the scent is lovely.&lt;br /&gt;but the biggest problem was the nozzle kept getting clogged - and though I managed to unclog it each time, until the last time when nothing I did worked.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to get a refund, as I had had it only a week or so.</li>
            <li> Love this hair spray--holds very well.</li>
            <li> This hair spray is great, it holds your hair in place but doesn&#x27;t look glue down. A little spray will do the trick. Worth every penny and its much higher at the salon. It also lets you brush it out if you need to and still has a hold effect. Smells great also. Shipping was fast and well packaged.</li>
            <li> This spray holds hair especially in humid weather.  I buy this in the summer and when I vacation to the south where weather is more humid.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Despite the hype this spray is a 6 of 10 for holding power.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Aveda Control Force hairspray to use as my daily hairspray. Because I like to use all natural products, I thought that it would be difficult to find a product that is natural, and has a long lasting hold. I have very thick hair, and use hairspray to hold in all day curl, to maintain volume, and to help battle frizz. Aveda Control Force met all of my hair spray needs, and exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this hairspray for 3 months I have noticed that it is a light, non-sticky spray with long-lasting hold. Control Force will not leave your hair feeling crunchy, or looking over teased. Its light texture allows you to keep a style for days at a time, or change their style throughout the day. This hairspray will not leave your hair with flakes, or scalp left with any buildup.  Since this product is from Aveda, it does have the noticeable Aveda aromas, which are natural, and non-chemical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One issue that may occur is spray buildup on the nozzle. This does tend to happen about once a month; however, you can easily fix this issue by running the nozzle under hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Control Force comes in a 9.1 oz. aerosol can, and retails at $28.00. This may seem expensive for a hairspray, but the cans will last 5-6 months. Compared to other high-quality sprays, it is only $2-$3 more, and with Control Force you are getting an all-natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an all-natural, high quality, firm hold spray, I highly recommend purchasing Aveda Control Force Hairspray.</li>
            <li> Best spray ever! Great can hold!</li>
            <li> The first purchase seemed to hold better, this one doesn&#x27;t seem to have the holding power but it must be me. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with thinning at the top. I was using non aerosol pumps all summer, having the hairdresser leave more on the top. I made the mistake of getting a haircut at Mastercuts in the local mall, and got scalped. Control Force to the rescue! I&#x27;ve been using Aveda since the Horst Rechelbacher days, and will always enjoy Aveda, even if it creeps into the synthetic Estee Lauder protocol over time. If you&#x27;ve got money to burn, get the original aerosol. It smells like pine, and you can layer for more hold. I can&#x27;t afford 2 cans, so I got this one, minus the pleasant smell. As the product dries, the smell dissipates. Style memory, 5 stars. Just knowing that your hold is dependable is reason enough to not get big box store garbage product that \\&quot;everyone else uses.\\&quot; Love Aveda, Love Amazon.com.</li>
