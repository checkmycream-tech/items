            <li>This is great stuff.  </li>
            <li>Place in a warm room the day before use for best results!</li>

            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Was very excited since reading about tamanu and great effects.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>THIS, SMELL IS LOVELY, AND HAS TAMANU, GREAT NUT GROWN ON A TREE, AND IS FABULOUS</li>
            <li>My skin is looking better than ever.</li>
            <li>love this and will never use anything else.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff it seem to be working on my ruff elbows</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I literally love it</li>
            <li>It just sits on top of the skin.</li>
            <li>perhaps I need to give it more time to see results.</li>
            <li>Fewer breakouts, healthy looking complexion with fewer wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>had originally got this for eczema.</li>
            <li>, it just feels good and fresh and soft.</li>
            <li>I even went to great lengths in stirring in container and still dry.</li>
            <li>I really loved this product, and had tried it after another reviewer of Tamanu essential oil recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But you scoop out a tiny bit and work it into your hands, ideally after washing them or bathing when they&#x27;re still warm &amp; slightly damp, and let it soak in.</li>
            <li>It is more waxy than a lot of other products but it warms into a nice consistency.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very mild &amp; neutral, much like the scent of shea.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use most hand creams because my skin is too sensitive.</li>
            <li>I am 70 years old and I love the feel of my skin after cleansing and using this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was soft and easy to spread, becoming softer at body temperature and absorbing well into the skin.</li>
            <li>I also use on my kids when they have any sort of rash and it clears it right up.</li>
            <li>This stuff is thick but it works great, doesn&#x27;t rub off on your cloths.</li>
            <li>I used it on my skin for several days but it never got better.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really like the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Very dissappointed and recommend that this be a pass.</li>
            <li>Very gentle to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I used on my very dry lips and it made an immediate difference that stayed smooth for hours.  </li>
            <li>I have used this daily on my face at night for the last several months and love the results!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as strong as straight tamanu oil, just a slight hint of the nutty smell.  </li>
            <li>Your feet.are just like new feet again...</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it, especially in the winter, after gardening, too much hand-washing, etc.</li>
            <li>Made my skin feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>several times a day I smear a bit of this butter on the area and the area ia beginning to look normal again.</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing when applied to my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>at first the smell was a little overpowering but product made a tremendous improvement in my dry, chemo related skin!!--just</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding it very helpful for my very dry skin after only 2 days</li>
            <li>A little oily at first</li>
            <li>very dry like they sold an old product off the shelf.</li>

            <li> very dry like they sold an old product off the shelf.</li>
            <li> I used this after being in the sun in Arizona for a bit too long; took the redness and sting away almost instantly.</li>
            <li> I might like this product if it were more &amp;#34;usable.&amp;#34; The butter is so stiff it hardly comes out of the jar, and it does not melt when warmed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is wonderful. My skin is looking better than ever. I use it after showers and at bedtime. A little oily at first but it gradually soaks in. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I just tried this and like it.  It goes on smoothly and is not greasy.  Smells good.  I&#x27;m using it for the eczema on my legs.</li>
            <li> .&lt;br /&gt;I love this and will never use anything else. Your feet.are just like new feet again...i cannot explain how you.feel.&lt;br /&gt;Arms...legs..&lt;br /&gt;All I can say ..try it ..you won&#x27;t  waste.your money</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  I used it on my rough feet and it worked well.  It is more waxy than a lot of other products but it warms into a nice consistency.</li>
            <li> AM still useing it i love this stuff it seem to be working on my ruff elbows thank u</li>
            <li> I have eczema, and my medication is crazy expensive. I can&#x27;t use most hand creams because my skin is too sensitive. My MIL suggested tamanu to my husband, so we bought this to give it a try. It works wonderfully! It&#x27;s a very firm ointment, not really a cream at all. But you scoop out a tiny bit and work it into your hands, ideally after washing them or bathing when they&#x27;re still warm &amp; slightly damp, and let it soak in. It stays oily for a short while, but it does soak in. I haven&#x27;t had to use my medicated ointment since getting this--my hands haven&#x27;t felt so good in years! I recommended this to a friend who suffers from psoriasis, and she loves it, too. Very gentle to sensitive skin. The fragrance is very mild &amp; neutral, much like the scent of shea. I recommend anyone who has dry skin or eczema to give this a try.</li>
            <li> recently have used this on a healing scrape on my hand but because I had not benn oiling the lesion, the skin aroond the actual lesion was discolored and raised. several times a day I smear a bit of this butter on the area and the area ia beginning to look normal again.</li>
            <li> Heals skin within three days!</li>
            <li> This stuff is thick but it works great, doesn&#x27;t rub off on your cloths. Love it. Try it you&#x27;ll like it</li>
            <li> It felt like it was going to work as the description said it would after one application. Made my skin feel soft and supple. Will see how the results are later down the line.</li>
            <li> I might like this product if it were more &amp;#34;usable.&amp;#34; The butter is so stiff it hardly comes out of the jar, and it does not melt when warmed! It&#x27;s not creamy at all.</li>
            <li> Love this. I used on my very dry lips and it made an immediate difference that stayed smooth for hours.  Doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as strong as straight tamanu oil, just a slight hint of the nutty smell.  Very pleased. i want to put this in an empty lip balm container and use as a lip balm.</li>
            <li> I heard about tamanu oil on Dr. Ozshow. I ordered like five different products.&lt;br /&gt;I have horrible jean burn on my otherwise smooth bottom. I&#x27;ve had it all my life. This got rid of my jean burn. It&#x27;s the best!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made of natural ingredients. There is nothing in this that is bad for you. I literally love it and I hope they never stop making it. I&#x27;m a customer for life.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE! don&#x27;t stop making and selling this. I don&#x27;t want to have to experiment again with other products.</li>
            <li> Altho it is greasy when applied I&#x27;m finding it very helpful for my very dry skin after only 2 days</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing when applied to my dry skin.  It is extremely greasy and does not absorb AT ALL!  It just sits on top of the skin. If applied at night, your sheets and clothes will be sticky.</li>
            <li> I am 70 years old and I love the feel of my skin after cleansing and using this product.  Nothing extravagant, it just feels good and fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> Cleared up psoriasis well</li>
            <li> B UY THIS, SMELL IS LOVELY, AND HAS TAMANU, GREAT NUT GROWN ON A TREE, AND IS FABULOUS</li>
            <li> had originally got this for eczema. I used it on my skin for several days but it never got better. perhaps I need to give it more time to see results. only bought this based on other people&#x27;s review. I did try the cleansing bar (same name and such) and it seemed like it helped a bit.</li>
            <li> I used this after being in the sun in Arizona for a bit too long; took the redness and sting away almost instantly. I really like the way it makes my skin feel. Will keep using.</li>
            <li> Was very excited since reading about tamanu and great effects.&lt;br /&gt;After receiving this product, i immediately opened jar that evening and it was not creamy..very dry like they sold an old product off the shelf. I even went to great lengths in stirring in container and still dry. Very dissappointed and recommend that this be a pass. Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream ever for all of the above-dry hands, face, feet! Can&#x27;t live without it, especially in the winter, after gardening, too much hand-washing, etc.</li>
            <li> at first the smell was a little overpowering but product made a tremendous improvement in my dry, chemo related skin!!--just ordered 2 at a time so I wouldn&#x27;t run out!!--can&#x27;t find this in ANY store!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this daily on my face at night for the last several months and love the results! Fewer breakouts, healthy looking complexion with fewer wrinkles. This stuff is amazing. I also use on my kids when they have any sort of rash and it clears it right up. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I really loved this product, and had tried it after another reviewer of Tamanu essential oil recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it because of the ingredients - they hit all the mainstays of skin nourishment and protection - but also because of the ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was soft and easy to spread, becoming softer at body temperature and absorbing well into the skin. I think the reviewer that thought it was hard might have been trying to use it too cold. Place in a warm room the day before use for best results!</li>
