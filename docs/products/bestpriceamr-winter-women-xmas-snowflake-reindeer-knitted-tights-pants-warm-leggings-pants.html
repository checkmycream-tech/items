            <li>They also do not have a specified front and back so if you have any kind of &amp;#34;curve&amp;#34; to your backside they do not cover it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2 and 140 pounds, this wouldn&#x27;t even fit a thigh with the whole materials that makes up the product!!</li>

            <li> Bad product!Ripped right at the bottom in class the first time i wore it.</li>
            <li> very thin and cheap...</li>
            <li> If your not a very petite girl do not buy.</li>
            <li> What could go wrong, right?</li>
            <li> sizing was not right</li>
            <li> I thought they were a dark brown</li>
            <li> Because of the use of both beige and black, they can be worn with almost anything.</li>
            <li> but they are black.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really tight.</li>
            <li> The hips did not fit at all</li>
            <li> too small.  </li>
            <li> When I attempted to try them on, I couldn&#x27;t even get them past my thighs.</li>
            <li> Material of unknown weird plastic.</li>
            <li> Print also is actually different than what I had ordered, so I&#x27;m a little disappointed with that.</li>
            <li> I mean, they&#x27;re leggings.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m  5&#x27;5 and 100lbs, the material was really thin though, and as soon as I washed them, they practically disintegrated.</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> So sad.</li>
            <li> the were ripped, there were holes all over the legs :(</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re really tight. If your not a very petite girl do not buy.</li>
            <li> very thin and cheap...sizing was not right</li>
            <li> These are SO incredibly big, and definitely wouldn&#x27;t call these leggings, rather they would be pants.  Print also is actually different than what I had ordered, so I&#x27;m a little disappointed with that.</li>
            <li> cute for xmass winter time very cute n warm</li>
            <li> Poor quality, but you get what you pay for. First time putting them on they ripped in the middle. Trash and out close to $10.</li>
            <li> too small.  gave them to my daughter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2 and 140 pounds, this wouldn&#x27;t even fit a thigh with the whole materials that makes up the product!!</li>
            <li> The tights ripped while  trying on. Legs way too short. Child size. Material of unknown weird plastic. JUNK junk junk</li>
            <li> I received this today, needless to say when I opened the package and tried them on (which I was so excited about!!) the were ripped, there were holes all over the legs :( I&#x27;ve been so excited about these ever since I ordered them and now I&#x27;m bummed! The quality is just crappy. If u even touch them they just fall apart like fuzz falling off . Very disappointed and will not purchase again!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these at a mall kiosk for my 8th grade daughter before Christmas. I paid $20. They&#x27;re adorable and keep her toasty warm. She gets compliments on them whenever she wears them.</li>
            <li> Plenty of stretch and a wonderful design. The blue is darker in person, but that&#x27;s likely a color setting issue. Because of the use of both beige and black, they can be worn with almost anything.</li>
            <li> Very  bad ..bad size.too short.and horrible quality....first day used and is broke between legs.</li>
            <li> I am an average sized girl (5&#x27;6 and 140 lbs) and was super excited to buy these one-size-fits-all adorable aztec print winter leggings. I just knew I was totally gonna love them. I mean, they&#x27;re leggings. What could go wrong, right? WRONG. When I attempted to try them on, I couldn&#x27;t even get them past my thighs. The material wasn&#x27;t stretchy AT ALL. There is no way these leggings are one-size-fits-all. If you are a fourth grader, I recommend these leggings, but otherwise don&#x27;t even bother. I was highly disappointed with my purchase</li>
            <li> Very cute but very cheap material..... second time I wore them I noticed three holes in the crotch!</li>
            <li> They fit me perfect, a bit short but I loved em, I&#x27;m  5&#x27;5 and 100lbs, the material was really thin though, and as soon as I washed them, they practically disintegrated. So sad. I never even got to wear them out, I had to just toss em. You honestly don&#x27;t even get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Bad product!Ripped right at the bottom in class the first time i wore it.Had to cover up with my jacket.</li>
            <li> Junk, Don&#x27;t buy these. They ripped before i had my into them. Yiu can see the stitches falling apart</li>
            <li> Horrible... Way too short- no way it could be one size fits all. Too small to fit anyone other than maybe a child.</li>
            <li> These tights were way too short in the leg and almost weren&#x27;t covered by my boots.  They also do not have a specified front and back so if you have any kind of &amp;#34;curve&amp;#34; to your backside they do not cover it!</li>
            <li> Clearly these were not made for women! The hips did not fit at all and there was a hole in the crotch. Cheap quality.</li>
            <li> Too short no mention of inseem does not work for long legs and no info for return or phone number.</li>
            <li> I thought they were a dark brown but they are black.</li>
            <li> Not the greatest material..</li>
            <li> Cute patterned leggings, but be warned: they are very small.</li>
            <li> Awful! Broke right away and there were a lot of unfinished seams</li>
