            <li>Just perfect.</li>

            <li>great product  if dentalflooss gets stuck and te  ar between your teeth  </li>
            <li>The picks are very nice for cleaning between teeth.  </li>
            <li>Very nice.  </li>
            <li>Received the Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks and find them to do a very nice job removing bits of food lodged between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Using this pick is a good  way to  get in between teeth to remove particles of food.  </li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, shipped really fast</li>
            <li>I have problems with food getting caught between my teeth, and these new Brushpicks are the best thing I have been able to find in order to clean them out.  </li>
            <li>I love these toothpicks.</li>
            <li>These are simply the best toothpicks I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Well these are my all-time favorite tooth picks.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are a better option (I think) than dental floss as they can be used to massage the gum tissue BETWEEN the teeth - something that floss cannot</li>
            <li>The brush cleans better.</li>
            <li>you  iam buying more togive as gifts</li>
            <li>Better than a tooth pick because its flexible, but not too flexible.</li>
            <li>The Brushpicks are fine except for one thing-- I would love for the stick to be MORE RIGID--it breaks off when food gets between some of my teeth.</li>
            <li>They also slide easily between most of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>They are good quality and gentle.</li>
            <li>See Dentek easy brushes.</li>
            <li>It helps to a good flossing job even though they aren&#x27;t technically floss.</li>
            <li>Luckily I bought two.  </li>
            <li>But it works really well leaving clean spaces between the teeth free of any food or plaque.  </li>
            <li>the Brush Picks can&#x27;t slide up through the tips of two teeth like floss can, which ultimately makes floss the winner for cleaning teeth, but these are handy to keep in your pocket/purse for on the go and a more appropriate cleaning of teeth in public.</li>
            <li>I have gotten all my friends addicted to them as well, I just pass my container around the table after a wonderful meal, and we all just pick away!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>These however, slide right between teeth and get any food particles out with ease.</li>
            <li>I started using these dental picks right after I got my braces off.</li>
            <li>but I was looking for bristle brush to clean between teeth gently.</li>
            <li>These are great for those hard to get at spaces in between your teeth.</li>
            <li>These picks work better than the wooden toothpicks.</li>
            <li>The Soft Picks are thicker and don&#x27;t fit as well between my teeth as the Brush Picks</li>
            <li>For the first time ever my Dentist gave my oral hygiene</li>
            <li>First attempt to use brush and it collapsed.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know how to open this, so I pulled the top off.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even always brush my teeth as much as they recommend.</li>
            <li>These are really just toothpicks</li>
            <li>These work very well to fix that problem.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really care for these, some of the brush ends bend off immediately.</li>
            <li>In comparison to the Soft Picks, I like these a lot better for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush on the other end is also good after to just go through each tooth one last time.  </li>
            <li>The brush has a very small, but strong stem and it slips easily between my teeth while the wider brush does the job.  </li>
            <li>The brushy end on the Brush Picks is flexible so it feels pretty soft on my gums</li>
            <li>Brush picks are such a good idea, I didn&#x27;t realize what I had been missing.  </li>
            <li>I recommend them highly.</li>
            <li>I found them super helpful, mostly because I&#x27;m on the road a lot and can&#x27;t floss behind the wheel.</li>
            <li>Now, I can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li>they really get into places that no other product can.</li>
            <li>I will go back to using real dental brushes.</li>
            <li>Have bought other brands and the brush on them is too big to fit between teeth.</li>
            <li>One side has that feathery stuff that goes between the teeth easily, and the other side has a little gentle point.  </li>
            <li>I realized, too late, that you open it by sliding the top piece to the side, and shake.  </li>
            <li>You have to be gentle when you use it between your teeth especially the ones in the back.  </li>
            <li>The Brush Picks have two different ends (a brush and a pick) and the Soft Picks only one&lt;</li>
            <li>The Brush Picks are sturdier than the Soft Picks, the Soft PIcks bend in half easily which make it hard to get the back teeth</li>

            <li> I love these toothpicks. Have bought other brands and the brush on them is too big to fit between teeth. These however, slide right between teeth and get any food particles out with ease.</li>
            <li> For the first time ever my Dentist gave my oral hygiene an A+. I know it was the twice daily use of these picks which gave me the edge. I don&#x27;t even always brush my teeth as much as they recommend. I was very happy to get a good grade.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed after reading reviews. These are really just toothpicks but I was looking for bristle brush to clean between teeth gently. This is single piece of plastic and bristles are flat rather than being 360 degrees as expected. First attempt to use brush and it collapsed. Couldn&#x27;t even finish cleaning all my teeth. I will go back to using real dental brushes. These are useless! Only buy if you want plastic toothpicks. See Dentek easy brushes. They are good quality and gentle.</li>
            <li> Nothing better...gets down deep into the gums.</li>
            <li> These are simply the best toothpicks I&#x27;ve ever used. I recommend them highly. They offer multiple surfaces to nudge between your teeth, both to expel debris and to scrape off plaque.</li>
            <li> Well these are my all-time favorite tooth picks.  One side has that feathery stuff that goes between the teeth easily, and the other side has a little gentle point.  I prefer the feathery side.  I use these every day.  Great for getting particles out from between my teeth.</li>
            <li> My wife brought some of these home after she had a dental procedure so, I tried them. So I went on line and found them here. I found them super helpful, mostly because I&#x27;m on the road a lot and can&#x27;t floss behind the wheel. The brush end of the pick can be a little aggressive and painful if you have tender gums.</li>
            <li> The best toothpick EVER!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how to open this, so I pulled the top off.  BIG mistake.  It fell on the floor and ALL of the picks fell out!  Luckily I bought two.  I realized, too late, that you open it by sliding the top piece to the side, and shake.  That package has fallen, with no problems.  The picks are very nice for cleaning between teeth.  I hate being out and getting a piece of food stuck between my teeth.  These work very well to fix that problem.</li>
            <li> I have been a user of Doctors Brushpicks for years now.&lt;br /&gt;They are a better option (I think) than dental floss as they can be used to massage the gum tissue BETWEEN the teeth - something that floss cannot do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I unequivocally recommend Doctors Brushpicks</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t do braces with out these.  I am always sorry if I leave home without them.  These get in and out of places where food gets stuck.  Very nice.  They also slide easily between most of my teeth.  It helps to a good flossing job even though they aren&#x27;t technically floss.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery. Product as advertised.</li>
            <li> You have to be gentle when you use it between your teeth especially the ones in the back.  But it works really well leaving clean spaces between the teeth free of any food or plaque.  The brush on the other end is also good after to just go through each tooth one last time.  Again be careful for the back teeth.  The only thing I wish it would improve is the brush.  It seems to bend and eventually become a narrow stick and the bristles dont stay as long as I wish allowing you to brush through each tooth.  Good product.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I started using these dental picks right after I got my braces off. Now, I can&#x27;t live without them. They come with me everywhere.</li>
            <li> These are the best things invented since dental floss for your teeth. they really get into places that no other product can. And say goodbye to wooden toothpick splinters.</li>
            <li> I have problems with food getting caught between my teeth, and these new Brushpicks are the best thing I have been able to find in order to clean them out.  The brush has a very small, but strong stem and it slips easily between my teeth while the wider brush does the job.  I also like the fact that the box contains 275 brushpicks, so that my supply lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Came on time. Work well like those I&#x27;ve had before</li>
            <li> Received the Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks and find them to do a very nice job removing bits of food lodged between my teeth.  Just what I hoped for.</li>
            <li> We prefer using these instead of wood.  The brush cleans better.</li>
            <li> I have gotten all my friends addicted to them as well, I just pass my container around the table after a wonderful meal, and we all just pick away!!!!!!  Please oh Please don&#x27;t ever stop making them!!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really care for these, some of the brush ends bend off immediately.</li>
            <li> Brush picks are such a good idea, I didn&#x27;t realize what I had been missing.  They get down into the cracks where Proxabrushes&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t reach.  My friends are amazed.a</li>
            <li> great product  if dentalflooss gets stuck and te  ar between your teeth  thi s is the ideal pick for you  iam buying more togive as gifts</li>
            <li> These are great for those hard to get at spaces in between your teeth. Better than a tooth pick because its flexible, but not too flexible. Just perfect.</li>
