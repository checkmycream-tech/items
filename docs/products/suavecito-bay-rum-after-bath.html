    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>My husband bought this because he thought it was the greatest stuff on earth.</li>
            <li>Women- if you want your man to smell like a 70-yr-old then it will be perfect for him.</li>
            <li>A very good aftershave.</li>
            <li>If you love clove like I do, this is awesome.  </li>
            <li>I Love it, keep up the good work!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the product is great, but it&#x27;s not how I want to smell.</li>
            <li>Nice glassbottle.</li>
            <li>Classic Bay Rum and smells perfect</li>
            <li>Great light scent not over powering more on the clover side.</li>
            <li>We both love the scent.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that smells very manly.</li>
            <li>I came here because I use their pomade and love it.</li>
            <li>I have since purchased many others.</li>
            <li>Since trying others, I can say that the Suavecito brand has a notable lack of staying power.  </li>
            <li>Cloves, if you like that smell than you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my shave</li>
            <li>and suavecito is more Colvery but</li>
            <li>the sexy scent suavecito pomade gives your hair all day.</li>
            <li>So, basing my opinion purely on the ones I&#x27;ve experienced, I can say that I truly enjoy the smell of this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember it smelling like cloves so strongly.</li>
            <li>As a man, I don&#x27;t want to smell so strongly that people in my conference rooms look around trying to figure out who smells like cloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>At first the clubman has more of an alcohol</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an avid user of suavecito pomade for years and have fallen in love (so has my girlfriend) with the smell.</li>
            <li>To me it seems more like a pleasant background scent that doesn&#x27;t jump out at people, instead just makes them appreciate that there something subtly pleasing about the wearer.  </li>
            <li>It is relatively inexpensive and feels nice after a shave.</li>
            <li>It kind of takes away from the traditional packaging of the glass medicine bottle.</li>
            <li>This stuff has a refreshing and natural smell of warm spices that is clearly manly but mellow enough that anyone can enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately although Suavecito is an amazing company and has great pomade, this particular product wasn&#x27;t of my liking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely buying your pomade though! :)</li>
            <li>I think there are better Bay Rums out there in the same price range.</li>
            <li>This was my first bay rum purchase.</li>
            <li>When first applied, it has a medicinal smell which I attribute to the alcohol used.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s just something I don&#x27;t like about most scents getting up my nose all day long and realizing that smell is coming from me.</li>
            <li>My only issue since I started using it is that it wears off very quickly.</li>
            <li>I really like the clove scent.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>As the alcohol evaporates, the remaining smell is very pleasing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want a cloud of aftershave stink surrounding me when I enter a room, but if I go through the trouble of putting on a nice smelling aftershave, its a bit of a downer to not have it noticed in close quarters.</li>
            <li>purchased bay rum soap (from different maker) and it doesn&#x27;t have anywhere near the strong scent of this</li>
            <li>During researching the product, they claimed &amp;#34;Bay Rum&amp;#34; was a classic scent.</li>
            <li>Gives me a classic scent that I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who likes a simple fresh smell.</li>
            <li>If had any other criticism, it&#x27;s the cheap laser printed sticker for the label.</li>
            <li>100% classic old man smell</li>
            <li>As a young boy my barber would put Bay Rum on me like he did with my dad.</li>
            <li>My grandfather was a barber, but he wore clubmans or old spice.</li>
            <li>While getting ready, I&#x27;ll put some on after a shower and shave, and by the time I&#x27;m finished getting dressed, there is the faintest hint left.</li>
            <li>Nowhere near the strength, projection and longevity of the Clubman.</li>
            <li>Similar though in profile, this one stays very close to the skin.</li>
            <li>This seems like a tacky aftershave an old man would bathe themselves in, not</li>
            <li>was super excited to receive it, only to be disappointed by the IMMENSELY strong smell that came off from the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I should add it to a rum cake or use it to light a fire.</li>
            <li>the dry down of the Savecito is light for the face and Pinaud is definetly for the body....</li>

            <li> Purchased for my husband.  We both love the scent.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Awful smelling stuff , but disappears in 5 minutes. As a young boy my barber would put Bay Rum on me like he did with my dad. I don&#x27;t remember it smelling like cloves so strongly. I like the smell of cloves on a ham, but not on my body!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of cologne. There&#x27;s just something I don&#x27;t like about most scents getting up my nose all day long and realizing that smell is coming from me. They seem so artificial and overpowering even in small doses.  That being said, I find myself feeling naked if I forget to put on my Bay Rum in the morning. This stuff has a refreshing and natural smell of warm spices that is clearly manly but mellow enough that anyone can enjoy it. To me it seems more like a pleasant background scent that doesn&#x27;t jump out at people, instead just makes them appreciate that there something subtly pleasing about the wearer.  This is the scent I&#x27;ve always wanted but never found until now. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this because he thought it was the greatest stuff on earth. Women- if you want your man to smell like a 70-yr-old then it will be perfect for him. If not, pursue him to get something else.</li>
            <li> I really like the clove scent. It is not overbearing. I recommend it to anyone who likes a simple fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately although Suavecito is an amazing company and has great pomade, this particular product wasn&#x27;t of my liking.&lt;br /&gt;I was super excited to receive it, only to be disappointed by the IMMENSELY strong smell that came off from the product. It doesn&#x27;t last too long either, but the scent is truly overpowering. I don&#x27;t know how some customers have stated that it is &amp;#34;subtle&amp;#34; or that it has a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent. It really doesn&#x27;t. As a man, I don&#x27;t want to smell so strongly that people in my conference rooms look around trying to figure out who smells like cloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased bay rum soap (from different maker) and it doesn&#x27;t have anywhere near the strong scent of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not buying ever again.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Suavecito. I&#x27;m definitely buying your pomade though! :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product that smells very manly. I wish the scent stayed on longer, but it works well</li>
            <li> If you like to smell like cloves this is the product for you. I prefer not to smell like the spice cabinet. I immediately smelled it when I opened the package, which took forever to get here, and was appalled at its stench. I tried to do a return, but Amazon wouldn&#x27;t let me. Now I am stuck with a bottle of this stuff. I&#x27;m not sure if I should add it to a rum cake or use it to light a fire. Whatever it&#x27;s actually use is I guarantee it won&#x27;t touch my body.</li>
            <li> If you love clove like I do, this is awesome.  The only issue is that the scent has a very short life span (five minutes or so).</li>
            <li> During researching the product, they claimed &amp;#34;Bay Rum&amp;#34; was a classic scent. Well that may be, but it&#x27;s nothing i&#x27;ve smelled before! To me, it smells like meat pie or a baked ham. It smells like cloves! I&#x27;m sure the product is great, but it&#x27;s not how I want to smell. I came here because I use their pomade and love it.</li>
            <li> Classic Bay Rum and smells perfect</li>
            <li> I think there are better Bay Rums out there in the same price range. This one is a little harsh smelling.</li>
            <li> Showed up in 2 days! I really like the bay rum aftershave that layrite makes, and this one is a few dollars cheaper. It seems like it will do the job!</li>
            <li> This was my first bay rum purchase. I have since purchased many others. I&#x27;m not sure what an old school bay rum should actually smell like. My grandfather was a barber, but he wore clubmans or old spice. So, basing my opinion purely on the ones I&#x27;ve experienced, I can say that I truly enjoy the smell of this. When first applied, it has a medicinal smell which I attribute to the alcohol used. As the alcohol evaporates, the remaining smell is very pleasing. Sort of spicy and masculine, but not too dark. My only issue since I started using it is that it wears off very quickly. Before I tried other brands, I just attributed this to the nature of bay rum. Since trying others, I can say that the Suavecito brand has a notable lack of staying power.  While getting ready, I&#x27;ll put some on after a shower and shave, and by the time I&#x27;m finished getting dressed, there is the faintest hint left. I don&#x27;t want a cloud of aftershave stink surrounding me when I enter a room, but if I go through the trouble of putting on a nice smelling aftershave, its a bit of a downer to not have it noticed in close quarters. I still wear it, but I never get the compliments I receive when I wear other brands. It is relatively inexpensive and feels nice after a shave. If had any other criticism, it&#x27;s the cheap laser printed sticker for the label. It kind of takes away from the traditional packaging of the glass medicine bottle. But, these labels seem to be the standard, even for much more expensive bay rums, so I won&#x27;t hold it against them.</li>
            <li> Cinnamon and clove similar to the Clubman version. Nowhere near the strength, projection and longevity of the Clubman. Similar though in profile, this one stays very close to the skin. This won&#x27;t blow out the people at the job. A steal for the price. A very good aftershave.</li>
            <li> Gives me a classic scent that I&#x27;ve been looking for. Definitely buying this again. I Love it, keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> Cloves, if you like that smell than you&#x27;ll love this. Nice glassbottle. I still perfer Clubman for the $10 price range.</li>
            <li> 100% classic old man smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my shave</li>
            <li> Great light scent not over powering more on the clover side. Compared to Pinaud Clubman bay rum? At first the clubman has more of an alcohol&lt;br /&gt;Scent and suavecito is more Colvery but the dry down of the Savecito is light for the face and Pinaud is definetly for the body....longevity is why I gave 4 stars.... Pinaud last longér.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an avid user of suavecito pomade for years and have fallen in love (so has my girlfriend) with the smell. I read reviews online this after shave smells like the pomade. But it does not. This seems like a tacky aftershave an old man would bathe themselves in, not the sexy scent suavecito pomade gives your hair all day.</li>
