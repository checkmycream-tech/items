            <li>Works great, but doesn&#x27;t have the same tingle that I got when it was used on me at the salon.</li>
            <li>and I think I am almost free of those ancient woes.</li>
            <li>I use it on my short hair once or twice a week and have had great results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used good hair products but eventually a residue builds and this is like the thing that really just cleans it all out of my hair, to start a fresh.</li>
            <li>very fresh smelling on hair, leaves it soft..keeps scalp clean with the herbal tea tree products.</li>
            <li>It makes you hair feel really clean</li>

            <li>It smells yummy in the shower, it feels tingly and soothing on your scalp and shoulders, and it leaves hair clean and manageable.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, I have an itchy scalp and this completely takes care of that.</li>
            <li>this is my first choice of shampoo, particular for my very oil head and hair, it brings me dry and clean and comfortable!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo!</li>
            <li>The hype is real.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Will know better  in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for folks with sensitive skin or flaky scalps.</li>
            <li>Ordering it via amazon wasn&#x27;t my first choice, but they were out here at our local salon store(s).</li>
            <li>Also, it has transformed my rough, rebellious hair into something worthy of praise.</li>
            <li>Thankfully it wasn&#x27;t the whole bottle, and it was wrapped in plastic, so the other items were not harmed.</li>

            <li> Sure it&#x27;s a little pricey, but that cheap crap from head and shoulders as well as denerex never helped the flaking so if you are the same way give it a try.</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but the product works fantastic.</li>
            <li> I also have a little red cocker spaniel with several skin allergies and this product also helps that problem.</li>

            <li> I got a differently shaped GREEN bottle.  </li>
            <li> Dried out my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little to expensive if you ask me, but it&#x27;s what he likes.</li>
            <li> It made my hair worse............</li>
            <li> I held off on buying this shampoo because it was so expensive.</li>
            <li> sorry to say that I will never bring anything from you again.......</li>
            <li> It was horrible...........</li>

            <li> Works great for my daughter who has severe dandruff and sensitive scalp issues. Smells great. Good value  for the price.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on me for my dandruff, so  that is why I looked it up on the web - couldn&#x27;t  find it in the store.  It seems to be working just great.  Will know better  in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but the product works fantastic. Leaves my scalp feeling smooth and relaxed. Highly recommended for folks with sensitive skin or flaky scalps.</li>

Sure it&#x27;s a little pricey, but that cheap crap from head and shoulders as well as denerex never helped the flaking so if you are the same way give it a try.</li>
            <li> I held off on buying this shampoo because it was so expensive. Now I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited. My scalp itching (I don&#x27;t have dandruff, just itching) is gone within a week of using this! I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Great smelling shampoo, works great. I have received many compliments on how great my hair smells. What recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> makes my head feel good and I enjoy the smell. I highly recommend. my wife also likes how I smell after a shower</li>
            <li> This shampoo was suggested to us by our hair stylist and it works well on controlling dandruff. Plus, it has a great minty smell. My son uses it several times a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on/off for about 3 years... very fresh smelling on hair, leaves it soft..keeps scalp clean with the herbal tea tree products.</li>
            <li> This is my husbands favorite shampoo. It&#x27;s a little to expensive if you ask me, but it&#x27;s what he likes. Ordering it via amazon wasn&#x27;t my first choice, but they were out here at our local salon store(s). It leaked all over the package when it arrived. Thankfully it wasn&#x27;t the whole bottle, and it was wrapped in plastic, so the other items were not harmed.</li>
            <li> this is my first choice of shampoo, particular for my very oil head and hair, it brings me dry and clean and comfortable!</li>
            <li> Dried out my hair and scalp. Definitely not what I had hoped. Kinda scared it was counterfeit since the bottle warns that it might be if not bought from a salon.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest shampoo.  It makes you hair feel really clean and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair look wash out if you hair has coloring.  Also the smell is out of the world.  With this product your hair and scalp feels really clean.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and works amazing.</li>
            <li> The description says WHITE.  I got a differently shaped GREEN bottle.  Don&#x27;t know what the difference is.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo! The smell is great, it lathers well, and it cleans my hair wonderfully without stripping it of moisture! It leaves my hair soft, light, and smelling great! I highly recommend this shampoo!</li>
            <li> It smells yummy in the shower, it feels tingly and soothing on your scalp and shoulders, and it leaves hair clean and manageable. Exhilarating!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used good hair products but eventually a residue builds and this is like the thing that really just cleans it all out of my hair, to start a fresh. Don&#x27;t shampoo, unless you have Tea Tree to flush the build-up.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo!  Invigerating, smells great and my hair looks healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> Works great, but doesn&#x27;t have the same tingle that I got when it was used on me at the salon. Would still recommend, for short hair this bottle will last you a while!</li>
            <li> The hype is real. This is perhaps the best shampoo in the world for those of us with dandruff problems and flaking, itchy scalp. It&#x27;s been about two weeks of usage and I think I am almost free of those ancient woes. Also, it has transformed my rough, rebellious hair into something worthy of praise. Thank you Paul Mitchell!</li>
            <li> This is really great for my hair. I am graying rapidly and my hair is usually very dry after shampooing, so I also use a Paul Mitchell conditioner. This shampoo has a great smell, not girly and feels great, makes my scalp tingle and feel cool. Most importantly, I have an itchy scalp and this completely takes care of that. I recommend this.</li>
            <li> Better than any shampoo I have ever used</li>
            <li> This minty shampoo with a bit of a ZING  is great in the morning to get you going.. after soaping my hair I spread the lather onto my face for shaving in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I love the aroma and tingle but for some it may be a bit too strong for the eyes... so take care around kids or save this for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;I always keep a spare so I dont run out.&lt;br /&gt;Im a guy with short hair so this lasts for me - maybe a month or longer with 5 uses a week</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new shampoo.  Had been using the stuff at the gym and it was leaving a film in my hair.  This solved the problem and then some.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> It was horrible...........it made severe dandruff, irritation, inflammation in the scalp, no tingling sensation at all!!!!!! It made my hair worse............sorry to say that I will never bring anything from you again.......</li>
            <li> This shampoo can&#x27;t be beat! I used to have all kinds of scalp problems (itching &amp; breakouts) and this is the only product I&#x27;ve ever found that stops all the symptoms. I also have a little red cocker spaniel with several skin allergies and this product also helps that problem. Great product!</li>
            <li> Did not work well.. Tried using this still dandruff didnot go,... not a helpful item to purchase... but hair is good</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great, tingles and cleans my scalp very well. I use it on my short hair once or twice a week and have had great results.</li>
            <li> Makes my scalp tingle. Nothing makes me feel cleaner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great shampoo but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. It hasn&#x27;t reduced my dandruff. Still on the lookout for a better product.</li>
