            <li> I was skeptical but it is pretty simple and gets it done.</li>
            <li> Does what I expected, and what was advertised.</li>
            <li> so I only need a little bit everyday.</li>
            <li> I wish there was an in-between for black and dark brown.</li>
            <li> Once it dries (which takes less than about 5 minutes), it won&#x27;t come off -- even in the rain.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very dark black.</li>
            <li> It not a good product</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any breakouts after two months of use.  </li>

            <li> Blackbeard best product ever for beards, no burning. Amazon got it to me in three days. Thanks</li>
            <li> Just for Men burned my skin so I needed to try something else.Works pretty good but it&#x27;s very dark black. I wish there was an in-between for black and dark brown. Lasts for about 6-8 hours</li>
            <li> The best product that I have used!</li>
            <li> It not a good product</li>
            <li> Does what I expected, and what was advertised. Cap&#x27;tn Jim was very helpful.</li>
            <li> Well its okay but i don&#x27;t think you can do it without messing your skin&lt;br /&gt;Not impressed with the application method</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!  It works really well with a short beard.  It covers the gray and looks very natural.  I have not experienced any breakouts after two months of use.  I have searched for this product for a long time!  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Awesome delivery, Highly recommend !</li>
            <li> Great alternative to JFM!</li>
            <li> Works well, looks natural and easy to use. I am 44 with no gray hair but lots of gray streaks in my beard that made me feel old. This product covers quickly and looks natural.</li>
            <li> The absolute best touch up I have tried.  It does not rub off...stays till you wash it out.</li>
            <li> Blackbeard is great and exactly as advertised.  Knocks off five years (maybe more!) in seconds.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> Blackbeard goes on easy, lasts all day, and washes out easy too. When I want to make a good impression, I get rid of those pesky gray hairs on my chin with a few strokes of Blackbeard for men. It really works!</li>
            <li> The brown color works perfectly, I just use a touch to wipe out the gray hairs before work. I was skeptical but it is pretty simple and gets it done.</li>
            <li> I keep my beard trimmed pretty short so I only need a little bit everyday. It definitely takes care of the gray&#x27;s. You have to make sure to wipe off the excess or it will come out in your clothes or on your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is about time for me to reorder.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing the only thing I don&#x27;t like is it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I thought it would but it good for a quick fix  say about 5 hours or so</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d be writing a review about a product for graying hair. Seems like I was a teen just last year. But at 47, things aren&#x27;t quite what they used to be, including my beard. So happy to have stumbled into this convenient and affordable product! It really does work as advertised. (Now if they can only come up with a product that&#x27;s as simple and effective in treating my gimpy hips!)</li>
            <li> this product is great.  like many other guys, i was a loyal Just For Man user until they changed the formula and my skin had a severe allergic reaction to it.  I used another product like Blackbeard and then I somehow found Blackbeard.  This stuff works!  Once it dries (which takes less than about 5 minutes), it won&#x27;t come off -- even in the rain.  You literally have to wash your face (with soap and wash cloth) to get it off.  It&#x27;s amazing.  And it looks realistic.  It lasts about 36 hours or so.  Definitely get this brand if you&#x27;re shopping for a product like this.</li>
            <li> Looks natural, stays on until wash out , without mess or irritation.</li>
