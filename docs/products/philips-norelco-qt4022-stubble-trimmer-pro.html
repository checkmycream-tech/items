    <ol>
            <li>Great trimmer!</li>
            <li>Superb trimmer.</li>
            <li>The best I have found.</li>
            <li>Great buy!!!</li>
            <li>Enter the Philips perfect stubble trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And, best of all, my wife doesn&#x27;t get on me to shave quite as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great choice for the money!</li>
            <li>The best I ever had.</li>
            <li>Works excellent.  </li>
            <li>What neither can do is give you Don Johnson&#x27;s perfect and continuous 5:00 shadow - if that&#x27;s the look you desire.</li>
            <li>stated in the product description, this is designed for the perfect stubble.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it- very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It does not fully cover the blades, therefore the unit must be held at a PERFECT angle for you to evenly cut your beard.  </li>
            <li>The best thing about this trimmer is the length settings.</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer to replace a trimmer i&#x27;d had for years and was very happy with.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best investments I&#x27;ve made!</li>
            <li>Best uses: cleaning up hairline on sides of neck and haircut touch-ups.  </li>
            <li>This is the best beard trimmer that I have found, very happy with this cordless trimmer.</li>
            <li>Works great!!</li>
            <li>Perfect item for beard trimming and the stubble look.  </li>
            <li>the trim is perfect every time.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>the look i go for is probably best termed \\&quot;scruff\\&quot; rather than stubble i guess.</li>
            <li>It keeps both of us happy!</li>
            <li>Excellent for the price.</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer 9 months ago, and I&#x27;m still very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I have had this trimmer for abt a year now and it works flawlessly.</li>
            <li>This is the best trimmer/shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Excellent</li>
            <li>Still it&#x27;s very good at what it does, and you can&#x27;t fault it for not being something it never claimed to be.</li>
            <li>The Stubble Trimmer Pro might work great for some faces, but I have found my perfect stubble exists somewhere between the \\&quot;2\\&quot; and \\&quot;3\\&quot; setting.</li>
            <li>the remingtons have the best trimmers that pop up with the press of a button but the problem is i find that these shavers tend to break after 1-2 years of use although i think they work great.</li>
            <li>It looks beautiful, it works well,</li>
            <li>lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The height adjustment mechanism for the trimmer is beautifully designed.</li>
            <li>It is washable which seams like a great option</li>
            <li>Great for that stubble look.</li>
            <li>Works Great.</li>
            <li>I use a razor to fix the edges of my beard, and then run this machine on the lowest setting over my beard for that great 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.</li>
            <li>It works great, and there&#x27;s a lot of flexibility with the length-settings.  </li>
            <li>Really happy with this.</li>
            <li>great product for all of the men in your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco Stubble Trimmer Pro does a great job of doing what it is supposed to do: trim hair and leave even stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The charge is great, and it is water proof.</li>
            <li>great for travel</li>
            <li>Great stubble trimmer its feels great in your hand</li>
            <li>In your hand it feels great.</li>
            <li>As a trimmer, it does a great job but again, not as close as an electric shaver or a razor.</li>
            <li>have found that this is perfect on its own and as a complement to the Sensotouch 3d</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you trim downwards, you get a nice even stubble trim that is literally perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with Norelco products.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is great for playing with stubble and varying the length to emphasize the jaw or neckline.</li>
            <li>I liked this product, I think it is the best in triming arround, I could give it a 5 stars but not quite yrt</li>
            <li>works great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, the quality of the product itself, in terms of look and feel, is great.</li>
            <li>Bought this a year ago and it still works great.</li>
            <li>Very nice unit, does everything descriptions said it would.  </li>
            <li>This Phillips Norelco Stubble Trimmer is amazing!</li>
            <li>I love the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and this works perfect.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and is as good as advertised!</li>
            <li>Very happy with it, had it about a year now and still going strong.</li>
            <li>A good thing because we have already lost the cleaning brush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The results are good, he got quite scruffy before because of his reluctance to shave, in case he broke out.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Stubble Trimmer Pro\\&quot; is a fairly good solution.  </li>
            <li>It works good for my purposes.  </li>
            <li>good points are it is electrically rechargeable</li>
            <li>... looks good, feels good and works like a charm...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me a good trimmer is as good as a razor.  </li>
            <li>I use it to maintain my stubble and even for body grooming (not design for it but gives good results).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was a good choice.  </li>
            <li>One pros is, the style is really good.</li>
            <li>It cuts closer the way I prefer, but doesn&#x27;t feel as good over my skin as the Philips trimmer does.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price though.</li>
            <li>It came pre-charged, and lasts for a good amount of time between charges.  </li>
            <li>Good Trimmer but charger could use a stand.....</li>
            <li>A good throw-away clipper.</li>
            <li>Been using it for about a year now, still does a good job trimming my beard.</li>
            <li>But honestly, if I can get a good 4-5 years out of the stubble trimmer w/o battery issues I&#x27;ll be happy.    </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an awesome product and has a cool sleek look.</li>
            <li>These trimmers in my opinion, is best suited for someone with peach fuzz, as opposed to someone with a full beard.</li>
            <li>And am I glad that I did!</li>
            <li>First of all, keep in mind this is not an electric shaver, so if you are expecting a perfect and close shave, you may not get it with the Qt4022.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>what more could you ask for!</li>
            <li>This has been easy for hubby to keep me happy.</li>
            <li>QT4022/41 is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I had been using a cheap hair trimmer from a B&amp;M store, whose battery had lost a great deal of capacity over time - I still have this trimmer, and its battery lasts for minutes after extended charging.</li>
            <li>* handy build in adjustable guard</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s good for more than just stubble and can be used for longer hair too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice, sleek design.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It also just looks good---a nice design and color.  </li>
            <li>These kind of just look like a petite version of the clippers a barber might use.</li>
            <li>Kind of a pain.  </li>
            <li>Hoping all Norelco \\&quot;Pro\\&quot; models are this nice.</li>
            <li>In fact, there is no battery life indicator of any kind.  </li>
            <li>The Qt4022, a charging adapter and a cleaning brush (a case would have been nice but that is not included)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked this product.</li>
            <li>One nice feature is that when you plug it in to recharge you can use the trimmer while it recharges.</li>
            <li>LED lighting that shows when the unit is plugged in, charging, and charged is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nicely charges</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>However, I never could get the look I liked until I purchased the Philips Norelco Stubble Trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Nice for fading effects from jawline upward, lots of things you can do.</li>
            <li>This keeps his stubble looking tidy and office-appropriate.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>I liked the length options, held charge well</li>
            <li>I was excited about this trimmer thinking it would be an excellent tool to use between shaves to clean up unsightly stubble.  </li>
            <li>Very good professional-quality feel, great beard trimmer overall.</li>
            <li>He also loved the way it felt---very easy to use and effective---and the fact you can plug it in, which he prefers to battery use.  </li>
            <li>Some days the irritation of a blade is just too much, and this elegantly designed trimmer is a perfect substitution.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco Stubble Trimmer Pro is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>so it is very easy trim hair shorter than intended.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to adjust the length settings.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is exceptionally well and performs beautifully giving a super precise trim .&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful stubble trimmer, it allows you to quickly and easily turn a beard into a nice light stubble.</li>
            <li>the kind that looks like they have a bent cheese-grater across the top, or three whirly circles?).</li>
            <li>Best trimmer I have used so far.</li>
            <li>Good grip, easy to use, sweet for touch ups around the ears/sideburns, makes it easy and quick to get the perfect stubble look even on your neck without any irritation.</li>
            <li>I was just browsing through a store and this perfect trimmer was lying on the shelf marked as xx% off items :)</li>
            <li>He was impressed that he did a quick first pass over his beard &amp; mustache and didn&#x27;t need to go over it again.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very comfortable .</li>
            <li>Charges quickly and holds for a good while.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was initially surprised by the slower speed of the blades, but the unit works fine for me, and have given me the best stubble trim</li>
            <li>Well it definitely is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve used if price is taken out of the equation, but I&#x27;m a bit on the fence with the $40 price.  </li>
            <li>* an outstanding all around trimmer (don&#x27;t let the Stubble Trimmer Pro label limit the scope of this tool&#x27;s abilities)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have been better of sticking with the 15 dollar one from target, that one even comes with a stand.</li>
            <li>Decided to stick with Norelco and go ahead with the stubble trimmer, a product specifically designed for what I had been using the bodygroom for (facial hair), although the bodygroom is awesome everywhere else.....</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t use my electric razor if I let it go more than a day.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>His beard looks better than it has in years.  </li>
            <li>The instructions say if you leave it plugged into the charger it will damage the battery, so the technology there seems kind of cheap and out of date.  </li>
            <li>He loves this shaver - simple and does a real good job on any level.  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought this..</li>
            <li>Glad Norelco saw the need and decided to make one itself.    </li>
            <li>Yes, because according to the manual \\&quot;Continuously recharging the trimmer will reduce the lifespan of the battery\\&quot; and \\&quot;Do not charge for more than 24</li>
            <li>Will post a review after using it in 240v :-)</li>
            <li>I must say I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of this product, especially considering it&#x27;s cost.</li>
            <li>On top of that, the manufacturer (Philips Norelco) refused to honor the promised rebate offer.  </li>
            <li>He uses it to give himself that sexy five o clock shadow.</li>
            <li>As these products becomes more prevalent this should be on your evaluation list.</li>
            <li>Have been using the product for several days and am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I cannot comment on whether a swivel-head makes a trimmer better (since I&#x27;ve never used one myself), but using this trimmer didn&#x27;t feel like an inconvenience to me</li>
            <li>I keep mine on 2/10 length and it gives me the perfect tiny amount of stubble</li>
            <li>But this trimmer is fantastic!</li>
            <li>After trying The Art of Shaving advice and many iterations of blades and products, as well as electric shavers, I gave up on close shaving and have stuck with stubble trimming.</li>
            <li>so I can find something better.  </li>
            <li>Overall very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>And many times even that does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its OK.</li>
            <li>i would gladly pay $50+ for this.</li>
            <li>but they never lasted more than a year.</li>
            <li>look :)</li>
            <li>i love it.  </li>
            <li>I do love this product.  </li>
            <li>Product should have held up better.  </li>
            <li>I love this trimmer I feel like my search for them had been going on since I started growing a beard.  </li>
            <li>The charging port of the shaver has the nice added detail of a ring of light around it that glows on whenever it is charging.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad its working for some people, but not everyone</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, nicely balanced, it feels nice in your hand, it&#x27;s easy to use, easy to adjust, easy to clean (it can be rinsed), and it does a nice job trimming my beard and sideburns.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, nicely balanced, it feels nice in your hand, it&#x27;s easy to use, easy to adjust, easy to clean (it can be rinsed), and it does a nice job trimming my beard and sideburns.  </li>
            <li>Good product at first, the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for more then 5 minutes after a year of use though...</li>
            <li>Now with the stubble trimmer he always looks like he hasn&#x27;t shaved for a day maybe and still quite clean and tidy as opposed to the scruffy look without.</li>
            <li>Electric razors leave me looking patchy, but just a couple runs through with this will clean everything up nice and</li>
            <li>The fact that it can be easily cleaned under a sink is awesome, and you can tell the inner workings are well made and</li>
            <li>First, this is a good product.</li>
            <li>Have used this product with pretty consistently good results.</li>
            <li>It would be a lot more useful if it could also give a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>This is very easy to clean under running water.</li>
            <li>to trim with a certain size its good.but to get a scruff look,its just terrible,although for the price it isn&#x27;t that good</li>
            <li>Many similar machines require you to have a full charge in order to use it, but not this one!!!!</li>
            <li>It does work great when the battery is not dead, which seems to be every time I pick it up.</li>
            <li>People with sensitive skin will be happy with this.</li>
            <li>The Stubble Trimmer Pro does a perfect job at allowing you to maintain a short or long beard, but it doesn&#x27;t do a great job with stubble because it doesn&#x27;t get close</li>
            <li>but dont cut easily what i want.&lt;br</li>
            <li>easy.</li>
            <li>This is a really easy to use unit that is pre-charged when it arrives.  </li>
            <li>The length adjustment is easy with the dial and it doesn&#x27;t slip during use.</li>
            <li>Charging times are fast and so far this has worked great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Earlier models could be opened easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate, battery lasts forever.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, safe, quick, painless, easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li>Handy illustrations show exactly how to disassemble the trimmer for cleaning after usage.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to plug it an outlet to get full power using it.</li>
            <li>good quality but more expensive than Best Buy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean with the brush that&#x27;s included and you can also clean by safely running under tap water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It holds comfortably on my hands and is easy to manipulate it around my face.  </li>
            <li>The product is fine.</li>
            <li>No pain, and really quick too!  </li>
            <li>As a stubble trimmer, compared to others I&#x27;ve had I would rate this one average at best as it works best with the comb off, but then it can cut your lips and draw a little blood.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and operate.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also water proof which makes it easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to wash and clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also light-weight and fits in a man-sized hand comfortably.  </li>
            <li>In addition it&#x27;s really easy to clean as there is no oil on the removable parts</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to adjust and clean.</li>
            <li>The charging light blinks while it&#x27;s charging.</li>
            <li>Adjustability fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is awesome for getting that close stubble for those who can&#x27;t use a razor everyday.  </li>
            <li>The power adapter is well designed - it doesn&#x27;t extend horizontally, allowing it to fit in recessed or flush-set sockets.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Fantastic Product at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>I got this to convince  my husband to keep a light stubble</li>
            <li>Clean up is easy.  </li>
            <li>and then nothing, not even charging indicator light.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>also like the precise, 0.5mm measurements</li>
            <li>Feels cheap as well.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a replacement for shaving, I would go with a more powerful trimmer.</li>
            <li>This product was fantastic.</li>
            <li>It also just feels cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Both my husband and my 16 year old son tested this razor for me, and both of them loved it.  </li>
            <li>, it is extremely easy to clean and take apart, and just as important, allows you to clean in water.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and makes for a clean cut.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this shaver is amazing and I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>This razor has a great grip, the right weight to give it just enough heft, and cleans easily . . .</li>
            <li>For my first trimmer, I&#x27;m glad I choose it.</li>
            <li>those solid tangibles, there are many nuances that makes this an outstanding tool, notably ergonomics, balance, performance.  </li>
            <li>When I do use it to shorten stubble or prep my face for a full shave, it glides over the face quite smoothly without any pinching or chafing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sleek, it&#x27;s simple, it&#x27;s easy to clean, it feels good against the cheeks.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-Skin friendly (no skin irritations at all)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>When I first received this trimmer, it seemed ok, albeit unremarkable product.</li>
            <li>It is in a maroon color that is darker than pictured, so it doesn&#x27;t look girly as I have originally imagined.</li>
            <li>It has many length settings (20 I think?) and allows me to get exactly the length I&#x27;m looking for; either shorter or longer.</li>
            <li>I wanted a trimmer that would allow me to shave to stubble length rather than shaving it clean with a razor.  </li>
            <li>so I can use the supplied brush to take 10 seconds to clean it off after use.    </li>
            <li>The trimmer can be rinsed off and opens easily to clean without losing parts and it requires no lubrication.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to get a shaving waiver at work since I am supposed to be clean shaven</li>
            <li>The vaccuum trimmer is easier to clean up</li>
            <li>(otherwise he prefers to be clean shaven).</li>
            <li>I even use it without the guard if i want it even closer than .5mm, but not quite a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>A beautiful red face with some nice detail and accent lines with a soft yet durable rubberized back have really made this shaver stand up well to lots of use and feel great in the hand.</li>
            <li>As with most trimmers, you get a huge upgrade from what&#x27;s included in electric shavers (even the best electric shavers have virtually useless trimmers), and you also don&#x27;t have a bulky shaver obscuring precise trim work.</li>
            <li>It does regular trimming great too, better than all except a barbers pair that cost almost ten times more.</li>
            <li>It gives just the right amount of stubble and easily picks up the hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is strictly a trimmer, also good for trimming hair lines, but would not be used as a total face</li>
            <li>15 minutes) and didn&#x27;t get clogged after shaving my full 25mm beard to .5mm stubble.</li>
            <li>Love the trimmer because it can get a very close stubble</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s no reason not to buy it, especially at such a good price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I ended up using a AA batter powered Wahl trimmer that I had on hand, which came with a full sized hair trimmer I had bought years ago.</li>
            <li>Got two recharges (yes, full charge/discharge cycle)</li>
            <li>I keep my stubble very close, and this did better than the cheaper trimmers I had bought before, and was cordless.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve all been good units that last about 10 years providing you replace the rechargeable battery at mid-life.</li>
            <li>somewhat futuristically-shaped trimmer is long and nicely curved to fit your hand comfortably.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it works great.</li>
            <li>The trimmer was fine the first month but after that it stopped working.</li>
            <li>and it works quickly and</li>
            <li>Super satisifed with my purchase.</li>
            <li>battery works well and charges quickly.</li>
            <li>and I got the hang of it quickly.</li>
            <li>But on contacting the vendor, quickly rectified the mistake and shipped the correct product.</li>
            <li>Holds a charge really well and easy to clean because it&#x27;s basically water proof.</li>
            <li>also like that you can just stick it under the faucet for a quick rinse when done.</li>
            <li>Very fast and accurate compared to the trimmer on my razer.</li>
            <li>This is a very nicely built trimmer and works extremely well for what it is intended for - trimming.</li>
            <li>The manual-selection wheel for cut-length is located on the inner-middle of the shaver; and since the thumb is positioned elsewhere during normal operation it is appropriately placed.</li>
            <li>Works great when I put off shaving for a week or two and need to trim down</li>
            <li>oddly enough this is becoming a rarity, as many cordless shavers will not work while plugged</li>
            <li>I knocked another star off the rating because a product like this should last many years, rather than becoming landfill after one.</li>
            <li>My husband loved the adjustability of the shave, so he could easily trim his beard to a shorter length without any trouble.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer was exactly what I was looking for, but when I used it for the first time, I quickly noticed a significant problem.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s a sturdy-feeling product that feels good in the hand -- not too light, not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>But to quote the manual and counter to all reasonable logic, \\&quot;After the trimmer is fully charged, the charging light will continue to blink.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Its design is ergonomic, light and it feels very well made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really tiny, would have been nice to have had a storage place on the trimmer handle to stow it away.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only shaved with it once and liked the result.</li>
            <li>Plus the full-width adjustment setting rotary knob on the back is a really nice touch.</li>
            <li>but when you see it and hold it in your hand you can tell it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Guess it&#x27;s worth revising the rating up to 2 stars.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is also completely washable for easy clean up.  </li>
            <li>Excellent trimmer, mediocer battery, poor battery management</li>
            <li>Extremely worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike most shavers/trimmers the body for this product has an elegant look.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the amount spent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only good, but very dependable.</li>
            <li>This was my biggest concern, but I have to completely disagree with the top review.</li>
            <li>I just ordered one for a christmas present to my brother in law who also borrowed mine at the beach and really liked it.</li>
            <li>but normally it stays on the trimmer which means this is easy to store</li>
            <li>and I recommend it for those men that like to maintain stubble or like to occasionally go from a full beard to a very light beard if you are like me</li>
            <li>Norelco did a good job of taking even the most basic functions from past models and tweaked them to make them better.</li>
            <li>Nothing else seems to provide this right now.    </li>
            <li>Has the trimmer length adjuster built right in</li>
            <li>I have search for quite a while to find the right trimmer</li>
            <li>Clean up was fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial</li>
            <li>Nice quick stubble trim, but be careful with the guard while trimming around your mouth region.</li>
            <li>But the Braun can more adequately edge the area of desired facial hair as well as shave the rest of your face without difficulty.</li>
            <li>0.5 cm arrangements are precise enough and working is pretty easy.</li>
            <li>It works like most other trimmers, and was easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Already charged right out of the box, the manual still says to charge it for 10 hours before the first use.</li>
            <li>It works great but 1mm is not short enough for the amount of stubble</li>
            <li>I find this unit easy to clean, and I&#x27;ve used it regularly for some months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and just toss back into drawer.</li>
            <li>I am way better at keeping my beard in check these dates no long scratchy beard for me.</li>
            <li>and I found this new unit for about 4.00 more than a new blade would have cost.</li>
            <li>When the trimmer was new, the battery allowed me to go more than one trim on a single full charge (~15-20min each session for full face, front/back of the neck).</li>
            <li>and he actually seemed pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>My husband uses this on a regular basis and is still pleased with the performance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Right now the QT4022 costs about $40.00, which seems at first like a steep price.</li>
            <li>He has several others, but this one is now his favorite.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: after more than a year of use, I still find this to work quite well for those days between regular blade shaves.</li>
            <li>Note: if the battery&#x27;s dead the trimmer can work on full power by being plugged in which is a nice touch.    </li>
            <li>This trimmer is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>and i had to shave the whole thing off!</li>
            <li>I love the feel, the quiet operation and the cleaning of the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now back to my wired Wahl peanut trimmer, which I love.</li>
            <li>It can get noticeably hot after extended use, but is probably not an issue when trimming stubble.</li>
            <li>I never have razer burn and my face is never uncomfortable anymore.  </li>
            <li>Does what it says and does it pretty well.</li>
            <li>You must be careful with this one because it does not have any kind of guard on the side</li>
            <li>I havbeen amazed from the first time I used this product.  </li>
            <li>exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>Exactly all I needed.</li>
            <li>If it cost more money, it would get only 3 stars instead of</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s pretty mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>Evidently, someone at Norelco thought about the design a</li>
            <li>First off, I did not purchase this through amazon</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was just me</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t mind going back over it once or twice to make sure its consistent.</li>
            <li>If you are trying this as your first foray into beard trimming for a stubble look instead of having to use a razor (like me) look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>This device is SO underpowered its not even funny.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and have a good looking stubble going on</li>
            <li>Im good to go within a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I previously had a cheap $15 norelco and was looking for a better one that would cut closer.  </li>
            <li>Ready to use right out of the box</li>
            <li>Sounds promising, right?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a shame because other than that, it&#x27;s a nice unit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because other than that, it&#x27;s a nice unit.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a simple and perfect trimmer for long time because my requirement was to have a universal (110-240V) charger and durability.</li>
            <li>With some basic soldering skills this made it relatively easy to replace the original NiCad or NiMH AA battery with a new one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s top notch at trimming facial hair, but I would not use it for much else.     </li>
            <li>The old trimmer had a guard comb that covered the entire blade assembly which i liked.</li>
            <li>The guard can technically be removed which results in an even closer shave, but the .5mm setting with the guard gave a good enough 12-o&#x27;clock shadow for me.</li>
            <li>I cut my lip the first time using the trimmer because of the somewhat large gaps in the guard.</li>
            <li>That seems perfectly logical and modern...</li>
            <li>Rechargable battery is nice, the guide comb keeps the setting without bumping itself up or down...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer is quiet barely louder than our electric toothbrush which is really nice.</li>
            <li>Easy use and low maintainence.</li>
            <li>The guard has always stayed locked on the level I set it to, and when I&#x27;ve used it to attempt to keep a certain length of hair, it&#x27;s worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The end result is a clean cut, precise, sharp look.  </li>
            <li>less clutter)&lt;br /&gt;- easy to clean under running tap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower, but I trust Norelco enough to think it&#x27;d be fine.</li>
            <li>Guessing the attention to build quality is the main reason Norelco prices this model higher than its others.</li>
            <li>This is a very high quality and durable device</li>
            <li>Also, the charger has a very high whistle or whine while it&#x27;s plugged in.  </li>
            <li>The other side is made of black rubbery plastic which provides a very good grip.</li>
            <li>It is very quiet, which is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>It also comes with 110-220 v power rating which is a huge advantage when travelling international.</li>
            <li>Ultra fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t use them very often now that I have this.  </li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t tried it for this year, but my husband sometimes gives our boys crew cuts for the summer, and this should work very well to give them a custom cut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s no fighting with a cord while trying to get your shaving accomplished.  </li>
            <li>I do really like that</li>
            <li>There is also a very noticeable dip in power when I use it on battery vs. when it&#x27;s plugged in.  </li>
            <li>Trimming is fast and even.</li>
            <li>Much better than expected.</li>
            <li>is really neat.</li>
            <li>For whatever reason Babyliss no longer makes their elusive I-Trim models which also have .5mm to .8mm settings, and were only available in the UK anyway.</li>
            <li>This thing shaves really close @</li>
            <li>A trimmer is something I don&#x27;t want to think too much about.  </li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know about you, but to me, that is too much for me to be concerned about for a beard trimmer when I just want it work when I need</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about you, but to me, that is too much for me to be concerned about for a beard trimmer when I just want it work when I need it.    </li>
            <li>Why, oh why did they skimp out so much on the battery/charging section?</li>
            <li>I like using this stubble shaver cause I really don&#x27;t like blade shaving.  </li>
            <li>There is an oval LED where the cord connects to the shaver that blinks on and off while the battery is charging; thisseems to be the only piece of advanced electronics in the device.</li>
            <li>Works really well to get a stubble look.</li>
            <li>and they worked very well.  </li>
            <li>but it works really well.  </li>
            <li>The clipper guard requires you to really pay attention to the angle.</li>
            <li>I figured it was cheap enough to try</li>
            <li>The motor is really lacking.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, with this otherwise perfectly nice unit, you&#x27;ll have to keep on top of the battery condition because this trimmer doesn&#x27;t do that for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not overly sharp, catches against hair/skin easily and heats up during the shave to the point it&#x27;s left burn marks on my neck (not bad marks, they go away quickly).</li>
            <li>width of the blade is 1 1/4\\&quot; which is much narrower than most other trimmers.</li>
            <li>all, a nice little stubble trimmer, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Very adjustable, charge last a long time, easy to clean and can be used in the shower....</li>
            <li>I have two other brands in my drawer that go unused because this one is so much better.</li>
            <li>Also, a great feature to this machine is that you can run it on a dead battery as long as you have it plugged in.</li>
            <li>I can use a regular blade, but I have to clean it out after every swipe.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- only for stubble look/ he still needs a separate razor for clean shave trimming&lt;br</li>
            <li>The QT4022 just gives you more control in terms of timing and can let you sport an everyday stubble if used consistently.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on the face and not like others I have used that pinch and cut in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>The wheel is thumb-sized with individual length settings clearly displayed which makes length selection no-nonsense and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it pays for itself within  a couple of months (as long as your employer doesn&#x27;t require a baby&#x27;s-butt smooth shave</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has some advantages over some similar devices: it is slim and nice to hold, very well-balanced, with that rubbery plastic that is easy-to-grip even when wet.</li>
            <li>my face is pretty sensitive but it didn&#x27;t irritate me whatsoever.</li>
            <li>The only flaw is something that all shavers have: they dont automatically stop charging when battery is full.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted to have a stubble beard but none of my previous (admittedly cheap) trimmers or razors seemed to have the right length settings to pull it off.</li>
            <li>Sure, this does not collect the hair, but just lay a towel down.  </li>
            <li>--I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair left, but for the sides and back, it shaves pretty close and painlessly and adjusts easily.</li>
            <li>and i found that this causes the trimmer to take off more or less depending on it&#x27;s angle.</li>
            <li>this is a better trimmer than the QT4070 at almost half the price.  </li>
            <li>Just a quick note on noise: it&#x27;s quiet.</li>
            <li>The hair comb adjusts to more than 20 lengths so anyone outside ZZTop can manage their facial hair as desired.</li>
            <li>With more around 20 different length settings, it allowed me try different styles for my stubble</li>
            <li>the main disadvantage is about lack of the battery alarm about power and when this fully charged.</li>
            <li>The 0.5mm setting tilted up will also shave below your neckline relatively close and quickly in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Overall, I can&#x27;t see how you&#x27;d be unhappy with this if you&#x27;re looking for a quick, effective and satisfying way to get and maintain the stubble look.</li>
            <li>I had to use my older Norelco G370 to make everything</li>
            <li>evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Have to be super careful to keep consistent angle?</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It grabs at your skin, grates, scratches and gives a completely uneven trim unless you hold it at a very PRECISE angle.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I will be getting the Norelco qt 4050 because i know the comb acts more like the G370 where it completely covers the blades no matter what setting you choose ( other then 0 of course).</li>
            <li>This day in age you&#x27;d expect a little more.....</li>
            <li>The rubber-like feel of the back will give you an excellent non-slip grip and while it&#x27;s not exactly heavy, it&#x27;s definitely not as light as other cheaper models which helps with stability.</li>
            <li>I suppose it&#x27;s better than using a dull straight razor without shaving cream, but not by much.</li>
            <li>I really miss my old AA powered trimmer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to spend time wondering if the unit is charged, if it&#x27;s charged too much or if the battery is near depletion.  </li>
            <li>, that is the first time I have personally seen that, this is very convenient.</li>
            <li>It only guards on the top and back, leaving the front section where the blades are completely exposed.  </li>
            <li>Only wish it trimmed a lower closer on the shortest setting (its close, but not anything that would compare to a fresh shave).</li>
            <li>This is one of those niche products that really has only one use, but it does exactly what it is designed to do.  </li>
            <li>This little trimmer is still going strong, holds its charge very well.  </li>
            <li>This specific trimmer goes down to 0.3 mm I believe which is amazing.</li>
            <li>The physical heft of the product is just right</li>
            <li>The steps are uniform, unlike most other trimmers on the market, and the steps are also much finer than the other trimmers, so you can set it to the exact length you want.</li>
            <li>First, it has a low profile guard so you can use the edge like normal clippers (where my sideburns meet the stubble of the beard).  </li>
            <li>I read reviews of this product saying it was cheap to the feel..but its exactly opposite the product feels premium and solid</li>
            <li>Hold it too high, and the blade is directly against your skin.  </li>
            <li>as I am very sensitive about the size of them and my workplace has rigorous rules about beard, this machine passed my expectations well.</li>
            <li>This is another product for us lazy guys who don&#x27;t want to shave more than a couple of times a week.</li>
            <li>It trims well and does not seem to miss any strays, so going over a second time is not needed unless you forget to comb the hair out first.</li>
            <li>first problem I have is that according to the manual, it takes ten hours of charging to every one hour of usage!  </li>
            <li>What I especially like is that there are a lot of options in the shorter range, so you can probably find one to get exactly the length that you want.</li>
            <li>bought this at the end of june and 6-7 weeks later i&#x27;m still trimming my stubble from the first charge.</li>
            <li>but ive rinsed it after some uses, although im not sure if thats ok to do...</li>
            <li>The comb tips need to extend past the blade to prevent this, as they do on most hair trimmers.  </li>
            <li>As you change the size up higher, the guide comb moves higher and away from the blades but it IS NOT exactly above the blades until maybe the 5mm setting which is the upper limit of my desired length.</li>
            <li>If you are also thinking about going to the higher models like the Norelco qt 4070, this also has the same issue ( from the reviews for 4070 you can call phillips to give you the comb of the qt 4050).</li>
            <li>which is kind of a drag, but if it keeps the price down I can live with it.</li>
            <li>and he had no trouble using it, even as an new shaver.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle on the face because the guide comb is actually flexible and not hard.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this leaves Phillips Norelco leaves no razor burn even my old clippers did that...</li>
            <li>Feels like it will last a long time, unlike my old Remington trimmer that had a cheap feel to it.</li>
            <li>The clippers are kind of weak too.</li>
            <li>The motor speed is constant and non-adjustable, yet I feel it is adequate for proper operation.</li>
            <li>So I have been using this trimmer (which is pretty fairly priced here in Canada) for about 4 years now and only discovered this past week that you&#x27;re supposed to shave DOWN to get that even stubble/trim look.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve found that going a little longer on the cheeks and shorter on the goatee area makes mine look more even overall, but</li>
            <li>The battery charing is a pain as it doesn&#x27;t tell you when it is fully charged or how much for a charge is even left.</li>
            <li>I used it with out any guard and it was no where near a stubble look.</li>
            <li>The unit is fairly light weight with a fairly narrow trimming edge of aprox 1.5 inches.</li>
            <li>The trimmer takes a couple of hours for the battery to charge after which you can use it for some considerable time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can set the razor for a setting from 1-10, with 1 being a close shave and 10 being pretty long.  </li>
            <li>He used the 1 setting, but likes the idea that if he wants to in the future, he can leave stubble to the extent he feels like.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and this trimmer hasn&#x27;t caused any issues.</li>
            <li>continue using it until the battery is completely empty\\&quot; and \\&quot;Do</li>
            <li>Adjustable lengths go between 1/32 inch and 13/32 inch, also a combing guide is included so direct contact with the skin is avoided to prevent skin irritation and the like.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Norelco stubble trimmer because I have sensitive skin and do not like to shave with a razor every day.</li>
            <li>First of all excuse me for writing a review before using a product...</li>
            <li>and I believed that&#x27;s why a trimmer is made for and not to expect a complete shave look.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very displeased with this product and will likely return it.</li>
            <li>If your ears work, do not plug it up near your sleeping area.  </li>
            <li>have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very underwhelmed with this trimmer</li>
            <li>I had to replace my old 12-year old Norelco trimmer.  </li>
            <li>i didnt know what .5mm&#x27;s would be in the real world but its not very short.</li>
            <li>I received this trimmer early in the afternoon, and began to charge the unit at approx.</li>
            <li>Overall a very usable trimmer.</li>
            <li>Only thing is the charging time of 8-10hrs but not so much of an issue</li>
            <li>Complete garbage, not a close shave at all in lowest setting.</li>
            <li>Because of the poor guard design it doesn&#x27;t handle any kind of curves in the face well</li>
            <li>It is sleek and comfortable in your hand and is very easy to maneuver into hard to those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>5/5 stars on Amazon mainly due to its solid build quality and the fact that nothing else currently available trims this close.</li>
            <li>I loved those things, but clearly not meant for facial hair (realized this the hard way).</li>
            <li>According to a very well known, major manufacturer of electronics and batteries, \\&quot;extensive trickle</li>
            <li>Not sure what happened, as the battery is fine and it holds charge, but something happened to the blades.</li>
            <li>The action of the mechanism itself is smooth and satisfying to change, but it is also designed in a way that makes it practically impossible to change accidentally while shaving (which has literally never happened to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This particular trimmer lasted a month, and I&#x27;m not talking about battery life with the occasional use, I&#x27;m talking lifespan.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a low cost and high quality product.</li>
            <li>razor blades are very sharp and accurate, you won&#x27;t have to shave the same area over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;-Comfortable</li>
            <li>The experience, price, and shipping were all exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It is stiff enough so the settings won&#x27;t change while you are shaving, and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>This razor seems to have the older style battery because the manual warns of leaving it plugged in too long, letting it drain completely before recharging, etc...</li>
            <li>Sure, you miss out on the nose trimmer, different size trimmer heads, body shavers and whatnot, but for straight-up beard and mustache trimming, it&#x27;s hard to beat this one.</li>
            <li>I use it to keep my facial hair at 1 mm, and then I use a standard wet razor to clean shave my neck.</li>
            <li>Used properly, with the guard, I imagine that it would work very well to maintain a short beard or stubble, depending on which of the 10 settings you use (the \\&quot;settings\\</li>
            <li>husband&#x27;s first reaction was how sharp the blades are.  </li>
            <li>if a trimmer is what you need, I can definitely recommend this one, remember that you are getting a quality product that additionally offers a warranty so, for the price, I&#x27;d say go for it!</li>
            <li>But for $15, its worth it for sideburns only if you don&#x27;t have any other way of managing your sideburns.</li>
            <li>There are many other grooming appliances out there that come with half a dozen interchangeable heads for different purposes.</li>
            <li>Been using this facial trimmer for a couple months so far.</li>
            <li>This makes trimming take FOREVER compared to the Remington MB series, which has a guard covering the whole blade, so you can just quickly drag it across your beard in the morning.  </li>
            <li>My only dislike is the battery requires recharging fairly frequently.  </li>
            <li>I used it on the shortest setting and it barely cuts the hair.  </li>
            <li>(it has a different feel compared to my old trimmer)</li>
            <li>Bottom line this shaver cannot trim anywhere near as close as the trimmer on the remingtons and definitely not gonna do it for me.</li>
            <li>probably the only thing I&#x27;ve every found that works for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used the product about 10 times so far with solid results, I havent had to recharge it yet.</li>
            <li>The built-in shave guard can be easily extended so that you can select the length from fairly short (not quite as short as I&#x27;d like, but short enough to razor the rest of it) to about half an inch.  </li>
            <li>The charger plug is kind of awkward, like an old fashion flip-phone charger that takes some concentration to get into place.</li>
            <li>one I received is a dark navy blue in color, not the red shown in the photo, which is good, because I keep it in a drawer, and the shape of the thing looks less like a battery-powered &#x27;massager&#x27; when it&#x27;s in dark blue.</li>
            <li>I have only used the trimmer up to 4 mm so far, so I can&#x27;t comment if it works well with longer facial hair.</li>
            <li>Was sad to see my old Norelco go because the blade motor gear cracked one too many times, so I replaced it with this.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend another trimmer on the market at the moment because this one has the most precise settings, but I really hate its battery.</li>
            <li>Generally, there aren&#x27;t any surprises with this trimmer and if you&#x27;ve used a traditional shaver then you will find there is no learning curve either.</li>
            <li>Stubble blade stopped working not long after I bought it.</li>
            <li>But, you have to charge it for a few minutes first.</li>
            <li>I use pretty firm pressure, and the guard does its job without giving me any bald patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Basically, this product is inferior to Philips&#x27; other trimmers currently on the market (the 4050/4070 lines) or Remington&#x27;s Smart Touch trimmer, recently released.</li>
            <li>I can adjust it to cut my goatee just like I like it (not very long).  </li>
            <li>The guard is flat and about an inch long, so it&#x27;s very easy to start and keep it flat, and a little tilting doesn&#x27;t seem to mess it</li>
            <li>This is my first trimmer and I must say that this served my purpose with precise cutting.</li>
            <li>(battery doesn&#x27;t work properly anymore), this thing has 1/4 as much power, making it harder and taking twice as long to trim.</li>
            <li>size adjustment knob is great, but you have to be very careful to keep the guide flat against the contours and not angle the cutting edge towards the skin, or you&#x27;ll make a noticeable gouge in your stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Not sure why Norelco, or whoever, can&#x27;t get such a simple concept right.</li>
            <li>He has very sensitive skin and finds that the wet shaving he normally does causes all kind of trouble: razor burn, nicks and scratches can easily become nasty spots.</li>

            <li> The best I have found.</li>
            <li> Great buy!!!</li>
            <li> Enter the Philips perfect stubble trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And, best of all, my wife doesn&#x27;t get on me to shave quite as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great choice for the money!</li>
            <li> The best I ever had.</li>
            <li> Works excellent.  </li>
            <li> What neither can do is give you Don Johnson&#x27;s perfect and continuous 5:00 shadow - if that&#x27;s the look you desire.</li>
            <li> stated in the product description, this is designed for the perfect stubble.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it- very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It does not fully cover the blades, therefore the unit must be held at a PERFECT angle for you to evenly cut your beard.  </li>
            <li> The best thing about this trimmer is the length settings.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace a trimmer i&#x27;d had for years and was very happy with.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best investments I&#x27;ve made!</li>
            <li> Best uses: cleaning up hairline on sides of neck and haircut touch-ups.  </li>
            <li> This is the best beard trimmer that I have found, very happy with this cordless trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works great!!</li>
            <li> Perfect item for beard trimming and the stubble look.  </li>
            <li> the trim is perfect every time.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product.</li>
            <li> the look i go for is probably best termed \\&quot;scruff\\&quot; rather than stubble i guess.</li>
            <li> It keeps both of us happy!</li>
            <li> Excellent for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer 9 months ago, and I&#x27;m still very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I have had this trimmer for abt a year now and it works flawlessly.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer/shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Excellent</li>
            <li> Still it&#x27;s very good at what it does, and you can&#x27;t fault it for not being something it never claimed to be.</li>
            <li> The Stubble Trimmer Pro might work great for some faces, but I have found my perfect stubble exists somewhere between the \\&quot;2\\&quot; and \\&quot;3\\&quot; setting.</li>
            <li> the remingtons have the best trimmers that pop up with the press of a button but the problem is i find that these shavers tend to break after 1-2 years of use although i think they work great.</li>
            <li> It looks beautiful, it works well,</li>
            <li> lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The height adjustment mechanism for the trimmer is beautifully designed.</li>
            <li> It is washable which seams like a great option</li>
            <li> Great for that stubble look.</li>
            <li> Works Great.</li>
            <li> I use a razor to fix the edges of my beard, and then run this machine on the lowest setting over my beard for that great 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.</li>
            <li> It works great, and there&#x27;s a lot of flexibility with the length-settings.  </li>
            <li> Really happy with this.</li>
            <li> great product for all of the men in your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco Stubble Trimmer Pro does a great job of doing what it is supposed to do: trim hair and leave even stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charge is great, and it is water proof.</li>
            <li> great for travel</li>
            <li> Great stubble trimmer its feels great in your hand</li>
            <li> In your hand it feels great.</li>
            <li> As a trimmer, it does a great job but again, not as close as an electric shaver or a razor.</li>
            <li> have found that this is perfect on its own and as a complement to the Sensotouch 3d</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if you trim downwards, you get a nice even stubble trim that is literally perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with Norelco products.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great for playing with stubble and varying the length to emphasize the jaw or neckline.</li>
            <li> I liked this product, I think it is the best in triming arround, I could give it a 5 stars but not quite yrt</li>
            <li> works great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the quality of the product itself, in terms of look and feel, is great.</li>
            <li> Bought this a year ago and it still works great.</li>
            <li> Very nice unit, does everything descriptions said it would.  </li>
            <li> This Phillips Norelco Stubble Trimmer is amazing!</li>
            <li> I love the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and this works perfect.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and is as good as advertised!</li>
            <li> Very happy with it, had it about a year now and still going strong.</li>
            <li> A good thing because we have already lost the cleaning brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The results are good, he got quite scruffy before because of his reluctance to shave, in case he broke out.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Stubble Trimmer Pro\\&quot; is a fairly good solution.  </li>
            <li> It works good for my purposes.  </li>
            <li> good points are it is electrically rechargeable</li>
            <li> ... looks good, feels good and works like a charm...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me a good trimmer is as good as a razor.  </li>
            <li> I use it to maintain my stubble and even for body grooming (not design for it but gives good results).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a good choice.  </li>
            <li> One pros is, the style is really good.</li>
            <li> It cuts closer the way I prefer, but doesn&#x27;t feel as good over my skin as the Philips trimmer does.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price though.</li>
            <li> It came pre-charged, and lasts for a good amount of time between charges.  </li>
            <li> Good Trimmer but charger could use a stand.....</li>
            <li> A good throw-away clipper.</li>
            <li> Been using it for about a year now, still does a good job trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> But honestly, if I can get a good 4-5 years out of the stubble trimmer w/o battery issues I&#x27;ll be happy.    </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an awesome product and has a cool sleek look.</li>
            <li> These trimmers in my opinion, is best suited for someone with peach fuzz, as opposed to someone with a full beard.</li>
            <li> And am I glad that I did!</li>
            <li> First of all, keep in mind this is not an electric shaver, so if you are expecting a perfect and close shave, you may not get it with the Qt4022.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> what more could you ask for!</li>
            <li> This has been easy for hubby to keep me happy.</li>
            <li> QT4022/41 is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I had been using a cheap hair trimmer from a B&amp;M store, whose battery had lost a great deal of capacity over time - I still have this trimmer, and its battery lasts for minutes after extended charging.</li>
            <li> * handy build in adjustable guard</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s good for more than just stubble and can be used for longer hair too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice, sleek design.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It also just looks good---a nice design and color.  </li>
            <li> These kind of just look like a petite version of the clippers a barber might use.</li>
            <li> Kind of a pain.  </li>
            <li> Hoping all Norelco \\&quot;Pro\\&quot; models are this nice.</li>
            <li> In fact, there is no battery life indicator of any kind.  </li>
            <li> The Qt4022, a charging adapter and a cleaning brush (a case would have been nice but that is not included)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked this product.</li>
            <li> One nice feature is that when you plug it in to recharge you can use the trimmer while it recharges.</li>
            <li> LED lighting that shows when the unit is plugged in, charging, and charged is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nicely charges</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> However, I never could get the look I liked until I purchased the Philips Norelco Stubble Trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Nice for fading effects from jawline upward, lots of things you can do.</li>
            <li> This keeps his stubble looking tidy and office-appropriate.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> I liked the length options, held charge well</li>
            <li> I was excited about this trimmer thinking it would be an excellent tool to use between shaves to clean up unsightly stubble.  </li>
            <li> Very good professional-quality feel, great beard trimmer overall.</li>
            <li> He also loved the way it felt---very easy to use and effective---and the fact you can plug it in, which he prefers to battery use.  </li>
            <li> Some days the irritation of a blade is just too much, and this elegantly designed trimmer is a perfect substitution.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco Stubble Trimmer Pro is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> so it is very easy trim hair shorter than intended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to adjust the length settings.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is exceptionally well and performs beautifully giving a super precise trim .&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful stubble trimmer, it allows you to quickly and easily turn a beard into a nice light stubble.</li>
            <li> the kind that looks like they have a bent cheese-grater across the top, or three whirly circles?).</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have used so far.</li>
            <li> Good grip, easy to use, sweet for touch ups around the ears/sideburns, makes it easy and quick to get the perfect stubble look even on your neck without any irritation.</li>
            <li> I was just browsing through a store and this perfect trimmer was lying on the shelf marked as xx% off items :)</li>
            <li> He was impressed that he did a quick first pass over his beard &amp; mustache and didn&#x27;t need to go over it again.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very comfortable .</li>
            <li> Charges quickly and holds for a good while.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was initially surprised by the slower speed of the blades, but the unit works fine for me, and have given me the best stubble trim</li>
            <li> Well it definitely is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve used if price is taken out of the equation, but I&#x27;m a bit on the fence with the $40 price.  </li>
            <li> * an outstanding all around trimmer (don&#x27;t let the Stubble Trimmer Pro label limit the scope of this tool&#x27;s abilities)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have been better of sticking with the 15 dollar one from target, that one even comes with a stand.</li>
            <li> Decided to stick with Norelco and go ahead with the stubble trimmer, a product specifically designed for what I had been using the bodygroom for (facial hair), although the bodygroom is awesome everywhere else.....</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t use my electric razor if I let it go more than a day.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> His beard looks better than it has in years.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say if you leave it plugged into the charger it will damage the battery, so the technology there seems kind of cheap and out of date.  </li>
            <li> He loves this shaver - simple and does a real good job on any level.  </li>
            <li> Glad I bought this..</li>
            <li> Glad Norelco saw the need and decided to make one itself.    </li>
            <li> Yes, because according to the manual \\&quot;Continuously recharging the trimmer will reduce the lifespan of the battery\\&quot; and \\&quot;Do not charge for more than 24</li>
            <li> Will post a review after using it in 240v :-)</li>
            <li> I must say I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of this product, especially considering it&#x27;s cost.</li>
            <li> On top of that, the manufacturer (Philips Norelco) refused to honor the promised rebate offer.  </li>
            <li> He uses it to give himself that sexy five o clock shadow.</li>
            <li> As these products becomes more prevalent this should be on your evaluation list.</li>
            <li> Have been using the product for several days and am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I cannot comment on whether a swivel-head makes a trimmer better (since I&#x27;ve never used one myself), but using this trimmer didn&#x27;t feel like an inconvenience to me</li>
            <li> I keep mine on 2/10 length and it gives me the perfect tiny amount of stubble</li>
            <li> But this trimmer is fantastic!</li>
            <li> After trying The Art of Shaving advice and many iterations of blades and products, as well as electric shavers, I gave up on close shaving and have stuck with stubble trimming.</li>
            <li> so I can find something better.  </li>
            <li> Overall very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> And many times even that does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its OK.</li>
            <li> i would gladly pay $50+ for this.</li>
            <li> but they never lasted more than a year.</li>
            <li> look :)</li>
            <li> i love it.  </li>
            <li> I do love this product.  </li>
            <li> Product should have held up better.  </li>
            <li> I love this trimmer I feel like my search for them had been going on since I started growing a beard.  </li>
            <li> The charging port of the shaver has the nice added detail of a ring of light around it that glows on whenever it is charging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad its working for some people, but not everyone</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, nicely balanced, it feels nice in your hand, it&#x27;s easy to use, easy to adjust, easy to clean (it can be rinsed), and it does a nice job trimming my beard and sideburns.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, nicely balanced, it feels nice in your hand, it&#x27;s easy to use, easy to adjust, easy to clean (it can be rinsed), and it does a nice job trimming my beard and sideburns.  </li>
            <li> Good product at first, the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for more then 5 minutes after a year of use though...</li>
            <li> Now with the stubble trimmer he always looks like he hasn&#x27;t shaved for a day maybe and still quite clean and tidy as opposed to the scruffy look without.</li>
            <li> Electric razors leave me looking patchy, but just a couple runs through with this will clean everything up nice and</li>
            <li> The fact that it can be easily cleaned under a sink is awesome, and you can tell the inner workings are well made and</li>
            <li> First, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Have used this product with pretty consistently good results.</li>
            <li> It would be a lot more useful if it could also give a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li> This is very easy to clean under running water.</li>
            <li> to trim with a certain size its good.but to get a scruff look,its just terrible,although for the price it isn&#x27;t that good</li>
            <li> Many similar machines require you to have a full charge in order to use it, but not this one!!!!</li>
            <li> It does work great when the battery is not dead, which seems to be every time I pick it up.</li>
            <li> People with sensitive skin will be happy with this.</li>
            <li> The Stubble Trimmer Pro does a perfect job at allowing you to maintain a short or long beard, but it doesn&#x27;t do a great job with stubble because it doesn&#x27;t get close</li>
            <li> but dont cut easily what i want.&lt;br</li>
            <li> easy.</li>
            <li> This is a really easy to use unit that is pre-charged when it arrives.  </li>
            <li> The length adjustment is easy with the dial and it doesn&#x27;t slip during use.</li>
            <li> Charging times are fast and so far this has worked great!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Earlier models could be opened easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate, battery lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, safe, quick, painless, easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li> Handy illustrations show exactly how to disassemble the trimmer for cleaning after usage.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to plug it an outlet to get full power using it.</li>
            <li> good quality but more expensive than Best Buy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean with the brush that&#x27;s included and you can also clean by safely running under tap water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It holds comfortably on my hands and is easy to manipulate it around my face.  </li>
            <li> The product is fine.</li>
            <li> No pain, and really quick too!  </li>
            <li> As a stubble trimmer, compared to others I&#x27;ve had I would rate this one average at best as it works best with the comb off, but then it can cut your lips and draw a little blood.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and operate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also water proof which makes it easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to wash and clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also light-weight and fits in a man-sized hand comfortably.  </li>
            <li> In addition it&#x27;s really easy to clean as there is no oil on the removable parts</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to adjust and clean.</li>
            <li> The charging light blinks while it&#x27;s charging.</li>
            <li> Adjustability fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is awesome for getting that close stubble for those who can&#x27;t use a razor everyday.  </li>
            <li> The power adapter is well designed - it doesn&#x27;t extend horizontally, allowing it to fit in recessed or flush-set sockets.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Product at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> I got this to convince  my husband to keep a light stubble</li>
            <li> Clean up is easy.  </li>
            <li> and then nothing, not even charging indicator light.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> also like the precise, 0.5mm measurements</li>
            <li> Feels cheap as well.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a replacement for shaving, I would go with a more powerful trimmer.</li>
            <li> This product was fantastic.</li>
            <li> It also just feels cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and my 16 year old son tested this razor for me, and both of them loved it.  </li>
            <li> , it is extremely easy to clean and take apart, and just as important, allows you to clean in water.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and makes for a clean cut.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this shaver is amazing and I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This razor has a great grip, the right weight to give it just enough heft, and cleans easily . . .</li>
            <li> For my first trimmer, I&#x27;m glad I choose it.</li>
            <li> those solid tangibles, there are many nuances that makes this an outstanding tool, notably ergonomics, balance, performance.  </li>
            <li> When I do use it to shorten stubble or prep my face for a full shave, it glides over the face quite smoothly without any pinching or chafing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sleek, it&#x27;s simple, it&#x27;s easy to clean, it feels good against the cheeks.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-Skin friendly (no skin irritations at all)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> When I first received this trimmer, it seemed ok, albeit unremarkable product.</li>
            <li> It is in a maroon color that is darker than pictured, so it doesn&#x27;t look girly as I have originally imagined.</li>
            <li> It has many length settings (20 I think?) and allows me to get exactly the length I&#x27;m looking for; either shorter or longer.</li>
            <li> I wanted a trimmer that would allow me to shave to stubble length rather than shaving it clean with a razor.  </li>
            <li> so I can use the supplied brush to take 10 seconds to clean it off after use.    </li>
            <li> The trimmer can be rinsed off and opens easily to clean without losing parts and it requires no lubrication.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to get a shaving waiver at work since I am supposed to be clean shaven</li>
            <li> The vaccuum trimmer is easier to clean up</li>
            <li> (otherwise he prefers to be clean shaven).</li>
            <li> I even use it without the guard if i want it even closer than .5mm, but not quite a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> A beautiful red face with some nice detail and accent lines with a soft yet durable rubberized back have really made this shaver stand up well to lots of use and feel great in the hand.</li>
            <li> As with most trimmers, you get a huge upgrade from what&#x27;s included in electric shavers (even the best electric shavers have virtually useless trimmers), and you also don&#x27;t have a bulky shaver obscuring precise trim work.</li>
            <li> It does regular trimming great too, better than all except a barbers pair that cost almost ten times more.</li>
            <li> It gives just the right amount of stubble and easily picks up the hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is strictly a trimmer, also good for trimming hair lines, but would not be used as a total face</li>
            <li> 15 minutes) and didn&#x27;t get clogged after shaving my full 25mm beard to .5mm stubble.</li>
            <li> Love the trimmer because it can get a very close stubble</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no reason not to buy it, especially at such a good price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I ended up using a AA batter powered Wahl trimmer that I had on hand, which came with a full sized hair trimmer I had bought years ago.</li>
            <li> Got two recharges (yes, full charge/discharge cycle)</li>
            <li> I keep my stubble very close, and this did better than the cheaper trimmers I had bought before, and was cordless.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve all been good units that last about 10 years providing you replace the rechargeable battery at mid-life.</li>
            <li> somewhat futuristically-shaped trimmer is long and nicely curved to fit your hand comfortably.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works great.</li>
            <li> The trimmer was fine the first month but after that it stopped working.</li>
            <li> and it works quickly and</li>
            <li> Super satisifed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> battery works well and charges quickly.</li>
            <li> and I got the hang of it quickly.</li>
            <li> But on contacting the vendor, quickly rectified the mistake and shipped the correct product.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge really well and easy to clean because it&#x27;s basically water proof.</li>
            <li> also like that you can just stick it under the faucet for a quick rinse when done.</li>
            <li> Very fast and accurate compared to the trimmer on my razer.</li>
            <li> This is a very nicely built trimmer and works extremely well for what it is intended for - trimming.</li>
            <li> The manual-selection wheel for cut-length is located on the inner-middle of the shaver; and since the thumb is positioned elsewhere during normal operation it is appropriately placed.</li>
            <li> Works great when I put off shaving for a week or two and need to trim down</li>
            <li> oddly enough this is becoming a rarity, as many cordless shavers will not work while plugged</li>
            <li> I knocked another star off the rating because a product like this should last many years, rather than becoming landfill after one.</li>
            <li> My husband loved the adjustability of the shave, so he could easily trim his beard to a shorter length without any trouble.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer was exactly what I was looking for, but when I used it for the first time, I quickly noticed a significant problem.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a sturdy-feeling product that feels good in the hand -- not too light, not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> But to quote the manual and counter to all reasonable logic, \\&quot;After the trimmer is fully charged, the charging light will continue to blink.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Its design is ergonomic, light and it feels very well made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really tiny, would have been nice to have had a storage place on the trimmer handle to stow it away.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only shaved with it once and liked the result.</li>
            <li> Plus the full-width adjustment setting rotary knob on the back is a really nice touch.</li>
            <li> but when you see it and hold it in your hand you can tell it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Guess it&#x27;s worth revising the rating up to 2 stars.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is also completely washable for easy clean up.  </li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer, mediocer battery, poor battery management</li>
            <li> Extremely worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike most shavers/trimmers the body for this product has an elegant look.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the amount spent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only good, but very dependable.</li>
            <li> This was my biggest concern, but I have to completely disagree with the top review.</li>
            <li> I just ordered one for a christmas present to my brother in law who also borrowed mine at the beach and really liked it.</li>
            <li> but normally it stays on the trimmer which means this is easy to store</li>
            <li> and I recommend it for those men that like to maintain stubble or like to occasionally go from a full beard to a very light beard if you are like me</li>
            <li> Norelco did a good job of taking even the most basic functions from past models and tweaked them to make them better.</li>
            <li> Nothing else seems to provide this right now.    </li>
            <li> Has the trimmer length adjuster built right in</li>
            <li> I have search for quite a while to find the right trimmer</li>
            <li> Clean up was fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial</li>
            <li> Nice quick stubble trim, but be careful with the guard while trimming around your mouth region.</li>
            <li> But the Braun can more adequately edge the area of desired facial hair as well as shave the rest of your face without difficulty.</li>
            <li> 0.5 cm arrangements are precise enough and working is pretty easy.</li>
            <li> It works like most other trimmers, and was easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Already charged right out of the box, the manual still says to charge it for 10 hours before the first use.</li>
            <li> It works great but 1mm is not short enough for the amount of stubble</li>
            <li> I find this unit easy to clean, and I&#x27;ve used it regularly for some months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and just toss back into drawer.</li>
            <li> I am way better at keeping my beard in check these dates no long scratchy beard for me.</li>
            <li> and I found this new unit for about 4.00 more than a new blade would have cost.</li>
            <li> When the trimmer was new, the battery allowed me to go more than one trim on a single full charge (~15-20min each session for full face, front/back of the neck).</li>
            <li> and he actually seemed pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses this on a regular basis and is still pleased with the performance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Right now the QT4022 costs about $40.00, which seems at first like a steep price.</li>
            <li> He has several others, but this one is now his favorite.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: after more than a year of use, I still find this to work quite well for those days between regular blade shaves.</li>
            <li> Note: if the battery&#x27;s dead the trimmer can work on full power by being plugged in which is a nice touch.    </li>
            <li> This trimmer is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> and i had to shave the whole thing off!</li>
            <li> I love the feel, the quiet operation and the cleaning of the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now back to my wired Wahl peanut trimmer, which I love.</li>
            <li> It can get noticeably hot after extended use, but is probably not an issue when trimming stubble.</li>
            <li> I never have razer burn and my face is never uncomfortable anymore.  </li>
            <li> Does what it says and does it pretty well.</li>
            <li> You must be careful with this one because it does not have any kind of guard on the side</li>
            <li> I havbeen amazed from the first time I used this product.  </li>
            <li> exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> Exactly all I needed.</li>
            <li> If it cost more money, it would get only 3 stars instead of</li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s pretty mediocre at best.</li>
            <li> Evidently, someone at Norelco thought about the design a</li>
            <li> First off, I did not purchase this through amazon</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was just me</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t mind going back over it once or twice to make sure its consistent.</li>
            <li> If you are trying this as your first foray into beard trimming for a stubble look instead of having to use a razor (like me) look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This device is SO underpowered its not even funny.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and have a good looking stubble going on</li>
            <li> Im good to go within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I previously had a cheap $15 norelco and was looking for a better one that would cut closer.  </li>
            <li> Ready to use right out of the box</li>
            <li> Sounds promising, right?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame because other than that, it&#x27;s a nice unit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame because other than that, it&#x27;s a nice unit.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a simple and perfect trimmer for long time because my requirement was to have a universal (110-240V) charger and durability.</li>
            <li> With some basic soldering skills this made it relatively easy to replace the original NiCad or NiMH AA battery with a new one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s top notch at trimming facial hair, but I would not use it for much else.     </li>
            <li> The old trimmer had a guard comb that covered the entire blade assembly which i liked.</li>
            <li> The guard can technically be removed which results in an even closer shave, but the .5mm setting with the guard gave a good enough 12-o&#x27;clock shadow for me.</li>
            <li> I cut my lip the first time using the trimmer because of the somewhat large gaps in the guard.</li>
            <li> That seems perfectly logical and modern...</li>
            <li> Rechargable battery is nice, the guide comb keeps the setting without bumping itself up or down...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer is quiet barely louder than our electric toothbrush which is really nice.</li>
            <li> Easy use and low maintainence.</li>
            <li> The guard has always stayed locked on the level I set it to, and when I&#x27;ve used it to attempt to keep a certain length of hair, it&#x27;s worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The end result is a clean cut, precise, sharp look.  </li>
            <li> less clutter)&lt;br /&gt;- easy to clean under running tap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower, but I trust Norelco enough to think it&#x27;d be fine.</li>
            <li> Guessing the attention to build quality is the main reason Norelco prices this model higher than its others.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality and durable device</li>
            <li> Also, the charger has a very high whistle or whine while it&#x27;s plugged in.  </li>
            <li> The other side is made of black rubbery plastic which provides a very good grip.</li>
            <li> It is very quiet, which is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> It also comes with 110-220 v power rating which is a huge advantage when travelling international.</li>
            <li> Ultra fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use them very often now that I have this.  </li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t tried it for this year, but my husband sometimes gives our boys crew cuts for the summer, and this should work very well to give them a custom cut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s no fighting with a cord while trying to get your shaving accomplished.  </li>
            <li> I do really like that</li>
            <li> There is also a very noticeable dip in power when I use it on battery vs. when it&#x27;s plugged in.  </li>
            <li> Trimming is fast and even.</li>
            <li> Much better than expected.</li>
            <li> is really neat.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason Babyliss no longer makes their elusive I-Trim models which also have .5mm to .8mm settings, and were only available in the UK anyway.</li>
            <li> This thing shaves really close @</li>
            <li> A trimmer is something I don&#x27;t want to think too much about.  </li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know about you, but to me, that is too much for me to be concerned about for a beard trimmer when I just want it work when I need</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about you, but to me, that is too much for me to be concerned about for a beard trimmer when I just want it work when I need it.    </li>
            <li> Why, oh why did they skimp out so much on the battery/charging section?</li>
            <li> I like using this stubble shaver cause I really don&#x27;t like blade shaving.  </li>
            <li> There is an oval LED where the cord connects to the shaver that blinks on and off while the battery is charging; thisseems to be the only piece of advanced electronics in the device.</li>
            <li> Works really well to get a stubble look.</li>
            <li> and they worked very well.  </li>
            <li> but it works really well.  </li>
            <li> The clipper guard requires you to really pay attention to the angle.</li>
            <li> I figured it was cheap enough to try</li>
            <li> The motor is really lacking.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, with this otherwise perfectly nice unit, you&#x27;ll have to keep on top of the battery condition because this trimmer doesn&#x27;t do that for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not overly sharp, catches against hair/skin easily and heats up during the shave to the point it&#x27;s left burn marks on my neck (not bad marks, they go away quickly).</li>
            <li> width of the blade is 1 1/4\\&quot; which is much narrower than most other trimmers.</li>
            <li> all, a nice little stubble trimmer, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Very adjustable, charge last a long time, easy to clean and can be used in the shower....</li>
            <li> I have two other brands in my drawer that go unused because this one is so much better.</li>
            <li> Also, a great feature to this machine is that you can run it on a dead battery as long as you have it plugged in.</li>
            <li> I can use a regular blade, but I have to clean it out after every swipe.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- only for stubble look/ he still needs a separate razor for clean shave trimming&lt;br</li>
            <li> The QT4022 just gives you more control in terms of timing and can let you sport an everyday stubble if used consistently.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on the face and not like others I have used that pinch and cut in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> The wheel is thumb-sized with individual length settings clearly displayed which makes length selection no-nonsense and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it pays for itself within  a couple of months (as long as your employer doesn&#x27;t require a baby&#x27;s-butt smooth shave</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has some advantages over some similar devices: it is slim and nice to hold, very well-balanced, with that rubbery plastic that is easy-to-grip even when wet.</li>
            <li> my face is pretty sensitive but it didn&#x27;t irritate me whatsoever.</li>
            <li> The only flaw is something that all shavers have: they dont automatically stop charging when battery is full.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to have a stubble beard but none of my previous (admittedly cheap) trimmers or razors seemed to have the right length settings to pull it off.</li>
            <li> Sure, this does not collect the hair, but just lay a towel down.  </li>
            <li> --I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair left, but for the sides and back, it shaves pretty close and painlessly and adjusts easily.</li>
            <li> and i found that this causes the trimmer to take off more or less depending on it&#x27;s angle.</li>
            <li> this is a better trimmer than the QT4070 at almost half the price.  </li>
            <li> Just a quick note on noise: it&#x27;s quiet.</li>
            <li> The hair comb adjusts to more than 20 lengths so anyone outside ZZTop can manage their facial hair as desired.</li>
            <li> With more around 20 different length settings, it allowed me try different styles for my stubble</li>
            <li> the main disadvantage is about lack of the battery alarm about power and when this fully charged.</li>
            <li> The 0.5mm setting tilted up will also shave below your neckline relatively close and quickly in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Overall, I can&#x27;t see how you&#x27;d be unhappy with this if you&#x27;re looking for a quick, effective and satisfying way to get and maintain the stubble look.</li>
            <li> I had to use my older Norelco G370 to make everything</li>
            <li> evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Have to be super careful to keep consistent angle?</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It grabs at your skin, grates, scratches and gives a completely uneven trim unless you hold it at a very PRECISE angle.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I will be getting the Norelco qt 4050 because i know the comb acts more like the G370 where it completely covers the blades no matter what setting you choose ( other then 0 of course).</li>
            <li> This day in age you&#x27;d expect a little more.....</li>
            <li> The rubber-like feel of the back will give you an excellent non-slip grip and while it&#x27;s not exactly heavy, it&#x27;s definitely not as light as other cheaper models which helps with stability.</li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s better than using a dull straight razor without shaving cream, but not by much.</li>
            <li> I really miss my old AA powered trimmer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to spend time wondering if the unit is charged, if it&#x27;s charged too much or if the battery is near depletion.  </li>
            <li> , that is the first time I have personally seen that, this is very convenient.</li>
            <li> It only guards on the top and back, leaving the front section where the blades are completely exposed.  </li>
            <li> Only wish it trimmed a lower closer on the shortest setting (its close, but not anything that would compare to a fresh shave).</li>
            <li> This is one of those niche products that really has only one use, but it does exactly what it is designed to do.  </li>
            <li> This little trimmer is still going strong, holds its charge very well.  </li>
            <li> This specific trimmer goes down to 0.3 mm I believe which is amazing.</li>
            <li> The physical heft of the product is just right</li>
            <li> The steps are uniform, unlike most other trimmers on the market, and the steps are also much finer than the other trimmers, so you can set it to the exact length you want.</li>
            <li> First, it has a low profile guard so you can use the edge like normal clippers (where my sideburns meet the stubble of the beard).  </li>
            <li> I read reviews of this product saying it was cheap to the feel..but its exactly opposite the product feels premium and solid</li>
            <li> Hold it too high, and the blade is directly against your skin.  </li>
            <li> as I am very sensitive about the size of them and my workplace has rigorous rules about beard, this machine passed my expectations well.</li>
            <li> This is another product for us lazy guys who don&#x27;t want to shave more than a couple of times a week.</li>
            <li> It trims well and does not seem to miss any strays, so going over a second time is not needed unless you forget to comb the hair out first.</li>
            <li> first problem I have is that according to the manual, it takes ten hours of charging to every one hour of usage!  </li>
            <li> What I especially like is that there are a lot of options in the shorter range, so you can probably find one to get exactly the length that you want.</li>
            <li> bought this at the end of june and 6-7 weeks later i&#x27;m still trimming my stubble from the first charge.</li>
            <li> but ive rinsed it after some uses, although im not sure if thats ok to do...</li>
            <li> The comb tips need to extend past the blade to prevent this, as they do on most hair trimmers.  </li>
            <li> As you change the size up higher, the guide comb moves higher and away from the blades but it IS NOT exactly above the blades until maybe the 5mm setting which is the upper limit of my desired length.</li>
            <li> If you are also thinking about going to the higher models like the Norelco qt 4070, this also has the same issue ( from the reviews for 4070 you can call phillips to give you the comb of the qt 4050).</li>
            <li> which is kind of a drag, but if it keeps the price down I can live with it.</li>
            <li> and he had no trouble using it, even as an new shaver.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle on the face because the guide comb is actually flexible and not hard.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this leaves Phillips Norelco leaves no razor burn even my old clippers did that...</li>
            <li> Feels like it will last a long time, unlike my old Remington trimmer that had a cheap feel to it.</li>
            <li> The clippers are kind of weak too.</li>
            <li> The motor speed is constant and non-adjustable, yet I feel it is adequate for proper operation.</li>
            <li> So I have been using this trimmer (which is pretty fairly priced here in Canada) for about 4 years now and only discovered this past week that you&#x27;re supposed to shave DOWN to get that even stubble/trim look.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve found that going a little longer on the cheeks and shorter on the goatee area makes mine look more even overall, but</li>
            <li> The battery charing is a pain as it doesn&#x27;t tell you when it is fully charged or how much for a charge is even left.</li>
            <li> I used it with out any guard and it was no where near a stubble look.</li>
            <li> The unit is fairly light weight with a fairly narrow trimming edge of aprox 1.5 inches.</li>
            <li> The trimmer takes a couple of hours for the battery to charge after which you can use it for some considerable time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can set the razor for a setting from 1-10, with 1 being a close shave and 10 being pretty long.  </li>
            <li> He used the 1 setting, but likes the idea that if he wants to in the future, he can leave stubble to the extent he feels like.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and this trimmer hasn&#x27;t caused any issues.</li>
            <li> continue using it until the battery is completely empty\\&quot; and \\&quot;Do</li>
            <li> Adjustable lengths go between 1/32 inch and 13/32 inch, also a combing guide is included so direct contact with the skin is avoided to prevent skin irritation and the like.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Norelco stubble trimmer because I have sensitive skin and do not like to shave with a razor every day.</li>
            <li> First of all excuse me for writing a review before using a product...</li>
            <li> and I believed that&#x27;s why a trimmer is made for and not to expect a complete shave look.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very displeased with this product and will likely return it.</li>
            <li> If your ears work, do not plug it up near your sleeping area.  </li>
            <li> have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very underwhelmed with this trimmer</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old 12-year old Norelco trimmer.  </li>
            <li> i didnt know what .5mm&#x27;s would be in the real world but its not very short.</li>
            <li> I received this trimmer early in the afternoon, and began to charge the unit at approx.</li>
            <li> Overall a very usable trimmer.</li>
            <li> Only thing is the charging time of 8-10hrs but not so much of an issue</li>
            <li> Complete garbage, not a close shave at all in lowest setting.</li>
            <li> Because of the poor guard design it doesn&#x27;t handle any kind of curves in the face well</li>
            <li> It is sleek and comfortable in your hand and is very easy to maneuver into hard to those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> 5/5 stars on Amazon mainly due to its solid build quality and the fact that nothing else currently available trims this close.</li>
            <li> I loved those things, but clearly not meant for facial hair (realized this the hard way).</li>
            <li> According to a very well known, major manufacturer of electronics and batteries, \\&quot;extensive trickle</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened, as the battery is fine and it holds charge, but something happened to the blades.</li>
            <li> The action of the mechanism itself is smooth and satisfying to change, but it is also designed in a way that makes it practically impossible to change accidentally while shaving (which has literally never happened to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This particular trimmer lasted a month, and I&#x27;m not talking about battery life with the occasional use, I&#x27;m talking lifespan.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a low cost and high quality product.</li>
            <li> razor blades are very sharp and accurate, you won&#x27;t have to shave the same area over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;-Comfortable</li>
            <li> The experience, price, and shipping were all exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It is stiff enough so the settings won&#x27;t change while you are shaving, and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This razor seems to have the older style battery because the manual warns of leaving it plugged in too long, letting it drain completely before recharging, etc...</li>
            <li> Sure, you miss out on the nose trimmer, different size trimmer heads, body shavers and whatnot, but for straight-up beard and mustache trimming, it&#x27;s hard to beat this one.</li>
            <li> I use it to keep my facial hair at 1 mm, and then I use a standard wet razor to clean shave my neck.</li>
            <li> Used properly, with the guard, I imagine that it would work very well to maintain a short beard or stubble, depending on which of the 10 settings you use (the \\&quot;settings\\</li>
            <li> husband&#x27;s first reaction was how sharp the blades are.  </li>
            <li> if a trimmer is what you need, I can definitely recommend this one, remember that you are getting a quality product that additionally offers a warranty so, for the price, I&#x27;d say go for it!</li>
            <li> But for $15, its worth it for sideburns only if you don&#x27;t have any other way of managing your sideburns.</li>
            <li> There are many other grooming appliances out there that come with half a dozen interchangeable heads for different purposes.</li>
            <li> Been using this facial trimmer for a couple months so far.</li>
            <li> This makes trimming take FOREVER compared to the Remington MB series, which has a guard covering the whole blade, so you can just quickly drag it across your beard in the morning.  </li>
            <li> My only dislike is the battery requires recharging fairly frequently.  </li>
            <li> I used it on the shortest setting and it barely cuts the hair.  </li>
            <li> (it has a different feel compared to my old trimmer)</li>
            <li> Bottom line this shaver cannot trim anywhere near as close as the trimmer on the remingtons and definitely not gonna do it for me.</li>
            <li> probably the only thing I&#x27;ve every found that works for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used the product about 10 times so far with solid results, I havent had to recharge it yet.</li>
            <li> The built-in shave guard can be easily extended so that you can select the length from fairly short (not quite as short as I&#x27;d like, but short enough to razor the rest of it) to about half an inch.  </li>
            <li> The charger plug is kind of awkward, like an old fashion flip-phone charger that takes some concentration to get into place.</li>
            <li> one I received is a dark navy blue in color, not the red shown in the photo, which is good, because I keep it in a drawer, and the shape of the thing looks less like a battery-powered &#x27;massager&#x27; when it&#x27;s in dark blue.</li>
            <li> I have only used the trimmer up to 4 mm so far, so I can&#x27;t comment if it works well with longer facial hair.</li>
            <li> Was sad to see my old Norelco go because the blade motor gear cracked one too many times, so I replaced it with this.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend another trimmer on the market at the moment because this one has the most precise settings, but I really hate its battery.</li>
            <li> Generally, there aren&#x27;t any surprises with this trimmer and if you&#x27;ve used a traditional shaver then you will find there is no learning curve either.</li>
            <li> Stubble blade stopped working not long after I bought it.</li>
            <li> But, you have to charge it for a few minutes first.</li>
            <li> I use pretty firm pressure, and the guard does its job without giving me any bald patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Basically, this product is inferior to Philips&#x27; other trimmers currently on the market (the 4050/4070 lines) or Remington&#x27;s Smart Touch trimmer, recently released.</li>
            <li> I can adjust it to cut my goatee just like I like it (not very long).  </li>
            <li> The guard is flat and about an inch long, so it&#x27;s very easy to start and keep it flat, and a little tilting doesn&#x27;t seem to mess it</li>
            <li> This is my first trimmer and I must say that this served my purpose with precise cutting.</li>
            <li> (battery doesn&#x27;t work properly anymore), this thing has 1/4 as much power, making it harder and taking twice as long to trim.</li>
            <li> size adjustment knob is great, but you have to be very careful to keep the guide flat against the contours and not angle the cutting edge towards the skin, or you&#x27;ll make a noticeable gouge in your stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Not sure why Norelco, or whoever, can&#x27;t get such a simple concept right.</li>
            <li> He has very sensitive skin and finds that the wet shaving he normally does causes all kind of trouble: razor burn, nicks and scratches can easily become nasty spots.</li>
            <li> However, if you are concerned about hair getting everywhere as you shave, which obviously does happen with this shaver, I would recommend a shaver with a built in vacuum which Norelco also makes.</li>
            <li> I have also used this on my eyebrows, with solid results as well, easily trims thick eyebrows down.</li>
            <li> The G370 doesn&#x27;t quite get it as short as this QT4022 theoretically can, but at least it&#x27;s consistent.</li>
            <li> I like the ergonomics of the whole thing, and the materials chosen (slick plastic front, grippy material back).</li>
            <li> This one simply refuses to work after long or short charges.</li>
            <li> If I spend enough time, I can approximate a quick electric razor shave (I have one of mid tier quality to compare against).</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, this model is holding it&#x27;s charge much longer than some other electric shavers that we&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s spot on so far, I go over my short facial hair from a few different angles, and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice it cutting anything on my face and is only good for maybe a little bit of cleaning up of my sideburns.  </li>
            <li> This means that you don&#x27;t really need the small brush that is provided.</li>
            <li> I got it to use when I don&#x27;t want to look like I&#x27;m quite as lazy as I really am.</li>
            <li> After reading user reviews of the other stubble trimmers the general consensus is that they don&#x27;t shave close enough.</li>
            <li> Usually, I set the guard to minimum, and use the trimmer upside-down without the guard for a very close stubble trim.</li>
            <li> You can use it for a long time on a same charge.</li>
            <li> Long term, the reliability might pay off in terms of the cost, but without that versatility you&#x27;ll need to decide if trimming the beard and mustache is all you ever intend to use such a trimmer for.</li>
            <li> battery management circuitry is apparently not designed to preserve the battery life for plugged-in use.</li>
            <li> so you can use it for a while, the only gripe is that it will discharge completely if not plugged in within a month, without any use.</li>
            <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t really last that long.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, because there is no guard over the side, you have to hold the razor at an angle exactly perpendicular to the surface of your face or it will shave unevenly.  </li>
            <li> not keep the cord permanently plugged in\\&quot; and \\&quot;Discharge/run down the battery completely twice a year by letting the motor run until it stops\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the vacuum is sub par, as long as it cuts evenly at my desired setting ( 2-4)</li>
            <li> The manual seems to be at least a bit generic, as some of the descriptions were inaccurate for the details of this trimmer in particular.</li>
            <li> Now after a little over two years of regular use the rechargable battery holds only a short charge.  </li>
            <li> As a minor complaint, it has a very old-fashioned look with the burgundy color and the curvy stripes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a long while and the battery still charges and holds it well.</li>
            <li> But, don&#x27;t leave it plugged in too long.</li>
            <li> A standard disposable razor is 1 1/2\\&quot; wide.</li>
            <li> and you get a long beard/goatee/moustache.</li>
            <li> I like it because I can trim the grey ends off</li>
            <li> But it holds a charge a long time and has the power to do the job.</li>
            <li> The wide range of built in guard lengths frees up my drawer space from not having to keep up with several plastic guards.</li>
            <li> does hold a charge for a long time though.  </li>
            <li> It takes way too long to shave.  </li>
            <li> It stays charged a long time too.</li>
            <li> Yes, the hair does litter your bathroom sink / countertop afterwards, but nothing that a 5 second wipe with a sponge or wet cloth can&#x27;t take care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Suddenly it grabs my hair and screams like a dying cat as it tries to pull my face</li>
            <li> They hold a charge for a long time and I use them in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The only reason he purchased a new one is the blades become dull</li>
            <li> This means that if you hold the trimmer at different angles, it will cut your hair at varying lengths, all the way down to the actual blade.  </li>
            <li> Seems to hold a charge a long, long time, although I don&#x27;t use it every single day.</li>
            <li> and there aren&#x27;t any extra pieces to get lost (other than, perhaps, the charging cord).</li>
            <li> The Qt4022 may be a little bit more expensive than other similar devices out there</li>
            <li> believe the claims about wash-ability (I rinse the unit regularly), and the blades seem to be as sharp now (without maintenance) as when I bought the unit.</li>
            <li> Expect your skin to be dry and maybe even flaky after using this at its lowest setting.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using the trimmer several times over the last few weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only time will tell, its only been a few days and these are our initial reactions to this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Prior product was deficient in manyrespects but this really fills the bill.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, the trimmer takes forever to cut through hair, as it has a very low RPM motor compared to the old cheapo one I had, and is in slow motion compared to my Panasonic Arc4 razor.  </li>
            <li> find the adjustable guard works well for me, but I have used it in a limited capacity.</li>
            <li> Why, oh why did they skimp out so much on the battery/charging section?rioration due to overcharging, and it is the least preferred charging method concerning battery performance.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> As mentioned in some other reviews, it does not cover the blades entirely, but it is not really a problem.</li>
            <li> has nothing negative to say about his new trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Got one at a local store because the airline lost my previous stubble trimmer.  </li>
            <li> 45mins and each time i only use for less than 5mins.</li>
            <li> But for me who likes to trim once or twice a week to keep a light beard, it is not possible with this product due to uneven cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding vendor, initially a wrong product was shipped in place of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> This one is difficult to use and creates a huge mess.  </li>
            <li> If you are Asian or your beard is not rich, do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> I had the unfortunate experience, with my Remington adjustable hair trimmer, of setting it on a certain length, only to have it collapse as I shaved my head, to the lowest setting, forcing me to take all my hair off.     </li>
            <li> but once you wet the head area it will  continue to leak out the bottom where the charger plug connects.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not ready to give those away yet -</li>
            <li> All I expected from a trimmer is One-day after shave look</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not) with increments of 0,5 millimeters, giving you a wide range of lenght</li>
            <li> The electric cord is the loose-type, not spring-loaded, with a generous length that reaches both of my sinks.</li>
            <li> Its not supposed to get wet</li>
            <li> not much thought to the customers needs.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts longer than I expected between charges, although I wish it was a lithium battery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the trimmer for a few months</li>
            <li> I basically fully submerge them and often I use them after I have already gotten my face wet.  </li>
            <li> Let me address a few of my initial concerns:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month in a weekly base and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> I do have an electric trimmer for my goatee, but it&#x27;s not really designed for cutting right next to the skin, and can pinch a little bit when I use it to mow the facial</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it slightly improperly (holding it upside down so that there is no guard), and it gives me a shave so close that my wife thought for a minute or two that I had used my regular razors.</li>
            <li> It goes from just less than close shaved (still a millimeter of stubble) to quite long.</li>
            <li> For half the price (or less) you can get an appliance with multiple heads and comparable performance.</li>
            <li> The past 4 years I had been shaving up towards my cheeks, and while it was cutting the hair nice, it would still be uneven at some</li>
            <li> Only lasted 2 yrs with very little use.  </li>
            <li> The price is reasonable, but would still be a poor value at half the price.</li>
            <li> Sharp Blades&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the other stubble trimmers so I&#x27;ll try to compare this to a Norelco G370 beard trimmer that I have.    </li>
            <li> Plus, the blades are designed to stay sharp and do not require to be replaced, you can&#x27;t beat convenience like that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other products from Norelco, like for example the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Brazil and Philips products here are pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and trims well and evenly.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I like the unit.</li>
            <li> I tried this trimmer out along with about 4 other \\&quot;stubble trimmers\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Over time, however, this capacity has been reduced, due to my arguable miss-use of shaving with the trimmer plugged in to the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have extremely course/thick hair on my face, and this trimmer cuts it</li>
            <li> trimming was extremely even and painless.</li>
            <li> but so has every other trimmer i&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Use it once a weak and charged it 4 times so far!</li>
            <li> It can barely power through even the softest of hair, let alone a thick beard.</li>
            <li> However, consider the following: The blades on this thing are self sharpening; It&#x27;s virtually impossible to nick yourself with this thing (unless you use it with complete and total reckless abandon); You will get no more razor bumps/burns (again, if used even close to properly); and&lt;br /&gt;you won&#x27;t need to buy shaving cream or aftershave.</li>
            <li> As someone who had never had a positive experience with an electric shaver or trimmer, I was skeptical, but ended up picking it up on sale at Marshall&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally the guard is thick but widely spaced, so hair tends to lay flat in between the tines and not reach the trimmer, even if it is longer than the guard is tall.  </li>
            <li> My 5yr old G370 still works, but the battery life is now atrocious, not lasting long after a single charge.</li>
            <li> On its lowest setting the comb rests behind the actual cutting mechanism of the blades which is fine for the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big finesse guy, so this also concerned me, but it&#x27;s hard for me to screw it up.</li>
            <li> The actual shaving quality is the biggest negative.</li>
            <li> I think this designs merely for stubble and do it really well.</li>
            <li> When you plug the trimmer in to charge it, a light near the plug base slowly blinks.  </li>
            <li> * a companion for a shaver (this won&#x27;t shave all the way down, but could suffice for some situations)&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can put it under the tap in the sink without any fear of it breaking down.</li>
            <li> Plus it cuts the stubble down to size where I can finish the job with my electric razor.  </li>
            <li> and then I wouldn&#x27;t be so inclined to run it down before recharging.</li>
            <li> The plastic guard for the trimmer head covers the entire cutting area- contrary to the other reviews I&#x27;ve read about it not covering completely.</li>
            <li> My rotary triple head electric shaver is naturally quieter, but for a traditional back &amp; forth electric razor I was shocked by how little noise this makes.    </li>
            <li> B003V37ZDS Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black]]</li>
            <li> Third is the price, it&#x27;s just too expensive for such a limited-use trimmer.</li>
            <li> There is a chance for you to poke yourself only at the shortest setting, and only if you hold the trimmer at the wrong angle, which should not happen at all because you should be pushing the comb against your face.</li>
            <li> The trimmer head is smaller than I would have imagined it, yet it managed to trim difficult areas such as the neck and allows for precision trimming.</li>
            <li> This means all it takes is one slight tip of the trimmer to buzz a chunk of your eyebrow/beard out.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t \\&quot;comb\\&quot; up the hair with the guard without risking buzzing a chunk out as previously mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> My facial hair came out uneven, and I was forced to return the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I would prefer a slightly rounded leading edge.</li>
            <li> I have been using this trimmer for 1 and a half years now, and it is truly outstanding.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One possible negative is that the cutting head does not swivel like some modern shavers so it must be held perpendicular to cut at the correct length.</li>
            <li> does make quite a mess though</li>
            <li> As other negative reviews pointed out, the spacing between the blade teeth and comb is way too wide.</li>
            <li> This makes it easier to follow curves but it also takes a little longer to perform its task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like the head to be a little wider</li>
            <li> If you like having a little bit of stubble (or a lot)</li>
            <li> that, unlike hair trimmers, you can&#x27;t use this without the guide to get a really close cut, since the cutting teeth are pointed rather than</li>
            <li> On the plus side the charge lasts for quite a few uses, so I don&#x27;t have to charge it that often.  </li>
            <li> This design flaw caused me to trim my beard unevenly</li>
            <li> Thankfully, the wheel snaps firmly into place at each setting preventing accidental slippage during use.</li>
            <li> Be careful when trimming, there are not effective guards installed to keep you from getting cut.</li>
            <li> Only for people who want to keep daily stubble and just trim everything off, then you won&#x27;t notice the uneven cutting.</li>
            <li> Four years after buying it the battery is almost dead.</li>
            <li> Uneven cuts?</li>
            <li> charging (of NiMH batteries) can cause battery deterioration due to overcharging, and it is the least preferred charging method concerning battery</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just plain silliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The negative reviews mentioning how bad the guide comb is absolutely true.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for a very less price</li>
            <li> Too bad, because I&#x27;m pretty lost as to what else to purchase to replace it.</li>
            <li> The only bad part about this trimmer would be its power management, which is essentially non-existent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The biggest complaint: the light in the base flashes while it is plugged in to charge</li>
            <li> The head may seem quite small</li>
            <li> The charger is small and used infrequently.</li>
            <li> I usually let it go a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> Or, it&#x27;s for those who aren&#x27;t lazy but who want to look like those of us who are.</li>
            <li> This means I usually have to use the \\&quot;2\\&quot; and wait about two days to get what I want for 2 days and then repeat.</li>
            <li> A few months after the rebate processor received my resubmission along with a complaint, they agreed to honor the rebate.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat small and svelte yet this helps with control while trimming in the mirror.</li>
            <li> A disappointing product from Philips Norelco, which surprised me because I have purchased trimmers from them before</li>
            <li> The shaving area of this trimmer is way too small.  </li>
            <li> But surely not for beards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s with not a little disappointment that I have to lambaste this mediocre trimming tool given my glowing reviews of Philips&#x27; QT4070 beard trimmer in an earlier time.</li>
            <li> but this product is not very good on a beard of any length.</li>
            <li> But it is not suitable for everyone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so disappointed cause this seemed so promising.</li>
            <li> Hair also gets in the length-adjusting dial and is hard to remove.</li>
            <li> (Eventually the blades get dull or the motor bearings seize up.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer in late December 2011 when it was on a flash sale at Amazon for $19.97.  </li>
            <li> Just use some common sense when you use</li>
            <li> But this model can&#x27;t be opened, at least not without breaking the housing.</li>
            <li> , this review is coming from an Indian guy with really thick hair.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is cumbersome, the blades don&#x27;t trim evenly (necessitating a veritable acrobatics about the face, usually resulting in uneven length and repeated, tedious strokes), and a beard longer than a week will prove a challenge even to an inveterate groomer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s because of the ridiculous charging system and instructions.</li>
            <li> following comb makes it impossible to shave under your nose with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It actually feels just like the awful trimmers that norelco sticks on the back of its electric shavers.</li>
            <li> Definitely not a good experience.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly, no.</li>
            <li> After charging, the very first use ended with painful pulls and a small bloody nick on my face.  </li>
            <li> It is very slow, maybe because it&#x27;s cordless.  </li>
            <li> and you have to go very, very slow.</li>
            <li> Water dripping out of the spot where you are suppose to connect electricity seems like a really poor design.  </li>
            <li> That had to be the philosophy behind the design of this trimmer.</li>
            <li> the Magnificent?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it gets worse.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, if you don&#x27;t manage this charging game well, you&#x27;ll kill the Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) battery prematurely.  </li>
            <li> Personally I thought the selection wheel was rather idiot proof.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly the adjustable guard is extremely poorly designed.  </li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would give this a poor review.</li>
            <li> Poor design and</li>
            <li> I have used competitors products, both from remmington two times with poor results.</li>
            <li> Claiming this a bad product because the blades can cut you, is similar to claiming pencils are bad products because you can stab yourself with it.  </li>
            <li> Trying to get the stubble look was difficult until I got this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Because of that experience, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product as the length adjusting mechanism here is fool and fail proof compared to the Remington one.  </li>
            <li> However it is a bit pricey for a mere stubble trimmer.  </li>
            <li> battery failed</li>
            <li> listen to the people people saying this is difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> The rubberized surface makes cleaning difficult.  </li>
            <li> Sadly the battery, or some electrical system inside the trimmer, died a mere 9 months after use.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> Move the wrong way and you may as well be cutting at the shortest level.</li>
            <li> No matter what number you put it on, there&#x27;s no way you can stop it from cutting the hair with the number zero.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s about as useless as a screen door on a submarine!  </li>
            <li> You doing something wrong!</li>
            <li> This turns out to be basically an impossible task at the shorter comb settings.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, the battery management is so bad, that the unit has no way to even let you know when it is fully charged.  </li>
            <li> .5mm, uncomfortably close even... which isn&#x27;t necessarily a horrible thing.</li>
            <li> so I take out one star and rank it with four stars.</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every time I use it, it reminds me how much I hate</li>
            <li> After about 2 months of use, the clip attaching the blade to the trimmer&#x27;s body broke off - rendering the product useless!!!</li>
            <li> The worst part is, if you keep charging it, you will damage the battery, so you need to unplug it after charging it fully...</li>
            <li> This is the worst beard/stubble trimmer i&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> but the adjustable comb on it is awful.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product at first, the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for more then 5 minutes after a year of use though...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very comfortable . but dont cut easily what i want.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s just so so . it&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;use easy.</li>
            <li> For my first trimmer, I&#x27;m glad I choose it. I&#x27;ve had this for a long while and the battery still charges and holds it well. Easy to clean and operate. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Well it definitely is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve used if price is taken out of the equation, but I&#x27;m a bit on the fence with the $40 price.  Here&#x27;s what you get:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* an outstanding all around trimmer (don&#x27;t let the Stubble Trimmer Pro label limit the scope of this tool&#x27;s abilities)&lt;br /&gt;* corded or cordless utility (oddly enough this is becoming a rarity, as many cordless shavers will not work while plugged in)&lt;br /&gt;* handy build in adjustable guard&lt;br /&gt;* a companion for a shaver (this won&#x27;t shave all the way down, but could suffice for some situations)&lt;br /&gt;* no irritation or any kind&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond those solid tangibles, there are many nuances that makes this an outstanding tool, notably ergonomics, balance, performance.  As with most trimmers, you get a huge upgrade from what&#x27;s included in electric shavers (even the best electric shavers have virtually useless trimmers), and you also don&#x27;t have a bulky shaver obscuring precise trim work.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable! How am I supposed to use this product when all it&#x27;ll do is shave a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow! No matter what number you put it on, there&#x27;s no way you can stop it from cutting the hair with the number zero. I can&#x27;t believe Philips has designed this!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to keep a 5 oclock shadow look going all day. I previously had a cheap $15 norelco and was looking for a better one that would cut closer.  This shaver has a quality feel. Its got a rubber backing and fits well in your hand.  But after that the rest of the shaver is sub-par. The battery charing is a pain as it doesn&#x27;t tell you when it is fully charged or how much for a charge is even left. It is washable which seams like a great option but once you wet the head area it will  continue to leak out the bottom where the charger plug connects. Water dripping out of the spot where you are suppose to connect electricity seems like a really poor design.  The actual shaving quality is the biggest negative. I used it with out any guard and it was no where near a stubble look. It looked like had not shaved in 2 days not 8 hours....    Overall I would not recommend anyone with a thicker beard you this because it doesn&#x27;t come close to keeping a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, its closer to how i look 36 hours after I shave. I would have been better of sticking with the 15 dollar one from target, that one even comes with a stand.</li>
            <li> Bought this after using and breaking 2 Norelco bodygrooms. I loved those things, but clearly not meant for facial hair (realized this the hard way). Decided to stick with Norelco and go ahead with the stubble trimmer, a product specifically designed for what I had been using the bodygroom for (facial hair), although the bodygroom is awesome everywhere else.....and YES, I would recommend getting both and using them specifically for what they are designed for, to avoid breakage. Been using this facial trimmer for a couple months so far. Good grip, easy to use, sweet for touch ups around the ears/sideburns, makes it easy and quick to get the perfect stubble look even on your neck without any irritation. Would def recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Trying to get the stubble look was difficult until I got this trimmer.  You can set millimeters with one click of the adjustment dial.  Great trimmer!</li>
            <li> Superb trimmer. The best I have found. Great for that stubble look. Ultra fast shipping. Adjustments are made using a dial instead of guards. Works Great.</li>
            <li> I always wanted a machine that will give me that 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look. This machine did the trick. I use a razor to fix the edges of my beard, and then run this machine on the lowest setting over my beard for that great 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look. Cleaning it is a breeze. I just run it under the fountain for about five seconds. Also, a great feature to this machine is that you can run it on a dead battery as long as you have it plugged in. Many similar machines require you to have a full charge in order to use it, but not this one!!!! Great buy!!!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband to try. He has very sensitive skin and finds that the wet shaving he normally does causes all kind of trouble: razor burn, nicks and scratches can easily become nasty spots. Enter the Philips perfect stubble trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This somewhat futuristically-shaped trimmer is long and nicely curved to fit your hand comfortably. It comes with a tiny separate brush and a wall outlet adapter. The unit is fairly light weight with a fairly narrow trimming edge of aprox 1.5 inches. The trimmer takes a couple of hours for the battery to charge after which you can use it for some considerable time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer has an adjustable height knob on the back that goes from 0.5 mm to about 1cm so it&#x27;s good for more than just stubble and can be used for longer hair too. The head may seem quite small but it&#x27;s well suited to trimming the face and areas like the upper lip without discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is quiet barely louder than our electric toothbrush which is really nice. It&#x27;s also water proof which makes it easy to clean.  You can put it under the tap in the sink without any fear of it breaking down. This means that you don&#x27;t really need the small brush that is provided. A good thing because we have already lost the cleaning brush.  It&#x27;s really tiny, would have been nice to have had a storage place on the trimmer handle to stow it away. The charger is small and used infrequently. My husband has been using the trimmer several times over the last few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are good, he got quite scruffy before because of his reluctance to shave, in case he broke out. Now with the stubble trimmer he always looks like he hasn&#x27;t shaved for a day maybe and still quite clean and tidy as opposed to the scruffy look without.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to shave every day.  I usually let it go a couple of days.  The problem with that is then when I do shave it&#x27;s a bit of a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t use my electric razor if I let it go more than a day.  I can use a regular blade, but I have to clean it out after every swipe.  I do have an electric trimmer for my goatee, but it&#x27;s not really designed for cutting right next to the skin, and can pinch a little bit when I use it to mow the facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This \\&quot;Stubble Trimmer Pro\\&quot; is a fairly good solution.  I can adjust it to cut my goatee just like I like it (not very long).  Plus it cuts the stubble down to size where I can finish the job with my electric razor.  When I do use it to shorten stubble or prep my face for a full shave, it glides over the face quite smoothly without any pinching or chafing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice, sleek design.  It&#x27;s easy to wash and clean.  The built-in shave guard can be easily extended so that you can select the length from fairly short (not quite as short as I&#x27;d like, but short enough to razor the rest of it) to about half an inch.  It works good for my purposes.  It&#x27;s not quite as versatile as my beard and goatee trimmer set - so I&#x27;m not ready to give those away yet - but I don&#x27;t use them very often now that I have this.  I do like the fact that this is just one piece - you can remove the shave guard for cleaning purposes, but normally it stays on the trimmer which means this is easy to store and there aren&#x27;t any extra pieces to get lost (other than, perhaps, the charging cord).</li>
            <li> This thing does one thing well and that is to give you any size stubble you want. I use this everyday and have a good looking stubble going on 24/7</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful stubble trimmer, it allows you to quickly and easily turn a beard into a nice light stubble. It is sleek and comfortable in your hand and is very easy to maneuver into hard to those hard to reach areas. It is gentle on the face because the guide comb is actually flexible and not hard. You can actually wash it under running water, that is the first time I have personally seen that, this is very convenient. This is a very high quality and durable device and I recommend it for those men that like to maintain stubble or like to occasionally go from a full beard to a very light beard if you are like me and it grows back in 72 hours.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I wanted a trimmer that would allow me to shave to stubble length rather than shaving it clean with a razor.  So I bought this.  It works great, and there&#x27;s a lot of flexibility with the length-settings.  Also, it&#x27;s a sturdy-feeling product that feels good in the hand -- not too light, not too heavy.  Really happy with this.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and my 16 year old son tested this razor for me, and both of them loved it.  My husband loved the adjustability of the shave, so he could easily trim his beard to a shorter length without any trouble.  His beard looks better than it has in years.  You can set the razor for a setting from 1-10, with 1 being a close shave and 10 being pretty long.  He also loved the way it felt---very easy to use and effective---and the fact you can plug it in, which he prefers to battery use.  My son is not keen on shaving at all, although he needs to.  He has a blond shaggy beard when he doesn&#x27;t, which looks quite unkempt.  We got him to try this razor and he actually seemed pleased with it.  It shaved well and he had no trouble using it, even as an new shaver.  He used the 1 setting, but likes the idea that if he wants to in the future, he can leave stubble to the extent he feels like.  We haven&#x27;t tried it for this year, but my husband sometimes gives our boys crew cuts for the summer, and this should work very well to give them a custom cut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also just looks good---a nice design and color.  I haven&#x27;t seen such enthusiasm over a razor around the house ever before!</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco Qt4022/41 Stubble Trimmer Pro&lt;br /&gt;So far, this model is holding it&#x27;s charge much longer than some other electric shavers that we&#x27;ve used in the past. It comes out of the box already charged, however the instructions state to fully charge prior to initial use, so we charged this overnight.  It works like most other trimmers, and was easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;My husband&#x27;s first reaction was how sharp the blades are.  He was impressed that he did a quick first pass over his beard &amp; mustache and didn&#x27;t need to go over it again.  Adjusting the length was simple, as there is only one attachment, and the adjustment wheel.  Clean up was fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial Pros &amp; Cons A/O 05/01/2011&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Sharp Blades&lt;br /&gt;- Ready to use right out of the box&lt;br /&gt;- one attachment which adjusts to 10 different lengths  no need to keep up with multiple attachments, less clutter)&lt;br /&gt;- easy to clean under running tap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- only for stubble look/ he still needs a separate razor for clean shave trimming&lt;br /&gt;- seems a bit costly compared to similar models&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only time will tell, its only been a few days and these are our initial reactions to this trimmer.  I will come back and update this review with additional information concerning battery life, and blade wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 10/18/2011 :  This little trimmer is still going strong, holds its charge very well.  My husband uses this on a regular basis and is still pleased with the performance.</li>
            <li> First, you should realize that this QT4022 is like a pair of small hair clippers. It is not your standard electric shaver (you know, the kind that looks like they have a bent cheese-grater across the top, or three whirly circles?). These kind of just look like a petite version of the clippers a barber might use. That being said, I was using a pair of standard hair clippers to maintain a \\&quot;stubble\\&quot;, and the hair clippers did not do as even or as close of a job as the QT4022 does. Also, this thing doesn&#x27;t require oil, the way hair clippers do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now the QT4022 costs about $40.00, which seems at first like a steep price. However, consider the following: The blades on this thing are self sharpening; It&#x27;s virtually impossible to nick yourself with this thing (unless you use it with complete and total reckless abandon); You will get no more razor bumps/burns (again, if used even close to properly); and&lt;br /&gt;you won&#x27;t need to buy shaving cream or aftershave. I&#x27;d say it pays for itself within  a couple of months (as long as your employer doesn&#x27;t require a baby&#x27;s-butt smooth shave every day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it slightly improperly (holding it upside down so that there is no guard), and it gives me a shave so close that my wife thought for a minute or two that I had used my regular razors. Used properly, with the guard, I imagine that it would work very well to maintain a short beard or stubble, depending on which of the 10 settings you use (the \\&quot;settings\\&quot; just push the guard further away from the clippers, like the barber adding a bigger attachment to hair clippers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, hope this was some real-world info that helps you decide if you want this product.</li>
            <li> PHILIPS NORELCO QT4022/41 STUBBLE TRIMMER PRO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has worn a goatee and mustache for over 30 years, ever since he lost a bet with me regarding something foolish!  But the look suits him and he has never been without facial hair since that fateful betting day.  When this product was offered on VINE, I decided to get him one.  And am I glad that I did! So is he!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom has nothing negative to say about his new trimmer.  He has several others, but this one is now his favorite.  It trims well, as close as you want.  The end result is a clean cut, precise, sharp look.  There&#x27;s no tugging or pulling on facial hair or skin and it works quickly and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other good points are it is electrically rechargeable but the cord is removable so there&#x27;s no fighting with a cord while trying to get your shaving accomplished.  The trimmer is adjustable for any length desired; beard or stubble, whatever your look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also light-weight and fits in a man-sized hand comfortably.  It&#x27;s easy to clean with the brush that&#x27;s included and you can also clean by safely running under tap water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is strictly a trimmer, also good for trimming hair lines, but would not be used as a total face shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product for all of the men in your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pam</li>
            <li> I had the unfortunate experience, with my Remington adjustable hair trimmer, of setting it on a certain length, only to have it collapse as I shaved my head, to the lowest setting, forcing me to take all my hair off.     Because of that experience, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product as the length adjusting mechanism here is fool and fail proof compared to the Remington one.  I had no worries about any mishaps, and none occurred, when I trimmed my face.    This is a really easy to use unit that is pre-charged when it arrives.  Just turn the length dial to your desired setting, push the power button, and away you go.  No pain, and really quick too!  In addition it&#x27;s really easy to clean as there is no oil on the removable parts so I can use the supplied brush to take 10 seconds to clean it off after use.    Easy to use, safe, quick, painless, easy to maintain.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is another product for us lazy guys who don&#x27;t want to shave more than a couple of times a week. Or, it&#x27;s for those who aren&#x27;t lazy but who want to look like those of us who are. I got it to use when I don&#x27;t want to look like I&#x27;m quite as lazy as I really am. (That&#x27;s why I use the closest setting with the guard on.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line? It works just like their hype says. It&#x27;s adjustable. I have not noticed any irritation. I can shave multiple times on a charge. It&#x27;s easy to adjust and clean. And, best of all, my wife doesn&#x27;t get on me to shave quite as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t owned another such device, so I can&#x27;t compare features or value. I do like it; have used it for over a month and plan to keep using it on a regular basis. I have lots of stuff I can&#x27;t say that about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, why only four stars? It&#x27;s because of the ridiculous charging system and instructions. The charging light blinks while it&#x27;s charging. Oh, and after it&#x27;s charged. But, don&#x27;t leave it plugged in too long. And, you can shave with it plugged in. But, only if the battery is totally discharged. But, you have to charge it for a few minutes first. That&#x27;s just plain silliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: after more than a year of use, I still find this to work quite well for those days between regular blade shaves.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco Stubble Trimmer Pro does a great job of doing what it is supposed to do: trim hair and leave even stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has some advantages over some similar devices: it is slim and nice to hold, very well-balanced, with that rubbery plastic that is easy-to-grip even when wet. The length adjustment is easy with the dial and it doesn&#x27;t slip during use. The trimmer can be rinsed off and opens easily to clean without losing parts and it requires no lubrication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest complaint: the light in the base flashes while it is plugged in to charge but there is no way to know when the battery is fully charged. Hair also gets in the length-adjusting dial and is hard to remove. As a minor complaint, it has a very old-fashioned look with the burgundy color and the curvy stripes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The width of the blade is 1 1/4\\&quot; which is much narrower than most other trimmers. A standard disposable razor is 1 1/2\\&quot; wide. This makes it easier to follow curves but it also takes a little longer to perform its task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, a nice little stubble trimmer, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and this trimmer hasn&#x27;t caused any issues. I had to get a shaving waiver at work since I am supposed to be clean shaven but if you can get by with having a short stubble then this is the item for you!</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s intended to do.  I&#x27;d like the head to be a little wider so it would need fewer passes.  The instructions say if you leave it plugged into the charger it will damage the battery, so the technology there seems kind of cheap and out of date.  Also, it takes ten hours to charge it, so you have to plan ahead so you can be there to unplug it before you damage it.  Kind of a pain.  On the plus side the charge lasts for quite a few uses, so I don&#x27;t have to charge it that often.  I do really like that I can just rinse it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/24/67:  Despite religiously following the manual&#x27;s charging instructions, my battery is dying.  I now have to recharge it after just a couple uses, or use it plugged in.  There is also a very noticeable dip in power when I use it on battery vs. when it&#x27;s plugged in.  I knocked another star off the rating because a product like this should last many years, rather than becoming landfill after one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to replace a fancy Norelco.  Sure, this does not collect the hair, but just lay a towel down.  He loves this shaver - simple and does a real good job on any level.  Also, some rechargable shavers can not be used until they charge - this one can be used either plugged in or charged.  Great choice for the money!</li>
            <li> The best I ever had. The charge is great, and it is water proof. Works excellent.  You can use it for a long time on a same charge.</li>
            <li> Very fast and accurate compared to the trimmer on my razer. Glad I bought this.. I have not had to recharge in about three weeks.</li>
            <li> great for travel... looks good, feels good and works like a charm... its silent and doesn&#x27;t get heated up like the last trimmer I had... plus the battery seems to stay charged for quiet a while...</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco Stubble Trimmer Pro is very easy to use. Trimming is fast and even. Much better than expected.</li>
            <li> Great stubble trimmer its feels great in your hand and it feels like its really solid along with being water resistant the adjustable guard is really neat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m &gt; than 40, have tried all the brands trimmers and this one out does them all for the five o&#x27;clock shadow look. It does regular trimming great too, better than all except a barbers pair that cost almost ten times more. FYI: still have not charged the battery once after 5 weeks of use. Super satisifed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the other stubble trimmers so I&#x27;ll try to compare this to a Norelco G370 beard trimmer that I have.    After reading user reviews of the other stubble trimmers the general consensus is that they don&#x27;t shave close enough. Well at .5mm on paper, this is as close as it gets. For whatever reason Babyliss no longer makes their elusive I-Trim models which also have .5mm to .8mm settings, and were only available in the UK anyway. Glad Norelco saw the need and decided to make one itself.    The Shave:  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  This thing shaves really close @ .5mm, uncomfortably close even... which isn&#x27;t necessarily a horrible thing. Expect your skin to be dry and maybe even flaky after using this at its lowest setting. Note that the plastic comb guard doesn&#x27;t spring-adjust to contour to your face like the QT4021, but at the same time I don&#x27;t think that \\&quot;feature\\&quot; would actually give a closer shave.    I&#x27;ve only shaved with it once and liked the result. In fact it cut so close that the \\&quot;stubble look\\&quot; lasted two days for me. That said, naturally uncut stubble is still better looking in my opinion, your results may vary. The QT4022 just gives you more control in terms of timing and can let you sport an everyday stubble if used consistently. Nothing else seems to provide this right now.    Build Quality:  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  In your hand it feels great. The rubber-like feel of the back will give you an excellent non-slip grip and while it&#x27;s not exactly heavy, it&#x27;s definitely not as light as other cheaper models which helps with stability. Plus the full-width adjustment setting rotary knob on the back is a really nice touch. No flimsy parts here that may break off. Guessing the attention to build quality is the main reason Norelco prices this model higher than its others. It should last you several years, with the biggest concern being the battery.    Battery:  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  This razor seems to have the older style battery because the manual warns of leaving it plugged in too long, letting it drain completely before recharging, etc... which is kind of a drag, but if it keeps the price down I can live with it. Wish I could comment on batt life, will amend this review later if it starts acting up. My 5yr old G370 still works, but the battery life is now atrocious, not lasting long after a single charge. But honestly, if I can get a good 4-5 years out of the stubble trimmer w/o battery issues I&#x27;ll be happy.    Note: if the battery&#x27;s dead the trimmer can work on full power by being plugged in which is a nice touch.    Noise:  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  Just a quick note on noise: it&#x27;s quiet. My rotary triple head electric shaver is naturally quieter, but for a traditional back &amp; forth electric razor I was shocked by how little noise this makes.    Rating:  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  Giving the Norelco QT4022 stubble trimmer 5/5 stars on Amazon mainly due to its solid build quality and the fact that nothing else currently available trims this close. Norelco did a good job of taking even the most basic functions from past models and tweaked them to make them better. Hoping all Norelco \\&quot;Pro\\&quot; models are this nice.</li>
            <li> To me, stubble refers to what Don Johnson often had while playing Sonny Crockett on Miami Vice. It looked as though he had last shaved 24-36 hours earlier, all the time. If you let facial hair grow beyond stubble, you end up with a short beard/goatee/moustache. Keep going and you get a long beard/goatee/moustache. The Stubble Trimmer Pro does a perfect job at allowing you to maintain a short or long beard, but it doesn&#x27;t do a great job with stubble because it doesn&#x27;t get close enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery works well and charges quickly. The physical heft of the product is just right and it fits well in the hand for manipulation. The clippers work beautifully such that you&#x27;ll get an evenly trimmed area without any difficulty. The ability to toss the entire thing under a running tap makes cleaning a breeze. But if you&#x27;re trying to maintain the edge of your goatee or moustache, or if you want to have an evenly trimmed area that is shorter than short (e.g. stubble), this product won&#x27;t do the trick. I find myself going back and forth between my Braun electric shaver/clipper and the Norelco trimmer. The Braun&#x27;s clipper isn&#x27;t quite as even in terms of the end result because it doesn&#x27;t have the adjustable plastic guard. But the Braun can more adequately edge the area of desired facial hair as well as shave the rest of your face without difficulty. What neither can do is give you Don Johnson&#x27;s perfect and continuous 5:00 shadow - if that&#x27;s the look you desire.</li>
            <li> The Stubble Trimmer Pro might work great for some faces, but I have found my perfect stubble exists somewhere between the \\&quot;2\\&quot; and \\&quot;3\\&quot; setting. This means I usually have to use the \\&quot;2\\&quot; and wait about two days to get what I want for 2 days and then repeat. I wish there was a \\&quot;2.5\\&quot; setting I could use every day.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to do one thing, do it well. That had to be the philosophy behind the design of this trimmer. It&#x27;s top notch at trimming facial hair, but I would not use it for much else.     There are many other grooming appliances out there that come with half a dozen interchangeable heads for different purposes. This has just one, the hair comb. Sure, you miss out on the nose trimmer, different size trimmer heads, body shavers and whatnot, but for straight-up beard and mustache trimming, it&#x27;s hard to beat this one. Already charged right out of the box, the manual still says to charge it for 10 hours before the first use. Handy illustrations show exactly how to disassemble the trimmer for cleaning after usage. The manual seems to be at least a bit generic, as some of the descriptions were inaccurate for the details of this trimmer in particular. Otherwise, the foldout instructions are spot on as to how to use it and care for it.    Results speak for themselves. The hair comb adjusts to more than 20 lengths so anyone outside ZZTop can manage their facial hair as desired. It trims well and does not seem to miss any strays, so going over a second time is not needed unless you forget to comb the hair out first. The comb removes simply for trimming hairlines or whatever else you might want to use it for, but I&#x27;ve only tried if on my goatee (I&#x27;m a guy, that&#x27;s all I figure to use it for).    The only drawback in my mind is the cost. For half the price (or less) you can get an appliance with multiple heads and comparable performance. Long term, the reliability might pay off in terms of the cost, but without that versatility you&#x27;ll need to decide if trimming the beard and mustache is all you ever intend to use such a trimmer for.</li>
            <li> Was sad to see my old Norelco go because the blade motor gear cracked one too many times, so I replaced it with this. It does work great when the battery is not dead, which seems to be every time I pick it up. I really miss my old AA powered trimmer. What a shame. Maybe I can convert it to AA&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me a good trimmer is as good as a razor.  Some days the irritation of a blade is just too much, and this elegantly designed trimmer is a perfect substitution.  It never pulls, and the built in guard allows you to adjust height with the roll of a switch.  It can even be rinsed under the faucet when brushing alone can&#x27;t get all shavings.  My only regret is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a carrying pouch.</li>
            <li> A trimmer is something I don&#x27;t want to think too much about.  I just want it work when I need it to.  I don&#x27;t want to spend time wondering if the unit is charged, if it&#x27;s charged too much or if the battery is near depletion.  Unfortunately, with this otherwise perfectly nice unit, you&#x27;ll have to keep on top of the battery condition because this trimmer doesn&#x27;t do that for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first problem I have is that according to the manual, it takes ten hours of charging to every one hour of usage!  10 hours charging for 1 hour of use?  Seriously?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the battery management is so bad, that the unit has no way to even let you know when it is fully charged.  In fact, there is no battery life indicator of any kind.  When you plug the trimmer in to charge it, a light near the plug base slowly blinks.  Sounds promising, right?  But to quote the manual and counter to all reasonable logic, \\&quot;After the trimmer is fully charged, the charging light will continue to blink.\\&quot;  Really?  That seems perfectly logical and modern... NOT.  Why didn&#x27;t they use an inexpensive circut to stop charging the battery once it&#x27;s fully charged? ?  ???  Really?  How is anyone supposed to KNOW when/if the battery is fully charged then?  Should I summon Karnak the Magnificent?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it gets worse.  Yes, because according to the manual \\&quot;Continuously recharging the trimmer will reduce the lifespan of the battery\\&quot; and \\&quot;Do not charge for more than 24 hours\\&quot; and \\&quot;...do not recharge the trimmer between trimming sessions - continue using it until the battery is completely empty\\&quot; and \\&quot;Do not keep the cord permanently plugged in\\&quot; and \\&quot;Discharge/run down the battery completely twice a year by letting the motor run until it stops\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, if you don&#x27;t manage this charging game well, you&#x27;ll kill the Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) battery prematurely.  According to a very well known, major manufacturer of electronics and batteries, \\&quot;extensive trickle charging (of NiMH batteries) can cause battery deterioration due to overcharging, and it is the least preferred charging method concerning battery performance.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about you, but to me, that is too much for me to be concerned about for a beard trimmer when I just want it work when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame because other than that, it&#x27;s a nice unit.  It&#x27;s light, nicely balanced, it feels nice in your hand, it&#x27;s easy to use, easy to adjust, easy to clean (it can be rinsed), and it does a nice job trimming my beard and sideburns.  Why, oh why did they skimp out so much on the battery/charging section?rioration due to overcharging, and it is the least preferred charging method concerning battery performance.\\&quot;    I don&#x27;t know about you, but to me, that is too much for me to be concerned about for a beard trimmer when I just want it work when I need it.

            <li> First of all, keep in mind this is not an electric shaver, so if you are expecting a perfect and close shave, you may not get it with the Qt4022.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s in the box? The Qt4022, a charging adapter and a cleaning brush (a case would have been nice but that is not included)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As stated in the product description, this is designed for the perfect stubble. As a trimmer, it does a great job but again, not as close as an electric shaver or a razor. Adjustable lengths go between 1/32 inch and 13/32 inch, also a combing guide is included so direct contact with the skin is avoided to prevent skin irritation and the like. Its design is ergonomic, light and it feels very well made. As I&#x27;ve said before, for those who find an issue with the price, you get what you pay for. The Qt4022 may be a little bit more expensive than other similar devices out there but when you see it and hold it in your hand you can tell it is worth it. Plus, the blades are designed to stay sharp and do not require to be replaced, you can&#x27;t beat convenience like that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other products from Norelco, like for example the [[ASIN:B003V37ZDS Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black]], it is fully washable and does not require to be disassembled to be cleaned up. Charging times are fast and so far this has worked great! I have also been using it to shape the beard and even to \\&quot;fix\\&quot; my kid&#x27;s hair in between haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that this is perfect on its own and as a complement to the Sensotouch 3d I already had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if a trimmer is what you need, I can definitely recommend this one, remember that you are getting a quality product that additionally offers a warranty so, for the price, I&#x27;d say go for it!</li>
            <li> I was excited about this trimmer thinking it would be an excellent tool to use between shaves to clean up unsightly stubble.  However, it&#x27;s about as useless as a screen door on a submarine!  I don&#x27;t notice it cutting anything on my face and is only good for maybe a little bit of cleaning up of my sideburns.  Did I misunderstand what this thing is supposed to do?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sleek, it&#x27;s simple, it&#x27;s easy to clean, it feels good against the cheeks.  I wish I&#x27;ve owned this thing earlier in life!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is exactly what I was looking for. Very good professional-quality feel, great beard trimmer overall. Feels like it will last a long time, unlike my old Remington trimmer that had a cheap feel to it. I would recommend it- very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Norelco stubble trimmer because I have sensitive skin and do not like to shave with a razor every day. With this trimmer, I can now keep a closely trimmed stubble and shave with my razor only when absolutely necessary. It is very easy to use and is as good as advertised!</li>
            <li> First of all excuse me for writing a review before using a product...but for this I can&#x27;t resist. I was looking for a simple and perfect trimmer for long time because my requirement was to have a universal (110-240V) charger and durability. All I expected from a trimmer is One-day after shave look and I believed that&#x27;s why a trimmer is made for and not to expect a complete shave look.    I bought this product for a very less price, that, I don&#x27;t want to mention here just to avoid breaking our fellow owners. I was just browsing through a store and this perfect trimmer was lying on the shelf marked as xx% off items :) Just one last piece. Do you think there is any option left with me except grabbing it before someone would. Yes, I didn&#x27;t even think twice and it&#x27;s with me now. Will post a review after using it in 240v :-)</li>
            <li> There are three problems with this trimmer.  One is the stubble comb.  It does not fully cover the blades, therefore the unit must be held at a PERFECT angle for you to evenly cut your beard.  Hold it too high, and the blade is directly against your skin.  This makes trimming take FOREVER compared to the Remington MB series, which has a guard covering the whole blade, so you can just quickly drag it across your beard in the morning.  The second problem is that there is no indication of when the unit is done charging.  Third is the price, it&#x27;s just too expensive for such a limited-use trimmer.</li>
            <li> August 1st, 2013&lt;br /&gt;In the last 8 years I&#x27;ve used different Wahl eletric razors. I&#x27;m from Brazil and Philips products here are pretty expensive. A friend travelled to US so I asked him to bring me the QT4022. I must say I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of this product, especially considering it&#x27;s cost. I use it to maintain my stubble and even for body grooming (not design for it but gives good results).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Cheap&lt;br /&gt;-You can lock the lenght from 0,5 to 10 millimeters (the product description says 1 to 10 but it&#x27;s not) with increments of 0,5 millimeters, giving you a wide range of lenght choices.&lt;br /&gt;-The razor blades are very sharp and accurate, you won&#x27;t have to shave the same area over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;-Comfortable in the hand and not heavy.&lt;br /&gt;-Washable&lt;br /&gt;-Skin friendly (no skin irritations at all)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-No travel bag&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month in a weekly base and I&#x27;m loving it. I definately reccomend it. It&#x27;s a low cost and high quality product.</li>
            <li> When I first received this trimmer, it seemed ok, albeit unremarkable product. The operation was reasonably quiet. The battery is permanently sealed and not replaceable. For it&#x27;s selling price, one would expect it to have a lithium battery, which was not the case. After about 2 months of use, the clip attaching the blade to the trimmer&#x27;s body broke off - rendering the product useless!!! On top of that, the manufacturer (Philips Norelco) refused to honor the promised rebate offer.  Definitely not a good experience.  Update: A few months after the rebate processor received my resubmission along with a complaint, they agreed to honor the rebate. Guess it&#x27;s worth revising the rating up to 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for Christmas for my husband.  Being the girl that I am, I didn&#x27;t realize that it wasn&#x27;t an electric shaver.  It is, in fact, a stubble trimmer.  It still went over well, and he likes it.  He uses it to give himself that sexy five o clock shadow.</li>
            <li> This is a very nicely built trimmer and works extremely well for what it is intended for - trimming. It is in a maroon color that is darker than pictured, so it doesn&#x27;t look girly as I have originally imagined. The other side is made of black rubbery plastic which provides a very good grip. The size of the trimmer is longer than some of the others I&#x27;ve had, and it has a slim profile. It holds comfortably on my hands and is easy to manipulate it around my face.  The blades are sharp and trims well and evenly. The plastic comb is made of a translucent plastic. As mentioned in some other reviews, it does not cover the blades entirely, but it is not really a problem. There is a chance for you to poke yourself only at the shortest setting, and only if you hold the trimmer at the wrong angle, which should not happen at all because you should be pushing the comb against your face. Claiming this a bad product because the blades can cut you, is similar to claiming pencils are bad products because you can stab yourself with it.  The best thing about this trimmer is the length settings. There are 20 settings, all the way from 0.5mm to 10mm. The steps are uniform, unlike most other trimmers on the market, and the steps are also much finer than the other trimmers, so you can set it to the exact length you want. The lengths are adjusted with a dial in the middle of the trimmer. It is stiff enough so the settings won&#x27;t change while you are shaving, and it is easy to use. The trimmer is also completely washable for easy clean up.  The only bad part about this trimmer would be its power management, which is essentially non-existent. There is no indication if the battery is running low. It takes 10 hours to charge, but it wouldn&#x27;t let you know if it is fully charged or not. The worst part is, if you keep charging it, you will damage the battery, so you need to unplug it after charging it fully... which is not indicated... The only saving grace is that if you run out of battery, you can use it plugged in. For a product designed and made in 2011, this is unacceptable.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend another trimmer on the market at the moment because this one has the most precise settings, but I really hate its battery.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace a trimmer i&#x27;d had for years and was very happy with. The old trimmer had a guard comb that covered the entire blade assembly which i liked. This trimmer however leaves one side completely open and i found that this causes the trimmer to take off more or less depending on it&#x27;s angle. This design flaw caused me to trim my beard unevenly and i had to shave the whole thing off! I&#x27;m very displeased with this product and will likely return it.</li>
            <li> I love the feel, the quiet operation and the cleaning of the product.  Prior product was deficient in manyrespects but this really fills the bill.  Adjustability fantastic.  Charges quickly and holds for a good while.  Could not be happier.  As these products becomes more prevalent this should be on your evaluation list.</li>
            <li> I like using this stubble shaver cause I really don&#x27;t like blade shaving.  The unit works well.  My only dislike is the battery requires recharging fairly frequently.  Other than that, I like the unit.</li>
            <li> I tried this trimmer out along with about 4 other \\&quot;stubble trimmers\\&quot;.  After a comparison of each I would recommend the i-stubble trimmer from ConAir.  This one is difficult to use and creates a huge mess.  It took me about 20 min to shave with this one and about 5 min with the i-stubble.  The i-stubble appears to also get the closest at .4 mm.</li>
            <li> I already had the Norelco Qt4070.  It works great but 1mm is not short enough for the amount of stubble I like (~1.5-2 days since shave with a blade).  The vaccuum trimmer is easier to clean up but it doesn&#x27;t always retain the clippings and the contour following comb makes it impossible to shave under your nose with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The QT4022/41 is amazing.  First, it has a low profile guard so you can use the edge like normal clippers (where my sideburns meet the stubble of the beard).  It has no vaccuum function and flings clippings all over the place but you can rinse it off under the sink.  Rechargable battery is nice, the guide comb keeps the setting without bumping itself up or down...this is a better trimmer than the QT4070 at almost half the price.  1/2mm stubble is still the beginning of a beard, in my opinion...so stay away from the 1mm variants.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is awesome for getting that close stubble for those who can&#x27;t use a razor everyday.  It&#x27;s very gentle on the face and not like others I have used that pinch and cut in sensitive areas. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not up to the task of trimming manly stubble.  I used it on the shortest setting and it barely cuts the hair.  It is very slow, maybe because it&#x27;s cordless.  Also, the charger has a very high whistle or whine while it&#x27;s plugged in.  If your ears work, do not plug it up near your sleeping area.  I&#x27;m now back to my wired Wahl peanut trimmer, which I love.</li>
            <li> Have been using the product for several days and am very happy with it.  It works well for what it was designed for.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is ergonomic and fits the hand well. It is somewhat small and svelte yet this helps with control while trimming in the mirror. The trimmer head is smaller than I would have imagined it, yet it managed to trim difficult areas such as the neck and allows for precision trimming. One possible negative is that the cutting head does not swivel like some modern shavers so it must be held perpendicular to cut at the correct length. I cannot comment on whether a swivel-head makes a trimmer better (since I&#x27;ve never used one myself), but using this trimmer didn&#x27;t feel like an inconvenience to me and I got the hang of it quickly. The plastic guard for the trimmer head covers the entire cutting area- contrary to the other reviews I&#x27;ve read about it not covering completely. The guard can technically be removed which results in an even closer shave, but the .5mm setting with the guard gave a good enough 12-o&#x27;clock shadow for me. The motor speed is constant and non-adjustable, yet I feel it is adequate for proper operation. The trimmer maintained performance after extended use (approx. 15 minutes) and didn&#x27;t get clogged after shaving my full 25mm beard to .5mm stubble. It can get noticeably hot after extended use, but is probably not an issue when trimming stubble. The manual-selection wheel for cut-length is located on the inner-middle of the shaver; and since the thumb is positioned elsewhere during normal operation it is appropriately placed. The wheel is thumb-sized with individual length settings clearly displayed which makes length selection no-nonsense and easy to apply. Thankfully, the wheel snaps firmly into place at each setting preventing accidental slippage during use. Personally I thought the selection wheel was rather idiot proof. The electric cord is the loose-type, not spring-loaded, with a generous length that reaches both of my sinks. There is an oval LED where the cord connects to the shaver that blinks on and off while the battery is charging; thisseems to be the only piece of advanced electronics in the device. Generally, there aren&#x27;t any surprises with this trimmer and if you&#x27;ve used a traditional shaver then you will find there is no learning curve either. It has simplicity in design and is simple to use.</li>
            <li> This is my first trimmer and I must say that this served my purpose with precise cutting. I liked this product.</li>
            <li> If you like having a little bit of stubble (or a lot) this thing is for you! I keep mine on 2/10 length and it gives me the perfect tiny amount of stubble I like.  After using razors/elecric razors I would never consider going back.  I never have razer burn and my face is never uncomfortable anymore.  This is one of the best investments I&#x27;ve made!</li>
            <li> Does what it says and does it pretty well. Be careful when trimming, there are not effective guards installed to keep you from getting cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to have a stubble beard but none of my previous (admittedly cheap) trimmers or razors seemed to have the right length settings to pull it off. But this trimmer is fantastic! It has many length settings (20 I think?) and allows me to get exactly the length I&#x27;m looking for; either shorter or longer. What I especially like is that there are a lot of options in the shorter range, so you can probably find one to get exactly the length that you want. Bottom line: if you want a stubble look, I cannot recommend this trimmer highly enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer in late December 2011 when it was on a flash sale at Amazon for $19.97.  Now after a little over two years of regular use the rechargable battery holds only a short charge.  As a stubble trimmer, compared to others I&#x27;ve had I would rate this one average at best as it works best with the comb off, but then it can cut your lips and draw a little blood.  Overall I feel that I got what I paid for, a short-lived battery with a passable appliance wrapped around it. Best uses: cleaning up hairline on sides of neck and haircut touch-ups.  One nice feature is that when you plug it in to recharge you can use the trimmer while it recharges.</li>
            <li> I love the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and this works perfect.  This has been easy for hubby to keep me happy.</li>
            <li> It works without any problems. Just make sure to plug it an outlet to get full power using it. Works really well to get a stubble look.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this leaves Phillips Norelco leaves no razor burn even my old clippers did that...</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer, mediocer battery, poor battery management circuitry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin. After trying The Art of Shaving advice and many iterations of blades and products, as well as electric shavers, I gave up on close shaving and have stuck with stubble trimming. I had been using a cheap hair trimmer from a B&amp;M store, whose battery had lost a great deal of capacity over time - I still have this trimmer, and its battery lasts for minutes after extended charging. This trimmer (QT4022) is a vast improvement over that method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the adjustable guard works well for me, but I have used it in a limited capacity. Usually, I set the guard to minimum, and use the trimmer upside-down without the guard for a very close stubble trim. If I spend enough time, I can approximate a quick electric razor shave (I have one of mid tier quality to compare against). The guard has always stayed locked on the level I set it to, and when I&#x27;ve used it to attempt to keep a certain length of hair, it&#x27;s worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially surprised by the slower speed of the blades, but the unit works fine for me, and have given me the best stubble trim I&#x27;ve experienced thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the claims about wash-ability (I rinse the unit regularly), and the blades seem to be as sharp now (without maintenance) as when I bought the unit. I like the ergonomics of the whole thing, and the materials chosen (slick plastic front, grippy material back). I find this unit easy to clean, and I&#x27;ve used it regularly for some months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Battery:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing that the battery chemistry used here was chosen to reduce price. When the trimmer was new, the battery allowed me to go more than one trim on a single full charge (~15-20min each session for full face, front/back of the neck). Over time, however, this capacity has been reduced, due to my arguable miss-use of shaving with the trimmer plugged in to the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Battery Circuitry:&lt;br /&gt;The battery management circuitry is apparently not designed to preserve the battery life for plugged-in use. My battery is now entirely inoperable - after leaving the unit plugged in for 8+ hours, the battery powers the trimmer for &amp;#60;1 second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LED lighting that shows when the unit is plugged in, charging, and charged is a nice touch. The power adapter is well designed - it doesn&#x27;t extend horizontally, allowing it to fit in recessed or flush-set sockets. The adapter also feels like a quality built part, and doesn&#x27;t seem to emit any hum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this trimmer, but caution you to consider your use model - I&#x27;ve lost my ability to use this trimmer without a wall socket.</li>
            <li> This is the best beard trimmer that I have found, very happy with this cordless trimmer. No attachments included or needed - saves a lot of space.</li>
            <li> Love the trimmer because it can get a very close stubble but it is not as close as I hoped. You can take off the measure piece if you want it closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nicely charges so you can use it for a while, the only gripe is that it will discharge completely if not plugged in within a month, without any use.</li>
            <li> So I have been using this trimmer (which is pretty fairly priced here in Canada) for about 4 years now and only discovered this past week that you&#x27;re supposed to shave DOWN to get that even stubble/trim look. The past 4 years I had been shaving up towards my cheeks, and while it was cutting the hair nice, it would still be uneven at some parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you trim downwards, you get a nice even stubble trim that is literally perfect. I have extremely course/thick hair on my face, and this trimmer cuts it perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is extremely easy to clean and take apart, and just as important, allows you to clean in water. Extremely worth it.</li>
            <li> Got one at a local store because the airline lost my previous stubble trimmer.  After charging, the very first use ended with painful pulls and a small bloody nick on my face.  Immediately returned for refund.  As other negative reviews pointed out, the spacing between the blade teeth and comb is way too wide.</li>
            <li> A disappointing product from Philips Norelco, which surprised me because I have purchased trimmers from them before and they worked very well.  You must be careful with this one because it does not have any kind of guard on the side so it is very easy trim hair shorter than intended. Because of the poor guard design it doesn&#x27;t handle any kind of curves in the face well and you have to go very, very slow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the trimmer takes forever to cut through hair, as it has a very low RPM motor compared to the old cheapo one I had, and is in slow motion compared to my Panasonic Arc4 razor.  As a dedicated stubble trimmer it gets 3/5 stars. It does the job, but not that closely, and not fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly the adjustable guard is extremely poorly designed.  It only guards on the top and back, leaving the front section where the blades are completely exposed.  This means all it takes is one slight tip of the trimmer to buzz a chunk of your eyebrow/beard out.  Guess how I found that one out?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally the guard is thick but widely spaced, so hair tends to lay flat in between the tines and not reach the trimmer, even if it is longer than the guard is tall.  You can&#x27;t \\&quot;comb\\&quot; up the hair with the guard without risking buzzing a chunk out as previously mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;For grooming anything longer than stubble it gets 1/5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s wireless, but I use it 2 or 3 times and need to recharge it again.  Overall I&#x27;m very underwhelmed with this trimmer and now I&#x27;m just waiting for it to die so I can find something better.  Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Stubble blade stopped working not long after I bought it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Has the trimmer length adjuster built right in so there&#x27;s no extra parts everywhere .. Its water proof and rechargeable!</li>
            <li> good quality but more expensive than Best Buy</li>
            <li> Works great!! Very adjustable, charge last a long time, easy to clean and can be used in the shower....what more could you ask for!</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old 12-year old Norelco trimmer.  This was a good choice.  It took some time getting used to it (it has a different feel compared to my old trimmer) but it works really well.  I&#x27;m happy with Norelco products.</li>
            <li> bought this at the end of june and 6-7 weeks later i&#x27;m still trimming my stubble from the first charge. granted i only use the trimmer 2-3 times per week it still amazes me that i&#x27;ve had yet to recharge it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s with not a little disappointment that I have to lambaste this mediocre trimming tool given my glowing reviews of Philips&#x27; QT4070 beard trimmer in an earlier time. This trimmer is cumbersome, the blades don&#x27;t trim evenly (necessitating a veritable acrobatics about the face, usually resulting in uneven length and repeated, tedious strokes), and a beard longer than a week will prove a challenge even to an inveterate groomer. Basically, this product is inferior to Philips&#x27; other trimmers currently on the market (the 4050/4070 lines) or Remington&#x27;s Smart Touch trimmer, recently released. Avoid this product and let it die a speedy death from lack of sales.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works only if the wire is plugged, however it says Rechargeable Battery without electric power it does not work. One pros is, the style is really good.</li>
            <li> Overall very happy with this product. Only wish it trimmed a lower closer on the shortest setting (its close, but not anything that would compare to a fresh shave). The quality of the machine seems solid, especially considering the price (~25). Its not supposed to get wet but ive rinsed it after some uses, although im not sure if thats ok to do... however, hasnt caused any problems yet.</li>
            <li> The trimmer was fine the first month but after that it stopped working. I have to always plug it in and use it. And many times even that does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
            <li> Its OK. Works like it says it would but the shaver head hurts and scratches if you use it for close shaving. Well built though.</li>
            <li> I havbeen amazed from the first time I used this product.  I have a \\&quot;scraggly\\&quot; beard so I keep mine trimmed very short.  However, I never could get the look I liked until I purchased the Philips Norelco Stubble Trimmer.  And because it&#x27;s battery operated, I keep in in the vanity drawer and can use it every two days.  Fantastic Product at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> exactly what i was looking for. it&#x27;s an awesome product and has a cool sleek look. the design reminds me of an hp laptop i had back in the day ha. my face is pretty sensitive but it didn&#x27;t irritate me whatsoever. trimming was extremely even and painless. i can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would give this a poor review. does make quite a mess though but so has every other trimmer i&#x27;ve used so it&#x27;s no big deal. i would gladly pay $50+ for this. there&#x27;s no reason not to buy it, especially at such a good price.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great for playing with stubble and varying the length to emphasize the jaw or neckline. It goes from just less than close shaved (still a millimeter of stubble) to quite long. I like it because I can trim the grey ends off and my stubble looks darker. Nice for fading effects from jawline upward, lots of things you can do. Seems to hold a charge a long, long time, although I don&#x27;t use it every single day. The charger plug is kind of awkward, like an old fashion flip-phone charger that takes some concentration to get into place.</li>
            <li> Perfect item for beard trimming and the stubble look.  I have search for quite a while to find the right trimmer and this is it.  I like the way you can set it for the stubble look and the trim is perfect every time.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut my stubble as close as I would like even with the guard removed. But it holds a charge a long time and has the power to do the job. It glides over my skin well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up using a AA batter powered Wahl trimmer that I had on hand, which came with a full sized hair trimmer I had bought years ago. It cuts closer the way I prefer, but doesn&#x27;t feel as good over my skin as the Philips trimmer does.</li>
            <li> Nice quick stubble trim, but be careful with the guard while trimming around your mouth region. I cut my lip the first time using the trimmer because of the somewhat large gaps in the guard. Good product for the price though.</li>
            <li> This is one of those niche products that really has only one use, but it does exactly what it is designed to do.  It came pre-charged, and lasts for a good amount of time between charges.  It&#x27;s very easy to adjust the length settings.  However it is a bit pricey for a mere stubble trimmer.  It would be a lot more useful if it could also give a nice close shave.  Still it&#x27;s very good at what it does, and you can&#x27;t fault it for not being something it never claimed to be.</li>
            <li> So i was looking for a trimmer to replace my remington microsceen shaver because i really only use the trimmer on the shaver versus the actual shaver portion. the remingtons have the best trimmers that pop up with the press of a button but the problem is i find that these shavers tend to break after 1-2 years of use although i think they work great. i was hoping this trimmer would replace my remington and last longer. Bottom line this shaver cannot trim anywhere near as close as the trimmer on the remingtons and definitely not gonna do it for me. Just for reference the look i go for is probably best termed \\&quot;scruff\\&quot; rather than stubble i guess. i didnt know what .5mm&#x27;s would be in the real world but its not very short. perhaps i was expecting to close a trim outta this thing but imo it should trim closer as you can always increase the guard size.</li>
            <li> This is the worst beard/stubble trimmer i&#x27;ve ever owned.  It grabs at your skin, grates, scratches and gives a completely uneven trim unless you hold it at a very PRECISE angle.  Wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> Compared to the Wahl lithium model [[ASIN:B001GQ3GEY Wahl Lithium Ion All In One Trimmer]] (battery doesn&#x27;t work properly anymore), this thing has 1/4 as much power, making it harder and taking twice as long to trim.</li>
            <li> This trimmer was exactly what I was looking for, but when I used it for the first time, I quickly noticed a significant problem.  Although the adjustable comb rises in height, it does not move forward.  This means that if you hold the trimmer at different angles, it will cut your hair at varying lengths, all the way down to the actual blade.  The comb tips need to extend past the blade to prevent this, as they do on most hair trimmers.  My facial hair came out uneven, and I was forced to return the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have always used cheaper ($10) trimmers but they never lasted more than a year. This Phillips Norelco Stubble Trimmer is amazing! The wide range of built in guard lengths frees up my drawer space from not having to keep up with several plastic guards. No oil needed either makes this a low maintenance product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> With more around 20 different length settings, it allowed me try different styles for my stubble look :)&lt;br /&gt;Unlike most shavers/trimmers the body for this product has an elegant look.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the amount spent.</li>
            <li> I got this to convince  my husband to keep a light stubble (otherwise he prefers to be clean shaven). This keeps his stubble looking tidy and office-appropriate. It keeps both of us happy!</li>
            <li> Good Trimmer but charger could use a stand..... does hold a charge for a long time though.  Excellent for the price.</li>
            <li> to trim with a certain size its good.but to get a scruff look,its just terrible,although for the price it isn&#x27;t that good</li>
            <li> The shaving area of this trimmer is way too small.  It takes way too long to shave.  Poor design and not much thought to the customers needs.</li>
            <li> anything else out there doesnt even come close to this machine. The only flaw is something that all shavers have: they dont automatically stop charging when battery is full. Which means if you over charge you decrease the battery lifetime.</li>
            <li> Exactly all I needed.</li>
            <li> It is very quiet, which is a huge plus.  It trims my chin beard in a flash and just the way I like it.  Clean up is easy.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This particular trimmer lasted a month, and I&#x27;m not talking about battery life with the occasional use, I&#x27;m talking lifespan. Got two recharges (yes, full charge/discharge cycle) and then nothing, not even charging indicator light.</li>
            <li> everything it said it was.  Will trim anywhere from .5mm to 10mm in .5mm increments.  I even use it without the guard if i want it even closer than .5mm, but not quite a clean shave.  It stays charged a long time too.</li>
            <li> It looks beautiful, it works well, probably the only thing I&#x27;ve every found that works for my sensitive skin.  I can&#x27;t use a razor, but this stubble trimmer on the lowest setting does wonders.  i love it.  People with sensitive skin will be happy with this.</li>
            <li> I received this trimmer early in the afternoon, and began to charge the unit at approx. 6 p.m. knowing that I needed to use it the following morning.  That being said, that same evening I read the booklet so as to properly operate the trimmer, and charge correctly.  The next day I began to use the trimmer, and 30 min. later I was left with patches of beard of unequal length,( i forgot to mention that I had 3 days of beard growth).  These trimmers in my opinion, is best suited for someone with peach fuzz, as opposed to someone with a full beard.</li>
            <li> I liked this product, I think it is the best in triming arround, I could give it a 5 stars but not quite yrt</li>
            <li> It works well and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is my husbands second one of these. He uses it to trim is beard with the attachments and trim his head without the attachment. He uses it in the shower and it IS waterproof. The only reason he purchased a new one is the blades become dull and I found this new unit for about 4.00 more than a new blade would have cost.</li>
            <li> lasted a short while. battery failed</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in 9/2013 with tax and shipping the purchase price total $29.19.  I do love this product.  works great.</li>
            <li> First, this is a good product. But it is not suitable for everyone. If you are Asian or your beard is not rich, do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> I like this overall.  If it cost more money, it would get only 3 stars instead of 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size adjustment knob is great, but you have to be very careful to keep the guide flat against the contours and not angle the cutting edge towards the skin, or you&#x27;ll make a noticeable gouge in your stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that, unlike hair trimmers, you can&#x27;t use this without the guide to get a really close cut, since the cutting teeth are pointed rather than squared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one I received is a dark navy blue in color, not the red shown in the photo, which is good, because I keep it in a drawer, and the shape of the thing looks less like a battery-powered &#x27;massager&#x27; when it&#x27;s in dark blue.</li>
            <li> Not overly sharp, catches against hair/skin easily and heats up during the shave to the point it&#x27;s left burn marks on my neck (not bad marks, they go away quickly). I suppose it&#x27;s better than using a dull straight razor without shaving cream, but not by much. The price is reasonable, but would still be a poor value at half the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer 9 months ago, and I&#x27;m still very happy with it.  I use it to keep my facial hair at 1 mm, and then I use a standard wet razor to clean shave my neck. Yes, the hair does litter your bathroom sink / countertop afterwards, but nothing that a 5 second wipe with a sponge or wet cloth can&#x27;t take care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t listen to the people people saying this is difficult to use.  Just use some common sense when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this review is coming from an Indian guy with really thick hair.</li>
            <li> Works well, motor does seem to get a bit weaker after time / dirt/ etc.</li>
            <li> Only lasted 2 yrs with very little use.  Do not buy.  Contacted Philips and they indicated it was out of warranty and couldn&#x27;t do anything about it.  Product should have held up better.  Back up your products Philips</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very quiet.  The rubberized surface makes cleaning difficult.  The blade guide is too pointed for comfort.  I would prefer a slightly rounded leading edge.</li>
            <li> I think this designs merely for stubble and do it really well. as I am very sensitive about the size of them and my workplace has rigorous rules about beard, this machine passed my expectations well. 0.5 cm arrangements are precise enough and working is pretty easy. the main disadvantage is about lack of the battery alarm about power and when this fully charged. this is important when consider that fully-charging and stay in the power cause broken in the battery. so I take out one star and rank it with four stars. the price is another advantage compare with the function</li>
            <li> The product is fine. But surely not for beards. The unprotected cover on the blade doesn&#x27;t allow even cut for beard. Only for people who want to keep daily stubble and just trim everything off, then you won&#x27;t notice the uneven cutting. But for me who likes to trim once or twice a week to keep a light beard, it is not possible with this product due to uneven cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding vendor, initially a wrong product was shipped in place of the trimmer. But on contacting the vendor, quickly rectified the mistake and shipped the correct product.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge really well and easy to clean because it&#x27;s basically water proof. The clipper guard requires you to really pay attention to the angle. Move the wrong way and you may as well be cutting at the shortest level.</li>
            <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t really last that long. The clippers are kind of weak too. All in all, it&#x27;s pretty mediocre at best. This day in age you&#x27;d expect a little more.....but it does trim hair. A good throw-away clipper.</li>
            <li> I have had this trimmer for abt a year now and it works flawlessly. This is very easy to clean under running water. It also comes with 110-220 v power rating which is a huge advantage when travelling international.</li>
            <li> This did what I needed it to do for a while. I keep my stubble very close, and this did better than the cheaper trimmers I had bought before, and was cordless. However, one day it stopped working properly. Not sure what happened, as the battery is fine and it holds charge, but something happened to the blades. Suddenly it grabs my hair and screams like a dying cat as it tries to pull my face off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought it I would have given it four stars, but considering it hasn&#x27;t even lived six months, that rating is now a two. Too bad, because I&#x27;m pretty lost as to what else to purchase to replace it. Not sure why Norelco, or whoever, can&#x27;t get such a simple concept right.</li>
            <li> I read reviews of this product saying it was cheap to the feel..but its exactly opposite the product feels premium and solid I have no idea why people were just bashing it. The trimmer is exceptionally well and performs beautifully giving a super precise trim .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely recommend this trimmer especially at this price point</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer/shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. I bought one 2 years ago, sight unseen, and it hasn&#x27;t let me know. It&#x27;s not only good, but very dependable. I like that the guard is attached. Don&#x27;t hesitate on this one!</li>
            <li> I used this beard trimmer both \\&quot;corded\\&quot; as well as \\&quot;uncorded\\&quot;. Sadly the battery, or some electrical system inside the trimmer, died a mere 9 months after use. I had the same problem with another Philips beard trimmer but that trimmer ran corded after leaving the trimmer plugged in overnight (for charging the battery I presume). This one simply refuses to work after long or short charges. The trimmer is designed to be used corded so it doesn&#x27;t make any sense for it to not work while I have it plugged in. Anyway, I&#x27;m going to stick to regular hair clippers for my beard from now on -- they seem to last longer.</li>
            <li> Excellent--I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair left, but for the sides and back, it shaves pretty close and painlessly and adjusts easily. Easy to clean and just toss back into drawer. Has survived drops to floor. Battery lasts longer than I expected between charges, although I wish it was a lithium battery and then I wouldn&#x27;t be so inclined to run it down before recharging. Haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower, but I trust Norelco enough to think it&#x27;d be fine. Got two for my fully hairy teen age sons also and no complaints there.</li>
            <li> Works great when I put off shaving for a week or two and need to trim down so I can shave.</li>
            <li> Have used this product with pretty consistently good results. Evenness of cut depends on how you hold the trimmer. Overall a very usable trimmer.</li>
            <li> Very nice unit, does everything descriptions said it would.  Very happy with it, had it about a year now and still going strong.</li>
            <li> Been using it for about a year now, still does a good job trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> Works well for me! Easy use and low maintainence. Only thing is the charging time of 8-10hrs but not so much of an issue cos it can last approx. 45mins and each time i only use for less than 5mins. No worries bout voltage issue as the power adapter supplied is 100-220V.</li>
            <li> Only 4 stars, because the whiskers stick to the rubbery side of the clippers. Other than that, it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the trimmer for a few months but I&#x27;m loving it. It gives just the right amount of stubble and easily picks up the hair.</li>
            <li> This razor has a great grip, the right weight to give it just enough heft, and cleans easily . . . but the adjustable comb on it is awful.  As other reviewers have said, because there is no guard over the side, you have to hold the razor at an angle exactly perpendicular to the surface of your face or it will shave unevenly.  This turns out to be basically an impossible task at the shorter comb settings.  Too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone back to my Norelco G370.  The G370 doesn&#x27;t quite get it as short as this QT4022 theoretically can, but at least it&#x27;s consistent.</li>
            <li> Four years after buying it the battery is almost dead. This is my third Philips/Norelco beard trimmer. They&#x27;ve all been good units that last about 10 years providing you replace the rechargeable battery at mid-life. (Eventually the blades get dull or the motor bearings seize up.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier models could be opened easily. With some basic soldering skills this made it relatively easy to replace the original NiCad or NiMH AA battery with a new one. But this model can&#x27;t be opened, at least not without breaking the housing. As a result I have no choice but to add it to land fill. Shame on you Philips.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer I feel like my search for them had been going on since I started growing a beard.  They hold a charge for a long time and I use them in the shower.  I basically fully submerge them and often I use them after I have already gotten my face wet.  I am way better at keeping my beard in check these dates no long scratchy beard for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this trimmer for 1 and a half years now, and it is truly outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the quality of the product itself, in terms of look and feel, is great. A beautiful red face with some nice detail and accent lines with a soft yet durable rubberized back have really made this shaver stand up well to lots of use and feel great in the hand. The charging port of the shaver has the nice added detail of a ring of light around it that glows on whenever it is charging. Evidently, someone at Norelco thought about the design a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The height adjustment mechanism for the trimmer is beautifully designed. The action of the mechanism itself is smooth and satisfying to change, but it is also designed in a way that makes it practically impossible to change accidentally while shaving (which has literally never happened to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver mechanism has stood up to well over a year of use with no deterioration or loss of usability whatsoever. The fact that it can be easily cleaned under a sink is awesome, and you can tell the inner workings are well made and durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this shaver is amazing and I highly recommend it to anyone. However, if you are concerned about hair getting everywhere as you shave, which obviously does happen with this shaver, I would recommend a shaver with a built in vacuum which Norelco also makes.</li>
            <li> As someone who had never had a positive experience with an electric shaver or trimmer, I was skeptical, but ended up picking it up on sale at Marshall&#x27;s. Could not be happier. Let me address a few of my initial concerns:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Hard to cut beard evenly? Not at all. Electric razors leave me looking patchy, but just a couple runs through with this will clean everything up nice and evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Have to be super careful to keep consistent angle? Surprisingly, no. This was my biggest concern, but I have to completely disagree with the top review. The guard is flat and about an inch long, so it&#x27;s very easy to start and keep it flat, and a little tilting doesn&#x27;t seem to mess it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Is applying a constant level of pressure a big issue? Again, not at all. I&#x27;m not a big finesse guy, so this also concerned me, but it&#x27;s hard for me to screw it up. I use pretty firm pressure, and the guard does its job without giving me any bald patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the precise, 0.5mm measurements - I&#x27;ve found that going a little longer on the cheeks and shorter on the goatee area makes mine look more even overall, but YMMV. The 0.5mm setting tilted up will also shave below your neckline relatively close and quickly in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that you can just stick it under the faucet for a quick rinse when done. Overall, I can&#x27;t see how you&#x27;d be unhappy with this if you&#x27;re looking for a quick, effective and satisfying way to get and maintain the stubble look.</li>
            <li> First off, I did not purchase this through amazon but i did go off on the reviews here. The negative reviews mentioning how bad the guide comb is absolutely true. I don&#x27;t see how its possible to trim a short beard evenly with this trimmer. This review is in line with having a short beard between 2-4mm. On its lowest setting the comb rests behind the actual cutting mechanism of the blades which is fine for the lowest setting. As you change the size up higher, the guide comb moves higher and away from the blades but it IS NOT exactly above the blades until maybe the 5mm setting which is the upper limit of my desired length. So if you try to cut under 5mm you wont have the guide comb FULLY protecting your beard from the blades to get your desired length. So in my experience I had a lot of patches and inconsistent length. At first I thought it was just me and I would learn to hold the trimmer properly and get a even cut but this kept happening to me over and over again. I had to use my older Norelco G370 to make everything even again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so disappointed cause this seemed so promising. I liked the length options, held charge well, it was way quieter than then G370, and i could rinse it out in the sink. But for me it wasn&#x27;t doing the job. If you are also thinking about going to the higher models like the Norelco qt 4070, this also has the same issue ( from the reviews for 4070 you can call phillips to give you the comb of the qt 4050). I will be getting the Norelco qt 4050 because i know the comb acts more like the G370 where it completely covers the blades no matter what setting you choose ( other then 0 of course). Even its lower on power and the vacuum is sub par, as long as it cuts evenly at my desired setting ( 2-4) i don&#x27;t mind going back over it once or twice to make sure its consistent.</li>
            <li> I bought it based on reviews, and rushed to throw packaging away and start using it. Big mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it as stubble trimmer (shortest possible), and I have to go over the same place three times to remove all the hair. I hate it. I tried returning it to Target, but they would not accept it without packaging, so I have been stuck with it since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I use it, it reminds me how much I hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad its working for some people, but not everyone</li>
            <li> Complete garbage, not a close shave at all in lowest setting. Feels cheap as well. Im just going to order another norelco....</li>
            <li> I purchased this beard trimmer for the sole purpose of keeping shorter facial hair, and occasionally stubble. I have used the product about 10 times so far with solid results, I havent had to recharge it yet. I have used competitors products, both from remmington two times with poor results. This specific trimmer goes down to 0.3 mm I believe which is amazing. It&#x27;s spot on so far, I go over my short facial hair from a few different angles, and Im good to go within a few minutes. I have only used the trimmer up to 4 mm so far, so I can&#x27;t comment if it works well with longer facial hair. I have also used this on my eyebrows, with solid results as well, easily trims thick eyebrows down.</li>
            <li> Bought this a year ago and it still works great. All my son&#x27;s use it so it has had a ton of use over the year. I just ordered one for a christmas present to my brother in law who also borrowed mine at the beach and really liked it. I have two other brands in my drawer that go unused because this one is so much better. The adjusting level is the key. It is smooth and makes for a clean cut.</li>
            <li> The experience, price, and shipping were all exactly what I expected. No complaints here. Quality made.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have used so far. Easy to operate, battery lasts forever. I have it for over a year. Use it once a weak and charged it 4 times so far! Uneven cuts? Pulling your hair? You doing something wrong!</li>
            <li> If you are trying this as your first foray into beard trimming for a stubble look instead of having to use a razor (like me) look elsewhere. I figured it was cheap enough to try but this product is not very good on a beard of any length. It actually feels just like the awful trimmers that norelco sticks on the back of its electric shavers. The motor is really lacking. I will use this now for sideburns only I guess. But for $15, its worth it for sideburns only if you don&#x27;t have any other way of managing your sideburns. If you are looking for a replacement for shaving, I would go with a more powerful trimmer.</li>
            <li> This product was fantastic. Sadly, it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> This device is SO underpowered its not even funny. It also just feels cheaply made. It can barely power through even the softest of hair, let alone a thick beard. You&#x27;ll have to go over and over and over the same area in order to get it to trim.</li>
