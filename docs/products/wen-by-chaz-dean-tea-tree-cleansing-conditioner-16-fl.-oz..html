    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Not the best smelling, but leaves my scalp feeling great!</li>
            <li>and I Love WEN!!!!</li>
            <li>Washed it again today and was very happy again with the results.</li>
            <li>this impressed me.</li>
            <li>something products for cleansing conditioners are just as good!</li>
            <li>Love this on my hair and the smell is great!</li>
            <li>I think the results are equally good.</li>
            <li>But not in a good way.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>love this product!</li>
            <li>I have used WEN cleansing conditioner for years and this is my favorite!</li>
            <li>I have to be honest though</li>
            <li>Wen products are really the best for your hair if you color it.</li>
            <li>WEN is by far the best hair cleanser</li>
            <li>I love this conditioning cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Best for hair that doesn&#x27;t need extra fullness.</li>
            <li>My Hair is much more manageable and more softer, shiny and the curls stay in tact.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many reviews on this product and seen the commercials.</li>
            <li>1: I don&#x27;t like the price tag but am glad I bought from Amazon</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not stuck in any recurring billing and shipping of more product.</li>
            <li>It looks healthy and almost looks like it might be a bit oily in a couple spots</li>
            <li>I no longer use Wen.it&#x27;s putting more oil in my hair than I need, and it&#x27;s lost the lustier of being healthy shinny.</li>
            <li>The Tea Tree cleansing conditioner works much better for my hair type.</li>
            <li>WEN Tea Tree came it was in a beautiful package like a new package should be</li>
            <li>It reminds me of Tea Tree shampoo I&#x27;ve used and even though the smell is strong</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, my daughter-in-law introduced me to this.  </li>
            <li>Worked like any cheap shampoo would.</li>
            <li>and I can go several days between washing with it continuing to look great.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and I normally have many many tangles to come through</li>
            <li>I enjoy the scent, it feels/smells clean.</li>
            <li>I love this particular Wen product.  </li>
            <li>Love, love this product would totally recommend it for any hair type and length.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s rare for me to not wash my hair for 3 days, like once or twice a year.</li>
            <li>If you use classic Wen, this is a good alternate.</li>
            <li>Also when combing, I usually get static and fly aways, so far I&#x27;ve not encountered this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair greasy no matter how much you rinse it!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still incredibly soft, tangle free, and cooperative.</li>
            <li>This is the first time since I started using this product I didn&#x27;t wash my hair 3 days in a row.</li>
            <li>When I brush it, my hair stays exactly where I brush it.</li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s now soft, smooth, with lots of body</li>
            <li>As it&#x27;s drying it does feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Only when washing with my old product did my hair come out looking clean and feeling clean.</li>
            <li>: It does clog follicles; the hair that sheds has a HUGE white ball on the end of it and the strand is straw like.</li>
            <li>May be pricey, but do not have to shampoo as much.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t one of my favorite scents from WEN but it left my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Left my hair very soft, and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>It appears after 1 months use of Wen it&#x27;s not really cleaning, it&#x27;s weighing my hair down, it&#x27;s putting more oil in my hair than I need, and it&#x27;s lost the lustier of being healthy shinny.</li>
            <li>And my reviews/days above are true for my results.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like how my hair smells after I use this particular version of WEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>it was all my hair, which is new.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I was expecting to see some sort of build up in my hair, but I&#x27;m not, this is doing everything I&#x27;ve seen advertised and if I don&#x27;t want the second day, my hair is not greasy as it is normally with the usual shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li>It rinsed clean and when I brushed it, I had only 2 tangles.</li>
            <li>2: My hair is very soft, hasn&#x27;t been this soft in quite some time.</li>
            <li>There are 2 more days left in my review to see what it does but so far, I&#x27;m very pleased and the price no longer hurts so bad.</li>
            <li>If you have fine, slightly wavy, hair that&#x27;s prone to oiliness, like me, try the Tea Tree!</li>
            <li>I started out liking the shampoo, but about three weeks into using the it, my scalp developed a lot of buildup, and it itched&lt;br</li>
            <li>I buy it from amazon regularly and my hair texture has improved so much.</li>
            <li>Soft and shiny result and no itch scalp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s naturally oily so no shampooing after 1 day</li>
            <li>So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;m naturally oily haired</li>
            <li>3: My hair is so soft.</li>
            <li>Once again, no tangles and soft as can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 4:</li>
            <li>It still felt soft and did look healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So just for kicks I washed with my old shampoo and conditioner 1 day and then returned to Wen.</li>
            <li>Like the other WEN cleansing conditioners it&#x27;s gentle on my hair, but the Tea Tree variety also cleans it really well</li>
            <li>It still detangles like nobody&#x27;s business but this combined with the price tag make this product no long desirable to me.</li>
            <li>It still detangles like nobody&#x27;s business but this combined with the price tag make this product no long desirable to me.</li>
            <li>The directions indicate using way too much though, my hair is curly and down to my shoulder blades---</li>

            <li> The directions indicate using way too much though, my hair is curly and down to my shoulder blades---</li>
            <li> only to finally figure out that my hair loss/ and thinning hair is due to this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is long</li>
            <li> I only wash every other day and have long hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do a lot to my hair, such as styling and blow drying nor do I use anything other than shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> ill get again; I&#x27;ll stick with Lavendar or Sweet Almond Mint</li>
            <li> Dried hair out a lot on second use.</li>
            <li> I applied to my wet hair and let it sit and then washed and rinsed when I was done with my shower.</li>
            <li> I expected to see oil build up this morning upon waking.</li>
            <li> The other WEN conditioners made me feel like I was washing my hair with conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> 5: Once again like on the previous days, I used 30 pumps and let it sit on my hair as directed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without Wen, but it is too expensive.</li>
            <li> Every day it appears to be getting oilier and oiler or rather looking really greasy (and to me dirty).</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve stated before I don&#x27;t abuse my hair with heavy styling or products.</li>
            <li> And by the evening it starts to feel heavy.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t planned, I was late for an appointment and didn&#x27;t have time to give it the time it needed.</li>
            <li> My only caveat is that it is very expensive.</li>
            <li> Although this is expensive</li>
            <li> Too expensive.</li>
            <li> crazy, so I am no longer using the product.</li>
            <li> , I am looking for another alternative to this products because it is just too expensive!  </li>
            <li> and I look horrible</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too leary of getting that nasty greasy feel.</li>
            <li> By the afternoon (after a morning cleansing) my hair appears rather nasty.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this conditioning cleanser.  The directions indicate using way too much though, my hair is curly and down to my shoulder blades---according to their directions, I should use 32 pumps!!  I have found I can use about 9 pumps and have a sufficient amount.</li>
            <li> I love this particular Wen product.  Tea tree oil treats an itchy scalp and it does the trick.  I have to be honest though, I am looking for another alternative to this products because it is just too expensive!  Renpure and Lisa something products for cleansing conditioners are just as good!</li>
            <li> I started out liking the shampoo, but about three weeks into using the it, my scalp developed a lot of buildup, and it itched&lt;br /&gt;like crazy, so I am no longer using the product.</li>
            <li> Love this on my hair and the smell is great!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, my daughter-in-law introduced me to this.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. I buy it from amazon regularly and my hair texture has improved so much. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product! May be pricey, but do not have to shampoo as much.</li>
            <li> I like Wen but not this formula at all.</li>
            <li> If you use classic Wen, this is a good alternate. It&#x27;s got similar emollient properties. Best for hair that doesn&#x27;t need extra fullness. The scent is somewhat medicinal but doesn&#x27;t linger on your hair.</li>
            <li> Not the best smelling, but leaves my scalp feeling great! Wen products are really the best for your hair if you color it. Soft and shiny result and no itch scalp. Will purchase Wen again.</li>
            <li> Received it on time. Used it once already. Left my hair very soft, and easy to manage. We&#x27;ll see over time.</li>
            <li> Love, love this product would totally recommend it for any hair type and length.</li>
            <li> My Hair is much more manageable and more softer, shiny and the curls stay in tact. Me Susan W. Graham officially a #WEN Girl for life!!!&lt;br /&gt;When WEN Tea Tree came it was in a beautiful package like a new package should be and I LOVE IT and I Love WEN!!!!</li>
            <li> will forever bee a Wen girl.  love this product!</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth it. Worked like any cheap shampoo would. Didn&#x27;t notice tea tree oil at all. Dried hair out a lot on second use.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair greasy no matter how much you rinse it!  Gross!</li>
            <li> I recommend that you not use the Wen product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over 3 yrs. only to finally figure out that my hair loss/ and thinning hair is due to this product.</li>
            <li> The other WEN conditioners made me feel like I was washing my hair with conditioner.  This is actually a cleansing conditioner.  I do have to use a conditioner afterwards though because it is not moisturizing.  I also don&#x27;t like how my hair smells after I use this particular version of WEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It does clog follicles; the hair that sheds has a HUGE white ball on the end of it and the strand is straw like.</li>
            <li> I am uncertain whether additional benefits are derived from using Wen.  I&#x27;ve used a shampoo containing are going to oil for years. I think the results are equally good. I am the only one that knows that I am using wen.  In view of the cost, I see no cost benefit return.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many reviews on this product and seen the commercials. I don&#x27;t do a lot to my hair, such as styling and blow drying nor do I use anything other than shampoo and conditioner. I no longer color my hair either but I would like it to be softer. It&#x27;s naturally oily so no shampooing after 1 day and I look horrible and it feels gross. Although this is expensive I figured I&#x27;d give it a try and see what it did to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: I don&#x27;t like the price tag but am glad I bought from Amazon so I&#x27;m not stuck in any recurring billing and shipping of more product. My hair is long so I used 30 pumps as the directions say. It does feel like a lot but I&#x27;m just doing as it says at this point. I applied to my wet hair and let it sit and then washed and rinsed when I was done with my shower. I did not put in an extra pump and leave in as a leave-in conditioner. I&#x27;m too leary of getting that nasty greasy feel. It reminds me of Tea Tree shampoo I&#x27;ve used and even though the smell is strong I enjoy the scent, it feels/smells clean. It rinsed clean and when I brushed it, I had only 2 tangles. My hair is fine and I normally have many many tangles to come through so this is a plus. As it&#x27;s drying it does feel soft and clean. So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2: My hair is very soft, hasn&#x27;t been this soft in quite some time. Because I&#x27;m naturally oily haired I expected to see oil build up this morning upon waking. It looks healthy and almost looks like it might be a bit oily in a couple spots but it doesn&#x27;t feel oily. I think it&#x27;s just the look at this point. Also when combing, I usually get static and fly aways, so far I&#x27;ve not encountered this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 3: My hair is so soft. Washed it again today and was very happy again with the results. Once again, no tangles and soft as can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 4: Still soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 5: Once again like on the previous days, I used 30 pumps and let it sit on my hair as directed. It&#x27;s still incredibly soft, tangle free, and cooperative. I can honestly say I was expecting to see some sort of build up in my hair, but I&#x27;m not, this is doing everything I&#x27;ve seen advertised and if I don&#x27;t want the second day, my hair is not greasy as it is normally with the usual shampoo &amp; conditioner. There are 2 more days left in my review to see what it does but so far, I&#x27;m very pleased and the price no longer hurts so bad. The results are what I was wanting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 6: This is the first time since I started using this product I didn&#x27;t wash my hair 3 days in a row. This wasn&#x27;t planned, I was late for an appointment and didn&#x27;t have time to give it the time it needed. My hair now looked oily but when I ran my fingers through it, it didn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy. Also instead of just looking oily at the roots it was all my hair, which is new. When I pulled my hair back into a clip it didn&#x27;t look like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in 3 days. this impressed me. Now it&#x27;s rare for me to not wash my hair for 3 days, like once or twice a year. It still felt soft and did look healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Month 1: It&#x27;s now been 1 month since I begin using Wen. As I&#x27;ve stated before I don&#x27;t abuse my hair with heavy styling or products. And my reviews/days above are true for my results. However, in the last 2 weeks it seems Wen isn&#x27;t cleaning my hair anymore. Every day it appears to be getting oilier and oiler or rather looking really greasy (and to me dirty). I use Wen daily and have been rinsing it thoroughly. By the afternoon (after a morning cleansing) my hair appears rather nasty. And by the evening it starts to feel heavy. Come the next morning, it looks and feels like I&#x27;ve left conditioner in it. When I brush it, my hair stays exactly where I brush it. But not in a good way. The roots as well as the length are all appearing oily. So just for kicks I washed with my old shampoo and conditioner 1 day and then returned to Wen. Only when washing with my old product did my hair come out looking clean and feeling clean. It appears after 1 months use of Wen it&#x27;s not really cleaning, it&#x27;s weighing my hair down, it&#x27;s putting more oil in my hair than I need, and it&#x27;s lost the lustier of being healthy shinny. It still detangles like nobody&#x27;s business but this combined with the price tag make this product no long desirable to me. Also I&#x27;m on the second bottle of Wen for 1 months use as well. So it&#x27;s cost me close to $70.00 to end up with oilier hair than I started with.

            <li> WEN is by far the best hair cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.  My only caveat is that it is very expensive.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t one of my favorite scents from WEN but it left my hair soft. This wont be a scent ill get again; I&#x27;ll stick with Lavendar or Sweet Almond Mint</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without Wen, but it is too expensive. I only wash every other day and have long hair. Too expensive.</li>
            <li> I have used WEN cleansing conditioner for years and this is my favorite! I&#x27;d been using the Lavender cleansing conditioner, but it wasn&#x27;t cleaning my hair thoroughly enough. It would look greasy the next day. The Tea Tree cleansing conditioner works much better for my hair type. Like the other WEN cleansing conditioners it&#x27;s gentle on my hair, but the Tea Tree variety also cleans it really well: it&#x27;s now soft, smooth, with lots of body and I can go several days between washing with it continuing to look great. If you have fine, slightly wavy, hair that&#x27;s prone to oiliness, like me, try the Tea Tree!</li>
