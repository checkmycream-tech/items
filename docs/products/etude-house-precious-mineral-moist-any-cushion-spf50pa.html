            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>My daughter liked the product qualities but her skin broke out with it.</li>
            <li>This product has a good amount of coverage and the application process is so quick and easy!</li>
            <li>The strong perfume order of makeup lasts all day and ovepowered my own perfume.</li>
            <li>and you get more of it (.5 oz vs most .35 oz)</li>
            <li>Coverage was OK.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this Etude product.</li>
            <li>Seller was great and product arrived as promised, I just have a bit too much olive in my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has a lot of sunscreen in it (50+?)</li>
            <li>The cushion is great at filling out your pores and the actual BB has amazing coverage.</li>
            <li>I did A LOT of reading about these compacts and this one to be the most accessible with colors that work with my pale/golden undertoned skin.</li>
            <li>easy to apply.</li>
            <li>the bb cream feels very light and is super blendable.  </li>
            <li>The color is very light (too light) - and I am blonde and fair.</li>
            <li>It might be a bit too light for people with darker skin tones.</li>
            <li>Many people said it&#x27;s good for dry skin</li>
            <li>I later added some of my Nymph Aura Volumer to the cushion and now I love it!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product has not given me any issues :)</li>
            <li>Much more affordable than most other compact sponge foundations</li>
            <li>The smell is very clean and not overpowering at all unless you are extremely sensitive to scent which I am not.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, I love the high sun protection and it also has a nice cooling effect on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it is not very long lasting and it sort of &#x27;swims&#x27; on your face.</li>
            <li>the only thing i could say about it is is has a very strong floral fragrence</li>
            <li>You only need a little bit to get a flawless face.</li>
            <li>yet, light and natural!</li>
            <li>I assumed that the coverage might be too light - but I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented, soft and smooth texture, covers my rosacea!</li>
            <li>the product itself is exactly as pictured and unopened.  </li>
            <li>this was my first time using this product.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like it because I thought it was too matte.</li>
            <li>I love this and will definitely continue to purchase it!</li>
            <li>Very pigmented!</li>
            <li>This color was perfect for me as I am very pale with pink/red undertones and it has slightly yellow undertones</li>
            <li>Smell is strong, but goes away after an hour; also, I patted setting powder on my t-zone and that seemed to help it last.</li>
            <li>It alos setledin to large pores and highlighted them about 3 hours after application.</li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t replace my Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB Cream, but it will certainly get the job done</li>
            <li>It goes on shiny then progresses to very greasy looking.</li>
            <li>I live in hot Florida</li>
            <li>but it dried my skin even more.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive but this product did nothing to irritate it.</li>
            <li>the shipping was so fast and came in a week when it was predicted to come in 2 or so weeks later!</li>
            <li>recommend this particular color to pale girls with normal to oily skin because the finish is matte.</li>

            <li> It does have a fragrance, but I find it wears off after an hour or maybe less.</li>
            <li> If you are darker than a NC20 this will not fit your color.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy or &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; on my combination/oily skin.</li>
            <li> so maybe NC20 might be too pale for you.</li>
            <li> but it make my oily skin look much worse.</li>

            <li> Best product and price.</li>
            <li> the shipping was so fast and came in a week when it was predicted to come in 2 or so weeks later! the product itself is exactly as pictured and unopened.  the bb cream feels very light and is super blendable.  the coverage is fair too but it&#x27;s buildable if you need a little extra. the only thing i could say about it is is has a very strong floral fragrence so if you don&#x27;t like that in makeup this cushion won&#x27;t  be the one for you.</li>
            <li> My daughter liked the product qualities but her skin broke out with it.</li>
            <li> Overall I like the product. It is easy to apply, I love the high sun protection and it also has a nice cooling effect on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it is not very long lasting and it sort of &#x27;swims&#x27; on your face. After I wear sunglasses, I have marks on my skin from where the foundation wore off. The color is very light (too light) - and I am blonde and fair.</li>
            <li> Great product! Much more affordable than most other compact sponge foundations and you get more of it (.5 oz vs most .35 oz) I was using IT cosmetics sponge compact foundation (from Ulta) but found out that those are not refillable. Such a waste of packaging at $38 each. I was really disappointed because I love their product. I did A LOT of reading about these compacts and this one to be the most accessible with colors that work with my pale/golden undertoned skin. It does have a fragrance, but I find it wears off after an hour or maybe less. I prefer unscented makeup but this one is still great. It has excellent coverage and is build-able. I don&#x27;t like the weight of traditional foundations so this is perfect for me. I live in hot Florida so the spf is a bonus.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation !! It goes on well and has good coverage. I have sensitive skin and this product has not given me any issues :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry.  Don&#x27;t know if the product got dry out or it was like this.  Many people said it&#x27;s good for dry skin but it dried my skin even more.  Not for me.</li>
            <li> Very nice!  Went on smoothly flawless complexion</li>
            <li> this was my first time using this product. i&#x27;m a convert! easy to apply. good coverage. lasts all day. yet, light and natural! you won&#x27;t need powder ever again!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect!!! Highly pigmented, soft and smooth texture, covers my rosacea! I will definitely order this again!!!</li>
            <li> The strong perfume order of makeup lasts all day and ovepowered my own perfume. Coverage was OK. It goes on shiny then progresses to very greasy looking. It was supposed have some oil/shine control properties but it make my oily skin look much worse. It alos setledin to large pores and highlighted them about 3 hours after application.</li>
            <li> its great! i use it every day.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Etude product. At first I didn&#x27;t like it because I thought it was too matte. I later added some of my Nymph Aura Volumer to the cushion and now I love it! The cushion is great at filling out your pores and the actual BB has amazing coverage. You only need a little bit to get a flawless face. The smell is very clean and not overpowering at all unless you are extremely sensitive to scent which I am not. This color was perfect for me as I am very pale with pink/red undertones and it has slightly yellow undertones so it cancels out my redness and covers my dark circles well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this particular color to pale girls with normal to oily skin because the finish is matte. If you are darker than a NC20 this will not fit your color. In fact, it&#x27;s perfect for NC15 so maybe NC20 might be too pale for you.</li>
            <li> But I like it over my other BB cream when applied to the TZone it sets it wonderfully.  Seller was great and product arrived as promised, I just have a bit too much olive in my skin tone.  Don&#x27;t apply powder to set until you get oily to avoid cakeiness.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect from this product as I had never used anything like it! I assumed that the coverage might be too light - but I was pleasantly surprised! This product has a good amount of coverage and the application process is so quick and easy! It doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy or &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; on my combination/oily skin. The shade is perfect for my very fair complexion. It might be a bit too light for people with darker skin tones. My skin is very sensitive but this product did nothing to irritate it. I love this and will definitely continue to purchase it!</li>
            <li> keeps skin moist and has good coverage will buy again</li>
            <li> Amazing product! The colour is perfect and have a beautifull scent of flower! Great seller too!</li>
            <li> I love that it has a lot of sunscreen in it (50+?) and I love that you pat and then go! Touch up is necessary ocassionaly, especially for oily/combination skin. Smell is strong, but goes away after an hour; also, I patted setting powder on my t-zone and that seemed to help it last. Very pigmented! LOVE! This won&#x27;t replace my Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB Cream, but it will certainly get the job done</li>
