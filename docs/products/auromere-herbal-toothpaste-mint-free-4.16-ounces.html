            <li>This toothpaste is mild and yet it cleans beautifully.  </li>
            <li>This is the most amazing toothpaste ever.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t the best tasting toothpaste, but it is mint-free and natural.</li>
            <li>This is a good flouride free toothpaste</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this toothpaste and it is the best I have ever used for my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>It is a flourine free, mint free, great tasting toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Many of the &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; pastes even numbed my mouth.</li>
            <li>I ran out and bought more of this.  </li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>This paste helps to reduce gum bleeding too, but you must love licorice in order to use it.</li>
            <li>My wife and I love it.</li>
            <li>love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Although, I love the herbal toothpaste, which I tried this time.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that it works just as well as Sensodyne to help with my teeth sensitivity problem so this is a double winner :)</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste... have purchased this more than once and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I bought more for my family to try.</li>
            <li>And, I love the taste of their toothpastes (licorice is my favorite).  </li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My gums are so healthy now.</li>
            <li>but I found a better product that is correcting my oral problem expedient.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t have</li>
            <li>and I love that.</li>
            <li>Favorite toothpaste ever</li>
            <li>, I already feel like I have better breath throughout the day.</li>
            <li>, it does not taste good when you eat or drink something right after.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste is a favorite of many family members because of the taste which is like mild licorice!   </li>
            <li>Great toothpaste for anyone sensitive to mint and sulfates!</li>
            <li>I enjoy the licorice flavor even more.  </li>
            <li>The benefit of mint free is that it supposedly is more compatible with homeopathic medicines.</li>
            <li>Tried this as a sample from the food coop in my town and loved it so much</li>
            <li>Most modern tooth pastes contain mint flavoring which is good if you like clean breath.</li>
            <li>Thought I wouldn&#x27;t like it at first, but it&#x27;s my favorite now!</li>
            <li>the flavor is mild and pleasant and I think I brush longer, which combined with this toothpaste means my teeth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li>This is tasty, like licorice, and does a fine job of cleaning &amp; whitening.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the best taste, but my sensitive teeth are no longer sensitive after I use it.</li>
            <li>I like Auromere&#x27;s Mint Free Toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I guess I love that wake-up powerful flavor.  </li>
            <li>Auromere Herbal Toothpaste is SLS free.  </li>
            <li>This chemical began its mainstream career in the US during the 50&#x27;s, as a primary ingredient in engine degreaser, which is still sold today.  </li>
            <li>Good, natural toothpaste</li>
            <li>This is a good all natural toothpaste with a list of ingredients that you can read and pronounce.  </li>
            <li>I love the taste and my mouth feels so clean and fresh after using.</li>
            <li>To our minds, this one is worth the price!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It leaves your mouth so clean.  </li>
            <li>It whitens and keeps teeth clean all day.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this toothpaste in the 4 and 5 count boxes so that I can share a tube or two with other family members so they can enjoy this great toothpaste and switch from store bought toothpaste.</li>
            <li>While completing chemistry courses via university and becoming increasingly homeopathic literate,  the very real toxic effects of SLS  (sodium lauryl sulfate) have truly hit home for me.  </li>
            <li>Give me the full blast.  </li>
            <li>My absolute favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li>When we tried it, it really did reduce swelling and promote healthy gums and teeth.  </li>
            <li>brown, so that takes some getting used to, and the taste gets some getting used to if your used to mint tooth paste, its not bad at all, its just not mint.  </li>
            <li>The licorice-like flavor is subtle and delicious.  </li>
            <li>It has a MILD licorice flavor.  </li>
            <li>Auromere is my favorite brand of toothpaste, i have been using it for years and it makes my teeth feel smooth and clean like no other toothpaste, plus it feels much more natural than the super foamy minty stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li>This toothpaste has a slight licorice flavor and so far is the best we have found.</li>
            <li>So I order this toothpaste without the mint and it also works great without the minty taste for my little ones.</li>
            <li>Its fantastic, and my teeth and gums are much healthier after switching off the Aquafresh, Colgate, Crest, and the like.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It really leaves your teeth smooth and your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>My favorite tooth paste by far.</li>
            <li>You feel like you have fresh breath.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>Always leaves my teeth and mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>Unlike most other toothpastes, this one does not leave a strong mint tingle in your mind.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to strong smells and tastes, this is the toothpaste for you.</li>
            <li>It tastes fine, i just like the other ones better.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Before your first tube is up, I think you&#x27;ll agree with me that Auromere is the toothpaste you&#x27;ll always want to buy.</li>
            <li>It is the first toothpaste that does not burn her mouth....</li>
            <li>I went from ready to stalk a dentists office to improving my oral hygiene in a weeks time!</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat the ingredients!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a regular and satisfied user since 1004.</li>
            <li>I hope a healthier and more enlightened existence for all of you,  especially those who are seeking!</li>
            <li>This week is the first time ordering a multi-pack from Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li>No complex chemicals, no unpleasant aftertaste and works as well as any toothpaste I have used.</li>
            <li>It has a similar feeling after brushing with mint toothpaste, which is the clean and fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li>I am not a fan of black licorice, BUT this toothpaste is so amazing</li>
            <li>The texture is not as silky smooth as I like my toothpastes, but it&#x27;s not gritty either.</li>
            <li>I really wanted the MINT product.  </li>
            <li>Since I started using it, I went from having a cavity every year, to having them very infrequently.  </li>
            <li>Modern toothpaste then adds flouride to preserve the teeth from the bacteria destroyed by the mint they add.  </li>
            <li>This is a mint free tooth paste, which  helps reduce the teeth sensitivity similar to Sensodyne.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon, I can buy it again.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even imagine how the Licorice flavor tastes, because this one with a much milder flavor is still nauseating.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need much of this toothpaste to brush.  </li>
            <li>Much better than any other toothpaste I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Not only is this a non-mint but the flavor is unique and enjoyable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this brand, if not this particular flavor!</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a different taste, especially if you&#x27;re used to Colgate, Crest, etc., but give yourself a chance, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>etc) get away with putting so much stuff in their product that overpowers the sensitive skin found in the mouth!</li>
            <li>If you suffer from mouth ulcers/canker sores or, even if you don&#x27;t, I highly recommend you use Auromere toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothpaste without hesitation.</li>
            <li>am here to tell you that my mouth ulcers are absolutely and completely gone since I&#x27;ve begun using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a great toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Have suffered from consistent mouth ulcers for almost ten years.  </li>
            <li>; (just saw Mint&amp;#34;) 4 pack, and the only flavor I taste is Anise!!  </li>
            <li>only because i strongly prefer the taste of the other ones, it took me a while to get used to the non-mint.</li>
            <li>i advocate anthing that is natural...</li>
            <li>I use it because I am sensitive to mint which irritates my gum tissue and causes tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I have had no problems with sensitive teeth since using this product.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had them professionally cleaned for 4 years</li>
            <li>All the ingredients are natural and derived from plants.  </li>
            <li>Good product without all the bad additives you see in many other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste doesn&#x27;t over tingle or, taste ridiculously sweet or artificial like most mainstream ones.</li>
            <li>After about half a minute of use, the intense, almost spicy flavor begins to tingle the lips too much.</li>
            <li>My new &amp;#34;go to toothpaste.&amp;#34; Traditional toothpastes were leaving a funky feeling in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Reviews further stated that using this toothpaste reduced or completely cleared up the mouth ulcers/canker sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First day I tried the mint free, I was shocked by the strong black licorice flavor.  </li>
            <li>People (including myself) who are making an active effort to be health conscious are marketed these highly toxic products under the guise that they are beneficial,  which couldn&#x27;t be farther from the truth.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste foams very well due to the SLS (which I try to avoid).</li>
            <li>It not only tastes natural, it does noticeably whiten my teeth and cuts back on plaque as well.</li>
            <li>which tooth was causing the problem (the pain was on my right side both top and bottom teeth, all of them it seemed) the pain was so bad that it kept me up all night for 3 nights in a row (no swelling).</li>
            <li>but also has a major drawback, namely that mint destroys the good as well as the bad bacteria in the mouth.</li>
            <li>Most of those that don&#x27;t are &amp;#34;kiddy&amp;#34; flavored and taste pretty bad.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Auromere is my favorite brand of toothpaste, i have been using it for years and it makes my teeth feel smooth and clean like no other toothpaste, plus it feels much more natural than the super foamy minty stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has a slight licorice flavor and so far is the best we have found.</li>
            <li> So I order this toothpaste without the mint and it also works great without the minty taste for my little ones.</li>
            <li> Its fantastic, and my teeth and gums are much healthier after switching off the Aquafresh, Colgate, Crest, and the like.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It really leaves your teeth smooth and your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> My favorite tooth paste by far.</li>
            <li> You feel like you have fresh breath.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Always leaves my teeth and mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Unlike most other toothpastes, this one does not leave a strong mint tingle in your mind.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to strong smells and tastes, this is the toothpaste for you.</li>
            <li> It tastes fine, i just like the other ones better.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Before your first tube is up, I think you&#x27;ll agree with me that Auromere is the toothpaste you&#x27;ll always want to buy.</li>
            <li> It is the first toothpaste that does not burn her mouth....</li>
            <li> I went from ready to stalk a dentists office to improving my oral hygiene in a weeks time!</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the ingredients!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a regular and satisfied user since 1004.</li>
            <li> I hope a healthier and more enlightened existence for all of you,  especially those who are seeking!</li>
            <li> This week is the first time ordering a multi-pack from Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> No complex chemicals, no unpleasant aftertaste and works as well as any toothpaste I have used.</li>
            <li> It has a similar feeling after brushing with mint toothpaste, which is the clean and fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li> I am not a fan of black licorice, BUT this toothpaste is so amazing</li>
            <li> The texture is not as silky smooth as I like my toothpastes, but it&#x27;s not gritty either.</li>
            <li> I really wanted the MINT product.  </li>
            <li> Since I started using it, I went from having a cavity every year, to having them very infrequently.  </li>
            <li> Modern toothpaste then adds flouride to preserve the teeth from the bacteria destroyed by the mint they add.  </li>
            <li> This is a mint free tooth paste, which  helps reduce the teeth sensitivity similar to Sensodyne.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon, I can buy it again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even imagine how the Licorice flavor tastes, because this one with a much milder flavor is still nauseating.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need much of this toothpaste to brush.  </li>
            <li> Much better than any other toothpaste I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> Not only is this a non-mint but the flavor is unique and enjoyable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this brand, if not this particular flavor!</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a different taste, especially if you&#x27;re used to Colgate, Crest, etc., but give yourself a chance, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> etc) get away with putting so much stuff in their product that overpowers the sensitive skin found in the mouth!</li>
            <li> If you suffer from mouth ulcers/canker sores or, even if you don&#x27;t, I highly recommend you use Auromere toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothpaste without hesitation.</li>
            <li> am here to tell you that my mouth ulcers are absolutely and completely gone since I&#x27;ve begun using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a great toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Have suffered from consistent mouth ulcers for almost ten years.  </li>
            <li> ; (just saw Mint&amp;#34;) 4 pack, and the only flavor I taste is Anise!!  </li>
            <li> only because i strongly prefer the taste of the other ones, it took me a while to get used to the non-mint.</li>
            <li> i advocate anthing that is natural...</li>
            <li> I use it because I am sensitive to mint which irritates my gum tissue and causes tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with sensitive teeth since using this product.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had them professionally cleaned for 4 years</li>
            <li> All the ingredients are natural and derived from plants.  </li>
            <li> Good product without all the bad additives you see in many other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste doesn&#x27;t over tingle or, taste ridiculously sweet or artificial like most mainstream ones.</li>
            <li> After about half a minute of use, the intense, almost spicy flavor begins to tingle the lips too much.</li>
            <li> My new &amp;#34;go to toothpaste.&amp;#34; Traditional toothpastes were leaving a funky feeling in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Reviews further stated that using this toothpaste reduced or completely cleared up the mouth ulcers/canker sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First day I tried the mint free, I was shocked by the strong black licorice flavor.  </li>
            <li> People (including myself) who are making an active effort to be health conscious are marketed these highly toxic products under the guise that they are beneficial,  which couldn&#x27;t be farther from the truth.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste foams very well due to the SLS (which I try to avoid).</li>
            <li> It not only tastes natural, it does noticeably whiten my teeth and cuts back on plaque as well.</li>
            <li> which tooth was causing the problem (the pain was on my right side both top and bottom teeth, all of them it seemed) the pain was so bad that it kept me up all night for 3 nights in a row (no swelling).</li>
            <li> but also has a major drawback, namely that mint destroys the good as well as the bad bacteria in the mouth.</li>
            <li> Most of those that don&#x27;t are &amp;#34;kiddy&amp;#34; flavored and taste pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> It has been used for 3000 years, and has stood the test of time, so my opinion really adds very little weight to its lasting popularity.  </li>
            <li> I first purchased this same toothpaste with mint and my littles ones complained about it being too minty.</li>
            <li> , if you don&#x27;t like strong fake mint taste in your toothpaste this is the one for you because they explicitly didn&#x27;t put any mint in it.</li>
            <li> It is so much better than the artificially dyed and flavored toothpaste that we all thought we were used to.  </li>
            <li> The vague licorice taste is quickly forgotten about (I don&#x27;t care for licorice) and only toothpaste remains.</li>
            <li> It is not easy to find toothpaste without mint in it, even organic and natural toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I went to 2 other stores, only they didn&#x27;t have it either, so that is why I purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have found my life long paste!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from a local health food store for less then $7.</li>
            <li> And you only need a little bit</li>
            <li> If you are careful about what you are putting into body via your mouth, and don&#x27;t like or can&#x27;t use mint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble finding this toothpaste in my local stores.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so the tube lasts a while.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> so perhaps it is due to this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but no more than other products making the same claims without delivery on their promises.  </li>
            <li> While measuring the skin irritancy of other ingredients in scientific studies,  they decide the resulting detriment factor by COMPARING it with SLS.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and always return to Auromere.</li>
            <li> in America, uncovered by insurance and beyond the financial reach of average people, hence the proliferation of these products), and hardly any of them make a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> so I use less and a tube lasts longer than a conventional tube of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Maybe a few other flavors for kids .</li>
            <li> It seems odd, but for me, using mint toothpaste at night seems to wake me up...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll mention that I do not like black licorice</li>
            <li> I was referred to this brand of toothpaste and have enjoyed no more bleeding gums, no more mouth sores and no more bad breath caused by previous store bought toothpaste.</li>
            <li> There is a safety seal but still a little concerning.  </li>
            <li> fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;You can feel the little granules washing your teeth</li>
            <li> Also, product seemed a little dried out.  </li>
            <li> the last thing I need when I&#x27;m tired and brushing my teeth at night.   </li>
            <li> I found this one a few years ago</li>
            <li> (Affordable)&lt;br /&gt;I was experiencing some dull, throbbing dental pain</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a non-mint toothpaste.</li>
            <li> At least one of the 4 packages had the cover off when I opened it.  </li>
            <li> Less expensive in the pack of 4.  </li>
            <li> Avoid this product at all costs unless they make the unlikely move to cater to the well-being of their customers and REMOVE the floor cleaner (SLS).  </li>
            <li> It also cleans your teeth like crazy.  </li>
            <li> My bad, but their lack of support gets 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>

            <li> My new &amp;#34;go to toothpaste.&amp;#34; Traditional toothpastes were leaving a funky feeling in my mouth. Many of the &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; pastes even numbed my mouth. This is tasty, like licorice, and does a fine job of cleaning &amp; whitening.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste for anyone sensitive to mint and sulfates! Recommended! ;) Love it! Has great licorice taste. Thought I wouldn&#x27;t like it at first, but it&#x27;s my favorite now! And you only need a little bit, it&#x27;s concentrated, so the tube lasts way longer than regular toothpaste!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing toothpaste ever.  First day I tried the mint free, I was shocked by the strong black licorice flavor.  But, I kept brushing and it&#x27;s incredible how clean it makes your mouth feel.  I then bought the mint, to avoid the licorice flavor, but I don&#x27;t think it works as well.  I am not a fan of black licorice, BUT this toothpaste is so amazing, I&#x27;m thinking about buying the licorice flavored one to see how well it works.  I tried Earthpaste recently and it was no Bueno.  I ran out and bought more of this.  I will never use another toothpaste.  It leaves your mouth so clean.  1000% recommended!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a couple of months and I feel it has helped with tooth sensitivity...</li>
            <li> My favorite tooth paste by far. Unlike most other toothpastes, this one does not leave a strong mint tingle in your mind. My wife hates it and I love it so it is not for everyone. If you are sensitive to strong smells and tastes, this is the toothpaste for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Auromere Toothpaste for about 3 yrs. I recently ran out &amp; the store I grocery shop at, quit carrying it. I went to 2 other stores, only they didn&#x27;t have it either, so that is why I purchased on Amazon. Thank you Amazon!  I like Auromere&#x27;s Mint Free Toothpaste. It seems odd, but for me, using mint toothpaste at night seems to wake me up...the last thing I need when I&#x27;m tired and brushing my teeth at night.   I used my husbands regular toothpaste for the week I was out of Auromere &amp; my teeth felt horrid! I could feel the plaque build up on them daily, even though I continued brushing just as regular as using Auromere.   I&#x27;ll mention that I do not like black licorice and this tastes somewhat like it, (I think it&#x27;s one of the ingredients) - I mention this because since I don&#x27;t like it you would think I couldn&#x27;t handle this toothpaste -- not so! Yes, it&#x27;s a different taste, especially if you&#x27;re used to Colgate, Crest, etc., but give yourself a chance, you&#x27;ll be glad you did. Before your first tube is up, I think you&#x27;ll agree with me that Auromere is the toothpaste you&#x27;ll always want to buy. Your teeth and mouth will thank you!  As a big added benefit, I do not wake up with &#x27;morning breath&#x27;!   How about that for a great toothpaste? :)</li>
            <li> This toothpaste foams very well due to the SLS (which I try to avoid). The texture is not as silky smooth as I like my toothpastes, but it&#x27;s not gritty either. This paste helps to reduce gum bleeding too, but you must love licorice in order to use it. After about half a minute of use, the intense, almost spicy flavor begins to tingle the lips too much.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste we&#x27;ve used. My wife and I love it.</li>
            <li> Product is good quality.  Wording of the listing was a bit miss leading.  I really wanted the MINT product.  I was unaware of a &amp;#34;MINT-FREE&amp;#34; product.  Last time I looked, it was EITHER mint or licorice??</li>
            <li> been using ti for years.. i advocate anthing that is natural... no floride of course..</li>
            <li> Good, natural toothpaste</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this tooth paste for years, probably about 7 years.  Since I started using it, I went from having a cavity every year, to having them very infrequently.  My teeth are cleaner then ever and when I use it regularly without returning to \\&quot;normal\\&quot; tooth paste, I dont get \\&quot;morning breath\\&quot;, its amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its brown, so that takes some getting used to, and the taste gets some getting used to if your used to mint tooth paste, its not bad at all, its just not mint.  Its a great tooth paste if your taking homeopathic medication too, because of course, its mint free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff.  Its fantastic, and my teeth and gums are much healthier after switching off the Aquafresh, Colgate, Crest, and the like.  great product!  cant recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> I love this product. unlike standard name brand toothpaste it does not burn your mouth. the flavor is mild and pleasant and I think I brush longer, which combined with this toothpaste means my teeth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is wonderful!  It is so much better than the artificially dyed and flavored toothpaste that we all thought we were used to.  Now... I can&#x27;t go back to what I used for years!  I am sold on Auromere Tooth Paste. It not only tastes natural, it does noticeably whiten my teeth and cuts back on plaque as well. Although, I love the herbal toothpaste, which I tried this time.  I enjoy the licorice flavor even more.  Some people complained that the licorice was too powerful a flavor, so I tried the herbal.  I guess I love that wake-up powerful flavor.  I will order the predominantly licorice next time.  I say predominantly because both herbal and licorice have licorice flavor in degrees.  Give me the full blast.  I am sold!</li>
            <li> At least one of the 4 packages had the cover off when I opened it.  There is a safety seal but still a little concerning.  Also, product seemed a little dried out.  Lastly, they should consider either a travel size or reducing this tube size (and proportionately the price) so you can travel with it.  It is over the allowed 3 oz. for carryon.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste! I was referred to this brand of toothpaste and have enjoyed no more bleeding gums, no more mouth sores and no more bad breath caused by previous store bought toothpaste. I first purchased this same toothpaste with mint and my littles ones complained about it being too minty. So I order this toothpaste without the mint and it also works great without the minty taste for my little ones. I have purchased this toothpaste in the 4 and 5 count boxes so that I can share a tube or two with other family members so they can enjoy this great toothpaste and switch from store bought toothpaste.</li>
            <li> If you do not like licorice, do not buy this. I love it.  I&#x27;m wondering why I didn&#x27;t try this toothpaste sooner.  Everything at the store is mint.  Maybe a few other flavors for kids . I think there might be cinnamon.  But no licorice.  It has a similar feeling after brushing with mint toothpaste, which is the clean and fresh feeling.  You feel like you have fresh breath.  And also similar to mint, it does not taste good when you eat or drink something right after.  My absolute favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It always amazed me how mainstream toothpastes (Crests, Colgates..etc) get away with putting so much stuff in their product that overpowers the sensitive skin found in the mouth! This toothpaste doesn&#x27;t over tingle or, taste ridiculously sweet or artificial like most mainstream ones. The best part is that it works just as well as Sensodyne to help with my teeth sensitivity problem so this is a double winner :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you don&#x27;t like strong fake mint taste in your toothpaste this is the one for you because they explicitly didn&#x27;t put any mint in it.</li>
            <li> Good product without all the bad additives you see in many other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a very good toothpaste.  It has been used for 3000 years, and has stood the test of time, so my opinion really adds very little weight to its lasting popularity.  Most modern tooth pastes contain mint flavoring which is good if you like clean breath. but also has a major drawback, namely that mint destroys the good as well as the bad bacteria in the mouth. The good bacteria help preserve the teeth&#x27;s enamal.  Modern toothpaste then adds flouride to preserve the teeth from the bacteria destroyed by the mint they add.  It should be said that not all the Auromere toothpastes are mint-free, but they do give you that option.</li>
            <li> My wife thinks it&#x27;s great.  It is the first toothpaste that does not burn her mouth....Very good product</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste... have purchased this more than once and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Love this! No fear shopping here! I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothpaste and it is the best I have ever used for my sensitive teeth but now the price has so increased I can not afford it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from a local health food store for less then $7. (Affordable)&lt;br /&gt;I was experiencing some dull, throbbing dental pain and I couldn&#x27;t pin point which tooth was causing the problem (the pain was on my right side both top and bottom teeth, all of them it seemed) the pain was so bad that it kept me up all night for 3 nights in a row (no swelling). Once I started using this toothpaste I noticed a DRASTIC decrease in pain and frequency of pain. I went from ready to stalk a dentists office to improving my oral hygiene in a weeks time! I like the flavor, the ingredients, the price and the results! I highly recommend trying this brand, if not this particular flavor!</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  The flavor is anise (licorce).  Leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> AMAZInG!!! I bought more for my family to try. It whitens and keeps teeth clean all day. I have found my life long paste!</li>
            <li> Auromere is my favorite brand of toothpaste, i have been using it for years and it makes my teeth feel smooth and clean like no other toothpaste, plus it feels much more natural than the super foamy minty stuff. My teeth are also very white, people always comment on that so perhaps it is due to this toothpaste. I like the foam it gets and though the texture is different than standard toothpastes, i prefer it. A little goes a long way so the tube lasts a while. You really can&#x27;t beat the ingredients! 4 stars only because i strongly prefer the taste of the other ones, it took me a while to get used to the non-mint. I bought a pack of 4 to save a few dollars, and didn&#x27;t like it as much as the licorice or neem ones. It tastes fine, i just like the other ones better. The benefit of mint free is that it supposedly is more compatible with homeopathic medicines.</li>
            <li> Have suffered from consistent mouth ulcers for almost ten years.  Read reviews on this toothpaste where people stated that SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) in toothpastes can cause and/or aggravate mouth ulcers and canker sores.  Auromere Herbal Toothpaste is SLS free.  Reviews further stated that using this toothpaste reduced or completely cleared up the mouth ulcers/canker sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am here to tell you that my mouth ulcers are absolutely and completely gone since I&#x27;ve begun using this toothpaste. I am thrilled!! And, I love the taste of their toothpastes (licorice is my favorite).  If you suffer from mouth ulcers/canker sores or, even if you don&#x27;t, I highly recommend you use Auromere toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is a favorite of many family members because of the taste which is like mild licorice!   I use it because I am sensitive to mint which irritates my gum tissue and causes tooth sensitivity. I have had no problems with sensitive teeth since using this product.</li>
            <li> This is a mint free tooth paste, which  helps reduce the teeth sensitivity similar to Sensodyne. I have used this product for the last four months and  I find that it  whitens the  teeth  as well.</li>
            <li> Homeopathic supplements are neutralized by mint so this mint-free toothpaste is just what we were looking for. The vague licorice taste is quickly forgotten about (I don&#x27;t care for licorice) and only toothpaste remains.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.  It doesn&#x27;t have the best taste, but my sensitive teeth are no longer sensitive after I use it.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  Hard to find in stores. Great price here!  Keep teeth white. Removes plaque. Teeth feels cleaner.  Less expensive in the pack of 4.  My son like to use it so his teeth are whiter.</li>
            <li> Helps with sensitivity. No cavities the last two dentist appointments since using this. Always leaves my teeth and mouth feeling fresh. Love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Have been using it for over 4 years!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a great toothpaste.  However I accidentally bought the &amp;#34;Mint Free&amp;#34; (just saw Mint&amp;#34;) 4 pack, and the only flavor I taste is Anise!!  Yuck!  And Amazon was no help in exchanging them since I had opened one.  My bad, but their lack of support gets 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;If I were Auromere I would not label a product &amp;#34;Mint Free&amp;#34;, but perhaps &amp;#34;Unflavored&amp;#34;, or Anise Flavor</li>
            <li> The Auromere &amp;#34;mint free&amp;#34; toothpaste is yummy!  It has a MILD licorice flavor.  (If you want the stronger licorice flavor, buy the one labeled &#x27;licorice flavor&#x27;.)  They are both great.  In fact, I use both of them.  This toothpaste is mild and yet it cleans beautifully.  It&#x27;s the only toothpaste I will use!  It has spoiled me!</li>
            <li> Tried this as a sample from the food coop in my town and loved it so much I knew I had to buy it online. Thank you!! Best toothpaste ever</li>
            <li> I am allergic to mint-all kinds in every toothpaste I have tried. It is not easy to find toothpaste without mint in it, even organic and natural toothpastes. I found this one a few years ago and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. It isn&#x27;t the best tasting toothpaste, but it is mint-free and natural. I&#x27;ve been a regular and satisfied user since 1004. If you are careful about what you are putting into body via your mouth, and don&#x27;t like or can&#x27;t use mint. I&#x27;ve had trouble finding this toothpaste in my local stores. Thanks to Amazon, I can buy it again. I highly recommend this toothpaste without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Feels good to brush without chemicals. My gums are so healthy now.</li>
            <li> Decided to switch to a non-fluoride tooth paste. This one is terrific. I love the taste and my mouth feels so clean and fresh after using. I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried about every toothpaste out there that claims to help reverse gum disease.  They are all expensive (healthy teeth are considered &amp;#34;luxuries&amp;#34; in America, uncovered by insurance and beyond the financial reach of average people, hence the proliferation of these products), and hardly any of them make a noticeable difference.  This is one of two exceptions.  When we tried it, it really did reduce swelling and promote healthy gums and teeth.  We saw a noticeable difference within a week!  Pricey, but no more than other products making the same claims without delivery on their promises.  To our minds, this one is worth the price!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even imagine how the Licorice flavor tastes, because this one with a much milder flavor is still nauseating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste for years and even recommended / purchased several tubes for friends and family.  While completing chemistry courses via university and becoming increasingly homeopathic literate,  the very real toxic effects of SLS  (sodium lauryl sulfate) have truly hit home for me.  This chemical began its mainstream career in the US during the 50&#x27;s, as a primary ingredient in engine degreaser, which is still sold today.  While measuring the skin irritancy of other ingredients in scientific studies,  they decide the resulting detriment factor by COMPARING it with SLS.  Neem toothpastes are available without the incorporation of SLS;  sodium lauroyl glutamate is an excellent alternative ingredient.  People (including myself) who are making an active effort to be health conscious are marketed these highly toxic products under the guise that they are beneficial,  which couldn&#x27;t be farther from the truth.  Avoid this product at all costs unless they make the unlikely move to cater to the well-being of their customers and REMOVE the floor cleaner (SLS).  I hope a healthier and more enlightened existence for all of you,  especially those who are seeking!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a repeat purchaser of Auromere Toothpaste for decades. I will continue using it. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and always return to Auromere. This week is the first time ordering a multi-pack from Amazon Prime. I&#x27;ll update my review if needed once it arrives.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but I found a better product that is correcting my oral problem expedient.</li>
            <li> This is a good all natural toothpaste with a list of ingredients that you can read and pronounce.  It is a flourine free, mint free, great tasting toothpaste.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for years. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;You can feel the little granules washing your teeth and I love that. It has a mild&lt;br /&gt;minty flavor. The toothpaste color is beige.&lt;br /&gt;It really leaves your teeth smooth and your mouth feeling fresh. You don&#x27;t need a lot.&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t sud, so don&#x27;t expect suds.</li>
            <li> I tried this at a friend&#x27;s house and ordered from Amazon the very next day...4 tubes!  The licorice-like flavor is subtle and delicious.  I don&#x27;t miss mint at all.  It leaves your mouth fresh-feeling and fresh-tasting.  It also cleans your teeth like crazy.  And whitening?  Much better than any other toothpaste I have ever tried.  I want this on Auto-Delivery so that I never run out.</li>
            <li> My mouth stings from mint flavored toothpaste. It is hard to find a non-mint toothpaste. Not only is this a non-mint but the flavor is unique and enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it is concentrated so I use less and a tube lasts longer than a conventional tube of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is my second batch.  I got a perfect rating from my dentist office on the results. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Great Toothpaste with Quality ingredients, it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this because she became allergic to mint which is contained in almost every toothpaste made.  Most of those that don&#x27;t are &amp;#34;kiddy&amp;#34; flavored and taste pretty bad.  This toothpaste has a slight licorice flavor and so far is the best we have found.</li>
            <li> Favorite toothpaste ever</li>
            <li> the dentist says my teeth look beautiful and I haven&#x27;t had them professionally cleaned for 4 years</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need much of this toothpaste to brush.  A little goes a long way.  All the ingredients are natural and derived from plants.  Formerly, I used &amp;#34;Sensodyne&amp;#34; but now I use this.  No complex chemicals, no unpleasant aftertaste and works as well as any toothpaste I have used.</li>
            <li> Tastrs so great I could eat it! But I won&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;After only two times using it, I already feel like I have better breath throughout the day. This is a good flouride free toothpaste</li>
            <li> Deleivered as promised</li>
            <li> no chemicals or fluoride - great taste and mouth-feel.  good checkups at the dentist!</li>
