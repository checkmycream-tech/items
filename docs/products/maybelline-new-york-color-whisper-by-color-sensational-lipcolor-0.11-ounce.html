            <li>&amp;#34;Cherry on top&amp;#34; is bit too bright for my taste, but &amp;#34;Lust for Blush&amp;#34; is so beautiful on my skin.</li>
            <li>Goes on real smooth!</li>

            <li>You would love them!</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s super moisturizing, which makes it ideal for wintertime.</li>
            <li>this great you enjoy putting it on.</li>
            <li>This is a nice idea</li>
            <li>OMG sooo creamy and nice.</li>
            <li>This shade is a nice shimmer color.  </li>
            <li>I liked the subtlety of the color</li>
            <li>It really is such a beautiful beautiful color.</li>
            <li>but it is very light color.</li>
            <li>The color is very light (I think they all r in this line)</li>
            <li>Very smooth and not too opaque.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>will look into buying more of the color whispers.</li>
            <li>LOVE the color (Lust for Blush) and the formula.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lipstick.  </li>
            <li>I love the texuture of this lipsticks.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying 4 more colors.</li>
            <li>and I really love this color.</li>
            <li>a couple more colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because they are very light texture, lasting power is not the best, and you will need to reapply often, but with the price, you wouldnt worry about going through them quickly.</li>
            <li>It is a great natural color!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, makes my lips feel smooth and supple.</li>
            <li>really nice light pink color and feels great and conditioning on your lips</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and it&#x27;s sooooo lightweight</li>
            <li>Feels so smooth and keeps my lips moist.</li>
            <li>So smooth and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Shop around for the best price, so you can try a few shades.</li>
            <li>Love this color, moisturizes lips for real too :)</li>
            <li>i also bought this at ulta recently and it&#x27;s a very nice lip product.</li>
            <li>Most of all, It is very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>give it three stars because it is manageable if you use a lip balm underneath (I used one with peppermint oil and it helped a lot giving my lips a cool comfortable feel)</li>
            <li>but they charged me full price for both.</li>
            <li>LOVE this color, love the color whisper line in general - very nice color, doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out!</li>
            <li>This is very pretty.</li>
            <li>Love the way this lipstick looks so natural, but wish it was long-lasting.</li>
            <li>This is right up there with the tops of all the lipsticks or tinted balms I have ever used.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very comfortable on the lips and doesn&#x27;t feel waxy and heavy like most lipsticks do.</li>
            <li>Makes your lips look nice and hydrated...not dry or sticky</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin you really will love these they are so so moisturizing and glossy!</li>
            <li>The only reason I took away a star is because I wanted it to be a bit more pigmented.</li>
            <li>This is a nice baby pink.</li>
            <li>Packaging is pretty too.</li>
            <li>My favorite color, and unlike other drying lipsticks this is pigmented with added moisture.</li>
            <li>They are super moisturizing,glossy,pigmented,shiny,long lasting, and everything you could ever want from a lipstick!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend shades; Lust for Blush, Pin up Peach, and Coral Ambition.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done the long lasting ones where you can then put whatever chapstick on over the top</li>
            <li>&quot; that is so big right now.</li>
            <li>Pretty light pink sheer color.</li>
            <li>I usually do not buy any &amp;#34;Drug Store&amp;#34; cosmetics</li>
            <li>They feel like those Soft Lips chap sticks you get at the check out</li>
            <li>I previously had to blend two or three products that gave me the effect of Maybelline Color Whisper, and this effect is really special.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the color is subtle, it is comfortable on my lips not sticky or anything, and when I rub my lips together it still feels soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, not that thick feeling.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I often forced to throw away lipsticks because of the smell and taste so that is very important.&lt;br /&gt;Girls, try this.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it isn&#x27;t a true lipstick, just a mere &amp;#34;cover over&amp;#34; of the lips.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m very pale, blonde hair blue eyes).</li>
            <li> Color is a beige pink.</li>

            <li> Not really worth your time or money.  </li>

            <li> Shipping was extremely slow though.</li>
            <li> AND my lipstick came with a broken cap on one of the lipsticks.</li>
            <li> but it was a bit uncomfortable on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t taste or smell bad.</li>

            <li> Love the way this lipstick looks so natural, but wish it was long-lasting.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color on lips for fair skin with light eyes .</li>
            <li> This is a nice idea but it is very light color. I do wear it, its okay, I guess I will wear again.</li>
            <li> It is a great natural color! Goes on real smooth! Makes your lips look nice and hydrated...not dry or sticky</li>
            <li> i also bought this at ulta recently and it&#x27;s a very nice lip product. it&#x27;s very comfortable on the lips and doesn&#x27;t feel waxy and heavy like most lipsticks do. will look into buying more of the color whispers.</li>
            <li> LOVE the color (Lust for Blush) and the formula. No complaints there. I love this product. Shipping was extremely slow though. It took over a week to receive my product and it was packaged in a simple envelope type mailer with no plastic or seal on the actual product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a gal whom doesn&#x27;t like to wear lipstick as I do, well you have to try this. The moment you apply this lipstick, you feel the difference. It glides on smoothly and it&#x27;s sooooo lightweight you wouldn&#x27;t even feel it on your lips. Plus it&#x27;s super moisturizing, which makes it ideal for wintertime. The only reason I took away a star is because I wanted it to be a bit more pigmented. I think I&#x27;ll try it in different color the next time, since I got the Lust For Blush.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this color. It really is such a beautiful beautiful color. I&#x27;m planning on sticking up on this color so I don&#x27;t run out. perfect for a day look or a night out.</li>
            <li> OMG sooo creamy and nice. Like a lip butter. I have used this for moisture not just for color.  Doesn&#x27;t taste or smell bad. The color is very light (I think they all r in this line) so it depends on what look ur going for. Great price I want more colors!!! This is a nice baby pink. A+ in my book</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, makes my lips feel smooth and supple. Doesn&#x27;t last all day but when you have a product this great you enjoy putting it on.</li>
            <li> LOVE this color, love the color whisper line in general - very nice color, doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out!</li>
            <li> My favorite color, and unlike other drying lipsticks this is pigmented with added moisture.</li>
            <li> Feels so smooth and keeps my lips moist. I will definitely buy another one of these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.  I didn&#x27;t realize it isn&#x27;t a true lipstick, just a mere &amp;#34;cover over&amp;#34; of the lips.  Not really worth your time or money.  Probably won&#x27;t ever wear it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lipstick.  It&#x27;s smooth, not that thick feeling.  This shade is a nice shimmer color.  Yes, it&#x27;s sensational.  I will from now on, always purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I have 3 of these and I am 100% in love! They are super moisturizing,glossy,pigmented,shiny,long lasting, and everything you could ever want from a lipstick! I highly recommend shades; Lust for Blush, Pin up Peach, and Coral Ambition. If you have dry skin you really will love these they are so so moisturizing and glossy!</li>
            <li> So smooth and moisturizing. Buy a few for when they discontinue.  Color is a beige pink.</li>
            <li> I usually do not buy any &amp;#34;Drug Store&amp;#34; cosmetics but I heard good reviews about this and wanted to try. I bought Lust for Blush which is a pinkish nude color and &amp;#34; Cherry on top&amp;#34;. &amp;#34;Cherry on top&amp;#34; is bit too bright for my taste, but &amp;#34;Lust for Blush&amp;#34; is so beautiful on my skin. I love the texuture of this lipsticks. Very smooth and not too opaque. Most of all, It is very moisturizing! Because they are very light texture, lasting power is not the best, and you will need to reapply often, but with the price, you wouldnt worry about going through them quickly. Packaging is pretty too. I ended up buying 4 more colors. I prefer the lighter colors in this line ( which is the tyoe of colors I would choose in any brand of lipsticks anyway). I want to add that these lipsticks do not have odd taste or smell which I am very sensitive to. I often forced to throw away lipsticks because of the smell and taste so that is very important.&lt;br /&gt;Girls, try this. You would love them!</li>
            <li> This is right up there with the tops of all the lipsticks or tinted balms I have ever used. There are tons of different colors, but Lust For Blush is one of my favorites. I previously had to blend two or three products that gave me the effect of Maybelline Color Whisper, and this effect is really special. Shop around for the best price, so you can try a few shades. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Pretty light pink sheer color.Does not stay on long though.</li>
            <li> This is very pretty. It feels great on the lips and I really love this color. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I liked the subtlety of the color but it was a bit uncomfortable on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;As it wore off it made my lips feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;I give it three stars because it is manageable if you use a lip balm underneath (I used one with peppermint oil and it helped a lot giving my lips a cool comfortable feel)</li>
            <li> really nice light pink color and feels great and conditioning on your lips</li>
            <li> This is a great color and the texture is perfect!! For the price, I think you can&#x27;t beat it.  Wife loves Lust for Blush and it looks great on her.  Perfect for light complexions.</li>
            <li> I have never been a lipstick girl.... I&#x27;ve done the long lasting ones where you can then put whatever chapstick on over the top so you have color, but even then I feel like I have to reapply at lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two colors of Maybelline&#x27;s Color Whisper today, Go Nude and Petal Rebel (they were buy one get one half off so figured I&#x27;d try the two colors). They are getting great reviews from blogs and on amazon. I&#x27;ve been skeptical because I HATE lipstick, but these are GREAT! Both colors look good on me (I&#x27;m very pale, blonde hair blue eyes). They feel like those Soft Lips chap sticks you get at the check out stand in the grocery store. Anyway, the color is subtle, it is comfortable on my lips not sticky or anything, and when I rub my lips together it still feels soft and silky. The Go Nude is perfect for a \\&quot;nude lip\\&quot; that is so big right now. I&#x27;m going to buy a couple more colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great! Definitely going to be my regular lip gloss going forward!</li>
            <li> SUPPOSEDLY this item was a buy one get one 50% off but they charged me full price for both. AND my lipstick came with a broken cap on one of the lipsticks. Do not recommend.</li>
