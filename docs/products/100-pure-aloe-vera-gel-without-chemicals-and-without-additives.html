            <li>It was excellent</li>
            <li>gREAT sTUFF........!!!</li>
            <li>Great product, very happy with gel.</li>
            <li>Really good product!</li>
            <li>Good stuff for skin problems!</li>
            <li>The cucumber gel is also great.</li>
            <li>Try it, it makes your skin feels great.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just a great product.</li>
            <li>That aside, it is a very nice product.  </li>
            <li>The ones in the stores ALWAYS have something added, and oftentimes that something may be good for skin but not so great when you want to use the product on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile</li>
            <li>If it is good what else needs to be said.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>This is a good product that was described correctly by Amazon.</li>
            <li>But if you want an aloe vera gel, this is a good product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>OMG I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It makes my face smooth, mosturize and reduce my pimples!!</li>
            <li>&amp;#60;3 Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I am well pleased with my results!</li>
            <li>I just buy the first time for my wife and she said to me it is the best ever.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve made me a grateful and appreciative customer.</li>
            <li>My wife was bitten by some kind of insect and her hand had a rash that would not go away.</li>
            <li>This aloe gel has a very strong perfume smell.</li>
            <li>this is a very good and pure aloe vera....</li>
            <li>Love the feel and smell of this</li>
            <li>I totally love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I ABSOLUTELY love the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the amount, more so after adding shipping.</li>
            <li>It smells ok, though</li>
            <li>the thing I like most about Roots Aloe gel is that has so many uses, I use it&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Skin so much better</li>
            <li>Most are not 100% and often end up staying sticky and tacky on the skin, attracting dust, sand, dirt, etc.</li>
            <li>am in love with the cucumber gel as well and cannot wait to try their hibiscus gel.</li>
            <li>Roots Herbal makes fantastic products and I hope they never stop!</li>
            <li>I though I would get more for the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s positively magic for sunburn, and since it is so calming for skin, it is an important ingredient in my rosacea treatment.  </li>
            <li>Being organic it is free from all the chemicals and additives that are in most Aloe Vera products.  </li>
            <li>have redness on my cheeks to which nothing worked to reduce it or better yet take it away, I apply Roots 100% Aloe Vera gel to the affected area daily and nightly and the redness has greatly diminished.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I knocked out one star because this gel does not dissolve in water easily.</li>
            <li>But still, why would it be so strong in the product?</li>
            <li>It is cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best aloe vera gel I have ever</li>
            <li>Another amazing product that is pure and without any added ingredients or chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this actually cleans my face, but it feels great</li>
            <li>Great product wish it was offered in a bigger size.</li>
            <li>Became smooth within a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>This gel is wonderful for many things - not the least of which is sunburn.  </li>
            <li>So far very pleased with product.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t think it really smells like anything - it smells good to me, but I don&#x27;t really notice the smell.  </li>
            <li>It is a thick gel and works wonderful on sunburns.</li>
            <li>I refrigerate mine so it is cool and soothing.</li>
            <li>They process it with rose water, so it has a slight rose smell.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>This heals acne sores very quickly and really diminishes wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Really great product - If they didn&#x27;t sell this, I would have to buy aloe plants every few weeks and chop them up.  </li>
            <li>but if it works for my face it will be well worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve especially been impressed with how moisturizing it is by itself when used on my callous, rough feet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it is worth the purchase price - try it and you will be back for more inflamation fighter and soother.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes your skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The shipping&lt;br /&gt;charge was much more than the actual cost of shipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok, first of all, there is no such thing as a pure aloe vera gel with no additives.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice thick gel that makes a fantastic face mask.</li>
            <li>I use it for acne scars on my face, along with other products, but I must admit that this is the only one that leaves my face looking  great.</li>
            <li>I often use this product on my face and feet at night to help cool them, the product absorbs 100% and in the morning my skin is soft.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going to give up trying to find a pure aloe vera gel with no preservatives - I&#x27;ve looked everywhere.</li>
            <li>This is a pure Aloe Vera Gel for your skin protection</li>
            <li>wanted pure aloe.  </li>
            <li>I like it because it is pure gel.  </li>
            <li>pure no additives</li>
            <li>I started using the gel as a moisturizer and it really kept my oily face from getting oily.</li>
            <li>Maybe I used too much.</li>
            <li>it met my expectations but really pricey</li>
            <li>This is a really neat product.</li>
            <li>Like the pills didn&#x27;t notice much of an improvement in health.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more fun to use than plain water.</li>
            <li>All natural and pure, wiggles!</li>
            <li>someone who is highly prone to sunburns, I tend to use a lot of aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair come alive!!</li>
            <li>Used so many harsh, burning, ill effective products, that left me searching for something better.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t be a pure aloe vera &#x27;gel&#x27;, because there is no such thing, but it will be pure aloe vera extract.  </li>
            <li>As opposed to other 100% pure aloe product claims (which are downright lies...just look at the ingredients lists), no additives here, just like the bottle says (they process the aloe with rose water; thus the slight smell).    </li>
            <li>I will continue to use it, but I&#x27;m not sure if I will buy more unless I start to see a benefit.</li>
            <li>Small bottle, which does not last very long, but it works great.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it for my face because I have dark spots</li>
            <li>I bought it because I was having an aloe vera obsession and wanted one that was as pure as possible.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter skin and it clear it up</li>
            <li>Instead, I&#x27;m going to peel my aloe plant to get the clear gel out, mash it up together with grapefruit seed extract (natural preservative) and keep it in the fridge.</li>
            <li>has ingredients I can&#x27;t use on my face (skin too sensitive).</li>
            <li>have used this directly on my skin for skin irritations as well as I have added it to homemade ( all natural) skin moisturizers ( lotions )</li>
            <li>I use it on my face as a lightweight, vitamin-packed moisturizer for my sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>Silky smooth, absorbs easily, no fragrances added (that I can detect).  </li>
            <li>It has a slight odor, probably from processing, but it is in no way off putting and the scent disappears quickly.</li>
            <li>After using it for about six weeks, I haven&#x27;t seen a major difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li>But if you want real pure aloe vera, buy the freeze dried powder and add water.  </li>
            <li>The only other pure aloe product I found was as runny as water.</li>

            <li> The only other pure aloe product I found was as runny as water.</li>
            <li> Mainly because pure aloe vera extract isn&#x27;t a gel, it&#x27;s a thin liquid.  </li>
            <li> Been suffering from long term skin condition.</li>
            <li> This helped my dry skin around my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li> Then after a week my face got very dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I also have found every other brand I&#x27;ve tried to be drying</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling a bit tight, and I suspect that&#x27;s due to the gelatin.</li>
            <li> I might try it again using less product or wait for the summer when my face is the oiliest.</li>
            <li> I use a little coconut oil to address that issue.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and this is the ONLY moisturizer I can use without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> and I like it to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> but you have to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I did wrong</li>
            <li> wrong Item, I was ordering the capsules</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to find JUST Aloe Vera in the stores.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.    </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the feel and smell of this</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and this is the ONLY moisturizer I can use without irritating my skin. Got the info from [...] (jam-packed with info about how to get rid of rosacea).    As opposed to other 100% pure aloe product claims (which are downright lies...just look at the ingredients lists), no additives here, just like the bottle says (they process the aloe with rose water; thus the slight smell).    Just do me a favor, Rootsherbal guys: Please never ever discontinue or change this product!</li>
            <li> This aloe gel has a very strong perfume smell. Then I noticed it was made in India... so *could* be an incense smell... But still, why would it be so strong in the product? As we know, India doesn&#x27;t have the same manufacturing controls as we do, so I&#x27;m not inclined to trust the label. Very disappointing.    I think I&#x27;m going to give up trying to find a pure aloe vera gel with no preservatives - I&#x27;ve looked everywhere. Instead, I&#x27;m going to peel my aloe plant to get the clear gel out, mash it up together with grapefruit seed extract (natural preservative) and keep it in the fridge.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. So soothing on the skin.</li>
            <li> Really great product - If they didn&#x27;t sell this, I would have to buy aloe plants every few weeks and chop them up.  This heals acne sores very quickly and really diminishes wrinkles.  I also don&#x27;t think it really smells like anything - it smells good to me, but I don&#x27;t really notice the smell.  I put it on before I got to bed at night.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I totally love this stuff. It&#x27;s a nice thick gel that makes a fantastic face mask. They process it with rose water, so it has a slight rose smell. I bought it because I was having an aloe vera obsession and wanted one that was as pure as possible. I actually left it in the refrigerator for maybe a year, because I couldn&#x27;t think of a use for it, and then recently I thought I&#x27;d just use it as a face cleanser because every face wash I look at has ingredients I can&#x27;t use on my face (skin too sensitive). I don&#x27;t think this actually cleans my face, but it feels great and it&#x27;s more fun to use than plain water. The cucumber gel is also great. The only other pure aloe product I found was as runny as water. Will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great product wish it was offered in a bigger size. I would purchase this item again. Try it, it makes your skin feels great.</li>
            <li> I started using the gel as a moisturizer and it really kept my oily face from getting oily. Then after a week my face got very dry and irritated. Maybe I used too much. I don&#x27;t know what I did wrong but I stopped using it and am waiting for the irritation to subside. I might try it again using less product or wait for the summer when my face is the oiliest.</li>
            <li> I use it for acne scars on my face, along with other products, but I must admit that this is the only one that leaves my face looking  great. Will keep purchasing.</li>
            <li> OMG I love this stuff! Another amazing product that is pure and without any added ingredients or chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;I have used this directly on my skin for skin irritations as well as I have added it to homemade ( all natural) skin moisturizers ( lotions ) and I ABSOLUTELY love the results.&lt;br /&gt;I have redness on my cheeks to which nothing worked to reduce it or better yet take it away, I apply Roots 100% Aloe Vera gel to the affected area daily and nightly and the redness has greatly diminished.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your skin so soft and smooth. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;This product definitely gets 2 thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> this is a very good and pure aloe vera.... it should be noted that once you open it you have to refrigerate it. I wish that were not the case as then I have to get it out of refrigerator every time I use if after a bath.</li>
            <li> wrong Item, I was ordering the capsules so I thought.If I can return this I will.thank You.I did not use this product.</li>
            <li> So far very pleased with product. It is a thick gel and works wonderful on sunburns. I originally bought it for my face because I have dark spots and I read that aloe Vera gel helps restore the skin. I have not noticed anything yet but it&#x27;s only been using for a week. It is pricey but if it works for my face it will be well worth it.</li>
            <li> I appreciate having such a soothing gel that can be used anywhere on the body.</li>
            <li> Really good product! It makes my face smooth, mosturize and reduce my pimples!!</li>
            <li> Small bottle, which does not last very long, but it works great.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly. After using it for about six weeks, I haven&#x27;t seen a major difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance. It leaves my skin feeling a bit tight, and I suspect that&#x27;s due to the gelatin. I use a little coconut oil to address that issue. I will continue to use it, but I&#x27;m not sure if I will buy more unless I start to see a benefit.</li>
            <li> This is a pure Aloe Vera Gel for your skin protection and I like it to use it everyday. But its pricey for its size</li>
            <li> wanted pure aloe.  it met my expectations but really pricey&lt;br /&gt;for the amount, more so after adding shipping. The shipping&lt;br /&gt;charge was much more than the actual cost of shipping.&lt;br /&gt;  would not repurchase because of the price.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this is 100% Aloe Vera...no extras, no fillers.....nothing but Aloe Vera. It&#x27;s impossible to find JUST Aloe Vera in the stores. The ones in the stores ALWAYS have something added, and oftentimes that something may be good for skin but not so great when you want to use the product on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. It makes my hair come alive!!</li>
            <li> I knocked out one star because this gel does not dissolve in water easily. I purchased it to make baby wipes. It smells ok, though</li>
            <li> I like it because it is pure gel.  However, I was told the aloe is rinsed in rosewater which&lt;br /&gt;stings on burns, cuts.</li>
            <li> I have read a lot of reviews on 100% aloe vera gel items that talk about them being watery. This is actual gel! It is not sticky when applied and rubbed in thoroughly. I use it on my face as a lightweight, vitamin-packed moisturizer for my sensitive, acne-prone skin. I refrigerate mine so it is cool and soothing. If only it came in a larger size..</li>
            <li> Great product, very happy with gel. Arrived on time. My granddaughter had a rash in her arm, I rubbed the gel on it at night the next morning it was gone!</li>
            <li> Perfect, meets all my needs for scrapes, tens unit needs, and over all use. If it is good what else needs to be said.</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;3 Love this stuff! All natural and pure, wiggles!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter skin and it clear it up but you have to use it everyday. It&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> This is a really neat product. My wife uses it for areas that burn or itch. It is cool and refreshing. This is a good product that was described correctly by Amazon. It arrived on time, was well packaged, and had no damage.</li>
            <li> This gel is wonderful for many things - not the least of which is sunburn.  It&#x27;s positively magic for sunburn, and since it is so calming for skin, it is an important ingredient in my rosacea treatment.  Works wonders.  Being organic it is free from all the chemicals and additives that are in most Aloe Vera products.  I am well pleased with my results!</li>
            <li> the thing I like most about Roots Aloe gel is that has so many uses, I use it&lt;br /&gt;in my hair, for cuts and scrapes, for foundation before applying make-up.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s pure no additives it&#x27;s just a great product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. Closest thing to using the actually plant I&#x27;ve found. Been suffering from long term skin condition. Used so many harsh, burning, ill effective products, that left me searching for something better. When I apply your product, I know I&#x27;m getting the medicinal benefits and healing all in one. Skin so much better and it&#x27;s only been three weeks. Thank you. You&#x27;ve made me a grateful and appreciative customer.</li>
            <li> Think I have done this  once! It was excellent</li>
            <li> gREAT sTUFF........!!!........it is worth the purchase price - try it and you will be back for more inflamation fighter and soother.</li>
            <li> This helped my dry skin around my nose and cheeks. Became smooth within a couple of weeks. Can also dissolve in water for oral use. Like the pills didn&#x27;t notice much of an improvement in health.</li>
            <li> Ok, first of all, there is no such thing as a pure aloe vera gel with no additives.  Mainly because pure aloe vera extract isn&#x27;t a gel, it&#x27;s a thin liquid.  Therefore, despite the vendor&#x27;s claims, a gelling agent like Carbomer or something else has been added - guarenteed. That aside, it is a very nice product.  Silky smooth, absorbs easily, no fragrances added (that I can detect).  But if you want real pure aloe vera, buy the freeze dried powder and add water.  It won&#x27;t be a pure aloe vera &#x27;gel&#x27;, because there is no such thing, but it will be pure aloe vera extract.  But if you want an aloe vera gel, this is a good product.  Just don&#x27;t be fooled by the label claiming that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s in it...</li>
            <li> Hands down the best aloe vera gel I have ever tried!&lt;br /&gt;As someone who is highly prone to sunburns, I tend to use a lot of aloe vera gel. Most are not 100% and often end up staying sticky and tacky on the skin, attracting dust, sand, dirt, etc. I also have found every other brand I&#x27;ve tried to be drying and I never understood the big deal with aloe vera gel until I tried this product.&lt;br /&gt;This product IS 100% aloe vera gel. It has a slight odor, probably from processing, but it is in no way off putting and the scent disappears quickly. I often use this product on my face and feet at night to help cool them, the product absorbs 100% and in the morning my skin is soft. I&#x27;ve especially been impressed with how moisturizing it is by itself when used on my callous, rough feet.&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with the cucumber gel as well and cannot wait to try their hibiscus gel. Roots Herbal makes fantastic products and I hope they never stop!</li>
            <li> The gel is about 2oz...I though I would get more for the price.  Will not purchase this item again; instead I&#x27;ll use Aloe Vera juice@ Walmart...1gallon bottle--$7.99.</li>
            <li> I just buy the first time for my wife and she said to me it is the best ever. Thanks</li>
            <li> My wife was bitten by some kind of insect and her hand had a rash that would not go away. We tried Cortisone cream, antibiotic ontiment, to no avail. When she put some of this aloe vera gel on the rash it started to go away almost immediately, and after 3 days is almost gone. Good stuff for skin problems!</li>
