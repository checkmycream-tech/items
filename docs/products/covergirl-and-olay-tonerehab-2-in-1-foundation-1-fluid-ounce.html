            <li>so I was able to match my skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li>it smells good too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and in the winter time</li>
            <li>the color matches my fair and freckled skin.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how good it looks when I&#x27;m a bit darker from tanning.  </li>
            <li>So the Cover Girl + Olay 2-1 Foundation is a great concept, and innovative.</li>
            <li>, THAT IS FOR SURE !  </li>
            <li>My skin tone is light, so &amp;#34;Creamy Natural&amp;#34; looked great on me.</li>
            <li>It smells and feels nice; doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause breakouts like others do; and blends well.</li>
            <li>and she really liked it.</li>
            <li>However, this review is based on my own opinion regarding the experience</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I don&#x27;t like this product because it is very easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>and it was very easy to spread.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been quite warm and humid here, but the CG/Olay foundation looks much better at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>and I liked it, but didn&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and is great for \\&quot;older\\&quot; skin types, covering fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it is so convenient to order it online.  </li>
            <li>This is the best foundation for any skin type especially middle age skin.  </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my skin when I wear this makeup because it makes my skin look so healthy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely my favorite foundation.</li>
            <li>I tend to settle for BB creams for this reason, but when I need more coverage</li>
            <li>This is my favorite drugstore foundation.</li>
            <li>My favorite drug store foundation to date</li>
            <li>I love it -- and</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Lancome foundation for years, but have decided I love the CoverGirl/Olay combo much more</li>
            <li>I WILL PURCHASE MORE</li>
            <li>Ellen plus many more) alot of money to endorse their product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the texture, smooth application, the innovative look of the bottle, and coverage.</li>
            <li>I love that foundation.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this because I&#x27;m tanning and will need a bit of a darker foundation in a couple more weeks.  </li>
            <li>I love Olay products and this one appears to be a winner for me.</li>
            <li>I Love the fact that while wearing foundation it is improving what&#x27;s underneath.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I bought this, and will be re ordering.</li>
            <li>I am so lucky to have the chance to try and find wonderful new products that become part of my beauty routine.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that has the Olay in it, and I use a primer underneath, but I love this and will be ordering another real soon!!!</li>
            <li>This is good - but the real test is how it holds up.  </li>
            <li>I like that it comes with a pump for easy dispensing (clean!).</li>
            <li>I wear this foundation, I can easily remove it my a tissue.</li>
            <li>It blends easily and plays well with others.  </li>
            <li>easy to apply this foundation using</li>
            <li>The liquid foundation goes on smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li>what I loved best was that now I&#x27;ve got more color choices with the CoverGirl line than probably any other similar product.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and doesnt settle into the fine lines on your face and add age to it.</li>
            <li>It looks a little heavier than Almay, but that could just be the tint not matching me perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to keep adding layers to that cakey point to cover what I am trying to cover.&lt;br /&gt; - The applicator (Pump) is unique and easy to use.</li>
            <li>- I use the creamy natural, as I have fair skin, but not the palest.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m leaving you for a new and better product!roduct!</li>
            <li>The price is fantastic and it has the anti-aging properties build right into the foundation!  </li>
            <li>When  you re-apply coverage to even things out, the originally applied layer peels off .  </li>
            <li>&gt; - the feeling of the makeup is unique, it is a creamy velvety feeling.</li>
            <li>&amp; Olay Tone Rehab 2-in-1 is a unique makeup from COVERGIRL which contains not just foundation, but also a serum from Olay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Coincidently, I recently for the first time tried using the Cover Girl/Olay concealer and discovered what a great product it was.  </li>
            <li>It really does make my skin look better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and was lucky to try this product at no cost to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the results and will definitely purchase these products in the future.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good all day long.  </li>
            <li>Being familiar with higher end brand foundations</li>
            <li>Thanks Covergirl and Olay for another fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>It provides excellent coverage with a thin layer applied.</li>
            <li>The consistency is lighter and smoother than my old product, and even the color is a better match for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I liked that the foundation was mixed in with Olay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving them 4 stars instead of 5 because I would have liked some SPF coverage, if that&#x27;s possible.</li>
            <li>right on the brush.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use very much at all.  </li>
            <li>I was also excited to try this because I like this new multi-use generation of foundations.</li>
            <li>I mixed a little of it with my existing foundation to match the color to my skin a little better, and it does a fantastic job evening out my skin tone and giving me a flawless look.  </li>
            <li>I have compared this to higher end department store foundations that cost triple the amount</li>
            <li>I also use SmashBox face primer first to hold my foundation in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li>I like that you can use this foundation as a tinted moisturizer too, just on its own, without any other makeup..</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, hardly looks like I&#x27;m wearing makeup, and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>The first time I applied it I put way too much on my hand.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it does glide on smoothly, and provides a sheer coverage.  </li>
            <li>I really like this foundation.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li>double wear light.</li>
            <li>My issue with it is that the colors are very off.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li>I do really like this foundation.  </li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzAgent</li>
            <li>It applys very evenly and in one application.</li>
            <li>/&gt; - it REALLY does even your skin tone.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a true believer in the skin care regime of \\&quot;moisturize, moisturize, moisturize\\&quot; and started to use moisturizers daily (at first) maybe twenty years or so ago.  </li>
            <li>I very rarely find foundation that is not Clinique or Origins that I like, especially the ones you can find at Walgreens!</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t used pressed powder since high school because of the splotchy sandpaper coverage but this pressed powder gave me a light air brushed look.</li>
            <li>After applying a small amount of the powder, I had a very nice finished and polished look that definitely lived up to the promise of evening out my skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li>Cover Girl is known for &#x27;decent&#x27; over the counter makeup where they pay a celebrity (</li>
            <li>Answer a couple of quick questions such as hair and eye color</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying it if you are on the fence about it.</li>
            <li>And, better yet, there&#x27;s one that matches my skin tone much more closely than my old expensive foundation.  </li>
            <li>I decided to venture from my normal foundation and try this one.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just one-shade darker than my normal &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; that I get.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a new foundation makeup</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>But my reco would be to Olay/Cover Girl to do a Sensitive Skin one just in case!</li>
            <li>just your fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;The foundation went on light, it didn&#x27;t feel like my skin was weighed down with makeup at all.</li>
            <li>I usually wear Almay Smart Shade Anti-Aging in light.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve been reading in \\&quot;More\\&quot; magazine (for women over 40) that twice daily moisturizing is the best way to slow down the inevitable.  </li>
            <li>Even as little as one stroke of pump delivered more than enough foundation for me.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel or look heavy.  </li>
            <li>This product caused my skin to break out, and I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>, I need to stick with creamy natural...</li>
            <li>One pump is enough for my whole face.</li>
            <li>plus (for me, at least) is that I absolutely love the smell of this foundation.</li>
            <li>/&gt; - I also have sensitive skin&lt;</li>
            <li>Studio Secrets Professional Color</li>
            <li>like how natural this leaves your skin looking after applying.</li>
            <li>my&lt;br /&gt;usual foundation doesn&#x27;t completely cover them either.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>forget to complete your make up</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t too heavy or too light.</li>
            <li>I ordered creamy natural</li>
            <li>I SPENT YEARS LOOKING FOR A FOUNDATION THAT IS RIGHT</li>
            <li>It has a rich, creamy and is velvet-y without being too heavy.</li>
            <li>But most tinted moisturizers have a limited range of colors (usually three -- light, medium and dark) which can pose a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&amp; Olay Tone Rehab 2-in-1 Foundation, left my face feeling very soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and foundations that tend to get powdery after they settle they make me look older.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was that I needed to use much less of the CG/Olay foundation for the same effect.  </li>
            <li>You simply can&#x27;t go wrong with this product since it gives great results for very little cost.</li>
            <li>I received this foundation to try as part of group that tries new products.  </li>

            <li> I mixed a little of it with my existing foundation to match the color to my skin a little better, and it does a fantastic job evening out my skin tone and giving me a flawless look.  </li>
            <li> I have compared this to higher end department store foundations that cost triple the amount</li>
            <li> I also use SmashBox face primer first to hold my foundation in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li> I like that you can use this foundation as a tinted moisturizer too, just on its own, without any other makeup..</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, hardly looks like I&#x27;m wearing makeup, and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> The first time I applied it I put way too much on my hand.  </li>
            <li> First of all, it does glide on smoothly, and provides a sheer coverage.  </li>
            <li> I really like this foundation.  </li>

            <li> I do really like this foundation.  </li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a true believer in the skin care regime of \\&quot;moisturize, moisturize, moisturize\\&quot; and started to use moisturizers daily (at first) maybe twenty years or so ago.  </li>
            <li> I very rarely find foundation that is not Clinique or Origins that I like, especially the ones you can find at Walgreens!</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used pressed powder since high school because of the splotchy sandpaper coverage but this pressed powder gave me a light air brushed look.</li>
            <li> After applying a small amount of the powder, I had a very nice finished and polished look that definitely lived up to the promise of evening out my skin without drying it out.</li>

            <li> I decided to venture from my normal foundation and try this one.  </li>

            <li> And I&#x27;ve been reading in \\&quot;More\\&quot; magazine (for women over 40) that twice daily moisturizing is the best way to slow down the inevitable.  </li>
            <li> Even as little as one stroke of pump delivered more than enough foundation for me.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel or look heavy.  </li>

            <li> But most tinted moisturizers have a limited range of colors (usually three -- light, medium and dark) which can pose a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have dry skin and foundations that tend to get powdery after they settle they make me look older.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed was that I needed to use much less of the CG/Olay foundation for the same effect.  </li>
            <li> You simply can&#x27;t go wrong with this product since it gives great results for very little cost.</li>
            <li> I received this foundation to try as part of group that tries new products.  </li>
            <li> To be fair, I have quite a few sun spots on my cheeks which are difficult to cover and</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t like the feel of gooey liquid foundations and usually use mineral powder foundation, but was pleasantly surprised at how this makeup allowed my skin to breathe and how natural my skin felt.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and foundation usually makes my skin flaky and looks very unnatural on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dry and powdery; not at all what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I am shocked and amazed I actually LOVE this foundation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> added the same thing - or at least really really similar to - a moisturizer with tinting?  </li>
            <li> This product is \\&quot;not ready for prime time\\&quot; and shouldn&#x27;t be sold.  </li>
            <li> It refines your skin and actually improves the texture of your skin without heavy overly made up look.</li>

            <li> when I shop for Covergirl products on their site, I look for the shades which have a pink dot beside them.</li>
            <li> But if you want a natural look you can&#x27;t expect a thick layer of coverage.</li>
            <li> I have been using other foundations and when I tried this I was hooked.  </li>

            <li> and I am not sure of this 100%, is that not sure if it makes me break out partially.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this foundation.  The color matches my skin tone perfectly.  It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel or look heavy.  I&#x27;ve used products that were 3X as expensive but this is the best foundation I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I have never had any problems with foundations. This product caused my skin to break out, and I do not have sensitive skin. I had to discontinue use. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I am a Asian girl, and a little whiter than normal. I bought the color nature 120. The color fits me well. it smells good too.&lt;br /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t like this product because it is very easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;When I wear this foundation, I can easily remove it my a tissue. After receive a phone call, my cellphone looks blurry. When I come back home at night, there is no foundation on my face at all. I can&#x27;t wipe my face during the day I wear this foundation. I really don&#x27;t like this product. I will definitely go back to Estee Lauder double wear light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new foundation makeup and I found it here on Amazon... I&#x27;m fair skinned and in the winter time, I need to stick with creamy natural... I use a makeup sponge and it blends perfectly. I love the fact that has the Olay in it, and I use a primer underneath, but I love this and will be ordering another real soon!!!</li>
            <li> The texture of this foundation is awesome. My issue with it is that the colors are very off. I wear creamy natural in other CG products so purchased this in the same. It is very orange and terrible.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this stuff ...</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is so convenient to order it online.  I have signed up for it to automatically be delivered every five months.  No more worrying about if the store has the product in my color.  I have used Covergirl for years and never have changed or would change to anything else.</li>
            <li> This product is \\&quot;not ready for prime time\\&quot; and shouldn&#x27;t be sold.  I bought this product and tried it several times. First of all, it does glide on smoothly, and provides a sheer coverage.  When  you re-apply coverage to even things out, the originally applied layer peels off .  The product did not cover the pores in the nose and made pore-holes (eww), when I reapplied, the holes grew.  Also the product settles into wrinkles around the eye, and makes the skin around your eyes look aged and old.  I tried to apply moisturizer around the eye, and the product crumbled and peeled off.  Bottom line, the Cover Girl company is selling a dud.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is the best foundation for any skin type especially middle age skin.  I have compared this to higher end department store foundations that cost triple the amount and they just do not measure up. It refines your skin and actually improves the texture of your skin without heavy overly made up look.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive, acne prone skin. I&#x27;ve been using this foundation for a few years now. It smells and feels nice; doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause breakouts like others do; and blends well. Ordering from Amazon was, as always, a great experience.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my skin when I wear this makeup because it makes my skin look so healthy.  It&#x27;s definitely my favorite foundation.</li>
            <li> Bought for my Mom based on the reviews of others. She said it went on silky and she really liked it.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and foundations that tend to get powdery after they settle they make me look older. I tend to settle for BB creams for this reason, but when I need more coverage this covergirl 2-in-1 works well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite drugstore foundation. It has a rich, creamy and is velvet-y without being too heavy. It provides excellent coverage with a thin layer applied. One pump is enough for my whole face.</li>
            <li> My favorite drug store foundation to date that&#x27;s very affordable. I like that it comes with a pump for easy dispensing (clean!). My skin tone is light, so &amp;#34;Creamy Natural&amp;#34; looked great on me. The liquid foundation goes on smoothly and easily. It does not feel powdery or oily. I use my Shiseido foundation brush to apply an even coating. I also use SmashBox face primer first to hold my foundation in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus (for me, at least) is that I absolutely love the smell of this foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a true believer in the skin care regime of \\&quot;moisturize, moisturize, moisturize\\&quot; and started to use moisturizers daily (at first) maybe twenty years or so ago.  (Now it&#x27;s twice a day.) And I&#x27;ve been reading in \\&quot;More\\&quot; magazine (for women over 40) that twice daily moisturizing is the best way to slow down the inevitable.  One of their suggestions this year is to use a tinted moisturizer in place of a foundation.  But most tinted moisturizers have a limited range of colors (usually three -- light, medium and dark) which can pose a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coincidently, I recently for the first time tried using the Cover Girl/Olay concealer and discovered what a great product it was.  Then it occurred to me - isn&#x27;t a foundation with moisturizer added the same thing - or at least really really similar to - a moisturizer with tinting?  Hmm, it was definitely time to give the foundation a try.  I did.  I love it -- and what I loved best was that now I&#x27;ve got more color choices with the CoverGirl line than probably any other similar product.  And, better yet, there&#x27;s one that matches my skin tone much more closely than my old expensive foundation.  So I went ahead and ordered the foundation (and a creme blush!).  The foundation is remarkable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was that I needed to use much less of the CG/Olay foundation for the same effect.  Even as little as one stroke of pump delivered more than enough foundation for me.  The consistency is lighter and smoother than my old product, and even the color is a better match for my skin.  This is good - but the real test is how it holds up.  It&#x27;s been quite warm and humid here, but the CG/Olay foundation looks much better at the end of the day.  And best of all -- I save money -- a LOT of money.  This is truly a five star product for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Lancome foundation for years, but have decided I love the CoverGirl/Olay combo much more -- farewell Lancome -- I&#x27;m leaving you for a new and better product!roduct!</li>
            <li> I do really like this foundation.  I decided to venture from my normal foundation and try this one.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;m so used to Amazon prime that I forgot to check the shipping costs and paid quite a bit in shipping.  Don&#x27;t make my mistake!</li>
            <li> I SPENT YEARS LOOKING FOR A FOUNDATION THAT IS RIGHT FOR MY SKIN TYPE AND I BELIEVE I JUST FOUND IT... THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME.. I WILL PURCHASE MORE, THAT IS FOR SURE !  THANKS</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and was lucky to try this product at no cost to me. However, this review is based on my own opinion regarding the experience I had using these great products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 2-in-1 Foundation is supposed to help cover discoloration and age spots as well as hydrate to improve skin tone over time. I applied a small amount of foundation with a sponge and it was very easy to spread. A little went a long way and was not sticky, tacky or heavy at all. After applying a small amount of the powder, I had a very nice finished and polished look that definitely lived up to the promise of evening out my skin without drying it out. The makeup stayed on all day and did not melt off in the Florida heat. I&#x27;m very happy with the results and will definitely purchase these products in the future. The foundation color was also a great match for my fair/medium skin tone. You simply can&#x27;t go wrong with this product since it gives great results for very little cost. Thanks to BzzAgent I am so lucky to have the chance to try and find wonderful new products that become part of my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I have been using other foundations and when I tried this I was hooked.  It goes on so smoothly and is great for \\&quot;older\\&quot; skin types, covering fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> So the Cover Girl + Olay 2-1 Foundation is a great concept, and innovative. I have not seen two brands combine products to a dual force in the makeup category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, Olay is known for skin care and anti-aging. Cover Girl is known for &#x27;decent&#x27; over the counter makeup where they pay a celebrity (Ellen plus many more) alot of money to endorse their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will say off the bat, I am not an over the counter make up person. I very rarely find foundation that is not Clinique or Origins that I like, especially the ones you can find at Walgreens! So I was skeptical. However, I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I am shocked and amazed I actually LOVE this foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Specifics:&lt;br /&gt; - I use the creamy natural, as I have fair skin, but not the palest. Very Irish skin.&lt;br /&gt; - I also have sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt; - I only use the foundation, not the accompanying powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The marketing pitch:&lt;br /&gt; - Instantly covers discolorations and age spots&lt;br /&gt; - Hydrates to improve skin tone over time&lt;br /&gt; - Foundation + Serum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I have switched and like it:&lt;br /&gt; - the feeling of the makeup is unique, it is a creamy velvety feeling. I know it sounds wierd but it actually feels almost like a moisturizing when you put it on, not like a foundation. It is awesome!&lt;br /&gt; - It applys very evenly and in one application. I don&#x27;t have to keep adding layers to that cakey point to cover what I am trying to cover.&lt;br /&gt; - The applicator (Pump) is unique and easy to use. It also doesn&#x27;t get messy like some of the twist of tops. It doesn&#x27;t leak, or leave makeup around the sides of the bottles, etc.&lt;br /&gt; - it REALLY does even your skin tone. Whether dark spots, age spots, or pimples/scars, it totally evens out with not a heavy look.&lt;br /&gt; - I actually got compliments on my skin. Shocked me.&lt;br /&gt; - One bottle has lasted about a month - with an average of 5 days per week use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I never use store brand makeup, and I am sold in.The ONLY con and I am not sure of this 100%, is that not sure if it makes me break out partially. I don&#x27;t think that is the reason as its only on my chin. But my reco would be to Olay/Cover Girl to do a Sensitive Skin one just in case!</li>
            <li> I tried this after my previous high end all-in-1 changed formulas.  Have been using it for about 2 years.  Great coverage for what I am looking for and the color matches my fair and freckled skin.  I do not plan on switching foundations unless this formula changes.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and foundation usually makes my skin flaky and looks very unnatural on my skin.  I tried the cream version of this and I liked it, but didn&#x27;t love it.  It was too thick.  This liquid version is perfect.  It blends easily and plays well with others.  I use a brush to apply it that has been swirled in a bit of bronzer[[ASIN:B007PCQ802 Tarte Amazonian Clay and Annatto Body Bronzer Amazon Bronze 0.70 oz]] and I mix in some color correcting primer[[ASIN:B002PBAJ4Y L&#x27;Oreal Paris Studio Secrets Professional Color Correcting Anti-Redness Primer, 0.68-Fluid Ounce]] right on the brush.  Works great and I don&#x27;t use very much at all.  I just use a dusting of powder on the T-zone to set it and it&#x27;s good all day long.  Doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing makeup at all.</li>
            <li> I just started using COVERGIRL &amp; Olay Tone Rehab 2-in-1 Foundation  as a product test from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;COVERGIRL &amp; Olay Tone Rehab 2-in-1 is a unique makeup from COVERGIRL which contains not just foundation, but also a serum from Olay. So you get foundation coverage and you moisturize your face each time you apply this makeup product. This reduces a step in a woman&#x27;s morning routine, saving a bit of time and effort. For those who are in a time crunch, I think you will appreciate this convenience.&lt;br /&gt;COVERGIRL &amp; Olay Tone Rehab 2-in-1 Foundation, left my face feeling very soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to apply this foundation using just your fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;The foundation went on light, it didn&#x27;t feel like my skin was weighed down with makeup at all. I don&#x27;t like the feel of gooey liquid foundations and usually use mineral powder foundation, but was pleasantly surprised at how this makeup allowed my skin to breathe and how natural my skin felt. The foundation applied evenly, leaving no streaks and blended nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I like how natural this leaves your skin looking after applying. I like that you can use this foundation as a tinted moisturizer too, just on its own, without any other makeup.. I didn&#x27;t get quite enough coverage of my spots&lt;br /&gt;with this foundation, even after applying a second coat. But if you want a natural look you can&#x27;t expect a thick layer of coverage. To be fair, I have quite a few sun spots on my cheeks which are difficult to cover and my&lt;br /&gt;usual foundation doesn&#x27;t completely cover them either.&lt;br /&gt;This foundation comes in shades for all women, offering 14 shades.&lt;br /&gt;Before buying- Covergirl Tone Rehab 2-in 1 Foundation, get matched to the best shade for you.  Go to Covergirl.com.&lt;br /&gt;Click on ColorMatch. Answer a couple of quick questions such as hair and eye color and they will give you a color circle to match with their foundation and other make up products.&lt;br /&gt;For instance my color circle was pink, so when I shop for Covergirl products on their site, I look for the shades which have a pink dot beside them. Then I know those shades are in my color range. This makes it easier to select the best shades for you.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget to complete your make up look by applying Covergirl + Olay Pressed Powder after you have applied the foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this foundation+ serum 4 stars, taking off 1 star because it doesn&#x27;t have sunscreen.  I would buy this product to use again in the future.</li>
            <li> Being familiar with higher end brand foundations I was a little skeptical about the coverage. I was also excited to try this because I like this new multi-use generation of foundations. I liked that the foundation was mixed in with Olay. I liked the texture, smooth application, the innovative look of the bottle, and coverage. It wasn&#x27;t too heavy or too light. I hadn&#x27;t used pressed powder since high school because of the splotchy sandpaper coverage but this pressed powder gave me a light air brushed look. I&#x27;m giving them 4 stars instead of 5 because I would have liked some SPF coverage, if that&#x27;s possible.</li>
            <li> This product is really bad.  It&#x27;s very dry and powdery; not at all what I expected.  And I use CG and Olay products regularly.</li>
            <li> I usually wear Almay Smart Shade Anti-Aging in light.  I love that foundation.  I decided to try this because I&#x27;m tanning and will need a bit of a darker foundation in a couple more weeks.  I ordered creamy natural and it&#x27;s just one-shade darker than my normal &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; that I get.  The first time I applied it I put way too much on my hand.  I think I pumped it 3 times.  Don&#x27;t do that.  Start with one pump.  I wiped the majority of it on a towel and wasted it because it is so smooth and a little goes a long way.  I mixed a little of it with my existing foundation to match the color to my skin a little better, and it does a fantastic job evening out my skin tone and giving me a flawless look.  I&#x27;m very happy with the way it applies and appears.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how good it looks when I&#x27;m a bit darker from tanning.  It looks a little heavier than Almay, but that could just be the tint not matching me perfectly.  I love Olay products and this one appears to be a winner for me.</li>
            <li> I found this to be greasy and stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I received this foundation to try as part of group that tries new products.  Olay Covergirl tone Rehab foundation is great!  The price is fantastic and it has the anti-aging properties build right into the foundation!  It hydrates and improves skin tone over time.  It comes it 14 shades too so I was able to match my skin tone perfectly. I don&#x27;t have to put a moisturizer on my face before either.  I Love the fact that while wearing foundation it is improving what&#x27;s underneath.  It really does make my skin look better.  Every night when I take it off my skin looks great.  What a change from regular foundation! Thanks Covergirl and Olay for another fantastic product.  I&#x27;m going to keep using this everyday.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. It doesnt look like a mask like some of the other foundations out there. I ran out and needed some and didn&#x27;t feel like driving 20 miles to town to get it. Just ordered it from Amazon and it was here 2 days later! Goes on smoothly and doesnt settle into the fine lines on your face and add age to it. I highly recommend trying it if you are on the fence about it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Goes on smooth, hardly looks like I&#x27;m wearing makeup, and has a nice smell. I&#x27;m really glad I bought this, and will be re ordering.</li>
