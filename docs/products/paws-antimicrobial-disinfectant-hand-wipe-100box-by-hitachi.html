            <li>but they really do a great job of cleaning up.</li>
            <li>These work as they should and smell great.</li>
            <li>I find it pleasant, but some may not like it.</li>
            <li>Fair warning: if you cannot tolerate anything with a fragrance you&#x27;ll need to bypass these as the ingredients do list aloe vera and \\&quot;fragrance.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>they good</li>
            <li>I was attracted to the price of this and the fact that it had received good reviews.  </li>
            <li>Good product to fight against the flu...</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>The price per piece is reasonably good.  </li>
            <li>Great product, excellent price and sized right.  </li>
            <li>Just okay!  </li>
            <li>Nice and moist.</li>
            <li>but it is NOT the sticky kind that leaves any kind of residue.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Price is nice too.</li>
            <li>They are effective.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I believe they are effective.</li>
            <li>Nice sized moist wipe.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and it is very cost effective and does a great job.</li>
            <li>I do wish they were more cloth-like though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I want to be able to disinfect my hands, arm rests, etc.  </li>
            <li>There are better wipes out there.</li>
            <li>I reminds me of spilling perfume on your hands and not being able to get it off.  </li>
            <li>The individual size is perfect for travel</li>
            <li>Be sure to carry creams or lotions though.</li>
            <li>NO comparison to germ X wipes they are top of the line.  </li>
            <li>Got these as so many times the gym runs out of cleaner</li>
            <li>Nice to have in the backpack or purse or to clean up on the hiking trail.</li>
            <li>Also nice for purse to clean hands on the go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While these hand wipes are very affordable, I would say you are definitely better off spending more to purchase either wetnaps, which are good or germ-X wipes, which are excellent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are Fantastic for many purposes.</li>
            <li>very handy to have these at all times with two young kids.</li>
            <li>They are not overly moist and are quite strong.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m fine with it.  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>but it works just fine to get the alcohol on your hands to kill germs.  </li>
            <li>easy to take in bag and keep hand clean.</li>
            <li>Handy, economical, just right for diabetics and for cleaning pierced ears and earrings.</li>
            <li>It is great to have whenever you need to clean your hands and are not near a sink with soap.  </li>
            <li>I use them in the car to clean my hands after pumping gas or anything else that needs a quick cleanup when on the road.  </li>
            <li>A lot had said the sent is not bad</li>
            <li>They dry quickly and the smell is not that pleasant.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We will probably go through these quickly because you&#x27;d need about 2 or 3 of them to do the work of one of the hand wipes we&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product,works very good when cleaning up after our peaple are through interveiwing clients that are sick or have a contagious disease.</li>
            <li>they are just the right size to clean every surface of my hands when I return to work.&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
            <li>These antimicrobial wipes are very handy and can easily be tucked into a pocket, purse, a glove compartment or anywhere you might need one when you least expect it.  </li>
            <li>Have enough alcohol to effectively cover your hands before evaporating.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>handy to have when traveling and making stops allong the way to gas up, buy road snacks, and going into public places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find them especially useful while dining out, in the car, or after using public restrooms.  </li>
            <li>They smell kind of gross.  </li>
            <li>After my 92 year old Dad contracted MRSA in a hospital  in 2009 , I did research and learned that Alcohol is A top notch santizer.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side they contain more alcohol than most other products.</li>
            <li>I was really looking for GermX individually wrapped hand wipes, which is an exceptional product....</li>
            <li>This one has such a strong fragrance it smells like cheap perfume.  </li>
            <li>very very fragrant.  </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for a safe way to carry some strong germ killing action individually wrapped in your purse-</li>
            <li>so I keep these in a FIFO (first in first out) rotation.</li>
            <li>Now, the first thing I do when I get home, no matter where I&#x27;ve been, is to wash my hands.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more quite regularly.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Larger than most.  </li>
            <li>They are pretty moist (compared to some of the others I&#x27;ve tried, which is a plus for me)</li>
            <li>Reminds me of the ones you get at Buffalo Wild Wings to clean your hands after you eat.</li>
            <li>Classic example of  the right time to pull these out.</li>
            <li>Pouch is easy to open for my daughter who started using these in kindergarten.</li>
            <li>I discovered these have a very high alcohol content</li>
            <li>It would be great if they were a little bit bigger .</li>
            <li>Our whole family uses these from the kiddies to the grandparents.  </li>
            <li>Upon discovering that another brand of individually wrapped hand wipes recently increased in price, I began looking for alternative solutions that are more economical.  </li>
            <li>My plans to use this product will continue, assuming the price remains reasonable.</li>
            <li>After reading a lot of reviews, we took a chance on these and really regret it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands dried out OR feeling tacky in any way</li>
            <li>I felt they were moer effective ans safer than those antibacterial gels that kill good as well as bad bacteria.</li>
            <li>These are plenty big to clean your hands.</li>
            <li>Cost effective option for alcoholic hand wipes.</li>
            <li>(More like a paper and less like a fabric weave.)</li>
            <li>advised they do evaporate quickly ... can be used only once.</li>
            <li>To my satisfaction, I found this high quality product named p.a.w.s. made by Safetec.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>not only  to sterilize his bed rails and remote, etc, but also to clean my own hands after pumping gas , holding grocery carts or pulling certain public door handles,  fast food table tops, airplane seats tables and arms,  or whenever I realize I have been  or may be about to be exposed to someone or something  which may carry a virus or other bacteria.</li>
            <li>I have been using them right and left-</li>
            <li>I leave them in the hot car in Vegas&#x27; summer, and they do not dry up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are not nearly as nice as the individually wrapped Germ-X wipes but seeing as how my local Sams Club doesn&#x27;t have those any more and people on the internet want an obscene amount of money for the Germ-X wipes, these are an OK substitute.</li>
            <li>I happen to like these wipes and can live with the scent.  </li>
            <li>I like the formula as they are less toxic than some, but the paper dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This type of packaging tends to dry out if not used quickly</li>
            <li>While it does clean your hands, the scent that it leaves behind is just too strong.  </li>
            <li>she gave me several samples along with a very high recommendation.  </li>
            <li>far I have found no wipes that meet all these conditions, however these come close.  </li>
            <li>By the way, I wouldn&#x27;t use these on kids or on your face, because they sting sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re look for some soft, comfy wipe-</li>
            <li>A box last me the whole winter</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t use them often, I need them to stay moist and because they&#x27;re well sealed, individually, they do stay ready to use.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because it was much cheaper than the other brands but be willing to pay a few dollars more for the unscented ones from the other companies.</li>
            <li>The dry time is fast as well.</li>
            <li>The wipes, which measure approximately 5 1/4\\&quot; x 8 1/4\\&quot;, are very easy to use and hold their moisture for several minutes after opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>plus is that with the addition of the aloe my hands actually feel soft after I use them.  </li>
            <li>They are in a small package that fits almost anywhere - pocket, purse, backpack and unfold into an ample sized paper cloth large enough for large hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am not obsessive, but after I saw how easily my Dad became cross comtaminated by a staph infection that ultimately killed him, I became a very careful person.  </li>
            <li>They barely have enough alcohol to keep from drying out before you are finished using them</li>
            <li>When I first got them the packs are really small and didn&#x27;t think much of the compared to the other brands I received.</li>

            <li> but I find it tough to deal with; just wanted something to feel clean, not act like a cologne.</li>
            <li> I saw a news report that tested everyday items for germs, and e-coli was found in high concentrations on gasoline nozzels, shopping cart handles, etc.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Honestly, we might even return them because they are such a let down.</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like about them is the slightly \\&quot;funny\\&quot; scent they have</li>

            <li> Every once in awhile she gets a dry one, but I haven&#x27;t found any brand that doesn&#x27;t have that problem and this one seems less than others.  </li>

            <li> not some other chemical who&#x27;s safety</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an Antimicrobial Hand Wipe, but I do not really care for the chemical perfume-like smell!  </li>

            <li> /&gt;They are extremely chintzy, small, rough and dry out quickly.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>

            <li> These are meant to disinfect your hands, not clean them of dirt.  </li>
            <li> I put these in my kids lunch boxes everyday.</li>
            <li> are akin to the hand cleaners you sometimes get in those prepackaged plastic silverware packs they give out with messy to go orders.&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Cost effective option for alcoholic hand wipes. This type of packaging tends to dry out if not used quickly so I keep these in a FIFO (first in first out) rotation. Nice to have in the backpack or purse or to clean up on the hiking trail. Nice and moist. Thick and stiff material. (More like a paper and less like a fabric weave.) I will buy again when this box is used.</li>
            <li> Great product, excellent price and sized right.  Not like those mini wipes.  These have some size to them.</li>
            <li> These antimicrobial wipes are very handy and can easily be tucked into a pocket, purse, a glove compartment or anywhere you might need one when you least expect it.  I do purchase the bottled hand sanitizers, but when I use these I&#x27;ve never ended up with a mess in my pocket or purse.  The wipes, which measure approximately 5 1/4\\&quot; x 8 1/4\\&quot;, are very easy to use and hold their moisture for several minutes after opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethyl Alcohol  40% (Antiseptic)&lt;br /&gt;Chloroxylenol (PCMX)  0.5% (Antiseptic)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about them is the slightly \\&quot;funny\\&quot; scent they have that remains on my hands for a while.  Fair warning: if you cannot tolerate anything with a fragrance you&#x27;ll need to bypass these as the ingredients do list aloe vera and \\&quot;fragrance.\\&quot;  I happen to like these wipes and can live with the scent.  One plus is that with the addition of the aloe my hands actually feel soft after I use them.  The person who recommended these to me was my doctor  . . .  she gave me several samples along with a very high recommendation.  After using them, I think I agree with her!</li>
            <li> An antiseptic/antimicrobial wipe should be:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Soft.&lt;br /&gt;2. Large.&lt;br /&gt;3. Have enough alcohol to effectively cover your hands before evaporating.&lt;br /&gt;4. Should not contain sticky side-ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have found no wipes that meet all these conditions, however these come close.  Others I have tried were truly horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. They are soft-ish.  They are not paper-ey feeling like some other ones I have used but they are not quite cloth either, they are not really absorbent at all.  But they don&#x27;t feel rough.  I do wish they were more cloth-like though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. While larger than some others that I have used they are not exceptionally large.  Might wish for them to be about 20-30% bigger.  But they are sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. They barely have enough alcohol to keep from drying out before you are finished using them but they do seem to have enough.  These are meant to disinfect your hands, not clean them of dirt.  Used in that capacity they good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Unfortunately these do contain some sort of hand lotion but it is NOT the sticky kind that leaves any kind of residue.  It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands dried out OR feeling tacky in any way so I&#x27;m fine with it.  Some other kinds I&#x27;ve used left my hands feeling more dirty than before I used them due to sticky/tacky lotion content. (i.e. wet wipes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is nice too.</li>
            <li> I was attracted to the price of this and the fact that it had received good reviews.  A box of 100 wipes is around six dollars, the postage will run you about the same. I&#x27;ve become more aware of germs since a health-care professional passed on something disgusting to me merely through touch. Now, the first thing I do when I get home, no matter where I&#x27;ve been, is to wash my hands.  I saw a news report that tested everyday items for germs, and e-coli was found in high concentrations on gasoline nozzels, shopping cart handles, etc. If I&#x27;ve touched one of these, I sanitize my hands.  By the way, I wouldn&#x27;t use these on kids or on your face, because they sting sensitive skin. But on hands, doorknobs, etc. they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;ll do but not like the &#x27;G  m-X&#x27; brand</li>
            <li> I put these in my kids lunch boxes everyday. They are effective. Smell a bit too per-fumy, but the scent fades away. The dry time is fast as well. Will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Our whole family uses these from the kiddies to the grandparents.  They are in a small package that fits almost anywhere - pocket, purse, backpack and unfold into an ample sized paper cloth large enough for large hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep them in my car as well... handy to have when traveling and making stops allong the way to gas up, buy road snacks, and going into public places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These are like lens paper.  They dry quickly and the smell is not that pleasant.  I&#x27;m hoping to find something that will replace the GermX wipes that they stopped making.</li>
            <li> I put these in my daughter&#x27;s school lunch and now all the kids are asking her to bring extras for them!  Every once in awhile she gets a dry one, but I haven&#x27;t found any brand that doesn&#x27;t have that problem and this one seems less than others.  Pouch is easy to open for my daughter who started using these in kindergarten.</li>
            <li> The individually wrapped towelettes were very moist, but the little square wipes were small. I was really looking for GermX individually wrapped hand wipes, which is an exceptional product....</li>
            <li> very handy to have these at all times with two young kids. quality. I will be buying more quite regularly.</li>
            <li> These are not nearly as nice as the individually wrapped Germ-X wipes but seeing as how my local Sams Club doesn&#x27;t have those any more and people on the internet want an obscene amount of money for the Germ-X wipes, these are an OK substitute.</li>
            <li> These wipes are great and compact.  I carry them in my bag, my pockets, and in my car.  It is great to have whenever you need to clean your hands and are not near a sink with soap.  It has a moderate hospital smell to it.</li>
            <li> Great product,works very good when cleaning up after our peaple are through interveiwing clients that are sick or have a contagious disease.</li>
            <li> Upon discovering that another brand of individually wrapped hand wipes recently increased in price, I began looking for alternative solutions that are more economical.  To my satisfaction, I found this high quality product named p.a.w.s. made by Safetec.  Due to some negative reviews, I was worried that this product was not going to meet my needs. The scent of this product is not offensive.  They are not overly moist and are quite strong.  I have yet to encounter a defective \\&quot;dry\\&quot; wipe.  I find them especially useful while dining out, in the car, or after using public restrooms.  My plans to use this product will continue, assuming the price remains reasonable.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  I was looking for a wipe with alcohol as the active ingredient- not the weird chemicals in the other anti-baterial wipes.  The paper is stiff- but it works just fine to get the alcohol on your hands to kill germs.  If you&#x27;re look for some soft, comfy wipe- this isn&#x27;t it.  But if you&#x27;re looking for a safe way to carry some strong germ killing action individually wrapped in your purse- this is for you.  I&#x27;m traveling and I want to be able to disinfect my hands, arm rests, etc.  And I wanted alcohol wipes- not some other chemical who&#x27;s safety I am not totally sure of.</li>
            <li> Handy, economical, just right for diabetics and for cleaning pierced ears and earrings.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Larger than most.  US made, Be advised here is a smell.  I find it pleasant, but some may not like it.</li>
            <li> There are better wipes out there. This one has such a strong fragrance it smells like cheap perfume.  While it does clean your hands, the scent that it leaves behind is just too strong.  I reminds me of spilling perfume on your hands and not being able to get it off.  I bought it because it was much cheaper than the other brands but be willing to pay a few dollars more for the unscented ones from the other companies.</li>
            <li> With local stores always running out disinfecting wipes in the front of their stores in flu season having these in my vehicle are a must as I&#x27;m a senior citizen that can&#x27;t take chances.</li>
            <li> These individually wrapped hand wipes are serving my purpose. I want away from my sterile work space often during creating salves and creams. These wipes work well ... they are just the right size to clean every surface of my hands when I return to work.&lt;br /&gt;Be advised they do evaporate quickly ... can be used only once.</li>
            <li> Great price and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> These are great wipes, I keep some in all my vehicles, in my camper and in my backpack. Just remember &amp;#34;you pack it in, you pack it out&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> easy to take in bag and keep hand clean.</li>
            <li> Good product to fight against the flu... It would be great if they were a little bit bigger . A box last me the whole winter</li>
            <li> Just okay!  It&#x27;s an Antimicrobial Hand Wipe, but I do not really care for the chemical perfume-like smell!  That&#x27;s why I dropped a star!</li>
            <li> They smell kind of gross.  Otherwise I believe they are effective.</li>
            <li> I keep them everywhere.  I use them on the airplane, in the car, at home...&lt;br /&gt;They  are essentially alcohol wipes that last about a year in their individual packets.  I leave them in the hot car in Vegas&#x27; summer, and they do not dry up.&lt;br /&gt;No scent, no residue.</li>
            <li> These are great! I used these as a &amp;#34;take one&amp;#34; at my massage therapy booth. These are plenty big to clean your hands. I found them moist enough to do the job well and I think they smell wonderful. Thank you for a great product. Will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Nice sized moist wipe.  I use them in the car to clean my hands after pumping gas or anything else that needs a quick cleanup when on the road.  Since I don&#x27;t use them often, I need them to stay moist and because they&#x27;re well sealed, individually, they do stay ready to use.  The price per piece is reasonably good.  So I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely not usable on sensitive areas.  To do so is quite painful</li>
            <li> These are Fantastic for many purposes. After my 92 year old Dad contracted MRSA in a hospital  in 2009 , I did research and learned that Alcohol is A top notch santizer.  I discovered these have a very high alcohol content so I bought cases of them. I felt they were moer effective ans safer than those antibacterial gels that kill good as well as bad bacteria. I have been using them right and left- not only  to sterilize his bed rails and remote, etc, but also to clean my own hands after pumping gas , holding grocery carts or pulling certain public door handles,  fast food table tops, airplane seats tables and arms,  or whenever I realize I have been  or may be about to be exposed to someone or something  which may carry a virus or other bacteria. Have you ever been on an elevator looking at buttons that were all grimey? YUK!  Classic example of  the right time to pull these out. I am not obsessive, but after I saw how easily my Dad became cross comtaminated by a staph infection that ultimately killed him, I became a very careful person.  I would never want to spread any contaminate that would sicken some one else.  I always carry these in the compartment on my car door as well as in a ziplock bag in my purse. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Really tiny packets that remind me of alcohol prep pads.</li>
            <li> very very fragrant.  can almost taste them when cleaning hands</li>
            <li> A lot had said the sent is not bad but I find it tough to deal with; just wanted something to feel clean, not act like a cologne.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travelling through India</li>
            <li> These are perfect to keep in my kids pockets, backpacks, car cup holders, etc....With all the weird diseases that are going around now a days, we keep a box of these by the front and garage doors. Every time we leave, everyone grabs a couple.</li>
            <li> These wipes are smaller than I&#x27;d like.  They do the job but it usually takes two to do a proper job.</li>
            <li> Great price for disinfecting wipes for the car, office, whatever! They are pretty moist (compared to some of the others I&#x27;ve tried, which is a plus for me)</li>
            <li> When I first got them the packs are really small and didn&#x27;t think much of the compared to the other brands I received. The product itself has a smaller towel but they really do a great job of cleaning up. The smell isn&#x27;t too bad at all and I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I like the formula as they are less toxic than some, but the paper dries very quickly.  The individual size is perfect for travel and I always have them in my purse.  I don&#x27;t know if I want to purchase them again or not; I&#x27;m still on the search for a less-toxic product without fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it is very cost effective and does a great job.</li>
            <li> These work as they should and smell great. I carry extra for my friends and and give these to friends after they touch anything in public.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but is drying.  Still to keep in your car, purse, etc. its a blessing.  Be sure to carry creams or lotions though.</li>
            <li> Very small paper like wip.  Reminds me of the ones you get at Buffalo Wild Wings to clean your hands after you eat. NO comparison to germ X wipes they are top of the line.  On the plus side they contain more alcohol than most other products.</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of reviews, we took a chance on these and really regret it.&lt;br /&gt;They are extremely chintzy, small, rough and dry out quickly.&lt;br /&gt;They are akin to the hand cleaners you sometimes get in those prepackaged plastic silverware packs they give out with messy to go orders.&lt;br /&gt;While these hand wipes are very affordable, I would say you are definitely better off spending more to purchase either wetnaps, which are good or germ-X wipes, which are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;We will probably go through these quickly because you&#x27;d need about 2 or 3 of them to do the work of one of the hand wipes we&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, we might even return them because they are such a let down.</li>
            <li> Convenient for traveling and day trips.  Won&#x27;t go without them.</li>
            <li> Got these as so many times the gym runs out of cleaner and I can use these for the machine before I work out.  Also nice for purse to clean hands on the go.</li>
