            <li>It is not the most powerful hair dryer out there by any regard</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great size to keep in a regular overnight or gym bag, if your gym doesn&#x27;t provide one for you.</li>
            <li>Does the job, but it emits a light odor of electrical power.</li>
            <li>The handle folds up, so I can fit it into my leather bag when I go fishing.  </li>

            <li>and we like to go light.</li>

            <li>Very powerful, light weight and compact.</li>
            <li>I took this to the Middle East with great success!</li>

            <li>It is lightweight but unfortunately not as compact and lightweight as the Conair (top part motor housing is 5 inches).</li>
            <li>May be small but it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It folds up really small and works great!</li>

            <li>This is a great little travel dryer, does a much better job at drying my hair than my full size hair dryer at home.</li>
            <li>Worked fine first time then nothing!  </li>
            <li>I use it at home, but it is very light and when I need to use it on the road, it does not take up much room in the bag.</li>
            <li>Very good portable hair dryer,  small and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I decided to go with the longer cord and cool</li>
            <li>Wish it had a cool button.</li>
            <li>The noise level is not bad considering its 1600 Watt power.</li>
            <li>The power is good too, of course not as powerful as full size, but more powerful than I had expected.</li>
            <li>it works just fine, blows out a lot of heat and does exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li>The product has been super.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I turned it off before the unit fried.</li>
            <li>So got the VS travel size at one of the Ace Hardware super stores (saw on Amazon ad).</li>
            <li>It is a great product, travels well, and is really strong - this is not just a cheap, secondary dryer.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re only taking carry-on luggage for a 3 week international trip and this hairdryer folds and is the perfect size.</li>
            <li>Works great, just enough power but not too much.</li>
            <li>It came quickly in the mail too.</li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>It DOES work just as well, has a very strong air stream and is equally compact and easy to pack.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great travel blow dryer for anyone, because it&#x27;s very small and very light.</li>
            <li>Very good small travel hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also handy if you&#x27;re generally still damp and need to dress in a hurry.</li>
            <li>Very quiet, very light and easy to turn on.</li>
            <li>It is super powerful for it&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li>very light weight and loud.  </li>
            <li>In the 120 mode, you will not be able to use HIGH mode, but HIGH appears to work fine if you do not toggle the switch.</li>
            <li>This is a reasonably priced that won&#x27;t blow you away with its performance, but it gets the job of drying hair done fine.</li>
            <li>This little dryer has worked out great.  </li>
            <li>Great little hair dryer for traveling as the handle folds up.  </li>
            <li>Great little dryer.  </li>
            <li>this is a great little dryer.</li>
            <li>Great little dryer</li>
            <li>I tried it on 250 and could easily put on high, but I quickly shut it off because it immediately got super hot.  </li>
            <li>Very compact and light.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight, which is important to me since I have severe arthritis in my hands and wrists.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp and the unit itself stays reasonably comfortable to the touch and definitely much quieter.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday and travel use.</li>
            <li>know I shouldn&#x27;t expect much for the cheap price</li>
            <li>I like that it is very compact and light weight,</li>
            <li>It is nice if you are looking for a simple hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It is the only blow dryer I own.  </li>
            <li>I like this blow dryer: foldable and tiny, so very portable for a trip, but also good for using it at home.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a basic portable dryer and this does the job nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as powerful as my &amp;#34;big&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t blow enough air and it runs a bit warm.  </li>
            <li>Purchased as christmas present and just found out she loves the dryer is nice to throw in travel bag and head out on a trip to mars</li>
            <li>, this Conair is a good simple dryer, but it is not at the forefront of dryer technology, and there are probably many other better options out there if you will mainly be using it at home.</li>
            <li>This puts out a nice flow to dry hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>I always end up forgetting my adaptor plug so it is both easier and cheaper to just buy the right hair dryer to begin with.</li>
            <li>However, it was just right for mom.</li>
            <li>THIS CONAIR HAIR DRYER IS JUST THE RIGHT SIZE</li>
            <li>The price is right.  </li>
            <li>Been using this for three months now and it is all right.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>and I do have all the right voltage converters and adaptors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Small, powerful, and great for travel.  </li>
            <li>It is small and folds for a good fit in my suitcase.  </li>
            <li>I just wish you could set it on cool and blow as fast</li>
            <li>Works great, Small size, folding handle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and compact but it does the job and works great.  </li>
            <li>Powerful, light, quiet, comfortable, cheap-perfect</li>
            <li>This is a really great hair dryer for travelers or those with small house.</li>
            <li>Fan blows good, but heat is below average</li>
            <li>Turns out that w/ the full size plug and cord, it&#x27;s really no lighter than my normal dryer (which, to be fair, is a compact dryer).</li>
            <li>The good point is that it&#x27;s very small and easy to carry while travelling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this hair dryer for a few weeks, and it wasn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth heavy plastic housing and generous length for power cord.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the very fast transaction and shipping!</li>
            <li>It works better set for 250 volts and high power in a 125 volt outlet than it does set for 125 and low power, but it isn&#x27;t very powerful either way.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>but it does the job well, like it very much.</li>
            <li>Good little travel dryer.</li>
            <li>cuz it does get pretty hot.  </li>
            <li>My first time with ordering a hair dryer online and would do it again.  </li>
            <li>This one is exactly what I wanted - compact, lightweight, works well.  </li>
            <li>This compact blow dryer was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>So far they have both held up nicely, and are powerful enough for me.  </li>
            <li>However, for one thing, hair dryers are nearly always available in hotels, and for another thing you still have to take an adaptor for the plug prongs.  </li>
            <li>Small, light, two speeds, has a nice loop to hang it, folds for traveling, and so on.  </li>
            <li>so I just keep it out and never use the big dryer any more.  </li>
            <li>It has the ability of some larger hair dryers but is more compact.</li>
            <li>It works better than my personal hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It is the exact style of hair dryer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this dual voltage dryer for international use rather than rely on a power converter.</li>
            <li>I THINK IT BLOWS TOO MUCH AIR AND MAKES MY HAIR FLYAWAY AND FRIZZY!  </li>
            <li>I purchased it because of its pretty color but it turns out that the color posted</li>
            <li>I JUST OPENED THE BOX AND USED THE DRYER FOR THE FIRST TIME</li>
            <li>Not too *HOT* either.  </li>
            <li>The hairdryer was exactly what I wanted - almost.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted for my RV.</li>
            <li>Most of these sold in the stores now are 1800 watts, which is too much for the old houses that can&#x27;t take that much power load.</li>
            <li>My son and I took an educational tour through England, France, Switzerland and Italy with a school group.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>yet it works like the BIG bulky dryers and my friends up borrowing it:)  </li>
            <li>If it holds up as long as my last one did I&#x27;ll be a happy customer.</li>
            <li>Burned out the first time I plugged it in.</li>
            <li>Thanks again Amazon for having what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Very Nice hair dryer, I bought this because the 1500 to 1600 watt ones are getting hard to find.</li>
            <li>It quickly dries my short, fine hair without blowing it around too much.</li>
            <li>The flow is as good if not better than my bigger , more costly dryer.</li>
            <li>BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL!</li>
            <li>The cord is a decent length and rarely tangles.  </li>
            <li>Because my dryer was still functioning at least minimally, I was able to shop on Amazon for a replacement, and this time I&#x27;m trying an ionic ceramic dryer which got great recommendations and which doesn&#x27;t cost much more than this simple travel dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You end up spending more money in the long run and throwing lots of plastic in landfills.  </li>
            <li>This is a good hair dryer for travel because it is small and also folds.</li>
            <li>Since they are still pretty young, this hairdryer is perfect for smaller hands, and has plenty of power to dry even long hair quickly.</li>
            <li>I also use it regularly for a super quick blows whenever I;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li>The high speed no longer worked but this was after more than a dozen years of daily use.</li>
            <li>It has a lot of power for it&#x27;s size and easy to fit into a suitcase tight on space.</li>
            <li>the reviews were kind of divided in half; I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>After a couple of minutes, it can be turned on again, and I dry my hair some more until it again shuts off.</li>
            <li>But as long as it works that&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Nice little dryer.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this type of hair dryer for quite awhile and was surprised to find exactly what I wanted!  </li>
            <li>Light, compact and fold-able which can be carried easily in a suitcase and takes very less space.</li>
            <li>2 temps and high is too hot and almost burns hair.</li>
            <li>Happy to have a back up and have no doubt this little gadget will last 10 years or more like my old one.</li>
            <li>Very nifty.</li>
            <li>Very convenient item if you travel.</li>
            <li>Needs something in between.&lt;br /&gt;Though can&#x27;t fault too much</li>
            <li>so it dries fast regardless</li>
            <li>it is a pleasure to have a very functional dryer with ease of portability.</li>
            <li>and I ordered the Babylisspro TT Tourmaline Titanium Travel Dryer - which I really like.</li>
            <li>I really like the Conair 1600 Watt hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>That would be really helpful.</li>
            <li>I am very please with this product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very inexpensive</li>
            <li>It is very compact and portable that i can bring it anywhere</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t really occupy too much in your cabinets.</li>
            <li>It folds, making it very compact.</li>
            <li>one if functional (has been using since a month), but looks very flimsy.</li>
            <li>I would certainly highly recommend this purchase to anyone!      </li>
            <li>One reason we chose it is that we are in a house with older wiring and this is less powerful than most.</li>
            <li>It has held up really well in the work environment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s promised, a small, handy traveling blowdryer that doesn&#x27;t take up space, is lightweight and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>This is definitely NOT user friendly - to change fan speed, you have to stop drying, turn the dryer, move the switch, turn the dryer, and resume drying.</li>
            <li>Nice little hairdryer!  </li>
            <li>This seems like it will do a perfectly adequate job as a hair dryer, but I like to pack LIGHT, and this is a little bit bigger/heavier than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Not only great for travel or other away from home uses,but I think it would be fine for everyday use.</li>
            <li>This does the business with minimum demand for luggage space and perfectly adequate for maintaining an adult and professional appearance.</li>
            <li>Its really small and handy..</li>
            <li>A nice, small hair dryer.</li>
            <li>While the dryer does not dry hair at high speed, it gets the job done in a reasonable amount of time that makes it worth it.</li>
            <li>you can fold down the top of dryer to make it easier to transport.</li>
            <li>Love the fact it folds down.</li>
            <li>I wish I had paid more and purchased one that had a slightly longer barrel.</li>
            <li>/ pay more, if I could find a machine of equal performance that would last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re aware of that and switch it to the opposite setting than you would expect (250 in US, 125 for higher voltages)</li>
            <li>This dryer actually dries my hair much better than the Revlon dryer which was much larger and heavier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 1600 Watt is the maximum for international use; many of her fellow students were unaware of that</li>
            <li>The unit should only be put on low in 250 (which is actually high ,twice the voltage means more energy at lo setting),when</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Conair Product.</li>
            <li>On the 125v setting, which is for use in the US, I can not switch to High setting.  </li>
            <li>The disadvantage is that you cant use it on the high in 240 voltage.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>high heat level did not work.</li>
            <li>When I travelled, I found the high speed switch doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>So, I never use the high setting.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Adjustable heat and adjustable blow power (high low)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for those looking for a truly compact travel hairdryer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going on HIGH.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li>have only used it a couple times so far, but I had another Conair dryer which is still good after 2.5 years (unlike Revlone which broke after half a year).</li>
            <li>Once that&#x27;s solved, however, the hot setting is quite strong and should make short work of drying even long hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the compact size to store away and takes up little space</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Simple, but sufficiently powerful for its size</li>
            <li>When I travel, my friends often laugh at how tiny and beat up my dryer is...</li>
            <li>New dryer will not work on high setting when set on US voltage of 125.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s small and quiet when it blows warm air.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The new electrical code calls for the bathroom outlet to be on a dedicated circuit (a circuit all by itself).</li>
            <li>/&gt;In theory a dual-voltage hair dryer would nonetheless be useful to me, as I am American, I live in London, and I frequently travel to continental Europe.  </li>
            <li>This gets your skin dry quickly.</li>
            <li>but the high setting gets too hot, while low setting isn&#x27;t hot enough.</li>
            <li>MY \\&quot;GREAT DEPRESSION ERA\\&quot; MOM WAS USING A SMALL, VERY OLD HAIR DRYER WITH BLACK ELECTRICAL TAPE HOLDING IT</li>
            <li>Glad to have it as the hotel one was not very powerful and had a short cord.  </li>
            <li>It is tiny and strong but will not burn skin as long as you keep it moving.</li>
            <li>This piece of trash turned on, began getting hot, and blew air for ONE second before burning out and ceasing operation.  </li>
            <li>It needs to fit in a small diaper bag and be strong enough to heat the appliance at the high setting but not burn his skin at the low setting.</li>
            <li>The slow speed is mild, but probably not enough for the wet hair right after shower, but is good for smoothing a midum wet hair.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap, slightly flimsy product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>you have long, thick hair, I would recommend looking for a more powerful dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being on the small side, this would make for a good dryer to take on trips due to its compactness.</li>
            <li>Cheap little hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I only wish it had a little more power, but I&#x27;ll take size over power.  </li>
            <li>However, the HIGH setting is a little strong for me, as I have very short hair, and my hair blows all over the place.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this hair dryer a short while ago and, thus far, it has worked very well for my needs.  </li>
            <li>clear, it lights up at night and has snooze alarm.  </li>
            <li>So far it has lived up to all my expectations.</li>
            <li>Been looking everywhere for a replacement for my old one.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this unit to replace an old dryer that quit working.</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t so loud and if it came with the concentrator attachment, then I wouldn&#x27;t be considering returning it.</li>
            <li>Conair 1600 watt travel dryer is very compact and lightweight but the cord is just too short for me-less than 5 ft.-</li>
            <li>After trying it out I found it does work rather unexpectedly well.  </li>
            <li>Not too loud.  </li>
            <li>I have an old folding dryer that I&#x27;ve used for YEARS.</li>
            <li>I bought this Conair 1600 in hopes that it would work as well as my old beater...</li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised considering there was a rubber hook to hang the hair dryer</li>
            <li>It is small but powerful and exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>However, the low setting on this dryer isn&#x27;t quite powerful enough.  </li>
            <li>Small, lightweight, and powerful - this blow drier was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>The only negative thing I can say that the supplier was slow in shipping it, but I&#x27;m very happy with the dryer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, folds down and is great to pack for a trip instead of your big hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>This was selected to be small and not take much room in his luggage so in that respect, it is perfectly adequate for travel abroad.</li>
            <li>it was small and easy to pack.</li>
            <li>Seems to work well and will be easy to pack because of the small size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, easy to carry</li>
            <li>Two and a half years is not a bad lifetime for a blow dryer, but I&#x27;ve had dryers function for longer than his.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems you have to make a choice of the most lightweight and compact (Conair), less compact with longer cord, or more expensive (Babyliss).</li>
            <li>A little loud but works just fine for vacations and short weekend trips.</li>
            <li>At 125v it is supposed to operate on both Low and High.  </li>
            <li>I called customer service at Conair and rep agreed that the switch is either defective or installed incorrectly, since at 125v it should switch bet Low and High setting.  </li>
            <li>On high, there&#x27;s an immediate burning smell and the heat coils turn red.</li>
            <li>I only had it on high for 2 seconds.</li>
            <li>With the international converter, this little dynamo dryer worked fine on both High and Low settings.  </li>
            <li>This dryer was just what I wanted, small, light, foldable &amp; powerful enough to dry my hair.</li>
            <li>Light weight and folds to a small size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small that can easily fit in our drawers or can just put it in my hand bag without a problem, unlike those bulky hair dryers.</li>
            <li>This is small but mighty.</li>
            <li>The fast blowing speed, though works fast in drying wet hair, is a little too hot..</li>
            <li>A little big for travelling, but compromises with its folding handle and light weight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m shopping for a new one now but definitely won&#x27;t go with this brand again!</li>
            <li>My fine hair doesn&#x27;t like to be blown hard.</li>
            <li>But not small enough.</li>
            <li>I have medium length hair and this thing dried it up fast and no frizz!!</li>
            <li>Very small and lightweight, so it is easy to store.  </li>
            <li>Very small and strong blowing hair dryer.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s clearly on its last legs.</li>
            <li>but when I turned it on the second time, all it did was make a small engine sound</li>
            <li>Bought to replace the old one in our extra bath.</li>
            <li>I can only assume that  this unit has been redesigned to prevent people from burning it out and they used the old shell design with the 250 on the \\&quot;left\\&quot; and the 125 on the \\&quot;right\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>: It dried my hair more efficiently and completely in less time, and, if this might be an issue, it did not tax the electric converters.</li>
            <li>Good for travel or regular use (if a simple dryer suits your needs)&lt;br /&gt;- High and low setting (the description mentions a cold setting, but I don&#x27;t believe mine came with one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this is quick and compact and stores in a small place.</li>
            <li>the unit would not let me go down to the high position,when I put it back to the way it was sent both the high and lo worked.</li>
            <li>I never take the time to submit reviews but have spent so much time on this issue that I figure I could help someone with the same problem out.</li>
            <li>i like: small and lightweight, easy to travel with, lots of power and a wide blower opening.  </li>
            <li>My old one just died but it lasted for a long time.  </li>
            <li>When I used it it was powerful for it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li>small, foldable handle, and powerful.  </li>
            <li>This is a small but powerful hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Small but powerful.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price paid, packs up small, and ought to do the job.  </li>
            <li>so I thought it would die the first few blow-dries, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s half the weight of my large blow dryer, which was what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It really shouldn&#x27;t be too hard, just flip the switch to high or low!</li>
            <li>so it does not dry quickly enough, but</li>
            <li>It did a decent job of getting my short, fine hair dry on the low setting daily for two and a half years, but over the past month it&#x27;s started to shut off only partway through my drying session.</li>
            <li>I use both the high and low settings and am very careful with storing it and plugging and unplugging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it works well, but someone without curly hair could wind up having to wet the whole head again and use the LOW setting to dry it.  </li>
            <li>and so it needs to be treated carefully and not overtaxed with running it for long periods of time on high.</li>
            <li>This dryer performed exactly like I needed it to--took up very little space in the suitcase.  </li>
            <li>I have short hair, so it wasn&#x27;t running for very long, so I really can&#x27;t say if it overheats due to it&#x27;s size.  </li>

            <li> Does the job, but it emits a light odor of electrical power.</li>
            <li> The handle folds up, so I can fit it into my leather bag when I go fishing.  </li>
            <li> It worked great on the low setting.</li>
            <li> It looks cheap.</li>
            <li> Works great for European travel but not so well in this hemisphere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fortunate to have curly hair</li>
            <li> The material does look cheap and filmsy.  </li>
            <li> It is light weight</li>
            <li> /&gt;VERY light and compact</li>
            <li> had this product before and liked it so much</li>
            <li> Liked this one so much, I bought two.</li>
            <li> hairdryer fit the bill to a &amp;#34;t&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li> and we like to go light.</li>
            <li> In my experience you are better off to just buy a cheap (£15 or so) travel hair dryer that already has the right voltage/plug prong.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful, light weight and compact.</li>
            <li> I took this to the Middle East with great success!</li>
            <li> Has a folding arm, 68 inch cord, strong air surge and cool shot.</li>
            <li> Very powerful.</li>
            <li> Very powerful for the size.</li>
            <li> but it is very powerful.  </li>
            <li> This light weight hair dryer is small, excellent for travel (dual voltage as well).</li>
            <li> Small, light and perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> First the good it is small,the whole thing with cord cord wrapped around it</li>
            <li> I took up very little room in my suitcase and worked perfectly when I needed it.  </li>
            <li> easy to carry and works as well as the big ones loved it</li>
            <li> Perfect timing for winter when the bathroom is colder than usual.</li>
            <li> Travel friendly.</li>
            <li> It is small and efficient - great for travel!</li>
            <li> It is lightweight but unfortunately not as compact and lightweight as the Conair (top part motor housing is 5 inches).</li>
            <li> May be small but it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It folds up really small and works great!</li>
            <li> Great buy, love this hair dryer for everyday use and travel.</li>
            <li> Dries the hair better than the larger hair dryer that I own.  </li>
            <li> I love bring it for travelling which is light and not taking too much space in the luggages.</li>
            <li> This is a great little travel dryer, does a much better job at drying my hair than my full size hair dryer at home.</li>
            <li> Worked fine first time then nothing!  </li>
            <li> I use it at home, but it is very light and when I need to use it on the road, it does not take up much room in the bag.</li>
            <li> Very good portable hair dryer,  small and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I decided to go with the longer cord and cool</li>
            <li> Wish it had a cool button.</li>
            <li> The noise level is not bad considering its 1600 Watt power.</li>
            <li> The power is good too, of course not as powerful as full size, but more powerful than I had expected.</li>
            <li> it works just fine, blows out a lot of heat and does exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> The product has been super.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I turned it off before the unit fried.</li>
            <li> So got the VS travel size at one of the Ace Hardware super stores (saw on Amazon ad).</li>
            <li> It is a great product, travels well, and is really strong - this is not just a cheap, secondary dryer.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re only taking carry-on luggage for a 3 week international trip and this hairdryer folds and is the perfect size.</li>
            <li> Works great, just enough power but not too much.</li>
            <li> It came quickly in the mail too.</li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> It DOES work just as well, has a very strong air stream and is equally compact and easy to pack.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great travel blow dryer for anyone, because it&#x27;s very small and very light.</li>
            <li> Very good small travel hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also handy if you&#x27;re generally still damp and need to dress in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Very quiet, very light and easy to turn on.</li>
            <li> It is super powerful for it&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li> very light weight and loud.  </li>
            <li> In the 120 mode, you will not be able to use HIGH mode, but HIGH appears to work fine if you do not toggle the switch.</li>
            <li> This is a reasonably priced that won&#x27;t blow you away with its performance, but it gets the job of drying hair done fine.</li>
            <li> This little dryer has worked out great.  </li>
            <li> Great little hair dryer for traveling as the handle folds up.  </li>
            <li> Great little dryer.  </li>
            <li> this is a great little dryer.</li>
            <li> Great little dryer</li>
            <li> I tried it on 250 and could easily put on high, but I quickly shut it off because it immediately got super hot.  </li>
            <li> Very compact and light.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight, which is important to me since I have severe arthritis in my hands and wrists.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp and the unit itself stays reasonably comfortable to the touch and definitely much quieter.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday and travel use.</li>
            <li> know I shouldn&#x27;t expect much for the cheap price</li>
            <li> I like that it is very compact and light weight,</li>
            <li> It is nice if you are looking for a simple hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It is the only blow dryer I own.  </li>
            <li> I like this blow dryer: foldable and tiny, so very portable for a trip, but also good for using it at home.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a basic portable dryer and this does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as powerful as my &amp;#34;big&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t blow enough air and it runs a bit warm.  </li>
            <li> Purchased as christmas present and just found out she loves the dryer is nice to throw in travel bag and head out on a trip to mars</li>
            <li> , this Conair is a good simple dryer, but it is not at the forefront of dryer technology, and there are probably many other better options out there if you will mainly be using it at home.</li>
            <li> This puts out a nice flow to dry hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> I always end up forgetting my adaptor plug so it is both easier and cheaper to just buy the right hair dryer to begin with.</li>
            <li> However, it was just right for mom.</li>
            <li> THIS CONAIR HAIR DRYER IS JUST THE RIGHT SIZE</li>
            <li> The price is right.  </li>
            <li> Been using this for three months now and it is all right.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> and I do have all the right voltage converters and adaptors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Small, powerful, and great for travel.  </li>
            <li> It is small and folds for a good fit in my suitcase.  </li>
            <li> I just wish you could set it on cool and blow as fast</li>
            <li> Works great, Small size, folding handle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and compact but it does the job and works great.  </li>
            <li> Powerful, light, quiet, comfortable, cheap-perfect</li>
            <li> This is a really great hair dryer for travelers or those with small house.</li>
            <li> Fan blows good, but heat is below average</li>
            <li> Turns out that w/ the full size plug and cord, it&#x27;s really no lighter than my normal dryer (which, to be fair, is a compact dryer).</li>
            <li> The good point is that it&#x27;s very small and easy to carry while travelling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this hair dryer for a few weeks, and it wasn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth heavy plastic housing and generous length for power cord.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the very fast transaction and shipping!</li>
            <li> It works better set for 250 volts and high power in a 125 volt outlet than it does set for 125 and low power, but it isn&#x27;t very powerful either way.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> but it does the job well, like it very much.</li>
            <li> Good little travel dryer.</li>
            <li> cuz it does get pretty hot.  </li>
            <li> My first time with ordering a hair dryer online and would do it again.  </li>
            <li> This one is exactly what I wanted - compact, lightweight, works well.  </li>
            <li> This compact blow dryer was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> So far they have both held up nicely, and are powerful enough for me.  </li>
            <li> However, for one thing, hair dryers are nearly always available in hotels, and for another thing you still have to take an adaptor for the plug prongs.  </li>
            <li> Small, light, two speeds, has a nice loop to hang it, folds for traveling, and so on.  </li>
            <li> so I just keep it out and never use the big dryer any more.  </li>
            <li> It has the ability of some larger hair dryers but is more compact.</li>
            <li> It works better than my personal hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It is the exact style of hair dryer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this dual voltage dryer for international use rather than rely on a power converter.</li>
            <li> I THINK IT BLOWS TOO MUCH AIR AND MAKES MY HAIR FLYAWAY AND FRIZZY!  </li>
            <li> I purchased it because of its pretty color but it turns out that the color posted</li>
            <li> I JUST OPENED THE BOX AND USED THE DRYER FOR THE FIRST TIME</li>
            <li> Not too *HOT* either.  </li>
            <li> The hairdryer was exactly what I wanted - almost.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted for my RV.</li>
            <li> Most of these sold in the stores now are 1800 watts, which is too much for the old houses that can&#x27;t take that much power load.</li>
            <li> My son and I took an educational tour through England, France, Switzerland and Italy with a school group.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> yet it works like the BIG bulky dryers and my friends up borrowing it:)  </li>
            <li> If it holds up as long as my last one did I&#x27;ll be a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Burned out the first time I plugged it in.</li>
            <li> Thanks again Amazon for having what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Very Nice hair dryer, I bought this because the 1500 to 1600 watt ones are getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> It quickly dries my short, fine hair without blowing it around too much.</li>
            <li> The flow is as good if not better than my bigger , more costly dryer.</li>
            <li> BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL!</li>
            <li> The cord is a decent length and rarely tangles.  </li>
            <li> Because my dryer was still functioning at least minimally, I was able to shop on Amazon for a replacement, and this time I&#x27;m trying an ionic ceramic dryer which got great recommendations and which doesn&#x27;t cost much more than this simple travel dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You end up spending more money in the long run and throwing lots of plastic in landfills.  </li>
            <li> This is a good hair dryer for travel because it is small and also folds.</li>
            <li> Since they are still pretty young, this hairdryer is perfect for smaller hands, and has plenty of power to dry even long hair quickly.</li>
            <li> I also use it regularly for a super quick blows whenever I;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li> The high speed no longer worked but this was after more than a dozen years of daily use.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of power for it&#x27;s size and easy to fit into a suitcase tight on space.</li>
            <li> the reviews were kind of divided in half; I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> After a couple of minutes, it can be turned on again, and I dry my hair some more until it again shuts off.</li>
            <li> But as long as it works that&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Nice little dryer.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this type of hair dryer for quite awhile and was surprised to find exactly what I wanted!  </li>
            <li> Light, compact and fold-able which can be carried easily in a suitcase and takes very less space.</li>
            <li> 2 temps and high is too hot and almost burns hair.</li>
            <li> Happy to have a back up and have no doubt this little gadget will last 10 years or more like my old one.</li>
            <li> Very nifty.</li>
            <li> Very convenient item if you travel.</li>
            <li> Needs something in between.&lt;br /&gt;Though can&#x27;t fault too much</li>
            <li> so it dries fast regardless</li>
            <li> it is a pleasure to have a very functional dryer with ease of portability.</li>
            <li> and I ordered the Babylisspro TT Tourmaline Titanium Travel Dryer - which I really like.</li>
            <li> I really like the Conair 1600 Watt hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> That would be really helpful.</li>
            <li> I am very please with this product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very inexpensive</li>
            <li> It is very compact and portable that i can bring it anywhere</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t really occupy too much in your cabinets.</li>
            <li> It folds, making it very compact.</li>
            <li> one if functional (has been using since a month), but looks very flimsy.</li>
            <li> I would certainly highly recommend this purchase to anyone!      </li>
            <li> One reason we chose it is that we are in a house with older wiring and this is less powerful than most.</li>
            <li> It has held up really well in the work environment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s promised, a small, handy traveling blowdryer that doesn&#x27;t take up space, is lightweight and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This is definitely NOT user friendly - to change fan speed, you have to stop drying, turn the dryer, move the switch, turn the dryer, and resume drying.</li>
            <li> Nice little hairdryer!  </li>
            <li> This seems like it will do a perfectly adequate job as a hair dryer, but I like to pack LIGHT, and this is a little bit bigger/heavier than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Not only great for travel or other away from home uses,but I think it would be fine for everyday use.</li>
            <li> This does the business with minimum demand for luggage space and perfectly adequate for maintaining an adult and professional appearance.</li>
            <li> Its really small and handy..</li>
            <li> A nice, small hair dryer.</li>
            <li> While the dryer does not dry hair at high speed, it gets the job done in a reasonable amount of time that makes it worth it.</li>
            <li> you can fold down the top of dryer to make it easier to transport.</li>
            <li> Love the fact it folds down.</li>
            <li> I wish I had paid more and purchased one that had a slightly longer barrel.</li>
            <li> / pay more, if I could find a machine of equal performance that would last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re aware of that and switch it to the opposite setting than you would expect (250 in US, 125 for higher voltages)</li>
            <li> This dryer actually dries my hair much better than the Revlon dryer which was much larger and heavier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 1600 Watt is the maximum for international use; many of her fellow students were unaware of that</li>
            <li> The unit should only be put on low in 250 (which is actually high ,twice the voltage means more energy at lo setting),when</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Conair Product.</li>
            <li> On the 125v setting, which is for use in the US, I can not switch to High setting.  </li>
            <li> The disadvantage is that you cant use it on the high in 240 voltage.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> high heat level did not work.</li>
            <li> When I travelled, I found the high speed switch doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> So, I never use the high setting.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Adjustable heat and adjustable blow power (high low)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for those looking for a truly compact travel hairdryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going on HIGH.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> have only used it a couple times so far, but I had another Conair dryer which is still good after 2.5 years (unlike Revlone which broke after half a year).</li>
            <li> Once that&#x27;s solved, however, the hot setting is quite strong and should make short work of drying even long hair.  </li>
            <li> I love the compact size to store away and takes up little space</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Simple, but sufficiently powerful for its size</li>
            <li> When I travel, my friends often laugh at how tiny and beat up my dryer is...</li>
            <li> New dryer will not work on high setting when set on US voltage of 125.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s small and quiet when it blows warm air.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The new electrical code calls for the bathroom outlet to be on a dedicated circuit (a circuit all by itself).</li>
            <li> /&gt;In theory a dual-voltage hair dryer would nonetheless be useful to me, as I am American, I live in London, and I frequently travel to continental Europe.  </li>
            <li> This gets your skin dry quickly.</li>
            <li> but the high setting gets too hot, while low setting isn&#x27;t hot enough.</li>
            <li> MY \\&quot;GREAT DEPRESSION ERA\\&quot; MOM WAS USING A SMALL, VERY OLD HAIR DRYER WITH BLACK ELECTRICAL TAPE HOLDING IT</li>
            <li> Glad to have it as the hotel one was not very powerful and had a short cord.  </li>
            <li> It is tiny and strong but will not burn skin as long as you keep it moving.</li>
            <li> This piece of trash turned on, began getting hot, and blew air for ONE second before burning out and ceasing operation.  </li>
            <li> It needs to fit in a small diaper bag and be strong enough to heat the appliance at the high setting but not burn his skin at the low setting.</li>
            <li> The slow speed is mild, but probably not enough for the wet hair right after shower, but is good for smoothing a midum wet hair.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap, slightly flimsy product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> you have long, thick hair, I would recommend looking for a more powerful dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being on the small side, this would make for a good dryer to take on trips due to its compactness.</li>
            <li> Cheap little hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I only wish it had a little more power, but I&#x27;ll take size over power.  </li>
            <li> However, the HIGH setting is a little strong for me, as I have very short hair, and my hair blows all over the place.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this hair dryer a short while ago and, thus far, it has worked very well for my needs.  </li>
            <li> clear, it lights up at night and has snooze alarm.  </li>
            <li> So far it has lived up to all my expectations.</li>
            <li> Been looking everywhere for a replacement for my old one.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this unit to replace an old dryer that quit working.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t so loud and if it came with the concentrator attachment, then I wouldn&#x27;t be considering returning it.</li>
            <li> Conair 1600 watt travel dryer is very compact and lightweight but the cord is just too short for me-less than 5 ft.-</li>
            <li> After trying it out I found it does work rather unexpectedly well.  </li>
            <li> Not too loud.  </li>
            <li> I have an old folding dryer that I&#x27;ve used for YEARS.</li>
            <li> I bought this Conair 1600 in hopes that it would work as well as my old beater...</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised considering there was a rubber hook to hang the hair dryer</li>
            <li> It is small but powerful and exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> However, the low setting on this dryer isn&#x27;t quite powerful enough.  </li>
            <li> Small, lightweight, and powerful - this blow drier was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can say that the supplier was slow in shipping it, but I&#x27;m very happy with the dryer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, folds down and is great to pack for a trip instead of your big hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> This was selected to be small and not take much room in his luggage so in that respect, it is perfectly adequate for travel abroad.</li>
            <li> it was small and easy to pack.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well and will be easy to pack because of the small size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, easy to carry</li>
            <li> Two and a half years is not a bad lifetime for a blow dryer, but I&#x27;ve had dryers function for longer than his.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems you have to make a choice of the most lightweight and compact (Conair), less compact with longer cord, or more expensive (Babyliss).</li>
            <li> A little loud but works just fine for vacations and short weekend trips.</li>
            <li> At 125v it is supposed to operate on both Low and High.  </li>
            <li> I called customer service at Conair and rep agreed that the switch is either defective or installed incorrectly, since at 125v it should switch bet Low and High setting.  </li>
            <li> On high, there&#x27;s an immediate burning smell and the heat coils turn red.</li>
            <li> I only had it on high for 2 seconds.</li>
            <li> With the international converter, this little dynamo dryer worked fine on both High and Low settings.  </li>
            <li> This dryer was just what I wanted, small, light, foldable &amp; powerful enough to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Light weight and folds to a small size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small that can easily fit in our drawers or can just put it in my hand bag without a problem, unlike those bulky hair dryers.</li>
            <li> This is small but mighty.</li>
            <li> The fast blowing speed, though works fast in drying wet hair, is a little too hot..</li>
            <li> A little big for travelling, but compromises with its folding handle and light weight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shopping for a new one now but definitely won&#x27;t go with this brand again!</li>
            <li> My fine hair doesn&#x27;t like to be blown hard.</li>
            <li> But not small enough.</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair and this thing dried it up fast and no frizz!!</li>
            <li> Very small and lightweight, so it is easy to store.  </li>
            <li> Very small and strong blowing hair dryer.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s clearly on its last legs.</li>
            <li> but when I turned it on the second time, all it did was make a small engine sound</li>
            <li> Bought to replace the old one in our extra bath.</li>
            <li> I can only assume that  this unit has been redesigned to prevent people from burning it out and they used the old shell design with the 250 on the \\&quot;left\\&quot; and the 125 on the \\&quot;right\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> : It dried my hair more efficiently and completely in less time, and, if this might be an issue, it did not tax the electric converters.</li>
            <li> Good for travel or regular use (if a simple dryer suits your needs)&lt;br /&gt;- High and low setting (the description mentions a cold setting, but I don&#x27;t believe mine came with one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this is quick and compact and stores in a small place.</li>
            <li> the unit would not let me go down to the high position,when I put it back to the way it was sent both the high and lo worked.</li>
            <li> I never take the time to submit reviews but have spent so much time on this issue that I figure I could help someone with the same problem out.</li>
            <li> i like: small and lightweight, easy to travel with, lots of power and a wide blower opening.  </li>
            <li> My old one just died but it lasted for a long time.  </li>
            <li> When I used it it was powerful for it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> small, foldable handle, and powerful.  </li>
            <li> This is a small but powerful hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Small but powerful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price paid, packs up small, and ought to do the job.  </li>
            <li> so I thought it would die the first few blow-dries, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s half the weight of my large blow dryer, which was what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It really shouldn&#x27;t be too hard, just flip the switch to high or low!</li>
            <li> so it does not dry quickly enough, but</li>
            <li> It did a decent job of getting my short, fine hair dry on the low setting daily for two and a half years, but over the past month it&#x27;s started to shut off only partway through my drying session.</li>
            <li> I use both the high and low settings and am very careful with storing it and plugging and unplugging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it works well, but someone without curly hair could wind up having to wet the whole head again and use the LOW setting to dry it.  </li>
            <li> and so it needs to be treated carefully and not overtaxed with running it for long periods of time on high.</li>
            <li> This dryer performed exactly like I needed it to--took up very little space in the suitcase.  </li>
            <li> I have short hair, so it wasn&#x27;t running for very long, so I really can&#x27;t say if it overheats due to it&#x27;s size.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is that it is rather loud.</li>
            <li> The only thing I am not so thrilled about is that it has a little clunky design but in terms of functionality it is difficult to beat.</li>
            <li> Actually for my son, he said it doesn&#x27;t dry as well as the Conair 1850 larger dryer, so he is still using mine.  </li>
            <li> The small size helps not make it weigh too much</li>
            <li> Its just the size to carry anywhere but the wire is too long thats the only drawback.</li>
            <li> I was with blew their converters and messed up their dryers and flat irons.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair, so</li>
            <li> So far so good,have only had it a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thick long hair, so I was at first worried about this product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like a powerful hairdryer because I have thin, short hair.  </li>
            <li> The older houses have the bathroom outlet on the same circuit as some of the other outlets in the house (the bathroom outlet shares a circuit with other outlets, such as TV, Stereo, and other plug in items).</li>
            <li> it lasts half as long as my *old* one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a small hair dryer that dried quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful enough for her long hair and small enough so it fits well in her small bathroom.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, reasonably priced, and well designed except for one unfortunate feature: when set for 125 volts it cannot be run on high power, presumably to prevent blowing it out on this setting when plugged into a 250 volt outlet.  </li>
            <li> It feels somewhat cheaply made and there is no way to disassemble it if something fails.  </li>
            <li> I would not buy this product if you have long hair.</li>
            <li> (so far after a few months).</li>
            <li> Just dont use it for too long, auto shuts</li>
            <li> The cord is 5 feet long and it has quite abit of heat and wind power.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> The small twist button on the handle that supposedly steps down the voltage evidently does not work.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer at my local drugstore when my previous dryer suddenly died in October 2010.</li>
            <li> Several other girls</li>
            <li> I also purchased the Vidal Sassoon Travel Dryer from Amazon and it&#x27;s going back due to the size -</li>
            <li> It is hard because you might tend to put it on high and then that would kill the equipment.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it for hair, but to dry watercolour paintings, between washes, so</li>
            <li> and it does dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much about it because I have short thin hair, but I use it to dry my thickening product and it works as a charm, it also helps dry my razors after I shave to keep them working</li>
            <li> I recommend this item who wants to get a usable little dryer for a small amount of money.</li>
            <li> And it is small, which means it has a little motor that can&#x27;t do much and is prone to overheating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered this because my previous Conair 1600 watt hair dryer finally gave out.  </li>
            <li> Now I can just whip this little travel one out to dry their short hair.</li>
            <li> Small and not very heavy.  </li>
            <li> I admit it is the first hairdryer I have owned in about 15 years, but serves to save me from the old wet hair in winter - get a cold with ease connection.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But if you just want to use it for a few minutes, to get short hair damp dry</li>
            <li> However, this little guy held up over 10 days and multiple uses a day by me and my friends</li>
            <li> My hair seems to always get tangled in the dryer when I use it - and that is really quite frustrating.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> We bought two of these hairdryers for our kids because our regular hairdryer is a bit too bulky and heavy for them.</li>
            <li> I seem to be only one of just a few people who are concerned with the cord length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not for heavy duty use, and that is obvious when you look at the quality of the plastic that it is made of.</li>
            <li> This one is what I expected .Its</li>
            <li> You can still notice the lights dim somewhat, but it&#x27;s not as bad as our older one that finally gave up the ghost.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> The one tricky part is the 120/240 switch -- be careful, it has a small arrow pointing to the direction that it is on which is opposite to which one you would think it is pointing to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and folds smaller, so I can throw it in with my art supplies.  </li>
            <li> One for when I give my small dog a bath every week, and one for me to use daily.  </li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL!</li>
            <li> From other reviews, I thought this would be extremely lightweight.</li>
            <li> I ordered this during a stay in a rehab hospital due to an injury.</li>
            <li> Hairdryer is small, but cord and plug is big.</li>
            <li> Bought and returned 2 other dryers.</li>
            <li> Looking at some of the pictures of other conair dual voltages the 125 and 250 are reversed from the way mine was.</li>
            <li> see other people&#x27;s review of this hairdryer saying it burnt out on them...</li>
            <li> I suggest it to other who want to buy it.</li>
            <li> I have no real complaints since I paid less than $15 for it.     </li>
            <li> If you have long, thick hair, it might take a while to dry.</li>
            <li> Too bad since it is compact and light.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money and hassle to return it.</li>
            <li> The only problem is the voltage selector switch 110V vs 220V is confusing and the instruction book is no help.</li>
            <li> Only negative is that it could have a longer cord.</li>
            <li> It was getting to be very difficult to hold a full size hair dryer.</li>
            <li> but it has a lot of power for such a small dryer!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use it every day, since we usually let our hair dry without heat.</li>
            <li> It has a hang clip thing and it folds in half.  </li>
            <li> Mine arrived slightly cracked</li>
            <li> The high setting is frightening.</li>
            <li> The bad is there is no \\&quot;cool shot button\\&quot; as included in the product info and a bag</li>
            <li> If you have extremely thick hair, it may take you a bit longer to dry it.  </li>
            <li> feels a little flimsy but durable</li>
            <li> Still, for so little money, I will keep it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little travel dryer....</li>
            <li> My wife just loves  this little hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this little hairdryer</li>
            <li> bucks down the drain!</li>
            <li> Mine worked when other girls&#x27; blow dryers wouldn&#x27;t!!  </li>
            <li> I was tired of taking them to my bathroom and using the big hair dryer on them.</li>
            <li> used it everyday of our 15 day tour.  </li>
            <li> Quite odd!</li>
            <li> but I figured it would at least work out of the box, for a little bit.</li>
            <li> id not have the power I expected to have!!!!</li>
            <li> This lil dryer packs a lot of punch for its small stature</li>
            <li> Just the small size I was trying to acquire.  </li>
            <li> It was small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would recommend this to anyone who needs a small reliable hair dryer.</li>
            <li> so I was not sure if it would work.  </li>
            <li> It just one day past the return policy.</li>
            <li> Small, but not too small.  </li>
            <li> Small and compact is what I wanted and this delivered.  </li>
            <li> Used the correct adapter but it failed instantly.  </li>
            <li> Called their 800 number 2x and they were not able to tell me how to make it work.  </li>
            <li> And even if it&#x27;s small it still do its job on drying up my hair.</li>
            <li> I also wanted a hairdryer that is small in size.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Small and convenient and works well.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately  a tad larger than I thought .</li>
            <li> it just works, is small, no fuss.</li>
            <li> I needed a small dryer to remove labels.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s too late to return it.</li>
            <li> My larger sized dryer died and I was in desperate need of a replacement.</li>
            <li> It only has the heat setting--no cold shot.  </li>
            <li> but they seem to be cutting back.</li>
            <li> Needless to say had wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> very small</li>
            <li> and it kicks out some serious heat.</li>
            <li> For the price and power it has you can&#x27;t go wrong with this little dryer.</li>
            <li> I looked at the instructions and it stated to \\&quot;flick the voltage selector to the lo position\\&quot;(bad wording you have to turn it ,use an America dime),and then put it in 250 for \\&quot;international use\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Does not blow very hard.</li>
            <li> Completely broken.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After some playing around I discovered that the cord at the base of the dryer seemed to be loose.</li>
            <li> The toggle switch for changing bet 125v and 125 must have been installed wrong.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, it is not cordless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t make the travel mini</li>
            <li> When I got the unit the selector was pointed to the 250 voltage setting which seemed wrong.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I hate that 2.5 translates to \\&quot;senior citizen\\&quot; in appliance years.  </li>
            <li> This was terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought almost two years ago still going strong! This worked so well I forgot to get a bigger/full sized blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Lifespan:  2.5 years&lt;br /&gt;(Mine just died.  I had a wet-haired funeral for him last night)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Functionality rating:  5 stars&lt;br /&gt;- Simple, but sufficiently powerful for its size&lt;br /&gt;- Compact, light-weight, fold-able.  Smallest dryer I&#x27;ve ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;- Good for travel or regular use (if a simple dryer suits your needs)&lt;br /&gt;- High and low setting (the description mentions a cold setting, but I don&#x27;t believe mine came with one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall rating:  3 stars&lt;br /&gt;- I hate that 2.5 translates to \\&quot;senior citizen\\&quot; in appliance years.  Nothing is made to last these days.  You end up spending more money in the long run and throwing lots of plastic in landfills.  Harumph.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Misc:&lt;br /&gt;You can tell that the machine is at the end of its lifespan when after being turned off, it makes a click, and won&#x27;t turn on again til it cools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general:&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again.  However, I&#x27;d buy a different dryer / pay more, if I could find a machine of equal performance that would last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Source:&lt;br /&gt;Dryer buyer, hair owner</li>
            <li> This light weight hair dryer is small, excellent for travel (dual voltage as well).</li>
            <li> Fried this dryer in three seconds in Italy. The small twist button on the handle that supposedly steps down the voltage evidently does not work. Thank goodness most of the hotels where I stayed had hair dryers!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my travel bag</li>
            <li> Perfect  size for travel w/good power</li>
            <li> This product is great for what I had to buy it for. I forgot my blow dryer and knew it would be cheaper to get it on amazon prime than buy one at cvs.     I have no real complaints since I paid less than $15 for it.     I would not buy this product if you have long hair. My hair seems to always get tangled in the dryer when I use it - and that is really quite frustrating. I wish I had paid more and purchased one that had a slightly longer barrel.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome! Perfect size and capacity for what i needed. Great gym dryer. Folds up and has good heat level.</li>
            <li> Good for this price. I recommend this item who wants to get a usable little dryer for a small amount of money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my boys to have in their bathroom. I was tired of taking them to my bathroom and using the big hair dryer on them. Now I can just whip this little travel one out to dry their short hair. Perfect timing for winter when the bathroom is colder than usual. Very powerful, light weight and compact.</li>
            <li> This little dryer has worked out great.  I don&#x27;t use it for hair, but to dry watercolour paintings, between washes, so I can&#x27;t speak to fizz, etc, however there are a lot of great things about it.  It&#x27;s small and folds smaller, so I can throw it in with my art supplies.  It would fit well in a suitcase/travel bag.  The cord is a decent length and rarely tangles.  It has been durable for me, even with being shoved in a drawer, banged around, etc. It has two settings and it makes a nice, even breeze.  It has a good price, too.  I can&#x27;t find anything not to like about it!</li>
            <li> This lil dryer packs a lot of punch for its small stature but i love it. It folds which makes it easy for travel. Very nifty.</li>
            <li> easy to carry and works as well as the big ones loved it</li>
            <li> I liked how compact and light this product is, it seems to be durable as well. Completely satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> just great for trael, my wife loves it</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Gets the job done.  No problems.</li>
            <li> Purchased this hair dryer a short while ago and, thus far, it has worked very well for my needs.  It&#x27;s very small and compact, making it perfect for travel or just tucking it in a drawer out of the way and the dual speeds is a nice feature.  It is not the most powerful hair dryer out there by any regard but I have quite short hair and, for this, it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have long, thick hair, I would recommend looking for a more powerful dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good; very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this hair dryer for a few weeks, and it wasn&#x27;t the best. It took forever to half-dry my hair. Then, today it just stopped working while I was using it. Completely broken. I&#x27;m shopping for a new one now but definitely won&#x27;t go with this brand again!</li>
            <li> This piece of trash turned on, began getting hot, and blew air for ONE second before burning out and ceasing operation.  It never worked again.  Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great travel blow dryer. Worked wonderfully on our trip to Europe. Loved the compact size.</li>
            <li> Fan blows good, but heat is below average</li>
            <li> The one tricky part is the 120/240 switch -- be careful, it has a small arrow pointing to the direction that it is on which is opposite to which one you would think it is pointing to.</li>
            <li> This is a good hair dryer for travel because it is small and also folds. I will use it whenever I travel.</li>
            <li> This worked perfectly for me while I was overseas. Just make sure you follow the instructions as they are written, and you&#x27;ll be fine. It&#x27;s also a great size to keep in a regular overnight or gym bag, if your gym doesn&#x27;t provide one for you.</li>
            <li> Does the job, but it emits a light odor of electrical power. Might return it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s promised, a small, handy traveling blowdryer that doesn&#x27;t take up space, is lightweight and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Recieved very quickly. I have medium length hair and this thing dried it up fast and no frizz!! great for travel and overnight!! Great price and great product.</li>
            <li> I have only had it for a short time. So far it has lived up to all my expectations. Very compact and light.The folding handle works well.Great price and shipped on time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, folds down and is great to pack for a trip instead of your big hair dryer.  I just wish you could set it on cool and blow as fast cuz it does get pretty hot.  Very convenient item if you travel.</li>
            <li> Works well. Compact unit. Travel friendly. After 5-6 weeks of use, the cord has become tangled. No safety issues though.</li>
            <li> MY \\&quot;GREAT DEPRESSION ERA\\&quot; MOM WAS USING A SMALL, VERY OLD HAIR DRYER WITH BLACK ELECTRICAL TAPE HOLDING IT TOGETHER. I GOT THIS ONE FOR HER SINCE THE SIZE WAS COMPARABLE. SHE COULDN&#x27;T HANDLE ANYTHING LARGER. SO FAR SHE&#x27;S HAPPY, BUT I&#x27;LL UPDATE THIS IF THAT CHANGES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Feb2013.  The product has been super.  Perfect size and enough watts for the job. Great that the handle folds up.[[ASIN:B000094ZDX Conair 124AR Vagabond Mini Turbo 1600-Watt Dryer, Blue]]</li>
            <li> great for travel - compact &amp; lightweight.  feels a little flimsy but durable (so far after a few months).</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product and delivery time.  My first time with ordering a hair dryer online and would do it again.  Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> This was a backup in case our hotels didn&#x27;t have dryers. Most did, but I wish I&#x27;d used it all along: It dried my hair more efficiently and completely in less time, and, if this might be an issue, it did not tax the electric converters. In addition, it&#x27;s lightweight and takes next to no space in the suitcase.</li>
            <li> Eh, it does the job and it&#x27;s compact, so I guess you can&#x27;t ask for much more....</li>
            <li> The dryer works beautifully and is very compact for easy storing.  Nice safety features.</li>
            <li> Its really small and handy..Its just the size to carry anywhere but the wire is too long thats the only drawback. Still you can go for this and the price suits. The colour is cute.</li>
            <li> Been looking everywhere for a replacement for my old one.  This one is exactly what I wanted - compact, lightweight, works well.  Great value!</li>
            <li> This compact blow dryer was exactly what I needed.  It was small and lightweight and I was grateful for the small switch that changed the wattage to be appropriate for the European wiring.  Mine worked when other girls&#x27; blow dryers wouldn&#x27;t!!  I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these.  One for when I give my small dog a bath every week, and one for me to use daily.  So far they have both held up nicely, and are powerful enough for me.  Very small and lightweight, so it is easy to store.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer for college and it is awesome.  So compact you can almost place it anywhere.  It is super powerful for it&#x27;s size. I have a lot of thick long hair, so I was at first worried about this product.  But it meets my needs and is a great buy!! Would recommend it for travel, home or college!</li>
            <li> It is on the smaller side, but this dryer works and does the trick. This is a reasonably priced that won&#x27;t blow you away with its performance, but it gets the job of drying hair done fine. Being on the small side, this would make for a good dryer to take on trips due to its compactness. I like that you can fold down the top of dryer to make it easier to transport. While the dryer does not dry hair at high speed, it gets the job done in a reasonable amount of time that makes it worth it.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly but high-speed has never worked since day one. Not worth the money and hassle to return it. BE CAREFUL!</li>
            <li> Good product. It works really good. I love the compact size to store away and takes up little space</li>
            <li> Love the size and power .</li>
            <li> Fantastic  for the money! the perfect size for traveling.....</li>
            <li> Perfect size, has power.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  I don&#x27;t have a need for a fancy hairdryer so this fits the bill.  It feels somewhat cheaply made and there is no way to disassemble it if something fails.  Comes with a GFI on the cord.</li>
            <li> From other reviews, I thought this would be extremely lightweight. Turns out that w/ the full size plug and cord, it&#x27;s really no lighter than my normal dryer (which, to be fair, is a compact dryer). This seems like it will do a perfectly adequate job as a hair dryer, but I like to pack LIGHT, and this is a little bit bigger/heavier than I thought it would be. Still, for so little money, I will keep it.</li>
            <li> nice. the handle folds in. very compact and good power</li>
            <li> Works great, Small size, folding handle. Perfect for travel</li>
            <li> Bought this for traveling and it broke after one use. And it&#x27;s too late to return it. Maybe I just got a defective one, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this during a stay in a rehab hospital due to an injury. It arrived as promised. It works great and the folding handle makes storage a snap. The noise level is not bad considering its 1600 Watt power. The only problem is the voltage selector switch 110V vs 220V is confusing and the instruction book is no help.I figured it out by trial and error.Not only great for travel or other away from home uses,but I think it would be fine for everyday use.Nice smooth heavy plastic housing and generous length for power cord.I highly recommend this Conair Product.</li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;m really impressed with this hairdryer! It has fantastic power, comparable to a full sized dryer and is so lightweight and compact! I bought it for travel, but I will definitely start using it as my regular hairdryer after the trip. Unbeatable price too!</li>
            <li> I bought this for travel overseas.  Thank goodness I tested it as soon as I received it, I had considered just packing it.  It didn&#x27;t work, and was totally unusable.  The toggle switch for changing bet 125v and 125 must have been installed wrong.  On the 125v setting, which is for use in the US, I can not switch to High setting.  It will only go into Low.  At 125v it is supposed to operate on both Low and High.  Only at 250v is it supposed to be kept on Low setting.  I thought maybe they had just reversed toggle by mistake so the 250 was actually the 125v.  I tried it on 250 and could easily put on high, but I quickly shut it off because it immediately got super hot.  Very disappointing.  I called customer service at Conair and rep agreed that the switch is either defective or installed incorrectly, since at 125v it should switch bet Low and High setting.  Love Amazon return policy, but think I&#x27;ll get a refund because I don&#x27;t trust that the next one won&#x27;t have the same problem.  Too bad since it is compact and light.</li>
            <li> Great product and transaction.</li>
            <li> powerful, compact and functional perfect for travel</li>
            <li> Love this! Very light &amp; easy to handle. Has 2 settings which is good. Great for traveling!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, fast shipping</li>
            <li> great to travel with and if you are on the go! i used this for a cruise and a weekend get away with the girls</li>
            <li> The most useless product ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product based on a review in a women&#x27;s magazine which claimed it was cordless (I was going sailing and would not have electricity).  Needless to say, it is not cordless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In theory a dual-voltage hair dryer would nonetheless be useful to me, as I am American, I live in London, and I frequently travel to continental Europe.  However, for one thing, hair dryers are nearly always available in hotels, and for another thing you still have to take an adaptor for the plug prongs.  In my experience you are better off to just buy a cheap (£15 or so) travel hair dryer that already has the right voltage/plug prong.  I always end up forgetting my adaptor plug so it is both easier and cheaper to just buy the right hair dryer to begin with.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for traveling.  I used mine in Costa Rica with no issues.  Glad to have it as the hotel one was not very powerful and had a short cord.  Hairdryer is small, but cord and plug is big.</li>
            <li> Just the small size I was trying to acquire.  I only wish it had a little more power, but I&#x27;ll take size over power.  The dryer does have a 125/250 switch for over-seas use.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can say that the supplier was slow in shipping it, but I&#x27;m very happy with the dryer.  It&#x27;s nice and compact (the folding handle works great, too!) and throws out plenty of heat and air for me.  The cord is nice and long also, which is a good feature that I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is perfect.  I use a compact hairdryer at home, but it is also terrific for travel.  Good amount of power....easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is nice if you are looking for a simple hair dryer. It does its job pretty nicely. The dual voltage option is a plus as you can use it anywhere in the world. A little big for travelling, but compromises with its folding handle and light weight. The disadvantage is that you cant use it on the high in 240 voltage. It is hard because you might tend to put it on high and then that would kill the equipment.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom. She&#x27;d been looking for one of these for a while and was very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Works well for traveling. LOVE that it folds to save room when packing.</li>
            <li> We bought two of these hairdryers for our kids because our regular hairdryer is a bit too bulky and heavy for them. Since they are still pretty young, this hairdryer is perfect for smaller hands, and has plenty of power to dry even long hair quickly. It&#x27;s also very lightweight, which makes it great for travel. Lightweight, plenty of power, easy to hold. All in all, a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Great buy, love this hair dryer for everyday use and travel.</li>
            <li> This dryer performed exactly like I needed it to--took up very little space in the suitcase.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very good small travel hair dryer.</li>
            <li> just what I was looking for.  Small, light, two speeds, has a nice loop to hang it, folds for traveling, and so on.  Especially nice with the Amazon rewards coupon.  It was shipped to my home at no charge.</li>
            <li> great for traveling!!!</li>
            <li> It was surprisingly awesome.  It works.  It has a hang clip thing and it folds in half.  Yay</li>
            <li> This is a nice little hair dryer. It is very lightweight, which is important to me since I have severe arthritis in my hands and wrists. It was getting to be very difficult to hold a full size hair dryer. The power is good too, of course not as powerful as full size, but more powerful than I had expected. Works well.</li>
            <li> Actually for my son, he said it doesn&#x27;t dry as well as the Conair 1850 larger dryer, so he is still using mine.  This was selected to be small and not take much room in his luggage so in that respect, it is perfectly adequate for travel abroad.</li>
            <li> Cheap little hair dryer. Works okay but the high setting gets too hot, while low setting isn&#x27;t hot enough. Needs something in between.&lt;br /&gt;Though can&#x27;t fault too much cause it&#x27;s so low cost</li>
            <li> I took the dryer on a recent trip and still had it in the box.  I took up very little room in my suitcase and worked perfectly when I needed it.  I have short hair, so it wasn&#x27;t running for very long, so I really can&#x27;t say if it overheats due to it&#x27;s size.  I loved it!!</li>
            <li> This is a cheap, slightly flimsy product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note there is a voltage selector (for 250 vs. 120 volts). In the 120 mode, you will not be able to use HIGH mode, but HIGH appears to work fine if you do not toggle the switch.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.  Folds nicely, puts out lots of air.  Great value.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect travel size and has plenty of power. I have fine hair so it dries fast regardless but this is quick and compact and stores in a small place.</li>
            <li> Great little hair dryer for traveling as the handle folds up.  My hair is short so I just keep it out and never use the big dryer any more.  Just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Nice little dryer. Just dont use it for too long, auto shuts</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit to replace an old dryer that quit working. It is excellent. Light weight and folds to a small size. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> id not have the power I expected to have!!!!</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer! Very quiet, very light and easy to turn on. Price also is great. The only thing I am not so thrilled about is that it has a little clunky design but in terms of functionality it is difficult to beat. So much better then Andis Micro!</li>
            <li> It has the ability of some larger hair dryers but is more compact. it is a pleasure to have a very functional dryer with ease of portability.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the very fast transaction and shipping! Got it just intime for christmas as planned. Item was very nice.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thanks Again</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 1 month back. It a pretty good hair drier. Light, compact and fold-able which can be carried easily in a suitcase and takes very less space. Optimum Power. I am quite satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought to replace the old one in our extra bath. It works better than my personal hair dryer.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer pointed out, the voltage converter is installed backward. If you&#x27;re aware of that and switch it to the opposite setting than you would expect (250 in US, 125 for higher voltages) then it seems to work fine. Nice portable lightweight design.</li>
            <li> Small, light and perfect for travel. I also use it regularly for a super quick blows whenever I;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li> It is the exact style of hair dryer i like: small and lightweight, easy to travel with, lots of power and a wide blower opening.  Perfect!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and compact but it does the job and works great.  Just right to put away in the drawer and is very handy for travel.</li>
            <li> We got this for a guest room, but the guests who use it ending up wanting one for themselves.  Good for travel as well, of course.</li>
            <li> My larger sized dryer died and I was in desperate need of a replacement. I was glad to find this compact Conair as they&#x27;re great for travel and space savers.  This dryer actually dries my hair much better than the Revlon dryer which was much larger and heavier.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp and the unit itself stays reasonably comfortable to the touch and definitely much quieter.</li>
            <li> Thought it was a 12 volt that you could use in the car in Alaska to defrost the windshield.  Returning it.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is nicely compact and the price is great, but the dryer is very basic and \\&quot;screams\\&quot; like a hotel dryer.  It only has the heat setting--no cold shot.  I strongly believe it needs to come with the attachment that allows you to concentrate the flow.  If it wasn&#x27;t so loud and if it came with the concentrator attachment, then I wouldn&#x27;t be considering returning it.</li>
            <li> This worked great in Ireland and London. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this dual voltage dryer for international use rather than rely on a power converter. Several other girls I was with blew their converters and messed up their dryers and flat irons.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loves it .</li>
            <li> Nice compact hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smallish. The low setting didn&#x27;t have enough heat. My fine hair doesn&#x27;t like to be blown hard. It was small. But not small enough. However, it was just right for mom. So she got this and I ordered the Babylisspro TT Tourmaline Titanium Travel Dryer - which I really like.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a small hair dryer that dried quickly.  This one does it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to take on vacation with us. it was small and easy to pack. When I used it it was powerful for it&#x27;s small size.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep it in my bag to take with us the next time we go somewhere.</li>
            <li> THIS USED TO BE A GREAT BLOW DRYER, BUT SOMETHING HAS CHANGED.  I THINK IT BLOWS TOO MUCH AIR AND MAKES MY HAIR FLYAWAY AND FRIZZY!  BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little travel dryer....very light weight and loud.  The handle folds up, so I can fit it into my leather bag when I go fishing.  That&#x27;s what I bought it for....and it does dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product cause the reviews were kind of divided in half; I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used it, it blew off. I don&#x27;t know what happened but it&#x27;s not working.&lt;br /&gt;And I used it in USA in USA voltage.&lt;br /&gt;Why?!?!?!?!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because my previous Conair 1600 watt hair dryer finally gave out.  The high speed no longer worked but this was after more than a dozen years of daily use. Loved that dryer.  This one seems comparable in size, wattage and style.  One fault would be where the switch placement is on this one.  Its on the outside of the handle and you have to turn the dryer in your hand to turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it lasts half as long as my *old* one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this to anyone who needs a small reliable hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Very good portable hair dryer,  small and comfortable. Very powerful.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well and will be easy to pack because of the small size.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my trip to Italy. It worked great on the low setting. The high setting is frightening. On high, there&#x27;s an immediate burning smell and the heat coils turn red. I only had it on high for 2 seconds. Luckily I turned it off before the unit fried. It&#x27;s nice an compact for travel so I will keep this for future overseas trips.</li>
            <li> This is a great little travel dryer, does a much better job at drying my hair than my full size hair dryer at home. So compact and lightweight.</li>
            <li> Met my needs for traveling in England. It is small and efficient - great for travel! Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is perfect for travel and every day use.  It is small but powerful and exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I really like the Conair 1600 Watt hair dryer.  Obviously it is an easy traveler because of the folding handle, but more than that, it does a great job drying my hair.  If you have extremely thick hair, it may take you a bit longer to dry it.  My hair is very fine and it dries in no time at all.  It is the only blow dryer I own.  In addition, it is a good buy.  I priced it at other stores and Amazon provided the best deal.</li>
            <li> Does not blow very hard.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and works well!</li>
            <li> I never take the time to submit reviews but have spent so much time on this issue that I figure I could help someone with the same problem out. I seem to be only one of just a few people who are concerned with the cord length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Conair 1600 watt travel dryer is very compact and lightweight but the cord is just too short for me-less than 5 ft.- I am 5ft. 10in. tall and need a cord that if I had to plug into a wall outlet (esp when no outlet is close to the bath mirror) I could reach the top of my head without crouching. That means I need a cord about 66 or 67 inches or so. My last Conair travel dryer had a cord of 68 inches but they seem to be cutting back. So I returned this one (after returning one from Revlon for the same reason) and after a lot of searching found that the Vidal Sassoon and Babyliss dryers seem to have the longest cords. So got the VS travel size at one of the Ace Hardware super stores (saw on Amazon ad). Has a folding arm, 68 inch cord, strong air surge and cool shot. It is lightweight but unfortunately not as compact and lightweight as the Conair (top part motor housing is 5 inches). But it&#x27;s lightweight enough so I&#x27;ll keep this one. I am using it for both regular and travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems you have to make a choice of the most lightweight and compact (Conair), less compact with longer cord, or more expensive (Babyliss). I decided to go with the longer cord and cool shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon in their specifications should begin noting cord length for all dryers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great travel blow dryer for anyone, because it&#x27;s very small and very light. It quickly dries my short, fine hair without blowing it around too much. I hang it on a lightweight sticky-back hook under the bathroom sink - so handy!</li>
            <li> A lot a power for a travel item</li>
            <li> I used to have an even smaller one that finally gave out.  Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t make the travel mini I used to use any more.  This is the smallest dryer I could find, and it works great.  I just wish someone would make one that doesn&#x27;t require plugging in.  That would be really helpful.</li>
            <li> Works good. Has a switch between 110 and 220V modes. Compact size, folding handle. Perfect for travelling.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it a couple times so far, but I had another Conair dryer which is still good after 2.5 years (unlike Revlone which broke after half a year). So I hope this one will last too.</li>
            <li> I am very please with this product.  Dries the hair better than the larger hair dryer that I own.  Was the perfect size to fit in my suit case. Am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Good little travel dryer. Folds and opens with ease. The flow is as good if not better than my bigger , more costly dryer.</li>
            <li> May be small but it works perfectly. Very powerful for the size. Excellent price/quality ratio. Wish it had a cool button.</li>
            <li> Compact and easy to use when traveling</li>
            <li> Wife uses this almost every second day. We used it on our trip to Europe and it worked great. dual voltage makes it a universal dryer..</li>
            <li> I purchased it because of its pretty color but it turns out that the color posted is misleading. The actual color is darker which I don&#x27;t like. It&#x27;s also noisy to me. It looks cheap. The good point is that it&#x27;s very small and easy to carry while travelling.</li>
            <li> Small, powerful, and great for travel.  My only suggested improvement would be a retractable cord.</li>
            <li> small, foldable handle, and powerful.  last one lasted about 10 years.  I expect the same from this one, but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Great for everyday and travel use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my trip to Ireland last summer.  I have pretty thick hair, so drying it is always a challenge.  However, this little guy held up over 10 days and multiple uses a day by me and my friends (also works well now as a spare dryer for house guests).</li>
            <li> Excellent for traveling.  It folds up real nice and fits great in your suitcase and doesn&#x27;t take up hardly any space when packed.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, reasonably priced, and well designed except for one unfortunate feature: when set for 125 volts it cannot be run on high power, presumably to prevent blowing it out on this setting when plugged into a 250 volt outlet.  It works better set for 250 volts and high power in a 125 volt outlet than it does set for 125 and low power, but it isn&#x27;t very powerful either way.  Works great for European travel but not so well in this hemisphere.</li>
            <li> I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s small and quiet when it blows warm air.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for traveling, but I am using at home.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> very small but it does the job well, like it very much.</li>
            <li> Works great, has plenty of power and is light in weight, which is what we needed.</li>
            <li> defective and returned. high heat level did not work.</li>
            <li> I love my Elgin alarm clock I like the number I can see them nice and  clear, it lights up at night and has snooze alarm.  Like this product.  Leonora A Rice</li>
            <li> Powerful, light, quiet, comfortable, cheap-perfect</li>
            <li> I bought this for a travel hair dryer .... and I use it for my home dryer ... awesome!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer specifically for international travel.  With the international converter, this little dynamo dryer worked fine on both High and Low settings.  Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for traveling I love the fold up for storage and easing packing. Makes great gifts, for anyone. Thanks</li>
            <li> This Conair mini hair dryer is awesome. I had it before &amp; I bought it again. Nice Product. Good Product</li>
            <li> Love the compactness and how quickly it dries my hair.  The only down side is that it is rather loud.</li>
            <li> The size and power of this hair dryer is great.</li>
            <li> Works well, no problems</li>
            <li> travel size and best value</li>
            <li> I like this blow dryer: foldable and tiny, so very portable for a trip, but also good for using it at home. The slow speed is mild, but probably not enough for the wet hair right after shower, but is good for smoothing a midum wet hair. The fast blowing speed, though works fast in drying wet hair, is a little too hot.. Hope it will be improved.</li>
            <li> THIS CONAIR HAIR DRYER IS JUST THE RIGHT SIZE AND WATTS THATI WAS LOOKING FOR. IT&#x27;S LIGHT AND EASY TO HOLD. AND IT WORKS GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;WAVA BRAMLAGE</li>
            <li> Great haidryer! does a great job for travel, took it to singapore. I have many dryers this is one of the best</li>
            <li> Love it! Very powerful! Came on time.</li>
            <li> Another good item for a trip.  Small and not very heavy.  There is always one or two places which don&#x27;t have curling irons.  Great to have with you.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and folds up to store it easily in a draw. However, the HIGH setting is a little strong for me, as I have very short hair, and my hair blows all over the place.  I&#x27;m fortunate to have curly hair so it works well, but someone without curly hair could wind up having to wet the whole head again and use the LOW setting to dry it.  I&#x27;m happy with it and the price was great.</li>
            <li> I JUST OPENED THE BOX AND USED THE DRYER FOR THE FIRST TIME AND AFTER THE DRYER WAS RUNNING FOR ABOUT 4 MINUTES, THE UNIT DIED ON ME. SO, I WOULD NOT PURCHASE THE ITEM IF I WERE YOU.  CHEAP PRODUCT EQUALS POOR QUALITH</li>
            <li> This is a small but powerful hair dryer.  Mine arrived slightly cracked so I was not sure if it would work.  After trying it out I found it does work rather unexpectedly well.  It is light weight that would be handy for travelling.  The material does look cheap and filmsy.  But as long as it works that&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Have not tried in Europe yet</li>
            <li> It has two speeds setting. When I travelled, I found the high speed switch doesn&#x27;t work. After the travel, and want to return it. It just one day past the return policy.</li>
            <li> Great blow dryer! It folds up really small and works great!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer. I&#x27;ve been using it for two years now and find it comical that it is more powerful than my \\&quot;at home\\&quot; dryer. It is a great product, travels well, and is really strong - this is not just a cheap, secondary dryer.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product exclusively for travel.  It is small and folds for a good fit in my suitcase.  It is light weight but it is very powerful.  And most important it is sold at a very good price point.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re only taking carry-on luggage for a 3 week international trip and this hairdryer folds and is the perfect size.</li>
            <li> When I was a kid I owned a number of different hairdryers that were all bigger, stronger and more expensive (comparatively) than this one.  But as a (grown-up)man this one suits my needs.  I admit it is the first hairdryer I have owned in about 15 years, but serves to save me from the old wet hair in winter - get a cold with ease connection. &lt;br /&gt;If you have hair you can put in a ponytail, look for another hairdryer.</li>
            <li> This does the business with minimum demand for luggage space and perfectly adequate for maintaining an adult and professional appearance. Why spend more?</li>
            <li> Works great and very compact.</li>
            <li> My daughter is using this dryer in Spain and reports that it has worked to her expectations.  The 1600 Watt is the maximum for international use; many of her fellow students were unaware of that so their dryers have blown out.  Hers is being borrowed constantly!  This dryers is light and compact, perfect for traveling and is sturdy; it has not blown out and has done a beautiful job of drying her long, long hair!</li>
            <li> The product works well - almost like my last ConAir 1600 watt mini, with one exception. The fan control has been moved from the inside of the handle by the thumb, to the outside of the handle. This is definitely NOT user friendly - to change fan speed, you have to stop drying, turn the dryer, move the switch, turn the dryer, and resume drying. Buy the ConAir 1875 watt model instead! It has the fan control where it belongs.</li>
            <li> Small, but not too small.  Not too loud.  Not too *HOT* either.  The price is right.  What more do you need when you&#x27;re on the road?</li>
            <li> I was looking for a basic portable dryer and this does the job nicely. It fits perfectly in my carry on luggage and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about whether or not the hotels will have hair dryers!</li>
            <li> Good travel hairdryer, just what I needed</li>
            <li> This dryer was just what I wanted, small, light, foldable &amp; powerful enough to dry my hair. I love it.</li>
            <li> The hairdryer was exactly what I wanted - almost.  I don&#x27;t like a powerful hairdryer because I have thin, short hair.  So, I never use the high setting.  However, the low setting on this dryer isn&#x27;t quite powerful enough.  It&#x27;s a great travel hair dryer, though, and since I travel a lot, it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling to EU region, light weight, a must have item for who travels outside US, 1600 Watts is the key factor.</li>
            <li> My wife just loves  this little hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling</li>
            <li> Great little dryer.  Small and compact is what I wanted and this delivered.  Does a great job drying hair, no different from more sub $20 dryers.  I&#x27;d buy another.</li>
            <li> I took this to the Middle East with great success!</li>
            <li> Tried to use this while in Scotland.  Used the correct adapter but it failed instantly.  Will try to return it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this dryer very often and usually only use it for a few minutes. I use both the high and low settings and am very careful with storing it and plugging and unplugging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very inexpensive and so it needs to be treated carefully and not overtaxed with running it for long periods of time on high. It is not for heavy duty use, and that is obvious when you look at the quality of the plastic that it is made of. And it is small, which means it has a little motor that can&#x27;t do much and is prone to overheating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you just want to use it for a few minutes, to get short hair damp dry it is just fine.</li>
            <li> Perfect kids hair dryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adjustable heat and adjustable blow power (high low)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY light and compact</li>
            <li> had this product before and liked it so much I bought this same one.  My old one just died but it lasted for a long time.  Have arthritis in shoulder and the lightness saves pain.</li>
            <li> Small, lightweight, and powerful - this blow drier was exactly what I was looking for.  It works great and is convenient for travel or workouts.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect size for travel.  I like to carry my own as you never know what you will get when traveling.  This puts out a nice flow to dry hair quickly.  I would recommend this to my friends</li>
            <li> Works great, just enough power but not too much. Bought and returned 2 other dryers. Liked this one so much, I bought two.</li>
            <li> Purchased this hair dryer because I had one before and really liked it for travel.  New dryer will not work on high setting when set on US voltage of 125.  Called their 800 number 2x and they were not able to tell me how to make it work.  It really shouldn&#x27;t be too hard, just flip the switch to high or low!</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer at my local drugstore when my previous dryer suddenly died in October 2010. This seemed the best option of the limited selection available there. It did a decent job of getting my short, fine hair dry on the low setting daily for two and a half years, but over the past month it&#x27;s started to shut off only partway through my drying session. After a couple of minutes, it can be turned on again, and I dry my hair some more until it again shuts off. So it&#x27;s clearly on its last legs. Two and a half years is not a bad lifetime for a blow dryer, but I&#x27;ve had dryers function for longer than his. Because my dryer was still functioning at least minimally, I was able to shop on Amazon for a replacement, and this time I&#x27;m trying an ionic ceramic dryer which got great recommendations and which doesn&#x27;t cost much more than this simple travel dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this Conair is a good simple dryer, but it is not at the forefront of dryer technology, and there are probably many other better options out there if you will mainly be using it at home. (By the way, I never pack a dryer when I travel because hotels always seem to provide them.)</li>
            <li> Been using this for three months now and it is all right. I have thick hair so it does not dry quickly enough, but what more can you ask for for a mini turbo? For travel, it is absolutely ideal.</li>
            <li> this is a great little dryer. does what its supposed to do and for the price is perfect for occasional use!</li>
            <li> Perfect small dryer, ideal for traveling.</li>
            <li> So far so good,have only had it a few weeks but it has a lot of power for such a small dryer! It is even smaller when you collapse the handle...great for travel.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted for my RV.</li>
            <li> Light weight, works great and can be used internationally!</li>
            <li> Item is great for traveling, folds up nicely for putting in travel bag on motorcycle, 2 temps and high is too hot and almost burns hair.</li>
            <li> Love my hairdryer. It is very compact and portable that i can bring it anywhere i go. And even if it&#x27;s small it still do its job on drying up my hair. It&#x27;s small that can easily fit in our drawers or can just put it in my hand bag without a problem, unlike those bulky hair dryers. This is a really great hair dryer for travelers or those with small house. It wouldn&#x27;t really occupy too much in your cabinets.</li>
            <li> First the good it is small,the whole thing with cord cord wrapped around it is about 6\\&quot;x5\\&quot;x2.5\\&quot;,not the smallest but better than I found in stores.The cord is 5 feet long and it has quite abit of heat and wind power.The bad is there is no \\&quot;cool shot button\\&quot; as included in the product info and a bag would have been nice.Now the odd,the 125/250 setting is reversed on the unit I recieved.When I got the unit the selector was pointed to the 250 voltage setting which seemed wrong.I looked at the instructions and it stated to \\&quot;flick the voltage selector to the lo position\\&quot;(bad wording you have to turn it ,use an America dime),and then put it in 250 for \\&quot;international use\\&quot;.The unit should only be put on low in 250 (which is actually high ,twice the voltage means more energy at lo setting),when I switched it to 125 (American setting) the unit would not let me go down to the high position,when I put it back to the way it was sent both the high and lo worked.I can only assume that  this unit has been redesigned to prevent people from burning it out and they used the old shell design with the 250 on the \\&quot;left\\&quot; and the 125 on the \\&quot;right\\&quot;.Looking at some of the pictures of other conair dual voltages the 125 and 250 are reversed from the way mine was.Quite odd!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much about it because I have short thin hair, but I use it to dry my thickening product and it works as a charm, it also helps dry my razors after I shave to keep them working right so it is a plus. Very cheap too. Just take good care of it.</li>
            <li> Perfect. A nice, small hair dryer. Good  for home or travel.&lt;br /&gt;Light and easy to hold and folds for convenience.</li>
            <li> I purchased this specifically to take with me when I am traveling with only an over-the -shoulder carry-on piece of luggage. It folds, making it very compact. It&#x27;s half the weight of my large blow dryer, which was what I wanted. It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of power, but that was not an issue for me. If you have long, thick hair, it might take a while to dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as my &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; hair dryer and it works great! It&#x27;s as powerful as my &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; dryer and it only takes up 1/4-1/2 of the space of by big dryer. I love it!</li>
            <li> Very Nice hair dryer, I bought this because the 1500 to 1600 watt ones are getting hard to find. Most of these sold in the stores now are 1800 watts, which is too much for the old houses that can&#x27;t take that much power load. The new electrical code calls for the bathroom outlet to be on a dedicated circuit (a circuit all by itself). The older houses have the bathroom outlet on the same circuit as some of the other outlets in the house (the bathroom outlet shares a circuit with other outlets, such as TV, Stereo, and other plug in items).</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this dryer. It&#x27;s powerful enough for her long hair and small enough so it fits well in her small bathroom.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry while traveling .</li>
            <li> Nice little hairdryer!  Very powerful!</li>
            <li> My son and I took an educational tour through England, France, Switzerland and Italy with a school group.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to bring a compact hair dryer with me that converts the wattage to Europe.  I also wanted a hairdryer that is small in size.&lt;br /&gt;This hairdryer fit the bill to a &amp;#34;t&amp;#34;....&lt;br /&gt;I used it everyday of our 15 day tour.  As a matter of fact, my roommate and her daughter used it as well...  That means the hairdryer was used 3 times a day for 15 days straight.&lt;br /&gt;I see other people&#x27;s review of this hairdryer saying it burnt out on them... I cannot say what they were doing when it burnt out, but we had our converter to European wall outlets with us, and we never had any burning, or overheating ever during the entire trip.&lt;br /&gt;I fully recommend this hairdryer to anyone going over to Europe.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;This one if functional (has been using since a month), but looks very flimsy. Probably becauses of low weight, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this type of hair dryer for quite awhile and was surprised to find exactly what I wanted!  This dryer is very compact, yet has 1600 watts of drying power, works absolutely perfect and fits anywhere!  Especially great for travel. I would certainly highly recommend this purchase to anyone!      Geri Kessler</li>
            <li> Small and convenient and works well.  Good value for your money.  I recommend this to travelers wishing to save space.</li>
            <li> great dryer compact and does the job!</li>
            <li> Love the size - super compact compared to the others on the market. It has a lot of power for it&#x27;s size and easy to fit into a suitcase tight on space. I highly recommend this product for those looking for a truly compact travel hairdryer. I also purchased the Vidal Sassoon Travel Dryer from Amazon and it&#x27;s going back due to the size - it&#x27;s huge compared to this one. Wish I could post a picture to show the difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this to take to Norway on business trip.  Worked fine first time then nothing!  This was my third trip and I do have all the right voltage converters and adaptors.&lt;br /&gt;I had it plugged into converter and adapter, selected 220 and used on Low but when I turned it on the second time, all it did was make a small engine sound then nothing,  it hasn&#x27;t worked since.  I ended up just buying a hair dryer while I was there.&lt;br /&gt;25 bucks down the drain!</li>
            <li> I have an old folding dryer that I&#x27;ve used for YEARS. When I travel, my friends often laugh at how tiny and beat up my dryer is...yet it works like the BIG bulky dryers and my friends up borrowing it:)  I bought this Conair 1600 in hopes that it would work as well as my old beater...in the event &amp;#34;Old Faithful&amp;#34; wore out.  It DOES work just as well, has a very strong air stream and is equally compact and easy to pack.  Happy to have a back up and have no doubt this little gadget will last 10 years or more like my old one.</li>
            <li> Small but powerful.  A little loud but works just fine for vacations and short weekend trips. Folds and stores easily in my luggage.</li>
            <li> Good cte size for travellig or use at home. Powerful for its size.!!!</li>
            <li> This is small but mighty. Love the fact it folds down. For the price and power it has you can&#x27;t go wrong with this little dryer.</li>
            <li> Have only had it a couple of months but it works fine. One reason we chose it is that we are in a house with older wiring and this is less powerful than most. You can still notice the lights dim somewhat, but it&#x27;s not as bad as our older one that finally gave up the ghost.&lt;br /&gt;We don&#x27;t use it every day, since we usually let our hair dry without heat. We use it for occasions when we are in a hurry. It&#x27;s also handy if you&#x27;re generally still damp and need to dress in a hurry. This gets your skin dry quickly. We haven&#x27;t used it for travel and likely won&#x27;t, as almost all hotels have hair dryers in the room and we like to go light. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Bought this when my hair dryer finally gave up after about 15 years of use.  Since I like to travel, the dual voltage is a nice feature.  Unfortunately it is not obvious which way to turn the switch to change voltage and the instructions don&#x27;t mention it, so you have to try it out to see.  Once that&#x27;s solved, however, the hot setting is quite strong and should make short work of drying even long hair.  It&#x27;s worth the price paid, packs up small, and ought to do the job.  No attachments, just a very basic hair dryer with two speeds.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer to replace one that lasted only a year.  I use it at home, but it is very light and when I need to use it on the road, it does not take up much room in the bag.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately  a tad larger than I thought . Would return bit threw away all packing etc. It probably works fine - have not yet tested it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for months for a dryer to stick in my gym bag and take along on trips where motels might not have a dryer attached to the wall in the bathroom. Finally, this is it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hairdryer because I needed one for the type of craft work I do. What is there to say about a hairdryer.....it works just fine, blows out a lot of heat and does exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> The compact dryer I had for 10 years finally took a dive.  This one performs just as well and is a lot  quieter than my last one.  You can&#x27;t complain about the price of this one either.  If it holds up as long as my last one did I&#x27;ll be a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer to  adhere my son&#x27;s ostomy appliance. It needs to fit in a small diaper bag and be strong enough to heat the appliance at the high setting but not burn his skin at the low setting. This fits the bill! It is tiny and strong but will not burn skin as long as you keep it moving. It came quickly in the mail too. Great purchase! Only negative is that it could have a longer cord.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful for the price and the size.  However, it doesn&#x27;t blow enough air and it runs a bit warm.  I don&#x27;t like blowdryers to be this warm, because it damages hair and encourages split ends more.  But, if you&#x27;re on travel, this works out well because of the size and the fact that it folds up.  It&#x27;s great for that.</li>
            <li> Great for travel.  Dries hair quickly.  Better than full size blow dryer</li>
            <li> The product is good. Working Properly, the variable speed switch is defective. It&#x27;s not going on HIGH. Please Help !!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect little hair dryer.  It folds, it&#x27;s dual voltage, is light weight and has a great air flow that dries hair fast.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my paint shop. It has held up really well in the work environment. Definitly a good product for the price</li>
            <li> Perfect for taking to Europe</li>
            <li> it just works, is small, no fuss. i bought and used it to shrink window film</li>
            <li> Compact for travel and was the lower wattage I needed for the electric converter--hard to find!  Very happy!</li>
            <li> Took this to Europe. Broke it trying to turn the slot to switch to use there. Needless to say had wet hair.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews I figured that this hair dryer was a pretty good deal for the price. I plugged it in and it seemed to work fine but as soon as I moved it around, it shut off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some playing around I discovered that the cord at the base of the dryer seemed to be loose. If it stopped working I could wiggle it and the dryer would turn on. I was a bit surprised considering there was a rubber hook to hang the hair dryer from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I shouldn&#x27;t expect much for the cheap price but I figured it would at least work out of the box, for a little bit.</li>
            <li> I have been using this little hairdryer and I think it is value for money. It&#x27;s small, easy to carry and it does the work. I have long hair so I thought it would die the first few blow-dries, but it didn&#x27;t. So I recommend it as a good travelling device.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.  I GO TO THE GYM AND WORKOUT AND THIS FIT PERFECTLY IN MY GYM BAG AND DRIES MY HAIR NICELY.  PERFECT FIT FOR MY NEEDS.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> Great size. Awesome foldable feature. Works great and perfect for traveling. I use this as my regular blow dryer. The small size helps not make it weigh too much and it kicks out some serious heat.</li>
            <li> It is a good travel dryer, but it is not as nice as my ConAir 1875.  I like that it is very compact and light weight,</li>
            <li> This was terrible. Burned out the first time I plugged it in. I didn&#x27;t return it because I didn&#x27;t want to lug it around Thailand for three weeks.</li>
            <li> i am fully satisfied with purchases. Everything was as described. I suggest it to other who want to buy it.</li>
            <li> Had my last Conair travel blow dryer for about 10 years and used it almost every day until it finally died..:-)  Had to order another and love using it!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is a very nice size, compact, and does a decent job of drying. I like the way it folds up and is easily packed. Only wish I knew how to store the cord efficiently.</li>
            <li> Works well! Great size for travel and powerful for its size.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this model hair dryer since my last one broke.  I finally found it on Amazon.  It is so compact to use for my short hair.  Thanks again Amazon for having what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I needed a small dryer to remove labels.  It works like a charm and will be handy for traveling as well.  Great little dryer</li>
            <li> Is perfect for travelling however the writing on the handle disappeared after a couple of use. Did not prevent to do the job.</li>
            <li> My grand daughter likes this hairdryer to travel with her soccer games</li>
            <li> Very small and strong blowing hair dryer. I love bring it for travelling which is light and not taking too much space in the luggages.</li>
            <li> This one is what I expected .Its what I thought it should be and folds easily for travel .This product will replace  th 1875- watt dryer well.</li>
            <li> Pretty handy for travel.</li>
