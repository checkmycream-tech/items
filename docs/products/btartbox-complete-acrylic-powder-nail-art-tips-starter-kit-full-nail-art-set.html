            <li> This came even earlier than was expected, so that was a plus. It was packaged nicely as well and came with everything it said it would. The only reason I haven&#x27;t given it five stars is because I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I plan to this weekend. By the looks of it, I think everything will go well.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s got every thing you need to do your nails. It&#x27;s got it all and then some. Fast shipping too</li>
            <li> No directions at all with these products.  Shipping was not the best, just placed in a box. This was a gift and I can not rate the ingredients in the products.</li>
            <li> I just got this today and i love it but can someone tell me what those cards are for ?</li>
            <li> I received this 2 weeks earlier then it saod. However the acrylic powder sucks! It dries so fast I can&#x27;t even work with it. I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
