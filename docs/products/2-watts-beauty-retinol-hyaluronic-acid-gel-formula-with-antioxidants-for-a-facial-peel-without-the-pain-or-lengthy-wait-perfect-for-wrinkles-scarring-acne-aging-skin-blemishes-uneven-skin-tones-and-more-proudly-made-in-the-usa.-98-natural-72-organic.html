            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I wish I could find even strong but this works great.</li>
            <li>purchased this product with a discount, and am writing my honest review of my experience with it.</li>
            <li>but it is effective.  </li>
            <li>I am noticing that my skin is smoother and I have had people tell me I have a really nice complexion, and I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Love all Watts Products</li>
            <li>I have tried an tried to get it to work, so I must put it on with my fingers, which I think makes me use more.</li>
            <li>I was using the Watts Retinol/ Hyaluronic Acid cream for quite some time, but I switched to the gel, and it is definitely more potent.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is a fantastic deal too!</li>
            <li>I love Watts products.</li>
            <li>This item does the job as advertised--it may or may not have made me look more</li>
            <li>I am hesitant to purchase more</li>
            <li>Product better.</li>
            <li>no commercial frills but product is great and as good as anything</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt smoother after day 1 but looked better after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>It was okay.  </li>
            <li>probably will not purchase any more products in this line.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to get a promo code that included a free bottle of argan oil as well.</li>
            <li>It is not as strong as a prescription grade</li>
            <li>and it goes on smoothly and is light.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Did not see any significant improvement to my skin.</li>
            <li>I feel like this retinol serum is more gentle on my skin compared to others, and complements my skincare routine well.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;ve been doing differently is using this serum, so I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s because the serum is more potent than the cream was.  </li>
            <li>I recently did a chemical peel, and it reacted way more quickly than it has before.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say I really saw any real difference in my fine lines.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it&#x27;d smooth out the very early signs of crows feet.</li>
            <li>the product itself: very slight pleasant scent, does not burn eyes</li>
            <li>Left my skin smooth, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a nice feeling serum that sinks in quickly and leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>, my face were sooo  calm and rested, I like the consistence too not as runny than other serums, love it,</li>
            <li>I use on my face, hands &amp; upper arms (major sun damage) and the difference is quite frankly amazing.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s more gentle on skin compared to other retinol</li>
            <li>The price of Watts beauty products have been doubled over the years but I am not sure if the products really contain the nice ingredients they claim to contain.</li>
            <li>That said, there are many other brands of the same stuff that are a lot cheaper, so you might continue shopping.</li>
            <li>I DID start off with a bottle of Neutrogena&#x27;s Retinol before switching to this, the transition was seamless.</li>
            <li>Make sure to start out using it only about twice a week because it will dry your skin out a little bit at first</li>
            <li>It is not highly fragranced and very neutral in odor and color.  </li>
            <li>Product was very watery and seemed to not last long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had a couple months so far</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely dry and extremely sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Within a few months of using this product my fine lines and wrinkles became much less visible.  </li>

            <li> when this squirts it squirts in a couple different directions so it wastes some of the product.</li>
            <li> I only use at night before going to bed, after washing face with plain water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I do like their other products.</li>

            <li> if it didn&#x27;t work for dark spots I&#x27;d continue to use this, my skin is softer &amp; smoother and just happier.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t lightened dark areas, I probably needed a stronger concentration.</li>
            <li> Well it does work a little and it seems my brown spots on my face are less and not s brown.</li>
            <li> Ill stick to their other goodies</li>

            <li> The last bottle I received smelled horrible almost smoke like ..</li>
            <li> Makes my face break out :(</li>
            <li> But this one made me break out terribly.</li>

            <li> great night serum, love it.</li>
            <li> Makes my face break out :(</li>
            <li> The reason for using this product was for the strength of the Retinol. I wish I could find even strong but this works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this retinol serum every evening for a week now. I notice some skin sensitivity, which I guess means it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is smoother, tighter. I&#x27;ve noticed that I don&#x27;t need to use the exfoliator as much.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been going out in the sun (with sunblock on, of course), and haven&#x27;t seen any extra peeling. Maybe it&#x27;s more gentle on skin compared to other retinol products.&lt;br /&gt;My acne has also diminished with use.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product with a discount, and am writing my honest review of my experience with it. I feel like this retinol serum is more gentle on my skin compared to others, and complements my skincare routine well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t work for me. I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable difference. I used it up and won&#x27;t be re-purchasing.</li>
            <li> Love all Watts Products</li>
            <li> I like this product. I just got it and it goes on smoothly and is light. Also I have not had any redness. The reason I gave it a 3 star instead of a 5 star is because the pump doesn&#x27;t work. I have tried an tried to get it to work, so I must put it on with my fingers, which I think makes me use more. When I read the other reviews other mentioned the pump doesn&#x27;t work. PEOPLE FIX YOUR PUMPS!!</li>
            <li> I was using the Watts Retinol/ Hyaluronic Acid cream for quite some time, but I switched to the gel, and it is definitely more potent.

            <li> I love Watts products. LOVE them! But this one made me break out terribly. Ill stick to their other goodies</li>
            <li> Within a few months of using this product my fine lines and wrinkles became much less visible.  This product really works.</li>
            <li> This item does the job as advertised--it may or may not have made me look more like I sleep when I don&#x27;t--but it smells really weird and chemical-y and dries up rather fast.</li>
            <li> Well it does work a little and it seems my brown spots on my face are less and not s brown. That said, there are many other brands of the same stuff that are a lot cheaper, so you might continue shopping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for awhile now because quite frankly it worked and was budget friendly with no harsh or unpleasant smell... The last bottle I received smelled horrible almost smoke like .. I am hesitant to purchase more</li>
            <li> I love this product! Make sure to start out using it only about twice a week because it will dry your skin out a little bit at first but the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> I used for a month.. No redness or stinging. It goes on smooth. I like the Olay microdermabrasion. Product better. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It feels like a placebo product and it didn&#x27;t nothing to my skin.  Just nothing.  The price of Watts beauty products have been doubled over the years but I am not sure if the products really contain the nice ingredients they claim to contain.</li>
            <li> STILL USING AND DO NOT SEE ANY CHANGES...AS YET.</li>
            <li> Got this to attempt to beat down some sun spots, since using this my main problem area has faded from dark brown to - gone. I use on my face, hands &amp; upper arms (major sun damage) and the difference is quite frankly amazing. I also rub in liquid Vitamin E afterwards for healing &amp; moisturizing, it&#x27;s a great combo! I only use at night before going to bed, after washing face with plain water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the product itself: very slight pleasant scent, does not burn eyes (I rub my entire face with it, yes eyelids included) doesn&#x27;t make me peel, burn or itch as the Retinol does some people and I have very fair irritation prone skin. I can&#x27;t do foundation at all, just mineral powder occasionally to give an idea of my skin&#x27;s crabbiness with foreign substances on it. I DID start off with a bottle of Neutrogena&#x27;s Retinol before switching to this, the transition was seamless. My skin loves this stuff and drinks it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if it didn&#x27;t work for dark spots I&#x27;d continue to use this, my skin is softer &amp; smoother and just happier.</li>
            <li> This is a nice feeling serum that sinks in quickly and leaves my skin soft.  It is not highly fragranced and very neutral in odor and color.  It leaves my skin feeling softer and moisturized.  I was pleased to get a promo code that included a free bottle of argan oil as well.</li>
            <li> Product was very watery and seemed to not last long. Did not see any significant improvement to my skin. I do like their other products.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It is not as strong as a prescription grade but it is effective.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> no commercial frills but product is great and as good as anything 2 x or 3 x the price.&lt;br /&gt;my skin loves it!</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry and extremely sensitive.  I love this stuff.  I tried it because of the ratings.  I noticed a difference after a couple of weeks.  My skin felt smoother after day 1 but looked better after a couple of weeks. My makeup seems to glide on now.  I am noticing that my skin is smoother and I have had people tell me I have a really nice complexion, and I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s.  I will continue to use this product.  Watts makes the best stuff!!!</li>
            <li> got it yesterday and used at night before my night lotion and I slept so good, my face were sooo  calm and rested, I like the consistence too not as runny than other serums, love it, thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I loved the product . For a African American woman who is about to turn 40 . It is helping my skin to look it&#x27;s best.</li>
            <li> It was okay.  Can&#x27;t say I really saw any real difference in my fine lines.</li>
            <li> when this squirts it squirts in a couple different directions so it wastes some of the product. I&#x27;ve only had a couple months so far so havn&#x27;t seen results yet</li>
            <li> used this product for one month and saw no difference in my skin. probably will not purchase any more products in this line.</li>
            <li> love this, works great for me and lasts! referred my family and friends to this products and ones like it as well!</li>
            <li> Left my skin smooth, absorbs quickly. Didn&#x27;t lightened dark areas, I probably needed a stronger concentration.</li>
