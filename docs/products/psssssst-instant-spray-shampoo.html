    <ol>
            <li>very happy with product.</li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to wash your hair but save a lot of time!  </li>
            <li>The spray mechanism works efficiently, a plus, it also smells pleasant!</li>
            <li>This stuff is a great stopgap to help your hair look great in a hurry!  </li>
            <li>i thought that like all really good products, it just vanished!  </li>
            <li>Psssssst was great in a pinch.</li>
            <li>it is a great product.  </li>
            <li>works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>It works great after having surgery and you can&#x27;t wash you hair.</li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>i used to use this great product in the 1970&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m so happy to find it on amazon, and happy that it is still made.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>therefore it is very handy to have on hand something that I can use to freshen up.</li>
            <li>Works great, smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Or I find that after I used some hair spray it has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Works great, I love it!</li>
            <li>always good.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have the greatest smell but is useful.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>love this product!</li>
            <li>did a much better job!</li>
            <li>SO GLAD I DID!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, nothing awesome, but not bad either.</li>
            <li>I really liked it</li>
            <li>Best of all was the price--very reasonable.</li>
            <li>The smell is quite nice,</li>
            <li>I really liked it</li>
            <li>I keep a can in the apt.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>This product does the trick better than most I have tried, has a somewhat &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; scent that I enjoy, and is a good price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice smell, just strong.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to see it here on Amazon - now I can get some more.</li>
            <li>Baby powder is better.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure to rub it in with your hands and/or give yourself about 30-60 minutes before styling.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with this product, however, I was not expecting my hair to appear just like I had washed it.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that it works better if I spray it on the desired areas and let it set for 2-3 minutes and then brush it out.</li>
            <li>It seems like that gives it more time to work on the oily areas of my hair.</li>
            <li>For blowout gals this is a lifesaver and maybe even more sore for those of us who prefer to hit the snooze button.</li>
            <li>This was recommended to me by my colorist, and I&#x27;m glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>I also just chopped off most of my hair</li>
            <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming smell that makes it seem like you used aerosol deodorant on your head.</li>
            <li>I chose this over the tresume, as it seems to do a better job of &amp;#34;refreshing&amp;#34; your hair.</li>
            <li>I happen to like the version that has more powder in it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Used to use it many years ago.</li>
            <li>and I love this.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you shake it a lot before you use.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>In fact I think it made it look more oily.</li>
            <li>Love this product-</li>
            <li>This used to be just wonderful dry shampoo</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo in the market</li>
            <li>Psssssst works best if you throughly shake the can and leave the spray to dry for a minute or two before working through the scalp.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo..</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo out there</li>
            <li>is the best dry shampoo on the market!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise I would say that this is the best dry shampoo that I have found!</li>
            <li>This is easily, hands-down, the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Pssst dry shampoo has saved my hair many times!!!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to make my hair appear much cleaner, and the smell was kind of overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Would not run out of this spray shampoo, can purchase so easy on Amazon.</li>
            <li>best dry shampooo and great with blonde hair</li>
            <li>This product has a strong smell.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special, but not horrible.</li>
            <li>It will look less oily, however, which I feel is the best thing about this product.</li>
            <li>I have fine oily hair</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair clean, smelling clean, and for sure makes it thicker.</li>
            <li>Fantastic</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and it works.</li>
            <li>Works great when you just don&#x27;t have enough time to shower.</li>
            <li>I think it smells like a mild mint, and gives a cool refreshing sensation when it touches your scalp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I felt that the scent was a bit too strong and too sweet for me.</li>
            <li>This is the original spray dry shampoo and it does an amazing job of soaking up oil and refreshing your hair- even removes the smell of smoke!</li>
            <li>This is a great instant dry shampoo, it does a great job on lifting roots after a day or two without a wash and provides volume.</li>
            <li>This says it is the original formula.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time, a great dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how quick, easy and effective</li>
            <li>, I really am a clean freak</li>
            <li>My hair is fine but abundant, I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day because my hair is color treated and after I wash it it I blow dry it and use a straightener, which I know stresses hair , so I don&#x27;t wish to over wash on top of all.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo has a light pleasant scent .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for many years and really like it.</li>
            <li>For those of you who like sweet smells, this smells like mango.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t really have a scent of</li>
            <li>but it had kind of an old lady smell, so</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo has a pleasant light smell of coconut but is so fresh.</li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars because while it works well and better than anything I&#x27;ve tried so far and the price is excellent, I&#x27;m still not really satisfied with the smell.</li>
            <li>She also has fine hair and recently she got it cut, pixie-cut short, and says the product feels great and makes her hair and scalp feel clean.</li>
            <li>so a good dry shampoo is a must for me!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried it at home first, but it made my hair greasy!</li>
            <li>It also has an extremely strong smell, and it&#x27;s more of a chemical smell than a fruit smell like a regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t nothing for my fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different dry shampoos and this by far, is the best.</li>
            <li>It smells good but not overpowering, makes hair look clean, and I have been able to easily go three days without shampooing due to this dry shampoo, even with oily hair.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wait to get my hair freshly dyed</li>
            <li>This spray makes my hair looked like its been freshly shampooed.</li>
            <li>My hair looks &amp; smells like it was freshly washed, even up to the end of the day.</li>
            <li>The smell is also nice, and generic.</li>
            <li>My sister&#x27;s hair got in a candle and this shampoo seemed to make the fire catch very quickly and immediately became a 12in high flame!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, it seems to not always be consistent when spraying and runs out quickly.</li>
            <li>I spray it on right after drying my hair from the shampooing.</li>
            <li>There was a light smell which reminded me of air freshener at first, which I didn&#x27;t really like</li>
            <li>I love this dry shampoo because it is really light, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great if you can get past the smell and learning curve.</li>
            <li>I heard that leaving the natural oils in my hair would help it be less fly away and healthier, and it&#x27;s true in my case.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect miracles with this product--as in your hair will not look like it is freshly washed because what can really replace a fresh wash and style?</li>
            <li>This works great to freshen up 2nd or 3rd day hair</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, a lot of dry shampoos do</li>
            <li>about 30 minutes helps anyway to let it absorb more prior to styling.</li>
            <li>love the extra volume I get when I use this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first one I tried.</li>
            <li>The first time I got to try it</li>
            <li>Tried many instant shampoo for in between shampooing for hair that gets oily.</li>
            <li>It can be used in a week more than once and the results are the same.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care what experts say - with my cowlicks and the way I sweat, the world is a better place when I wash daily.</li>
            <li>The PSSST brand was the first one I bought.  </li>
            <li>Next I tried Suave which had much better results</li>
            <li>haha!  </li>
            <li>The smell has usually been a bit overpowering and not always pleasant.</li>
            <li>Expect an initial white residue, but it easily brushes out leaving my hair clean and full bodied.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoos, this is by far the best in my opinion!</li>
            <li>On the first day after I wash my hair, it really does add volume to my slept-on hair.</li>
            <li>It works, and is many many times cheaper, but you do end up fighting a ton of static, and sometimes I get the powder application a little uneven to start with...  </li>
            <li>had much better luck with Not Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Refreshing Dry Shampoo which completely dried up the oil in my hair as desired</li>
            <li>The less you wash your hair probably the healthier it will be, leaving as much natural oils in it as possible without stripping it with regular shampoo seems to be the best way to keep it soft, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>Tresemme Dry Shampoo is MUCH better.  </li>
            <li>Baptiste absorbs more oil than Psssssst but leave a residue and can dry out the scalp.</li>
            <li>I have tried many dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li>It really did used to make my hair have body and look good but no more.</li>
            <li>For certain, the packaging and spray mechanism is not the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still my favorite dry shampoo!  </li>
            <li>I love this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>so the only way she could clean herself was hot washcloths soaked in soap that was given to her by the hospital.</li>
            <li>My hair is very oily and the product solves the problem.</li>
            <li>I have very oily hair which must be washed every day.</li>
            <li>Both remove oil and make my very oily hair look fresher.</li>
            <li>Very thankful for this item when in a rush.</li>
            <li>Washing it every day was causing the color to fade fast.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much to absorb oil at all.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>If you really want to you can always spray some body spray or perfume on your hair after you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>(Hope that doesn&#x27;t sound gross</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work for my texture - hair was still matted.  </li>
            <li>and it was very noticable.  </li>
            <li>but it seems to cling to the oil on my scalp making what appear to be dandruff flakes but is really the product caked up.  </li>
            <li>Does leave a lot of white residue and even on my light hair, it&#x27;s visibly lightened.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Two things to note:&lt;br /&gt;#1 - the powder that comes out of this is white, you do need to brush your hair well enough to blend it in (it blends in quie nicely).  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say my hair looks and feels sparkling clean, but it certainly absorbs the oil and allows me to go out in public without shame and humiliation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other cans of this stuff, but they all leave my hair feeling like straw, or they don&#x27;t do anything to help the oil.  </li>
            <li>Like most of the other stuff out there.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this classic!</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t oily so my system works for me and my hair looks pretty healthy and not like dried up straw.</li>
            <li>It not only helps to contain the oily hair, but it makes it feel clean and adds volume.  </li>
            <li>I have thin hair and this dry shampoo gives a lift without overwhelming my fair hair.</li>
            <li>so a tried and true pony tail or bun couldn&#x27;t be my fall back.</li>
            <li>and I love it, but my roommate has dark hair and she can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>The way I use it is; Section my hair off with my hands (it&#x27;s not an exact science) and spray it directly on the root, then I take my finger tips and massage it into the scalp.</li>
            <li>I have fine, dark blonde hair that seems to want to be washed just about every day but doing so stripped it of too many natural oils</li>
            <li>It absorbs the grease well, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue (I have black hair, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to miss it) or turn my hair</li>
            <li>Talcum powder does a better job and has less chemicals than this product.</li>
            <li>After seeing that this is the original dry shampoo, I thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>first several times I used it, I accidentally used too much.</li>
            <li>It may begin to wear away by the end of the day but your hair will look normal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than nothing I guess, but it really only provided a minor touch-up instead of making my roots look oil-free like washing my hair would.</li>
            <li>It does what a dry shampoo needs to do; removes oil, odors, and leave your hair full of body.</li>
            <li>so I sprayed this in, and my hair looked a little better, but nowhere near newly washed.</li>
            <li>The only really good stuff is made by Toni and Guy, but it&#x27;s super expensive.</li>
            <li>I am willing to sacrifice that, use this and wear the pony tail if I can get some extra time in the morning instead of devoting it all to my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if you wake up late and don&#x27;t have time to actually go through the entire wash cycle</li>
            <li>Other ones that I have used didn&#x27;t make my hair feel quite to clean.</li>
            <li>I read the complaints about the leaky nozzle and sure enough the heard hissing of the spray coming out when I wasn&#x27;t pressing the nozzle down.</li>
            <li>This is right now my go-to dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li>To avoid washing out my color quickly and maintaining moisture in my hair - I aim to wash it every other day.  </li>
            <li>and it definitely feels softer and much cleaner than before you put it on.</li>
            <li>With this product, my hair feels so soft &amp; fresh, that I can flip, swish, crimp and style as I want, the same as with my regular shampoo!  </li>
            <li>I have to hold the can as far away as my arm will stretch in order to not spray too</li>
            <li>Your hair will still feel silky and soft like hair.</li>
            <li>You really have to rub it in as to not have the white residue on your hair, but it works like a charm.</li>
            <li>Since it doesn&#x27;t really work as a dry shampoo as such, I sometimes use this on clean hair to add a *tiny* bit of volume.</li>
            <li>so I can comb through it, but I have not used regular shampoo for about 2 weeks and my hair is much healthier and manageable.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t think too much about it, but sometimes I have noticed a bit of white that didn&#x27;t blend in.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair every 3 days to keep the natural oils in my hair.</li>
            <li>I lightly spray just near the roots let sit for a few minutes and brush through.</li>
            <li>5.3 ounce  can of very reasonably priced dry shampoo..</li>
            <li>This is the first dry shampoo I tried.</li>
            <li>This is the first dry shampoo I ever tried.</li>
            <li>Pssst dry shampoo is my second favorite dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>I bought Pssssst at Walmart and was able to use twice... very hard to use though because you have to shake it vigorously the whole time which makes it hard to be accurate.</li>
            <li>I have used quite a few dry shampoos and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I have light brown hair and have no issues with the white finish but others with dark hair may.</li>
            <li>and I typically do not like the scents they have.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a recent find so the product I&#x27;m using is the New Look packaging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard wonders about dry shampoo from my friends and have never had much luck with them</li>
            <li>Overall this dry shampoo delivers on making my hair appear less oily and gives it more volume</li>
            <li>Helpful after my  major surgery where I could not wash my hair in the hospital.</li>
            <li>She had to get major surgery</li>
            <li>(Wish I could find a holding hairspray that didn&#x27;t dry my hair out, AND left it a little shiny... soon :).&lt;br</li>
            <li>dry shampoo before &amp; just decided to try it because it was a tiny bit cheaper than the Got2b dry shampoo, which I normally use &amp; the can holds a little bit more.</li>
            <li>I have pretty oily roots, but don&#x27;t like to wash it every day because the ends are so dry from highlights, blow dries, and flat irons.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a big disappointment, because it had always been such a great product, but I guess the company just couldn&#x27;t resist and decided to \\&quot;improve\\&quot; it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased better and worse.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible the color could last double the time it normally does!</li>
            <li>I have very dark hair, and have left for work with a strange light streak before</li>
            <li>I have thick, oily hair and was incredibly excited to try this product, but underwhelmed with the results.</li>
            <li>This weighs my hair down some and does not make it feel much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>But as far as dry shampoos come this one is alright.  </li>
            <li>I would only caution those with dark hair to really brush the product in.</li>
            <li>and I look like a hot mess!</li>
            <li>I have really thin fine blond hair....</li>
            <li>I have used many dry shampoos, including expensive ones, and this one is amazing and outdoes all the expensive ones.  </li>
            <li>My favorite dry shampoo and I have tried at least 8 other brands.</li>

            <li> Great Product.</li>
            <li> i used to use this great product in the 1970&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m so happy to find it on amazon, and happy that it is still made.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> Smells great.</li>
            <li> therefore it is very handy to have on hand something that I can use to freshen up.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Or I find that after I used some hair spray it has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Works great, I love it!</li>
            <li> always good.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the greatest smell but is useful.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> love this product!</li>
            <li> did a much better job!</li>
            <li> SO GLAD I DID!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, nothing awesome, but not bad either.</li>
            <li> I really liked it</li>
            <li> Best of all was the price--very reasonable.</li>
            <li> The smell is quite nice,</li>
            <li> I really liked it</li>
            <li> I keep a can in the apt.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> This product does the trick better than most I have tried, has a somewhat &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; scent that I enjoy, and is a good price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice smell, just strong.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to see it here on Amazon - now I can get some more.</li>
            <li> Baby powder is better.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure to rub it in with your hands and/or give yourself about 30-60 minutes before styling.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with this product, however, I was not expecting my hair to appear just like I had washed it.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that it works better if I spray it on the desired areas and let it set for 2-3 minutes and then brush it out.</li>
            <li> It seems like that gives it more time to work on the oily areas of my hair.</li>
            <li> For blowout gals this is a lifesaver and maybe even more sore for those of us who prefer to hit the snooze button.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my colorist, and I&#x27;m glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li> I also just chopped off most of my hair</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming smell that makes it seem like you used aerosol deodorant on your head.</li>
            <li> I chose this over the tresume, as it seems to do a better job of &amp;#34;refreshing&amp;#34; your hair.</li>
            <li> I happen to like the version that has more powder in it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Used to use it many years ago.</li>
            <li> and I love this.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you shake it a lot before you use.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> In fact I think it made it look more oily.</li>
            <li> Love this product-</li>
            <li> This used to be just wonderful dry shampoo</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo in the market</li>
            <li> Psssssst works best if you throughly shake the can and leave the spray to dry for a minute or two before working through the scalp.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo..</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo out there</li>
            <li> is the best dry shampoo on the market!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise I would say that this is the best dry shampoo that I have found!</li>
            <li> This is easily, hands-down, the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Pssst dry shampoo has saved my hair many times!!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to make my hair appear much cleaner, and the smell was kind of overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Would not run out of this spray shampoo, can purchase so easy on Amazon.</li>
            <li> best dry shampooo and great with blonde hair</li>
            <li> This product has a strong smell.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special, but not horrible.</li>
            <li> It will look less oily, however, which I feel is the best thing about this product.</li>
            <li> I have fine oily hair</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair clean, smelling clean, and for sure makes it thicker.</li>
            <li> Fantastic</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and it works.</li>
            <li> Works great when you just don&#x27;t have enough time to shower.</li>
            <li> I think it smells like a mild mint, and gives a cool refreshing sensation when it touches your scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I felt that the scent was a bit too strong and too sweet for me.</li>
            <li> This is the original spray dry shampoo and it does an amazing job of soaking up oil and refreshing your hair- even removes the smell of smoke!</li>
            <li> This is a great instant dry shampoo, it does a great job on lifting roots after a day or two without a wash and provides volume.</li>
            <li> This says it is the original formula.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time, a great dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how quick, easy and effective</li>
            <li> , I really am a clean freak</li>
            <li> My hair is fine but abundant, I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day because my hair is color treated and after I wash it it I blow dry it and use a straightener, which I know stresses hair , so I don&#x27;t wish to over wash on top of all.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo has a light pleasant scent .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years and really like it.</li>
            <li> For those of you who like sweet smells, this smells like mango.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t really have a scent of</li>
            <li> but it had kind of an old lady smell, so</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo has a pleasant light smell of coconut but is so fresh.</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars because while it works well and better than anything I&#x27;ve tried so far and the price is excellent, I&#x27;m still not really satisfied with the smell.</li>
            <li> She also has fine hair and recently she got it cut, pixie-cut short, and says the product feels great and makes her hair and scalp feel clean.</li>
            <li> so a good dry shampoo is a must for me!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it at home first, but it made my hair greasy!</li>
            <li> It also has an extremely strong smell, and it&#x27;s more of a chemical smell than a fruit smell like a regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t nothing for my fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different dry shampoos and this by far, is the best.</li>
            <li> It smells good but not overpowering, makes hair look clean, and I have been able to easily go three days without shampooing due to this dry shampoo, even with oily hair.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to get my hair freshly dyed</li>
            <li> This spray makes my hair looked like its been freshly shampooed.</li>
            <li> My hair looks &amp; smells like it was freshly washed, even up to the end of the day.</li>
            <li> The smell is also nice, and generic.</li>
            <li> My sister&#x27;s hair got in a candle and this shampoo seemed to make the fire catch very quickly and immediately became a 12in high flame!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, it seems to not always be consistent when spraying and runs out quickly.</li>
            <li> I spray it on right after drying my hair from the shampooing.</li>
            <li> There was a light smell which reminded me of air freshener at first, which I didn&#x27;t really like</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo because it is really light, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great if you can get past the smell and learning curve.</li>
            <li> I heard that leaving the natural oils in my hair would help it be less fly away and healthier, and it&#x27;s true in my case.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect miracles with this product--as in your hair will not look like it is freshly washed because what can really replace a fresh wash and style?</li>
            <li> This works great to freshen up 2nd or 3rd day hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own, a lot of dry shampoos do</li>
            <li> about 30 minutes helps anyway to let it absorb more prior to styling.</li>
            <li> love the extra volume I get when I use this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first one I tried.</li>
            <li> The first time I got to try it</li>
            <li> Tried many instant shampoo for in between shampooing for hair that gets oily.</li>
            <li> It can be used in a week more than once and the results are the same.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care what experts say - with my cowlicks and the way I sweat, the world is a better place when I wash daily.</li>
            <li> The PSSST brand was the first one I bought.  </li>
            <li> Next I tried Suave which had much better results</li>
            <li> haha!  </li>
            <li> The smell has usually been a bit overpowering and not always pleasant.</li>
            <li> Expect an initial white residue, but it easily brushes out leaving my hair clean and full bodied.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoos, this is by far the best in my opinion!</li>
            <li> On the first day after I wash my hair, it really does add volume to my slept-on hair.</li>
            <li> It works, and is many many times cheaper, but you do end up fighting a ton of static, and sometimes I get the powder application a little uneven to start with...  </li>
            <li> had much better luck with Not Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Refreshing Dry Shampoo which completely dried up the oil in my hair as desired</li>
            <li> The less you wash your hair probably the healthier it will be, leaving as much natural oils in it as possible without stripping it with regular shampoo seems to be the best way to keep it soft, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> Tresemme Dry Shampoo is MUCH better.  </li>
            <li> Baptiste absorbs more oil than Psssssst but leave a residue and can dry out the scalp.</li>
            <li> I have tried many dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li> It really did used to make my hair have body and look good but no more.</li>
            <li> For certain, the packaging and spray mechanism is not the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still my favorite dry shampoo!  </li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> so the only way she could clean herself was hot washcloths soaked in soap that was given to her by the hospital.</li>
            <li> My hair is very oily and the product solves the problem.</li>
            <li> I have very oily hair which must be washed every day.</li>
            <li> Both remove oil and make my very oily hair look fresher.</li>
            <li> Very thankful for this item when in a rush.</li>
            <li> Washing it every day was causing the color to fade fast.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much to absorb oil at all.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> If you really want to you can always spray some body spray or perfume on your hair after you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> (Hope that doesn&#x27;t sound gross</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work for my texture - hair was still matted.  </li>
            <li> and it was very noticable.  </li>
            <li> but it seems to cling to the oil on my scalp making what appear to be dandruff flakes but is really the product caked up.  </li>
            <li> Does leave a lot of white residue and even on my light hair, it&#x27;s visibly lightened.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Two things to note:&lt;br /&gt;#1 - the powder that comes out of this is white, you do need to brush your hair well enough to blend it in (it blends in quie nicely).  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say my hair looks and feels sparkling clean, but it certainly absorbs the oil and allows me to go out in public without shame and humiliation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other cans of this stuff, but they all leave my hair feeling like straw, or they don&#x27;t do anything to help the oil.  </li>
            <li> Like most of the other stuff out there.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this classic!</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t oily so my system works for me and my hair looks pretty healthy and not like dried up straw.</li>
            <li> It not only helps to contain the oily hair, but it makes it feel clean and adds volume.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair and this dry shampoo gives a lift without overwhelming my fair hair.</li>
            <li> so a tried and true pony tail or bun couldn&#x27;t be my fall back.</li>
            <li> and I love it, but my roommate has dark hair and she can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> The way I use it is; Section my hair off with my hands (it&#x27;s not an exact science) and spray it directly on the root, then I take my finger tips and massage it into the scalp.</li>
            <li> I have fine, dark blonde hair that seems to want to be washed just about every day but doing so stripped it of too many natural oils</li>
            <li> It absorbs the grease well, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue (I have black hair, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to miss it) or turn my hair</li>
            <li> Talcum powder does a better job and has less chemicals than this product.</li>
            <li> After seeing that this is the original dry shampoo, I thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> first several times I used it, I accidentally used too much.</li>
            <li> It may begin to wear away by the end of the day but your hair will look normal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than nothing I guess, but it really only provided a minor touch-up instead of making my roots look oil-free like washing my hair would.</li>
            <li> It does what a dry shampoo needs to do; removes oil, odors, and leave your hair full of body.</li>
            <li> so I sprayed this in, and my hair looked a little better, but nowhere near newly washed.</li>
            <li> The only really good stuff is made by Toni and Guy, but it&#x27;s super expensive.</li>
            <li> I am willing to sacrifice that, use this and wear the pony tail if I can get some extra time in the morning instead of devoting it all to my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if you wake up late and don&#x27;t have time to actually go through the entire wash cycle</li>
            <li> Other ones that I have used didn&#x27;t make my hair feel quite to clean.</li>
            <li> I read the complaints about the leaky nozzle and sure enough the heard hissing of the spray coming out when I wasn&#x27;t pressing the nozzle down.</li>
            <li> This is right now my go-to dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li> To avoid washing out my color quickly and maintaining moisture in my hair - I aim to wash it every other day.  </li>
            <li> and it definitely feels softer and much cleaner than before you put it on.</li>
            <li> With this product, my hair feels so soft &amp; fresh, that I can flip, swish, crimp and style as I want, the same as with my regular shampoo!  </li>
            <li> I have to hold the can as far away as my arm will stretch in order to not spray too</li>
            <li> Your hair will still feel silky and soft like hair.</li>
            <li> You really have to rub it in as to not have the white residue on your hair, but it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Since it doesn&#x27;t really work as a dry shampoo as such, I sometimes use this on clean hair to add a *tiny* bit of volume.</li>
            <li> so I can comb through it, but I have not used regular shampoo for about 2 weeks and my hair is much healthier and manageable.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think too much about it, but sometimes I have noticed a bit of white that didn&#x27;t blend in.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every 3 days to keep the natural oils in my hair.</li>
            <li> I lightly spray just near the roots let sit for a few minutes and brush through.</li>
            <li> 5.3 ounce  can of very reasonably priced dry shampoo..</li>
            <li> This is the first dry shampoo I tried.</li>
            <li> This is the first dry shampoo I ever tried.</li>
            <li> Pssst dry shampoo is my second favorite dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> I bought Pssssst at Walmart and was able to use twice... very hard to use though because you have to shake it vigorously the whole time which makes it hard to be accurate.</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few dry shampoos and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I have light brown hair and have no issues with the white finish but others with dark hair may.</li>
            <li> and I typically do not like the scents they have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a recent find so the product I&#x27;m using is the New Look packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard wonders about dry shampoo from my friends and have never had much luck with them</li>
            <li> Overall this dry shampoo delivers on making my hair appear less oily and gives it more volume</li>
            <li> Helpful after my  major surgery where I could not wash my hair in the hospital.</li>
            <li> She had to get major surgery</li>
            <li> (Wish I could find a holding hairspray that didn&#x27;t dry my hair out, AND left it a little shiny... soon :).&lt;br</li>
            <li> dry shampoo before &amp; just decided to try it because it was a tiny bit cheaper than the Got2b dry shampoo, which I normally use &amp; the can holds a little bit more.</li>
            <li> I have pretty oily roots, but don&#x27;t like to wash it every day because the ends are so dry from highlights, blow dries, and flat irons.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a big disappointment, because it had always been such a great product, but I guess the company just couldn&#x27;t resist and decided to \\&quot;improve\\&quot; it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased better and worse.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible the color could last double the time it normally does!</li>
            <li> I have very dark hair, and have left for work with a strange light streak before</li>
            <li> I have thick, oily hair and was incredibly excited to try this product, but underwhelmed with the results.</li>
            <li> This weighs my hair down some and does not make it feel much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> But as far as dry shampoos come this one is alright.  </li>
            <li> I would only caution those with dark hair to really brush the product in.</li>
            <li> and I look like a hot mess!</li>
            <li> I have really thin fine blond hair....</li>
            <li> I have used many dry shampoos, including expensive ones, and this one is amazing and outdoes all the expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> My favorite dry shampoo and I have tried at least 8 other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone who has tried all the other dry shampoos out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried other dry shampoos, including very high end dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li> This is hard as heck to get out of your hair if you use too much on accident!</li>
            <li> so I can see how long I can make it last with this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bonus is that I think it has a nice smell which is very faint to me.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last very long either.</li>

            <li> After trying a number of different dry shampoos, I found that Pssssssst works just as well as Not your mother&#x27;s or Suave.</li>
            <li> Dry Shampoo, Instant, 5.3 oz.]]</li>
            <li> This is the only dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave a tacky reside.</li>
            <li> I have only tried this dry shampoo and the Tresume one.</li>
            <li> Some dry shampoos smell like baby powder, which I try to avoid as much as possible.</li>
            <li> But after using this my hair is full of body, free from oil, and does not smell bad at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one other brand and both seemed to work the same.  </li>
            <li> Used this product a long time ago, and when I needed it lately was not able to find it locally, and was not able to find a product that I liked as well.</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t bought any in a long time.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last as long as I expected it to.</li>
            <li> On the second day after wash, I typically use it at my roots only to freshen up my pony-tailed hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d also like to add that I originally bought this for my Mom who was unfortunately diagnosed with cancer and was layed up in the hospital for a long time.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders and is relatively inexpensive compared to other brands -</li>
            <li> On the in between days, I spray some of this stuff at the roots, let it dry, and then shake out all the powder.  </li>
            <li> I use both Psssssst dry shampoo as well as Baptiste depending on how I want to style my hair.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo solved all that.</li>
            <li> but I could never find a dry shampoo that could allow me to skip washing my hair until this.</li>
            <li> I discovered psssssst dry shampoo in a buzzfeed article.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li> so I use dry shampoo as a bridge.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t make dry shampoo like they used to.</li>
            <li> The cheapest dry shampoo out there and for the price</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended that I not wash my hair everyday to try to keep the color in longer, which I thought was gross and my hair gets too greasy and oily to not wash daily.</li>
            <li> PSST made a small improvement, but no where near what I was used to with Tresemme&#x27;s dry shampoo line.  </li>
            <li> The other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, whether they&#x27;re expensive or cheap, have not worked well.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thin hair</li>
            <li> I use them as a styling aid  to add a little body/thickness to my fine thin hair or when I need extra grip for putting my hair up without making it stiff with hairspray.</li>
            <li> A cut on finger made me unable to get finger wet for a week and this stuff was a lifesaver for keeping my hair clean.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the point of dry shampoo - to make your hair look washed!  </li>
            <li> A lot of other dry shampoos can get sticky, but this one gives my hair volume, and doesn&#x27;t change the texture or weight.</li>
            <li> Every other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used has caused my hair to look and feel powdery/sticky.</li>
            <li> I color my hair and don&#x27;t like to shampoo everyday because I want the color to last a longer.</li>
            <li> I have think, dark hair, and I cannot seem to use this product without turning my hair grey for the day.  </li>
            <li> Anytime I put on a hat or go a little longer than I should without a shower, it&#x27;s greasy, flat hair time.  </li>
            <li> An average dry shampoo ...</li>
            <li> Pssssst makes my unwashed hair look fuller and healthier, and I can use less hairspray which as we all know can dry out your hair.  </li>
            <li> You have to use it sparingly, though - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I usually use it if I want to go an extra day without washing my hair, it also keeps my hairdo in place.</li>
            <li> careful though!</li>
            <li> This really makes your hair thicker and well as cutting back on the times a week I need to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> the only dry shampoo i can find that doesnt have a terrible smell, i love this stuff.</li>
            <li> then it gets very limp and flat, add oil to the mix</li>
            <li> I dye my hair and I was tired of having the color be nearly gone in less than a month.</li>
            <li> I have baby-fine hair and typically I have to wash it every day and even if it doesn&#x27;t look greasy</li>
            <li> Also, I like the idea of having an emergency hair treatment in case I wake up too late to shower before work, or to refresh my hair after a long day of work before I go out at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled about it, because it just won&#x27;t re-style my hair as it would when I blow it dry and style it.  </li>
            <li> My hair does look a little cleaner after using but I can&#x27;t see how it added any volume like the</li>
            <li> I had tried dry shampoos in the past and was never pleased.</li>
            <li> I have very dark hair</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t wash my hair everyday anymore.  </li>
            <li> Tresemme made my thin oily hair ACTUALLY look just washed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not always wash my hair everyday</li>
            <li> And I tend to get quite a few uses out of a can, maybe 8 or 10?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then let it sit for a little bit (usually do my make up while waiting) and then take a brush and brush it through to the ends.</li>
            <li> I hate using dry shampoo - it does not do anything to my hair that resembles what it looks or feels like after I use real shampoo -</li>
            <li> I have very oily hair, but I hate to wash it every single day.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m just a dry shampoo failure!</li>
            <li> A little pricier than in stores but can be hard to find.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is $15 less expensive, and it works as well, if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Washing her hair was definitely out unless she felt up to an NA helping and a lot of bending over which was difficult.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product brand in the past.</li>
            <li> (Not sure)</li>
            <li> Just spray it on, wait a few seconds, brush through- and voila!  </li>
            <li> Plus, at Amazon, it is least expensive dry shampoo around!  </li>
            <li> It is not effective at all.  </li>
            <li> I tried using this on a day where I chose to sleep in late.</li>
            <li> I am a dirty blonde</li>
            <li> I tried a couple of expensive brands, but the spray nozzle got clogged quickly and they ended up being worthless.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now and I am obsessed with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure if I&#x27;m using it wrong?  </li>
            <li> Within a few hours my hair looked just as dirty as it would if I didn&#x27;t use the product.</li>
            <li> Every dry shampoo I tried still had my hair looking like crap.</li>
            <li> If I had paid 7$ I&#x27;d be angry.</li>
            <li> incase I was unable to shampoo, so</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I did not take it camping.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find though, so that is why I use Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Horrible scent &amp; made my hair feel heavy &amp; dirty.</li>
            <li> This Pssssst performed well and the smell was not overpowering or unpleasant.</li>
            <li> but I absolutely hated the smell.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t absorb oil terribly well.  </li>
            <li> I need to try something else,  this is disgusting.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I always kept Psssssst Instant Spray Shampoo on hand. At the gym, the dance studio, at work... guaranteed that you could always have clean-looking and fresher smelling hair in an instant. However, on a whim I decided to try it again. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same stuff. For certain, the packaging and spray mechanism is not the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a big disappointment, because it had always been such a great product, but I guess the company just couldn&#x27;t resist and decided to \\&quot;improve\\&quot; it. Well, save your money and look for something else. NOT recommended.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, a great dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years and really like it. When I was in my 20s and 30s, I had to wash my hair every day because it was so oily. Psssssst was great in a pinch. I had heard that it was discontinued a while back so I haven&#x27;t bought any in a long time. I&#x27;m glad to see it here on Amazon - now I can get some more. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the scent. I&#x27;m allergic to fragrances of all types so I wish it came in an unscented type.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Didn&#x27;t nothing for my fine, straight hair. Horrible scent &amp; made my hair feel heavy &amp; dirty. I immediately got into the shower….Pass</li>
            <li> I bought Pssssst at Walmart and was able to use twice... very hard to use though because you have to shake it vigorously the whole time which makes it hard to be accurate. There is still product in the can but I can&#x27;t use it because now the spraying mechanism doesn&#x27;t work. I do not recommend to others because after paying over 5 dollars for it i feel like I only got 1/5 of the value.</li>
            <li> This used to be just wonderful dry shampoo but they must have changed the formula because it does nothing for my hair. Baby powder is better. I saw all the five star reviews and could not believe it. It really did used to make my hair have body and look good but no more.</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve only used one other brand and both seemed to work the same.  I will continue to buy and use this product.  The only con is the white powdery look.  You have to make sure to rub it in with your hands and/or give yourself about 30-60 minutes before styling.  I find waiting about 30 minutes helps anyway to let it absorb more prior to styling.</li>
            <li> My hair is very oily and the product solves the problem. It&#x27;s possible do not wash the hair every day  [[ASIN:B003NW8M1Q Pssssst! Dry Shampoo, Instant, 5.3 oz.]]</li>
            <li> I have very oily hair which must be washed every day. After trying a number of different dry shampoos, I found that Pssssssst works just as well as Not your mother&#x27;s or Suave. It absorbs the grease well, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue (I have black hair, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to miss it) or turn my hair white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I felt that the scent was a bit too strong and too sweet for me. For those of you who like sweet smells, this smells like mango.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair and I was tired of having the color be nearly gone in less than a month. My stylist recommended that I not wash my hair everyday to try to keep the color in longer, which I thought was gross and my hair gets too greasy and oily to not wash daily. I was pleasantly surprised at how quick, easy and effective this product is. It literally takes 3 minutes to spray it on, let it work and comb it out and it definitely feels softer and much cleaner than before you put it on. I think it smells like a mild mint, and gives a cool refreshing sensation when it touches your scalp. I really liked it and I can&#x27;t wait to get my hair freshly dyed so I can see how long I can make it last with this product. It&#x27;s possible the color could last double the time it normally does! Also, I like the idea of having an emergency hair treatment in case I wake up too late to shower before work, or to refresh my hair after a long day of work before I go out at night. The less you wash your hair probably the healthier it will be, leaving as much natural oils in it as possible without stripping it with regular shampoo seems to be the best way to keep it soft, shiny and healthy. I like this product a lot!</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo in the market</li>
            <li> I color my hair and don&#x27;t like to shampoo everyday because I want the color to last a longer. The other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, whether they&#x27;re expensive or cheap, have not worked well. The smell has usually been a bit overpowering and not always pleasant. This Pssssst performed well and the smell was not overpowering or unpleasant. Best of all was the price--very reasonable. I will buy again. I gave 4 stars because while it works well and better than anything I&#x27;ve tried so far and the price is excellent, I&#x27;m still not really satisfied with the smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over twenty years.  it is a great product.  i can&#x27;t wash my hair everyday anymore.  this spray allows me to go longer between washings and not look &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;.  love this product!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect miracles with this product--as in your hair will not look like it is freshly washed because what can really replace a fresh wash and style? It will look less oily, however, which I feel is the best thing about this product. On the first day after I wash my hair, it really does add volume to my slept-on hair. On the second day after wash, I typically use it at my roots only to freshen up my pony-tailed hair. I was pleased with this product, however, I was not expecting my hair to appear just like I had washed it. The only way it will look like that is if it actually gets washed. I am willing to sacrifice that, use this and wear the pony tail if I can get some extra time in the morning instead of devoting it all to my hair. I have noticed that it works better if I spray it on the desired areas and let it set for 2-3 minutes and then brush it out. It seems like that gives it more time to work on the oily areas of my hair.</li>
            <li> is the best dry shampoo on the market!  Plus, at Amazon, it is least expensive dry shampoo around!  With this product, my hair feels so soft &amp; fresh, that I can flip, swish, crimp and style as I want, the same as with my regular shampoo!  Fantastic stuff![[ASIN:B003NW8M1Q Pssssst! Dry Shampoo, Instant, 5.3 oz.]]</li>
            <li> PSST made a small improvement, but no where near what I was used to with Tresemme&#x27;s dry shampoo line.  Tresemme Dry Shampoo is MUCH better.  Tresemme made my thin oily hair ACTUALLY look just washed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand the 5-star reviews saying this PSST stuff is &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; even though it doesn&#x27;t make your hair look washed.  That&#x27;s the point of dry shampoo - to make your hair look washed!  If it doesn&#x27;t do its job, don&#x27;t give it 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars for effort, and because I got a $2 coupon and only had to pay 4.99.  If I had paid 7$ I&#x27;d be angry.</li>
            <li> This is the first dry shampoo I tried. It didn&#x27;t seem to make my hair appear much cleaner, and the smell was kind of overwhelming. I tried applying it twice. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. I&#x27;m going to try another brand.</li>
            <li> This really makes your hair thicker and well as cutting back on the times a week I need to wash my hair. I spray it on right after drying my hair from the shampooing. It keeps my hair clean, smelling clean, and for sure makes it thicker.</li>
            <li> I have used many dry shampoos, including expensive ones, and this one is amazing and outdoes all the expensive ones.  It is very hard to find though, so that is why I use Amazon!!</li>
            <li> An average dry shampoo ... I&#x27;ve purchased better and worse.  The smell is quite nice, though - almost reminds me of coconut.  It just doesn&#x27;t absorb oil terribly well.  I probably won&#x27;t order again, as there is another comprably priced brand that I prefer.</li>
            <li> Helpful after my  major surgery where I could not wash my hair in the hospital.</li>
            <li> This is the original spray dry shampoo and it does an amazing job of soaking up oil and refreshing your hair- even removes the smell of smoke! For blowout gals this is a lifesaver and maybe even more sore for those of us who prefer to hit the snooze button.</li>
            <li> works great. very happy with product.</li>
            <li> Works great, I love it!</li>
            <li> always good. the only brand I can ever see actually works.</li>
            <li> This is the first dry shampoo I ever tried. It was recommended in a magazine (I think it was InStyle?) and I decided to try it. I really liked it but I absolutely hated the smell. It takes a while for it to go away so I used a spritz or two of perfume to cover it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first several times I used it, I accidentally used too much. This is hard as heck to get out of your hair if you use too much on accident! I have to hold the can as far away as my arm will stretch in order to not spray too much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the extra volume I get when I use this and I can go ages without having to wash my hair. This stuff is great if you can get past the smell and learning curve.</li>
            <li> I only tried this product because it was a freebie.  It is not effective at all.  Talcum powder does a better job and has less chemicals than this product.</li>
            <li> I hate using dry shampoo - it does not do anything to my hair that resembles what it looks or feels like after I use real shampoo - but the fact of the matter is I have to use it.  I have pretty oily roots, but don&#x27;t like to wash it every day because the ends are so dry from highlights, blow dries, and flat irons.  To avoid washing out my color quickly and maintaining moisture in my hair - I aim to wash it every other day.  On the in between days, I spray some of this stuff at the roots, let it dry, and then shake out all the powder.  I won&#x27;t say my hair looks and feels sparkling clean, but it certainly absorbs the oil and allows me to go out in public without shame and humiliation.  I&#x27;ve tried many other cans of this stuff, but they all leave my hair feeling like straw, or they don&#x27;t do anything to help the oil.  This was recommended to me by my colorist, and I&#x27;m glad I tried it.  It&#x27;s cheap and it works.</li>
            <li> I use both Psssssst dry shampoo as well as Baptiste depending on how I want to style my hair. Both remove oil and make my very oily hair look fresher. Psssssst is a wetter formula but does not leave a residue in the hair. Your hair will still feel silky and soft like hair. Baptiste absorbs more oil than Psssssst but leave a residue and can dry out the scalp. Psssssst works best if you throughly shake the can and leave the spray to dry for a minute or two before working through the scalp. It may begin to wear away by the end of the day but your hair will look normal. I have light brown hair and have no issues with the white finish but others with dark hair may.</li>
            <li> Still my favorite dry shampoo!  You really have to rub it in as to not have the white residue on your hair, but it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Very thankful for this item when in a rush. I keep a can in the apt. and one in the car.</li>
            <li> the only dry shampoo i can find that doesnt have a terrible smell, i love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used Pssst! dry shampoo before &amp; just decided to try it because it was a tiny bit cheaper than the Got2b dry shampoo, which I normally use &amp; the can holds a little bit more. It&#x27;s ok, nothing awesome, but not bad either. My hair does look a little cleaner after using but I can&#x27;t see how it added any volume like the can says it would do. There was a light smell which reminded me of air freshener at first, which I didn&#x27;t really like but it didn&#x27;t last very long either. I would use this again if I couldn&#x27;t get Got2b but otherwise, probably not.</li>
            <li> This is the only dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave a tacky reside. You have to use it sparingly, though - a little goes a long way. Highly recommend this classic!</li>
            <li> I wanted it when I went camping incase I was unable to shampoo, so I tried it at home first, but it made my hair greasy! Needless to say, I did not take it camping. I found using baby powder sprinkled in my hair did a much better job!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different dry shampoos and this by far, is the best. It smells good but not overpowering, makes hair look clean, and I have been able to easily go three days without shampooing due to this dry shampoo, even with oily hair.</li>
            <li> If you want to refresh your hair quickly or simply have a just washed look for one day, use Psssssst Instant Spray Shampoo.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells amazing! A little pricier than in stores but can be hard to find.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine but abundant, I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day because my hair is color treated and after I wash it it I blow dry it and use a straightener, which I know stresses hair , so I don&#x27;t wish to over wash on top of all. My hair isn&#x27;t oily so my system works for me and my hair looks pretty healthy and not like dried up straw. This dry shampoo has a light pleasant scent . I lightly spray just near the roots let sit for a few minutes and brush through. This product isn&#x27;t meant to replace actual washing , just to extend the the look of cleanliness.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this dry shampoo. It&#x27;s the first one I tried. It&#x27;s better than nothing I guess, but it really only provided a minor touch-up instead of making my roots look oil-free like washing my hair would. It also has an extremely strong smell, and it&#x27;s more of a chemical smell than a fruit smell like a regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had much better luck with Not Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Refreshing Dry Shampoo which completely dried up the oil in my hair as desired and it doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable odor once you brush it through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See it here:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Not-Your-Mothers-Refreshing-Shampoo/dp/B0057NE7NQ/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hpc_4?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;1V0XRN608S67JTP25P2X</li>
            <li> This works great to freshen up 2nd or 3rd day hair and it doesn&#x27;t leave any noticeable residue.  I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried. I have oily hair but I also color it. Washing it every day was causing the color to fade fast. Every dry shampoo I tried still had my hair looking like crap. I also just chopped off most of my hair so a tried and true pony tail or bun couldn&#x27;t be my fall back. This dry shampoo solved all that. It&#x27;s great. Buy it. Seriously. Also it doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming smell that makes it seem like you used aerosol deodorant on your head.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much to absorb oil at all. Since it doesn&#x27;t really work as a dry shampoo as such, I sometimes use this on clean hair to add a *tiny* bit of volume. Not what I was expecting and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have thick, oily hair and was incredibly excited to try this product, but underwhelmed with the results. The first time I got to try it I overslept and couldn&#x27;t shower so I sprayed this in, and my hair looked a little better, but nowhere near newly washed. Within a few hours my hair looked just as dirty as it would if I didn&#x27;t use the product. I&#x27;ve heard wonders about dry shampoo from my friends and have never had much luck with them so I think my hair is just too oily. I read the complaints about the leaky nozzle and sure enough the heard hissing of the spray coming out when I wasn&#x27;t pressing the nozzle down. I got around the problem by removing the nozzle after use and storing it in the bottle cap.</li>
            <li> Tried many instant shampoo for in between shampooing for hair that gets oily. This spray makes my hair looked like its been freshly shampooed. It can be used in a week more than once and the results are the same. Would not run out of this spray shampoo, can purchase so easy on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This item was purchased as a stocking stuffer for my daughter, she used that product in emergencies and it is considered a Basic in her cabinet.</li>
            <li> My daughter got this in one of her sample box programs she is involved in &amp; left it at my house. I was hesitant because I NEED to wash my hair daily. I don&#x27;t care what experts say - with my cowlicks and the way I sweat, the world is a better place when I wash daily. Anyways... I tried using this on a day where I chose to sleep in late. Within 2 weeks the entire bottle was gone. My hair looks &amp; smells like it was freshly washed, even up to the end of the day. Plus there is no gooey feeling around my scalp like I&#x27;ve found with others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have only tried this dry shampoo and the Tresume one. I chose this over the tresume, as it seems to do a better job of &amp;#34;refreshing&amp;#34; your hair. However, it seems to not always be consistent when spraying and runs out quickly.</li>
            <li> This is easily, hands-down, the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I have baby-fine hair and typically I have to wash it every day and even if it doesn&#x27;t look greasy then it&#x27;s all messed up from sleeping. I&#x27;ve added a faux-silk pillow case and recently my bedhead days have been fewer but I could never find a dry shampoo that could allow me to skip washing my hair until this. It&#x27;s a recent find so the product I&#x27;m using is the New Look packaging. I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone who has tried all the other dry shampoos out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also like to add that I originally bought this for my Mom who was unfortunately diagnosed with cancer and was layed up in the hospital for a long time. She had to get major surgery so the only way she could clean herself was hot washcloths soaked in soap that was given to her by the hospital. Washing her hair was definitely out unless she felt up to an NA helping and a lot of bending over which was difficult. The product has worked wonders for her hair since she can&#x27;t properly wash it at the moment. She also has fine hair and recently she got it cut, pixie-cut short, and says the product feels great and makes her hair and scalp feel clean.</li>
            <li> I have tried other dry shampoos, including very high end dry shampoos.  None of them by themselves allow me to not wash my hair and look styled, but that is not how I use them. I use them as a styling aid  to add a little body/thickness to my fine thin hair or when I need extra grip for putting my hair up without making it stiff with hairspray. This product does the trick better than most I have tried, has a somewhat &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; scent that I enjoy, and is a good price.  This is right now my go-to dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure if I&#x27;m using it wrong?  I have think, dark hair, and I cannot seem to use this product without turning my hair grey for the day.  I&#x27;ve tried holding the bottle father away, closer to my hair, etc....I think I&#x27;m just a dry shampoo failure!</li>
            <li> Used this product a long time ago, and when I needed it lately was not able to find it locally, and was not able to find a product that I liked as well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the greatest smell but is useful.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product brand in the past. This says it is the original formula.  I happen to like the version that has more powder in it.  (Not sure) This weighs my hair down some and does not make it feel much cleaner.  I do like the smell of it and it works enough to use it- however would not purchase this type again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. A cut on finger made me unable to get finger wet for a week and this stuff was a lifesaver for keeping my hair clean.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo.. I am a dirty blonde and I love it, but my roommate has dark hair and she can&#x27;t use it. She loves how well it works but it makes it look like she has dandruff.</li>
            <li> Pssst dry shampoo is my second favorite dry shampoo! It does what a dry shampoo needs to do; removes oil, odors, and leave your hair full of body. I have pretty thin hair so if I go without washing it then it gets very limp and flat, add oil to the mix and I look like a hot mess! haha But after using this my hair is full of body, free from oil, and does not smell bad at all! I love that it doesn&#x27;t really have a scent of it&#x27;s own, a lot of dry shampoos do and I typically do not like the scents they have. If you really want to you can always spray some body spray or perfume on your hair after you&#x27;re done. Or I find that after I used some hair spray it has a pleasant scent. The way I use it is; Section my hair off with my hands (it&#x27;s not an exact science) and spray it directly on the root, then I take my finger tips and massage it into the scalp. I then let it sit for a little bit (usually do my make up while waiting) and then take a brush and brush it through to the ends. Letting it sit is the key it gives it time to soak up the oils. I also do not recommend spraying it on your part line as sometimes it can leave a dull/grey look to the part line. Pssst dry shampoo has saved my hair many times!!!</li>
            <li> After I wash my hair, I use a shiny product.  Sometimes, I over do it.  Pssssst helps to bring it back to a cleaner look.  The delivery date was as promised.</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo! I usually use it if I want to go an extra day without washing my hair, it also keeps my hairdo in place. The only thing I was surprised about was that it was empty after about 2 months and I only used about once a week. Maybe that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to be, but it caught me off-guard.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders and is relatively inexpensive compared to other brands - the only downside I could say is that it is probably not for people with darker hair and would definitely show up.  Luckily, I&#x27;m blonde and this stuff saves my life about 3 days a week.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Used to use it many years ago. It works great after having surgery and you can&#x27;t wash you hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thin fine blond hair.... and I love this.  I heard that leaving the natural oils in my hair would help it be less fly away and healthier, and it&#x27;s true in my case.  Pssssst makes my unwashed hair look fuller and healthier, and I can use less hairspray which as we all know can dry out your hair.  (Wish I could find a holding hairspray that didn&#x27;t dry my hair out, AND left it a little shiny... soon :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work out a lot, and shower about 2x a day....I condition my hair so I can comb through it, but I have not used regular shampoo for about 2 weeks and my hair is much healthier and manageable.  (Hope that doesn&#x27;t sound gross, I really am a clean freak so it&#x27;s weird for me not to shampoo, but the fact that my hair is stronger and looks much better... I&#x27;m sticking with this.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus is that I think it has a nice smell which is very faint to me.</li>
            <li> My favorite dry shampoo and I have tried at least 8 other brands. I have fine oily hair so a good dry shampoo is a must for me!&lt;br /&gt;Be careful though! It&#x27;s flammable. My sister&#x27;s hair got in a candle and this shampoo seemed to make the fire catch very quickly and immediately became a 12in high flame!&lt;br /&gt;I have had no such issues. Just keep your hair away from flames!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last as long as I expected it to. Make sure you shake it a lot before you use.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this drug store product to me awhile back. I love this dry shampoo because it is really light, but gets the job done. A lot of other dry shampoos can get sticky, but this one gives my hair volume, and doesn&#x27;t change the texture or weight. I would only caution those with dark hair to really brush the product in. I have blonde hair so I don&#x27;t think too much about it, but sometimes I have noticed a bit of white that didn&#x27;t blend in. The smell is also nice, and generic. Some dry shampoos smell like baby powder, which I try to avoid as much as possible.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every 3 days to keep the natural oils in my hair. I only need to use this on the days I don&#x27;t wash it. This stuff is amazing and smells fantastic! I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now and I am obsessed with it.</li>
            <li> I discovered psssssst dry shampoo in a buzzfeed article. I had tried dry shampoos in the past and was never pleased. After seeing that this is the original dry shampoo, I thought I would give it a try. SO GLAD I DID! I have thin hair and this dry shampoo gives a lift without overwhelming my fair hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of dry shampoos.  I have very oily hair, but I hate to wash it every single day.  I tried a couple of expensive brands, but the spray nozzle got clogged quickly and they ended up being worthless. This dry shampoo is $15 less expensive, and it works as well, if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things to note:&lt;br /&gt;#1 - the powder that comes out of this is white, you do need to brush your hair well enough to blend it in (it blends in quie nicely).  I have very dark hair, and have left for work with a strange light streak before (it&#x27;s not cute).&lt;br /&gt;#2 - This product has a strong smell.  It&#x27;s a nice smell, just strong.  I couldn&#x27;t use it at the cabin for fear of attracting mosquitoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise I would say that this is the best dry shampoo that I have found!</li>
            <li> I have fine, dark blonde hair that seems to want to be washed just about every day but doing so stripped it of too many natural oils so I use dry shampoo as a bridge.  The PSSST brand was the first one I bought.  It didn&#x27;t really work for my texture - hair was still matted.  Next I tried Suave which had much better results but it had kind of an old lady smell, so I am going to keep looking.  Have my eye on the stila brand.</li>
            <li> I do not always wash my hair everyday therefore it is very handy to have on hand something that I can use to freshen up.</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few dry shampoos and this is by far my favorite.  It not only helps to contain the oily hair, but it makes it feel clean and adds volume.  Other ones that I have used didn&#x27;t make my hair feel quite to clean.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I can use it several days in a row and my hair dose not get all grose and sticky.</li>
            <li> Bought this product recently to try.  I&#x27;m not thrilled about it, because it just won&#x27;t re-style my hair as it would when I blow it dry and style it.  Would probably recommend to others for them to try.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo out there and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  Expect an initial white residue, but it easily brushes out leaving my hair clean and full bodied.  Only improvement would be if they could create a darker spray and then I could use it to color my roots too.  :)</li>
            <li> I have fine, limp hair.  Anytime I put on a hat or go a little longer than I should without a shower, it&#x27;s greasy, flat hair time.  This stuff is a great stopgap to help your hair look great in a hurry!  And I tend to get quite a few uses out of a can, maybe 8 or 10?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recession update:  My friend asked me about my Psst!, and then showed me that I could get the same effects by just sprinkling baby powder liberally into my hair (I do it over the bathtub) and brushing it through my hair.  It works, and is many many times cheaper, but you do end up fighting a ton of static, and sometimes I get the powder application a little uneven to start with...  I am looking forward to the economy picking up, so I can afford my Pssst! again!</li>
            <li> This left a white residue on my hair. I have very dark hair and it was very noticable.  Plus i was stuck, because i had to leave the house for an appointment and didn&#x27;t have time to wash and restyle my hair.</li>
            <li> Great Product. 5.3 ounce  can of very reasonably priced dry shampoo.. When you don&#x27;t feel you need to wash your hair- grab the Psssssst...</li>
            <li> This is a great instant dry shampoo, it does a great job on lifting roots after a day or two without a wash and provides volume. The spray mechanism works efficiently, a plus, it also smells pleasant!</li>
            <li> Overall this dry shampoo delivers on making my hair appear less oily and gives it more volume but it seems to cling to the oil on my scalp making what appear to be dandruff flakes but is really the product caked up.  I need to try something else,  this is disgusting.</li>
            <li> best dry shampooo and great with blonde hair</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t make dry shampoo like they used to. Nothing special, but not horrible. Like most of the other stuff out there. The only really good stuff is made by Toni and Guy, but it&#x27;s super expensive.</li>
            <li> i have been looking for this product on the shelves for years!  i thought that like all really good products, it just vanished!  i used to use this great product in the 1970&#x27;s.  i&#x27;m so happy to find it on amazon, and happy that it is still made.</li>
            <li> The cheapest dry shampoo out there and for the price it&#x27;s great. Does leave a lot of white residue and even on my light hair, it&#x27;s visibly lightened. I would not recommend to anyone with darker hair.</li>
            <li> Every other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used has caused my hair to look and feel powdery/sticky. This dry shampoo has a pleasant light smell of coconut but is so fresh. I definitely will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I think this product works on specific types of hair.  It did absolutely nothing for my fine hair.  In fact I think it made it look more oily.</li>
            <li> Works great. Smells great. I&#x27;m pleasured.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this and will buy again. Works great when you just don&#x27;t have enough time to shower.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to wash your hair but save a lot of time!  Just spray it on, wait a few seconds, brush through- and voila!  It gets you through another day- It&#x27;s great if you wake up late and don&#x27;t have time to actually go through the entire wash cycle haha!  Love this product- and i&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoos, this is by far the best in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I have tried many dry shampoos.  They are all the same $5-$25.  But as far as dry shampoos come this one is alright.  Does not seem to get the oil out as I thought it would.</li>
