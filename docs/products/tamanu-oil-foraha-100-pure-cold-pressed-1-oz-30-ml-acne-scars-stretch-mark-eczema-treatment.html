            <li>I make my own \\&quot;rescue remedy\\</li>
            <li>It absorbed beautifully into my skin with a rather milder nutty scent than the Tahitian oil.</li>
            <li>and so happy to have found a source of true Madagascan tamanu oil.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fade as fast as I would have liked but good.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I pulled out the dropper and found it to be a lovely amber color, like Slice of Nature&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s healthy appearance.</li>
            <li>I like this product better than another companies as it&#x27;s liquid and has a glass dropper.</li>

            <li>To me, this is the mark of an honest seller who cares about the product, and this is evident in everything from the quality of the product to the excellent packaging: packed with styro peanuts in a hard plastic container and wrapped securely, it arrived intact with no spillage or breakage of the glass bottle.</li>

            <li>It really works!!!</li>
            <li>After getting used to it and loving it, I returned to purchase more and found that it is \\&quot;currently unavailable\\&quot; and has been for about a month.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that Madagascan tamanu oil (foraha) is superior to the more common Tahitian oil, so I found a fantastic one in Slice of Nature&#x27;s oils.</li>
            <li>I rub this amazing oil onto my face in circular motion daily after i wash my face.</li>
            <li>That alone was worth every cent.</li>
            <li>On dry days, I combine it with my BB cream to make it go on more smoothly, and it works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other brands, this one has a far more pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>This cured my toenail fungus after all else failed!&lt;br /&gt;Tried everything for years and finally I have healthy nails with no sign of fungus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>there are some out there that mix oilive oil on top and the actual tamanu oil is sitting at the bottom!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT STUFF!!</li>
            <li>few words about tamanu/foraha oil in general: Both Slice of Nature and Teliaoils state on their amazon descriptions that Madgascan oil is favored over Tahitian but offered no explanation as to why this is so.</li>
            <li>so this made me feel I was receiving pure Tamanu oil.</li>
            <li>Tahitian is very good, don&#x27;t get me wrong -</li>
            <li>I think the greek product may make a better carrier oil, because it&#x27;s own smell is hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this oil often do to the intense summer heat .The</li>
            <li>but there really is a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The dropper is very sturdy as well.</li>
            <li>The dropper is very sturdy as well.</li>
            <li>I cant really estimate whether or not its assisted in the healing process after the peels.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been reading so much about it</li>
            <li>Its doesnt leave you feeling greasy and it is very moisturizing while absorbing odors.</li>
            <li>the enclosed eye dropper is very helpful in dispensing the oil.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>The Tahitian oils are darker green in color and smell very strong.</li>
            <li>However, Simpler&#x27;s oil is so green and rich and full of healing \\&quot;goodness\\&quot;, it is still my number ONE choice.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Both Madagascan oils that I have tried are lighter colored, tending more toward amber than green.</li>
            <li>Now I have read that the season in which the nuts are harvested influences the color/smell, with Springtime producing the greener, more strong-smelling oil, so it may be a fluke that the Tahitian ones I&#x27;ve tried are green whereas the Madagascan ones are amber.</li>

            <li>This oil is a miracle worker as it has helped my fine lines &amp; wrinkles, old acne &amp; other scars &amp; leaves my usually dull skin with a nice glow.  </li>
            <li>But here is what I have learned from personal experience: Madagascan absorbs more readily into the skin and the scent is less pungent.</li>
            <li>My oil shipped directly from Greece</li>

            <li>and I have no active acne</li>
            <li>/&gt;It began working within the first day for my extremely itchy rash.</li>
            <li>I used it last night, mixed with argan oil underneath my NZ Fusion Skin Clear cream</li>
            <li>I am not allergic to nuts but after using this for less than a week I started breaking out in places where I have never broken out before.</li>
            <li>i think true assessment will be after a few months of use -not right away.</li>

            <li> As other reviews mention, it sort of just dissolves into the skin.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed; it was more like the tahitian variety I had bought from Life Force.</li>
            <li> I have tried other sellers/brands of Tamanu Oil.  </li>

            <li> This cured my toenail fungus after all else failed!&lt;br /&gt;Tried everything for years and finally I have healthy nails with no sign of fungus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped from Greece which took a while...&lt;br /&gt;worth the wait!!!!</li>
            <li> This oil was shipped from Greece &amp; arrived in about 3 wks - not bad! This oil is a miracle worker as it has helped my fine lines &amp; wrinkles, old acne &amp; other scars &amp; leaves my usually dull skin with a nice glow.  I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on my complexion since I&#x27;ve started using the Tamanu Oil!</li>
            <li> I have combination acne prone skin. I purchased tamanu oil because I wanted to try something &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; to treat my acne scarring. I am not allergic to nuts but after using this for less than a week I started breaking out in places where I have never broken out before. This does clog pores at least in my case. If you are looking for something to improve acne scarring I would suggest drinking herbal tea with rosehip in it to help with acne scarring. I was doing this and I noticed improvement while I was waiting for this tamanu oil.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this oil often do to the intense summer heat .The few times I have used the Tamanu oil ,it left my face soft with a silky look with a healthier appearance. I have combination skin,which is acne prone on the oily parts.This oil didn&#x27;t aggravate or cause me to breakout. I only used two droplets.Didn&#x27;t want to overdo it and push my luck.I don&#x27;t mind the fragrance it&#x27;s a suttle nutty aroma.Doesn&#x27;t bother me.I think this oil would be beneficial for my skin during the cold winter months.Too soon to tell but I didn&#x27;t have any negative reactions after using this product.I would order this product from the same seller.My oil shipped directly from Greece so this made me feel I was receiving pure Tamanu oil.</li>
            <li> This oil has been a miracle for me. I have been suffering with topical steroid withdrawl for months.&lt;br /&gt;It began working within the first day for my extremely itchy rash. After 3 days the itch was gone! That alone was worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Took FOREVER to arrive but it was good! Didn&#x27;t fade as fast as I would have liked but good.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I love the way it&#x27;s not so greasy and it evaporates quickly into the skin. Will continue to purchase money well spent.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea (mad red face) that gets me annoyed and on top of that I have acne around my jawline with red scars + dry skin. I rub this amazing oil onto my face in circular motion daily after i wash my face. And it&#x27;s heaven to my skin. I&#x27;ve seen it has diminished the redness and I have no active acne and my face feels smooth like a baby&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> I got this for acne scars on my face...or should I say the discoloration left from acne scars. I haven&#x27;t noticed anything yet. It is a nice emollient and doesn&#x27;t produce pustules while it nourishes the skin. Great value and arrived ahead of schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll post an update if anything actually improves, like my scars fade.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. As other reviews mention, it sort of just dissolves into the skin. On dry days, I combine it with my BB cream to make it go on more smoothly, and it works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other brands, this one has a far more pleasant smell. Definitely worth a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that Madagascan tamanu oil (foraha) is superior to the more common Tahitian oil, so I found a fantastic one in Slice of Nature&#x27;s oils. After getting used to it and loving it, I returned to purchase more and found that it is \\&quot;currently unavailable\\&quot; and has been for about a month. Crestfallen, I searched and searched for another. I purchased Shea Terra tamanu because it popped up under my search for Madagascan foraha. I was disappointed; it was more like the tahitian variety I had bought from Life Force. Tahitian is very good, don&#x27;t get me wrong - but there really is a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched again and found Teliaoils foraha oil. I took a chance and settled in for the long wait (it ships from Greece) and eagerly opened the package when it arrived yesterday. I pulled out the dropper and found it to be a lovely amber color, like Slice of Nature&#x27;s. I rubbed a few drops onto the backs of my hands and wow - this oil is spectacular! It absorbed beautifully into my skin with a rather milder nutty scent than the Tahitian oil. I used it last night, mixed with argan oil underneath my NZ Fusion Skin Clear cream (I&#x27;ve had some breakouts lately). When I woke up the breakouts were all but gone and my skin was smooth. Today I used it underneath my daytime moisturizer and my skin maintained it&#x27;s healthy appearance. I am really impressed with this oil and so happy to have found a source of true Madagascan tamanu oil. I only wish now that I had ordered it in a larger size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few words about tamanu/foraha oil in general: Both Slice of Nature and Teliaoils state on their amazon descriptions that Madgascan oil is favored over Tahitian but offered no explanation as to why this is so. I researched several websites to no avail. But here is what I have learned from personal experience: Madagascan absorbs more readily into the skin and the scent is less pungent. Both Madagascan oils that I have tried are lighter colored, tending more toward amber than green. The Tahitian oils are darker green in color and smell very strong. Now I have read that the season in which the nuts are harvested influences the color/smell, with Springtime producing the greener, more strong-smelling oil, so it may be a fluke that the Tahitian ones I&#x27;ve tried are green whereas the Madagascan ones are amber. But I do prefer the Madagascan, especially for my face as the greener ones bother my eyes. I use the green ones mixed with coconut oil as natural deodorant under my arms and on my feet. They work great for that. Both types worked great on a nasty bug bite that I got a few weeks ago which got infected. After 3 nights&#x27; use, the infection was gone and I am hard-pressed to find where the bite was now! Great for scarring if you put it on as soon as possible after an injury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teliaoils has comprehensive information available in their amazon description, stating where the oil comes from, how it is processed and the many uses for it. To me, this is the mark of an honest seller who cares about the product, and this is evident in everything from the quality of the product to the excellent packaging: packed with styro peanuts in a hard plastic container and wrapped securely, it arrived intact with no spillage or breakage of the glass bottle. The dropper is very sturdy as well. Believe me, I have ordered various oils from other sellers that are just dropped in a bubble mailer, which does not sit well with me. And they turned out to be inferior products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep in mind that because it ships from overseas, it will be several weeks before your order arrives. Your wait will be rewarded with the best tamanu/foraha oil available online!Tahitian oils are darker green in color and smell very strong.

            <li> I found this product online. I was looking for something to help with my psoriasis. This oil is amazing! It completely cleared up my psoriasis in a matter of days. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This Tamanu oil is shipped from Greece. It has a very light nutty smell, less pronounced compare to other brand I tried(Simpler Botanicals).  However, Simpler&#x27;s oil is so green and rich and full of healing \\&quot;goodness\\&quot;, it is still my number ONE choice.I applied it to my hand(I was stung by a wasp or a hornet yesterday. I still had some swelling and itching today). Itching and swelling dramatically reduced after few minutes. I think the greek product may make a better carrier oil, because it&#x27;s own smell is hardly noticeable.I make my own \\&quot;rescue remedy\\&quot; by mixing Tamanu oil with essential oil of Rosa Damascena - it improves my mood and helps relaxation.</li>
            <li> This Tamanu oil works great for Psoriasis (my husband has it on his legs and this oil gives him tremendous relief!</li>
            <li> I have tried other sellers/brands of Tamanu Oil.  Love this one, the nutty aroma is not as strong.  I will re-order this one.</li>
            <li> Delivery took a while but the seller was great with questions/communications. I cant really estimate whether or not its assisted in the healing process after the peels. But it does leave a temporary greasy feel on the skin after application. But eventually it melts into the skin. I personally wish i had gotten a much larger size b/c i think true assessment will be after a few months of use -not right away. But the bottle i purchased is nearly DONE. Good product as far as I can judge.</li>
            <li> I use it at night.  I have started to go to like the smell.  I alternate between other oils or combine for scar healing.  I like this product better than another companies as it&#x27;s liquid and has a glass dropper.</li>
            <li> Great Item! I&#x27;ve been reading so much about it, I decided to try it on my acne. It really works!!! It has a slight, weird, earthy smell... But you get used to it!</li>
            <li> I love the Tamanu Oil, I use it everyday for my face and in between my inner thighs. Its doesnt leave you feeling greasy and it is very moisturizing while absorbing odors. I have several people using it for multiple reasons, acne and muscle pains. Great stuff...just make sure you are getting 100% tamanu oil. there are some out there that mix oilive oil on top and the actual tamanu oil is sitting at the bottom!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT STUFF!!</li>
            <li> This product is an excellent quality of Tamanu oil.  I love the way it is packaged and the enclosed eye dropper is very helpful in dispensing the oil.  Great product!</li>
