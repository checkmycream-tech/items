            <li>It smells really nice.</li>
            <li>This product is, by far, the best I have found to beat the frizzies!  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say this is the miracle it professes to be, but it does help some with  volume and style with my very fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>Love this product, makes my hair very smooth.</li>
            <li>i like trying the latest products recommended by stylists.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes any appearance of damage disappear and makes my hair luxuriously healthy looking.</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing product ever, and I am usually pretty unimpressed by hair products!</li>
            <li>My hair feels so much healthier and has more shine to it!</li>
            <li>To my surprise, and pleasure, this product kept my hair under control and looking and feeling great the entire trip.  </li>
            <li>I used this under my hair gel and blew my hair into a sleek bob, finishing with a light mist of ElNett.</li>
            <li>the price was cheaper than the salon, shipping was quick, easy seller to deal with, highly recommend, this product is good too, makes my hair smoother and easier to manage and blow dry into a sleek style</li>
            <li>refinery 59 did an interview with popular hair stylist who recommended this product for short hair claiming it ups the  volume and tames the texture.</li>
            <li>The serum also left my hair with a lovely shyness.  </li>
            <li>First time using this product</li>
            <li>This works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>This is a find for my long fine hair!</li>
            <li>I used it and not only did it NOT give me volume, it made my hair full of grease!  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair that is stick straight in the back and wavy/frizzy in the front.</li>
            <li>Helps prevent frizzy hair, easier to blow hair out straight.</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
            <li>My hair gets very wavy, frizzy &amp; out of control in the summer when it&#x27;s humid.</li>
            <li>My hair-dresser recommended this product for control &amp; I really like it.</li>
            <li>Makes other products work better, but I also use it alone.</li>
            <li>However, this wella product gave my hair life and more volume than ever before without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure different people have different reactions to things, though.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you are looking for frizz control.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and have not had much luck finding something that will help keep my curls in shape without frizzing.  </li>
            <li>and I am always very cautious of hair products that can make hair soft because I already have issues with flyaways.</li>
            <li>Just one pump (at the most) applied to my towel dried hair allows me to blow out my hair to a soft, shiny, luxurious head of hair.  </li>
            <li>I am 47 years old, and my hair has never looked healthier until I started using Wella&#x27;s Volume Amplifier!</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft n manageable</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>and I dry it straight almost every day.</li>
            <li>Normally, my hair would either be flat all over or frizzy in front by now, even without being rained on.</li>
            <li>It does seem to tame the frizzies, and my curls keep their shape as long as I don&#x27;t mess with them too much. :)</li>
            <li>Before purchasing this product I was unable to blowout my hair effectively, frizz and all over visible dryness in result to the blowdryer heat was the cause of this.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to use too much of it though, as it is pretty think and weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li>it arrived in no time and works as recommended  hair isnt flat or lifeless but wavy and natural with no stickiness or stiffness..</li>
            <li>I think it works reasonably well for calming down frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small bottle, but that&#x27;s ok because a little dab goes a long way.</li>

            <li> The Velvet Amplifier Style Primer  is a concentrated serum that helps improve manageability and styling control. I then styled and blow-dried my hair. I have short hair and I found the serum tamed my hair without the stickiness or stiffness you  get from other products. The serum also left my hair with a lovely shyness.  You only need a really tiny amount, so this tube lasts a long time.[[ASIN:B004JUPQ2O Wella Professionals Velvet Amplifier 1.88 oz / 53.4 g Style Primer Serum Boosts]]</li>
            <li> i like trying the latest products recommended by stylists. refinery 59 did an interview with popular hair stylist who recommended this product for short hair claiming it ups the  volume and tames the texture. it arrived in no time and works as recommended  hair isnt flat or lifeless but wavy and natural with no stickiness or stiffness..good seller with great product.</li>
            <li> Use this product before blow drying hair. Helps prevent frizzy hair, easier to blow hair out straight. Nice product. Have been using it for over two years.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  I thought this would soften my hair and make it silky but it really doesn&#x27;t do much of anything. I was disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft n manageable</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I would highly recommend this to anyone. I have naturally curly hair and I dry it straight almost every day.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful to use this sparingly or your hair will be greasy.  I think it works reasonably well for calming down frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> First time using this product and I loved it. My hair feels so much healthier and has more shine to it!</li>
            <li> This is a find for my long fine hair! Smooths, and plumps without weight. Makes other products work better, but I also use it alone.</li>
            <li> My hair gets very wavy, frizzy &amp; out of control in the summer when it&#x27;s humid. My hair-dresser recommended this product for control &amp; I really like it. It&#x27;s a small bottle, but that&#x27;s ok because a little dab goes a long way. I have long hair and I only need 2 to 3 pea- size dabs for this to hold my hair. I highly recommend this product if you are looking for frizz control.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product I was unable to blowout my hair effectively, frizz and all over visible dryness in result to the blowdryer heat was the cause of this. However, this wella product gave my hair life and more volume than ever before without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I like this product. Very slight &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; good for a bit of texture without added greasiness. Used it before blow drying.</li>
            <li> the price was cheaper than the salon, shipping was quick, easy seller to deal with, highly recommend, this product is good too, makes my hair smoother and easier to manage and blow dry into a sleek style</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in volume, but I have noticed breakouts on my scalp. I&#x27;m sure different people have different reactions to things, though. It smells really nice.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say this is the miracle it professes to be, but it does help some with  volume and style with my very fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;Other products do the same, and I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> One pump per day does the trick, lasts for months.  Just use on last 3 inches of hair.  Eases any frizz and makes ends look finished and non-frizzy.  I don&#x27;t use a lot of products, but this is a must any time I leave the house.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and have not had much luck finding something that will help keep my curls in shape without frizzing.  This works pretty well.  Smells wonderful!  It does seem to tame the frizzies, and my curls keep their shape as long as I don&#x27;t mess with them too much. :)</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Gives good feel to hair</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing it in a magazine.  They said it&#x27;s great for volume.  I used it and not only did it NOT give me volume, it made my hair full of grease!  it&#x27;s too expensive to work so poorly</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy medium length hair, and have had excessive problems with frizz for years.  This product is, by far, the best I have found to beat the frizzies!  Just one pump (at the most) applied to my towel dried hair allows me to blow out my hair to a soft, shiny, luxurious head of hair.  Last week, I put it to the ultimate test when we went to the shore for a week.  This is when my frizzies are at their worst and completely out of control.  To my surprise, and pleasure, this product kept my hair under control and looking and feeling great the entire trip.  I am 47 years old, and my hair has never looked healthier until I started using Wella&#x27;s Volume Amplifier!</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair and I am always very cautious of hair products that can make hair soft because I already have issues with flyaways. I color my hair regularly to keep grays away, so it is also dry. This stuff makes any appearance of damage disappear and makes my hair luxuriously healthy looking. It doesn&#x27;t build-up either! Hairspray also bonds well to it, not making it white or flaky. I am truly impressed and happy with my purchase. Have repurchased three times now and will keep on it!</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair that is stick straight in the back and wavy/frizzy in the front. I used this under my hair gel and blew my hair into a sleek bob, finishing with a light mist of ElNett.Normally, my hair would either be flat all over or frizzy in front by now, even without being rained on. I got seriously rained on, yet I could just lightly fluff my hair dry with my fingers and the style remained. No funky bits in the front&#x27; and the back is still turned under. This is the most amazing product ever, and I am usually pretty unimpressed by hair products!</li>
            <li> Love this product, makes my hair very smooth. Be careful not to use too much of it though, as it is pretty think and weigh your hair down.</li>
