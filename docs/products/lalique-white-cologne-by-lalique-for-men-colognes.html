            <li>I brought this for my significant other and they loved it.</li>

            <li>You can&#x27;t find anyone alive who won&#x27;t enjoy being around you when you&#x27;re wearing this!&lt;br /&gt;Simply</li>

            <li>Good cologne for your everyday use</li>
            <li>From reading all of the positive reviews I&#x27;ve said to myself</li>
            <li>Too much pepper in the scent</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>And, this price on Amazon is so much wallet size than the&lt;br</li>
            <li>lasting and unique.</li>
            <li>An outburst of citrus at the top, then it dries down to a mellow violet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly when i recibed the product was ok, but now is seem like a fake one.&lt;br /&gt;You better save your money and dont buy fragances</li>
            <li>it smells somewhat sophisticated and perhaps more expensive than what it is, and I would say for mature guys ( 35 and up may be )</li>
            <li>, people will notice you by the fresh smell and aroma only given by a Lalique cologne</li>
            <li>I like this scent very much, I just wish it would last a bit longer and the projection was a little better...</li>
            <li>Bought this item from Amazon direct.</li>
            <li>The screw cap is damaged and the scent is completely evaporated before receiving it.</li>
            <li>The top chrome plate on the bottle was glued off center and is uneven vertically as well.</li>
            <li>bought this cologne due to the positive review on Youtube and man</li>
            <li>the price was good for the smell, It was cold smell</li>
            <li>which y us much cheaper than other places.</li>

            <li> Bought this item from Amazon direct. The scent it one of my favorites. Has a lemony wood smell that is very unique and great for daytime casual wear. Not synthetic at all. Longevity is good as well as sillage and projection on my skin. I will repurchase once my bottle is finished.</li>
            <li> I like this scent very much, I just wish it would last a bit longer and the projection was a little better...I probably will buy it again but I haven&#x27;t made up my mind yet.. I would say this is a good subtle office scent, great for the summer..it smells somewhat sophisticated and perhaps more expensive than what it is, and I would say for mature guys ( 35 and up may be )</li>
            <li> what can i say ? unbelievable frag i think this is what the heaven smells like . I&#x60;v tested two fragrance from lalique house so far and both of them are fantastic 5 stars a luxury masterpiece outstanding . now my winter Signature scent is Encre Noire and my summer Signature scent is Lalique White . you can&#x60;t go wrong with Lalique house the best fragrances house ever .</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance for men, perfect gift for the hubby. He loves it!</li>
            <li> Too much pepper in the scent Lalique makes esoteric scent this is not you run of the mill Tommy Hilfiger sport type of scent</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand this scent. It comes out as very weak to my nose.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe there are aspects of my nose that doesn&#x27;t cover the spectrum that lilique covers as a scent</li>
            <li> Smell good great price the only thing is in my case dont last more than 4 hours but is in my case</li>
            <li> the price was good for the smell, It was cold smell and I like it, good standing unique product...thanks. Also delivery was good</li>
            <li> I give to you 5 starts because you deserve  it. that experience with you was really great I am very happy to have business with you once again thank you and keep doing like that.</li>
            <li> Very nice unique scent. For the price, I consider this an under rated cologne. I can smell it 6 hrs after spraying. Not great longevity but not horrible.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased Lalique White 4.2oz, sold and fulfilled by Amazon. Shipping was fast and packing was OK. I received the cologne in a sealed box. Everything looks and smells authentic.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the manufacturer&#x27;s quality control leaves something to be desired. The top chrome plate on the bottle was glued off center and is uneven vertically as well. Not just a little bit ... you immediately notice. Given the manufacturing defect, I only gave 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, the bottle is not leaking and the sprayer is functional.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t find anyone alive who won&#x27;t enjoy being around you when you&#x27;re wearing this!&lt;br /&gt;Simply amazing!&lt;br /&gt;The house of Lalique didn&#x27;t disappoint at all with this one.&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting and unique.</li>
            <li> Nice lite sent for the summer</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually review cologne but when all the ladies at work followings me around asking for sniff, just passing by so I can smell u,  I&#x27;m loving every minute of it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful experience.....</li>
            <li> The Lalique White was purchased for a dear friend who loves this product.&lt;br /&gt;So, all I can do is give it the best review there is.  This is his second time asking&lt;br /&gt;me to get it for him.  And, this price on Amazon is so much wallet size than the&lt;br /&gt;department stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy AB</li>
            <li> Id totally recomend this product and the seller. Well worth it, if you like this fragance you should try it.&lt;br /&gt;You wont regret.&lt;br /&gt;Great experience.&lt;br /&gt;Totally satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly when i recibed the product was ok, but now is seem like a fake one.&lt;br /&gt;You better save your money and dont buy fragances online.&lt;br /&gt;For a few cents you can buy originals frangances from stores.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, &amp; smells very fresh and delightful!!!  You will not be disappointed at all!!! Everyone will ask what you are wearing.  I brought this for my significant other and they loved it.</li>
            <li> BOTTLE COVER DAMAGED. The product despite being well packed, by the smell, he suspected it was broken. Take photos to the product since I started in to manage evidence and lprefume DAMAGED WAS SHIPPED. The screw cap is damaged and the scent is completely evaporated before receiving it. I am very upset because descontentoy is a wonderful perfume that I have used but lamentablemtente came damaged.&lt;br /&gt;I would like that it be replaced as per the attached photos a defective product is evident. Compradoanteriormente already have other perfumes of different lines and I never had that happened.&lt;br /&gt;The damage occurred in packaging not in operation, not moving, was not well done.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate your cooperation because I&#x27;m a consistent buyer of Amazon and have the best references. Must be replaced. NOT how to contact the seller but I require to be replaced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TAPA DE BOTELLA DA&amp;Ntilde;ADA. El producto a pesar de estar bien empacado, por el olor, sospechaba que estaba roto. Tome fotos al producto desde que lo empece a manejar para dejar evidencia que e lprefume FUE DESPACHADO DA&amp;Ntilde;ADO. La rosca de la tapa se encuentra da&amp;ntilde;ada y el perfume se le evaporo completamente antes de recibirlo. Estoy muy descontentoy molesto porque es un maravilloso perfume que ya he utilizado pero lamentablemtente vino da&amp;ntilde;ado.&lt;br /&gt;Me gustaria que fuese sustituido ya que por las fotos anexas se evidencia un producto defectuoso. Ya he compradoanteriormente otros perfumes de diferentes lineas y nunca me habia sucedido eso.&lt;br /&gt;El da&amp;ntilde;o se produjo en el envasado no en el manejo, no en el traslado, no fue bien terminado.&lt;br /&gt;Agradezco su colaboracion porque soy un consecuente comprador de Amazon y tengo las mejores referencias. Debe ser sustituido. NO se como contactar al vendedor pero requiero sea sustituido</li>
            <li> An elegant, understated scent, just like the rest of the Lalique family.  This is a perfect scent for spring and summer.</li>
            <li> Nice and peppery, smoothness sets it off from the others. The reason for the 4 star rating and not a 5 is it&#x27;s longevity. Nice for the office</li>
            <li> From reading all of the positive reviews I&#x27;ve said to myself okay I&#x27;ll take a chance without  smelling it first , well that was one of the biggest mistake that I&#x27;ve ever made. This product really sucks and I could not understand what the other people like about it...</li>
            <li> An outburst of citrus at the top, then it dries down to a mellow violet. I found the scent works better on my skin than on the test paper.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this cologne due to the positive review on Youtube and man I did not regret it. Although it is winter season now, I still wear it a lot. For a light, refreshing frag, the longevity is good enough.</li>
            <li> Good cologne for your everyday use, people will notice you by the fresh smell and aroma only given by a Lalique cologne</li>
            <li> This is my son·s favorite. It smells like heaven! Very happy with it. It is totally worth the price which y us much cheaper than other places.</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s pretty good. I pick it up blindly. This is a good buy in my eyes I just like being different</li>
