            <li>This stuff smells so good.</li>
            <li>Very pleased and will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li>I LOVE DEVOTED CREATIONS!</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product smells amazing and my boyfriend has told me that this makes me look WAY darker than my Luminary</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice change from all the girly lotions they have out there.</li>
            <li>It smells nice too.</li>
            <li>It kind of has a cologne scent.</li>
            <li>Even without bronzer I produce a nice color after tanning.</li>
            <li>Smells great, absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>It applies very easily.</li>
            <li>Hero Worship is superior in getting good color, but really greasy.</li>
            <li>This is a very light lotion compared to others I have used.</li>
            <li>this is more of a gel, goes on very smoothly and does&#x27;t</li>
            <li>This is more like a gel than a lotion.</li>
            <li>But for color building, there&#x27;s better lotions.</li>
            <li>this stuff smells great and gets you tan fast.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it came with two free packets for my friends!</li>
            <li>and I have been in love since.  </li>
            <li>I love it, you can go tanning and not have that tanning smell when you are done.</li>
            <li>Being a gel, it goes on real smooth and dries cleanly...</li>
            <li>Couture Sports Lotion goes on easily and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, feels cool and clean, and is very lightweight.</li>
            <li>Absorbs cleanly and has a nice fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Perfect for guys who do not want to smell like the typical tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells great, I would like a cologne with the same fragrance.</li>
            <li>smells like a real good after shave and got me a few shades darker everytime</li>
            <li>goes on smoothly and adsorbs quickly,almost too quickly.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it isnt&#x27; so much a lotion, more like a serum</li>
            <li>Couture Sport wins its points for how cleanly it goes on, and how well it tends to eliminate the after-tan odor.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quick and is non greasy.....</li>
            <li>Unless your tanning salon offers promotional deals when buying a bottle in store, you&#x27;re better off buying your indoor tanning lotion online.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try</li>
            <li>I bought this from my salon because I got 50% off my first bottle</li>
            <li>A masculine but clean, all-day fragrance.</li>
            <li>However, this lotion is so lightweight that I&#x27;m even able to apply my Maui Babe after browning lotion (which I also highly recommend for a deep tan in a bed or outdoors) before bed.</li>
            <li>This serum is so smooth, very moisturizing and my tan is deep and lustrous.  </li>
            <li>It covers tan odor VERY well.</li>
            <li>For color, it does enhance, but nothing very drastic.</li>
            <li>but I really did not like the way the silicone made my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>It has a very normal cologne type smell.</li>
            <li>It does not leave any residue or come off on clothes like many other lotions.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>is totally OMG worth it.</li>
            <li>It seems okay as far as tanning, but does not have a dark look after tanning like bronzer lotions.</li>
            <li>i always like to go tanning for about a week before i go down to california because i burn easily.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve received the bottle and used it a few times, I&#x27;m sure that this is the exact same lotion my salon charges $6 a packet for and $54 a bottle.</li>
            <li>three stars due to the smell,like that of cheap cologne.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and seems to be an average lotion as far an tanning results.</li>
            <li>Smells clean and not girly (similar to HW, i think it&#x27;s like regular Dial bar soap.)</li>
            <li>Product goes on easily, and is absorbed well, leaving no residue behind.</li>
            <li>Couture Sport is the only one I have found that REALLY does smell masculine.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want any bronzers because I am working on an all natural tan.  </li>
            <li>So far, this is my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;BTW...</li>
            <li>Also, this lotion has a considerable amount of tyrosene in it which really does help create a deep dark tan.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought this stuff at one of the local tanning salons. They totally overcharged me (go figure) for a price of $60. So it being sold here for a third of that is totally OMG worth it. It disappears on your skin and has a \\&quot;manly\\&quot; scent to it. I definately recommend it to any guy out there wanting to get a good tan.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for my husband, but I have also used it. I usually use it when I have somewhere to go after tanning. It smells like men&#x27;s cologne and there is not an after tan smell. This is more like a gel than a lotion. If your looking for a creamy lotion then get something different. It goes on easy and seems to be an average lotion as far an tanning results.</li>
            <li> I have ordered many tanning lotions because they claim to be \\&quot;for men\\&quot;, only to be disappointed. Couture Sport is the only one I have found that REALLY does smell masculine. It covers tan odor VERY well. Leaves no residue. Perfect for the man on the go.</li>
            <li> same product that is sold at my tanning salon for half the price including shipping. I will order again. thank you.</li>
            <li> Being a gel, it goes on real smooth and dries cleanly... no real greasy feeling afterward. For color, it does enhance, but nothing very drastic. I use this and Hero Worship. Hero Worship is superior in getting good color, but really greasy. Couture Sport wins its points for how cleanly it goes on, and how well it tends to eliminate the after-tan odor. But for color building, there&#x27;s better lotions. Smells clean and not girly (similar to HW, i think it&#x27;s like regular Dial bar soap.)</li>
            <li> Best Tanning lotion that I&#x27;ve ever found for tanning beds...my wife and I both use it.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quick and is non greasy..... best I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> i always like to go tanning for about a week before i go down to california because i burn easily. this stuff smells great and gets you tan fast. it&#x27;s a nice change from all the girly lotions they have out there. it also feels a lot lights on your skin than those heavy lotions. this is more of a gel, goes on very smoothly and does&#x27;t make you sticky.</li>
            <li> Couture Sports Lotion goes on easily and absorbs well.  It does not leave any residue or come off on clothes like many other lotions.  However, I am still not convinced of its tanning qualities.  It seems okay as far as tanning, but does not have a dark look after tanning like bronzer lotions.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is amazing. It smells great, feels cool and clean, and is very lightweight. Personally, I like to go tanning in the evening and I shower in the morning. Heavy lotions bothered me because sleeping with a greasy feel is no fun. However, this lotion is so lightweight that I&#x27;m even able to apply my Maui Babe after browning lotion (which I also highly recommend for a deep tan in a bed or outdoors) before bed. Also, this lotion has a considerable amount of tyrosene in it which really does help create a deep dark tan. My salon warned me about the quality of online products but this seller is deinitely trustworthy. I have to admit, i was a bit skeptical. Now that I&#x27;ve received the bottle and used it a few times, I&#x27;m sure that this is the exact same lotion my salon charges $6 a packet for and $54 a bottle. Unless your tanning salon offers promotional deals when buying a bottle in store, you&#x27;re better off buying your indoor tanning lotion online. Oh, and it came with two free packets for my friends!</li>
            <li> Smells great, absorbs quickly.  I was using Luminary by Designer Skin but I really did not like the way the silicone made my skin feel.  I switched to Devoted Creations Couture Sport and I have been in love since.  This product smells amazing and my boyfriend has told me that this makes me look WAY darker than my Luminary ever did!  It&#x27;s half the price of what I paid for Luminary so I would definitely recommend this product.  Does not contain DHA which usually smells horrible, so thats another plus!  In all, I&#x27;d recommend this lotion to anyone who like good smelling DHA-free bronzers.  I LOVE DEVOTED CREATIONS!</li>
            <li> three stars due to the smell,like that of cheap cologne. goes on smoothly and adsorbs quickly,almost too quickly. leaves your skin feeling dry. not moisturized. it&#x27;s hard to find a tanning lotion that doesn&#x27;t contain self bronzing agents.i gave it a shot. on to the next.</li>
            <li> After using this product for almost a month, I&#x27;ve noticed quite a difference in the deep bronze color of my skin. Product goes on easily, and is absorbed well, leaving no residue behind. Also leaves no smell behind after tanning. Very pleased and will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This tanning serum (not lotion) is great!! I bought this from my salon because I got 50% off my first bottle and this is what the girl suggested.  I didn&#x27;t want any bronzers because I am working on an all natural tan.  This serum is so smooth, very moisturizing and my tan is deep and lustrous.  It smells nice too. A masculine but clean, all-day fragrance. No one can even tell I went tanning and I go before work quite often.  So far, this is my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;BTW... I am going to try DC&#x27;s Blonde Obsession so that my tan will plateau and then I will alternate between the two. I heard mixing your lotions can be very effective.</li>
            <li> Perfect for guys who do not want to smell like the typical tanning lotions. This lotions also works great!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so good. It kind of has a cologne scent. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. He swears by it and loves how it smells. Absorbs cleanly and has a nice fresh smell. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and my friend loves it.  trades off using this with another bronzer. smells so good and great price</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other tanning lotions so I can&#x27;t compare it, but I got it because I don&#x27;t want a bronzer, just want to accelerate the tan. The clerks at the salon I use tell me they like this lotion the best because it smells so good when you&#x27;re tanning.</li>
            <li> great lotion, doesnt leave nasty residue. great for indoor or outdoor tanning&lt;br /&gt;smells great&lt;br /&gt;it isnt&#x27; so much a lotion, more like a serum</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a week. So far I&#x27;ve enjoyed it. It smells incredible and has helped accelerate my tan. Nothing dramatic but it smells great for men and I don&#x27;t mind leaving the tanning booth smelling sporty. Definitely worth a try</li>
            <li> I use this every time I tan! I like the smell. I&#x27;m a guy and I don&#x27;t want to smell fruity after I can and this just smells like cologne! I would buy again!</li>
            <li> This serum smells great and isn&#x27;t greasy.  I like the men&#x27;s cologne smell (even though I&#x27;m a girl)  Great price too.</li>
            <li> Great tanning lotion for men. I love it, you can go tanning and not have that tanning smell when you are done. It has a very normal cologne type smell.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great, I would like a cologne with the same fragrance. This is a very light lotion compared to others I have used. It applies very easily. Even without bronzer I produce a nice color after tanning.</li>
            <li> smells like a real good after shave and got me a few shades darker everytime I wore it! Would buy again.</li>
