            <li> It was late getting to me</li>
            <li> it was late.</li>

            <li> This wig cap is terrible!  does not have the wide band around the bottom to keep it from sliding up, and is much smaller than other wig caps I have bought. Additionally, the fabric is very slippery and keeps slipping off my head! It took forever to come, and now I am stuck without any of my old ones left, and only these horrible, useless ones. Additionally, after trying to put them on once, they became all stretched out and unusable again! I would give it zero stars if I could. There is nothing I like about this item.</li>
