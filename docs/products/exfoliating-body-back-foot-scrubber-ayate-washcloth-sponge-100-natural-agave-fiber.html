            <li> I like to exfoliate about once per week, and have used other scrubbers, or polishing gloves in the past.  I was looking forward to trying this Ayate Washcloth, because it is all natural, and eco-friendly.  We were grateful to receive our first purchase at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.  The washcloth comes with instructions for preparation, which were very helpful.  My skin feels so smooth, after use, and has a healthy glow.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Does exfoliate well.  A little small on the size.</li>
            <li> Two words...“love it&amp;#34; I been look for a great exfoliator for months I finally found it .... Thanks vi-tae and I would like to thank amazon, because, if it wasn&#x27;t for them I wouldn&#x27;t known about this item...  I will be back to purchase this one again once needed. Ps. K.S</li>
            <li> Excellent quality material! don&#x27;t know what else to say, just a great product.</li>
            <li> I was asked to review the exfoliating body scrubber ayate washcloth. I have always used a loofah sponge because I just like the way it exfoliates my skin even my face. I now have a new fav! I love this washcloth! It works just like a regular washcloth. It&#x27;s like a washcloth and a loofah sponge in one! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Fantastic for dry brushing before a shower and excellent with shower gel or soap in the shower to clean, exfoliate, and feel energized. I&#x27;ve searched long and hard for just the right fiber for the shower, finally found it. It&#x27;s a must try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I promise.</li>
            <li> Really feels good! Just the right amount of scrub and silky too.</li>
            <li> I have always used Exfoliating Scrubbers and this one is excellent.</li>
            <li> very scratchy and do not like it. sorry</li>
            <li> I love that this Exfoliating Body Scrubber is 100 percent natural.  After using this in the shower, my skin felt very clean and refreshed.  I also felt like my lotion absorbed into my skin better and faster after using this washcloth.  It left my skin feeling invigorated and energized.  I felt like I had just come back from the spa. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I never heard of thos exfoliating body scrubber until noe. Im very surprised at how it works its not to harsh and is perfect for my hole body!  It leave my skin so soft  and its perfect to use before I apply my self tanning cream.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with an Ayate washcloth. After trying this for the first time, I absolutely loved it. Every time I use it I like it even more. The wash cloth looks hard when you get it but, as soon as it hits water, it shrinks up and gets thicker. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks and have found it to provide a good balance of exfoliation. My skin skin feels so clean and soft after using this. I have also noticed less ingrown hairs and my lotion absorbs into the skin so much better. I love that its not rough nor abrasive and is very exhilarating and refreshing. Overall it&#x27;s effective, doesn&#x27;t smell or get mildew, and is still like new. It&#x27;s great what more can I ask for! I purchased this product at a discount, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li> I love your products and showing all my friends.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Just what I needed,  Never liked scrunchies from Body Shop, etc. as they are too thick in my hands.  This fit the bill and the fiber is fantastic.  Makes your skin so nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Pretty fabulous exfoliating cloth.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have been a customer of these scrubbers for a few years now and have bought them as gifts too. Long lasting. Nothing negative to say about it.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a quality product. I use it in the shower with bar soap and it lathers wonderfully. It feels good when you use it, however I cannot say that my skin is any better because of it. It claims to make skin smoother and brighter, and even reduce cellulite. I haven&#x27;t noticed any of these things.</li>
            <li> Great product. Equally smooth and exfoliating.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to soak the cloth for 24 hours and at first it kind of glues itself together in a blob, but just be patient.  Then stretch it out and it&#x27;s ready to go.  I keep it in the shower and just run it under the water and it softens immediately so I can use it on my body, arms and legs.  It exfoliates great when I use it dry.  Would be nice if it were a little bigger, mine is roughly 7&amp;#34; x 7&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I purchased this exfoliating body washcloth in the hopes that it would rejuvenate my tired looking skin.  After several uses with this product, my skin looks very fresh.  It no longer looks dull.  It is soft and seems to glow.  In addition to using the washcloth on my arms and legs, I also use it on the bottom of my feet.  It softened the rough skin on my heels and took away some achiness in my feet.  There is a soft abrasive feel, but it is the washcloth doing its work and is non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the ayate washcloth came with a detailed instructions sheet.  It explains that it needs to soak in water overnight prior to the first use to get it ready to be used.  The washcloth can be used with just water, soap, or shower gel.  It is made with natural fibers and is more sanitary and effective than a loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  I love how this exfoliating washcloth makes my skin look and feel.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is awesome I had no idea something that looks so simple could work so well.  It&#x27;s a lot bigger than what expected.  The material is super strong but yet leaves your skin so soft.  I used mine and then used some lotion and it makes a huge difference.  Great product  I got this free or at a discounted price for my honest feedback</li>
            <li> This is by far the best washcloth ever. Ive never seen an exfoliating one like this before. My skin is beyond soft. Its very nice quality also. And rinses nicely. Very easy to use. Its not to hard on yours skin. I love this and how much skin looks. This is definitely a must have item of mine.</li>
            <li> The material is too hard for me! it is too strong for my body Exfoliating. but i use it for feet once a week.</li>
            <li> Almost 50% less expensive than the Biomelements but same quality. Very happy with my cloths, and I got one for my husband, too. He uses one to scrub his bald head after he shaves it weekly. It prevents ingrown hair.</li>
