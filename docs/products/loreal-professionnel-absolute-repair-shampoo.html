            <li>If the $26.29 price of this 18.9 oz shampoo seems too good to be true, you are correct!  </li>
            <li>/&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to Happily Use Loreal 5 damage repair shampoo and conditioner..and most importantly aphogee shampoo and 2minute reconstructor.</li>

            <li>is the best shampoo for my hair that is on the market and  at a reasonable price too.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I honestly cannot believe this stuff has gotten such good reviews...</li>
            <li>And trust me not every salon carries this product so buying on Amazon is a huge money and time saver.</li>
            <li>It was a huge disappointent because both of them &amp;#34;exploded&amp;#34; in the box.</li>
            <li>This product is simply fantastic.....</li>
            <li>I think it wasn&#x27;t loreal inside, just a cheap shampoo.</li>
            <li>It gives a smooth and light feel.</li>
            <li>This whole line is excellent and brought back the silkiness to my hair!</li>
            <li>It is a really good product, and the seller is completely recommended.</li>
            <li>I like the conditioner, its fine, nothing special.</li>
            <li>These actually leave my hair feeling healthy shiny nice and strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the original Loreal..</li>
            <li>I waited so excited for this product to arrive.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price!</li>
            <li>After using the lactic acid line for nearly a year now-even my stylist has commented on how much more healthy my hair feels and looks.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Product is OK, but the Aveda repair products makes the hair feel much smoother before conditioning.</li>
            <li>It is fair enough.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair super tangled...</li>
            <li>I thought i had not rinsed it out enough, so I ran it under the faucet one more time to be sure i got everything out.</li>
            <li>Leaves my heavily treated hair soft and smooth and looking wonderful!</li>
            <li>Good for dry and freezy hair.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Spendy, but worth it</li>
            <li>I love the Loreal Professional Color Shampoo/Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I used many hair products including others in Loreal, but this reduced my hairfall to a considerable extent.</li>
            <li>is healthy and not heavy with the use of this shampoo</li>
            <li>I am still able to highlight my hair without worry about my hair becoming too dry.  </li>
            <li>It was greasy right after my shower.</li>
            <li>It was these products that I used for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention for the first time ever I got mattes in my hair after the shower?!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product-try it and you&#x27;ll be addicted, too!</li>
            <li>I highlight, so you can imagine how good it feels to not have dried out, frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>If I use the repair system too many days in a row it does start to make your hair feel &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; so after several uses I started to switch between this system and a high end hydrating system.</li>
            <li>After coloring and aging in general, my hair had become kind of coarse.  </li>
            <li>the rest of my hair (the most damaged part) still felt as dry as straw,</li>
            <li>My hair feels very dry and wacky.</li>
            <li>its costs soooo much in salons....</li>
            <li>Thanks to L&#x27;Oreal and Absolut Repair</li>
            <li>This was not the real deal.  </li>
            <li>come to find out it really wasn&#x27;t as this is nothing like the shampoo I had gotten before.</li>
            <li>I am really dissapointed</li>
            <li>I got this product for much cheaper than I would from my Hair stylist.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo!</li>
            <li>I already knew the range of products and are very good.&lt;br /&gt;good price for the quantity.</li>
            <li>It is concentrated so you really dont have to use that much.</li>
            <li>It absolutely works wonders.</li>
            <li>I got this shampoo because my salon uses professional loreal products, and i want to find out how to get my hair to feel like it does fresh out of the salon...</li>
            <li>The lactic acid formula really does work to plump and condition the strands of the hair.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product</li>
            <li>I would recommend it over most of other shampoos that I have tried.</li>
            <li>before I used L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Neofibrine Repairing Shampoo for Very Damaged Hair for the first time.</li>
            <li>and I live in a very humid State...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very creamy almost like a conditioner, would recommend this product leaves your hair really soft.</li>
            <li>(once a week is my normal time)</li>
            <li>a few more times before I decide to use the straightener.</li>
            <li>It honestly felt like there was a thick oily film on my roots but</li>
            <li>The last time my stylist highlighted me she somehow fried the more dry prone areas of my head (crown, layers, etc).</li>
            <li>Atlastm, I found this shampoo and other related products on amazon for a reasonable price :)</li>
            <li>One girl said it maybe the new Lactic Acid in the ingredients?</li>
            <li>This is a real review by a real individual who has absolutely nothing to do with Loreal.</li>
            <li>It makes her hair very soft and she uses just a dab</li>
            <li>I trued few other products here but none of those products were as good as this one is....</li>
            <li>is.&lt;br /&gt;i felt that not good for very oily hair, but good for dry and verydamage hair.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry fine hair and use several products including Moroccan Oil</li>
            <li>A chemical straightener will take the frizz out and comes with such rich conditioners that your hair is soft and manageable and you don&#x27;t even have to use a flat iron with it.</li>
            <li>I had purchased loreal before and it was great product, this shampoo make our hair grassy and looks like dirty.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair twice and used the L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Conditioner, rinsing it out immediately.</li>
            <li>just turns it soft &amp; silky....</li>
            <li>It takes twice as much shampoo to lather up and hair is left frizzy and unconditioned.  </li>
            <li>I found this product to be so calming and hydrating for my naturally curly, sometimes colored hair.</li>
            <li>My over-processed, brittle hair transformed into soft, touchable hair over a matter of weeks.</li>
            <li>But..in the shower it made my hair feel a bit straw like..not really soft as I thought it would feel.</li>
            <li>This is the professional grade conditioner so there may be some experts out there who can tell me what the difference is.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s conditioner counterpart completely saved my hair.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo makes my hair feel soft.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair so soft and shiny</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny, and so manageable.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see much difference between this and the other Loreal conditioner I bought at the supermarket really.  </li>
            <li>but it was so soft and shiny, especially compared to normal,</li>
            <li>I usually purchase the smaller Absolut Repair shampoo, but when I saw this I thought it was a better deal....</li>
            <li>This shampoo is just an ordinary shampoo, but the balm I found made a huge difference in the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li>Ok, I have used  A LOT of different repair shampoos and the biggest complaint I have had thus far</li>
            <li>I color my hair about every 4 weeks and refresh the color every 2 weeks only because I have very vibrant red hair.</li>
            <li>The new girl at work today said, \\&quot;Your hair looks different.</li>
            <li>I been buying so many products for my hair, and believe me my hair is so hard to please!</li>
            <li>It really helps dry hair.</li>
            <li>Ina MAJOR way.</li>
            <li>However, for the purpose of a deep cleaning it did ok, no better than the generic brands in my oppinion.</li>
            <li>Smell is different and the foam is too much than normal as if it is added with other liquids rather than the shampoo..</li>
            <li>Then I put on the L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Masque and left it on while I finished showering about 10 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>I have my young hair back!  </li>
            <li>My hair is normal to dry and this shampoo left soft, silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have been through the wringer the last 3 years with my hair and it became very overprocessed, dry and damaged.  </li>
            <li>use this with the Intense Repair Masque....and other Loreal conditioners..what a suprise...</li>
            <li>My hair felt softer than it normally does with other shampoos.</li>
            <li>Not worth the really high price.</li>
            <li>The first time around you will see very little soap suds because it is going to work on the dirt and grime.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> These actually leave my hair feeling healthy shiny nice and strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the original Loreal..</li>
            <li> I waited so excited for this product to arrive.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> After using the lactic acid line for nearly a year now-even my stylist has commented on how much more healthy my hair feels and looks.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.  </li>
            <li> Product is OK, but the Aveda repair products makes the hair feel much smoother before conditioning.</li>
            <li> It is fair enough.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super tangled...</li>
            <li> I thought i had not rinsed it out enough, so I ran it under the faucet one more time to be sure i got everything out.</li>
            <li> Leaves my heavily treated hair soft and smooth and looking wonderful!</li>
            <li> Good for dry and freezy hair.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Spendy, but worth it</li>
            <li> I love the Loreal Professional Color Shampoo/Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I used many hair products including others in Loreal, but this reduced my hairfall to a considerable extent.</li>
            <li> is healthy and not heavy with the use of this shampoo</li>
            <li> I am still able to highlight my hair without worry about my hair becoming too dry.  </li>
            <li> It was greasy right after my shower.</li>
            <li> It was these products that I used for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention for the first time ever I got mattes in my hair after the shower?!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product-try it and you&#x27;ll be addicted, too!</li>
            <li> I highlight, so you can imagine how good it feels to not have dried out, frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> If I use the repair system too many days in a row it does start to make your hair feel &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; so after several uses I started to switch between this system and a high end hydrating system.</li>
            <li> After coloring and aging in general, my hair had become kind of coarse.  </li>
            <li> the rest of my hair (the most damaged part) still felt as dry as straw,</li>
            <li> My hair feels very dry and wacky.</li>
            <li> its costs soooo much in salons....</li>
            <li> Thanks to L&#x27;Oreal and Absolut Repair</li>
            <li> This was not the real deal.  </li>
            <li> come to find out it really wasn&#x27;t as this is nothing like the shampoo I had gotten before.</li>
            <li> I am really dissapointed</li>
            <li> I got this product for much cheaper than I would from my Hair stylist.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I already knew the range of products and are very good.&lt;br /&gt;good price for the quantity.</li>
            <li> It is concentrated so you really dont have to use that much.</li>
            <li> It absolutely works wonders.</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo because my salon uses professional loreal products, and i want to find out how to get my hair to feel like it does fresh out of the salon...</li>
            <li> The lactic acid formula really does work to plump and condition the strands of the hair.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product</li>
            <li> I would recommend it over most of other shampoos that I have tried.</li>
            <li> before I used L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Neofibrine Repairing Shampoo for Very Damaged Hair for the first time.</li>
            <li> and I live in a very humid State...</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very creamy almost like a conditioner, would recommend this product leaves your hair really soft.</li>
            <li> (once a week is my normal time)</li>
            <li> a few more times before I decide to use the straightener.</li>
            <li> It honestly felt like there was a thick oily film on my roots but</li>
            <li> The last time my stylist highlighted me she somehow fried the more dry prone areas of my head (crown, layers, etc).</li>
            <li> Atlastm, I found this shampoo and other related products on amazon for a reasonable price :)</li>
            <li> One girl said it maybe the new Lactic Acid in the ingredients?</li>
            <li> This is a real review by a real individual who has absolutely nothing to do with Loreal.</li>
            <li> It makes her hair very soft and she uses just a dab</li>
            <li> I trued few other products here but none of those products were as good as this one is....</li>
            <li> is.&lt;br /&gt;i felt that not good for very oily hair, but good for dry and verydamage hair.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry fine hair and use several products including Moroccan Oil</li>
            <li> A chemical straightener will take the frizz out and comes with such rich conditioners that your hair is soft and manageable and you don&#x27;t even have to use a flat iron with it.</li>
            <li> I had purchased loreal before and it was great product, this shampoo make our hair grassy and looks like dirty.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair twice and used the L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Conditioner, rinsing it out immediately.</li>
            <li> just turns it soft &amp; silky....</li>
            <li> It takes twice as much shampoo to lather up and hair is left frizzy and unconditioned.  </li>
            <li> I found this product to be so calming and hydrating for my naturally curly, sometimes colored hair.</li>
            <li> My over-processed, brittle hair transformed into soft, touchable hair over a matter of weeks.</li>
            <li> But..in the shower it made my hair feel a bit straw like..not really soft as I thought it would feel.</li>
            <li> This is the professional grade conditioner so there may be some experts out there who can tell me what the difference is.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s conditioner counterpart completely saved my hair.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair feel soft.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair so soft and shiny</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny, and so manageable.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see much difference between this and the other Loreal conditioner I bought at the supermarket really.  </li>
            <li> but it was so soft and shiny, especially compared to normal,</li>
            <li> I usually purchase the smaller Absolut Repair shampoo, but when I saw this I thought it was a better deal....</li>
            <li> This shampoo is just an ordinary shampoo, but the balm I found made a huge difference in the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> Ok, I have used  A LOT of different repair shampoos and the biggest complaint I have had thus far</li>
            <li> I color my hair about every 4 weeks and refresh the color every 2 weeks only because I have very vibrant red hair.</li>
            <li> The new girl at work today said, \\&quot;Your hair looks different.</li>
            <li> I been buying so many products for my hair, and believe me my hair is so hard to please!</li>
            <li> It really helps dry hair.</li>
            <li> Ina MAJOR way.</li>
            <li> However, for the purpose of a deep cleaning it did ok, no better than the generic brands in my oppinion.</li>
            <li> Smell is different and the foam is too much than normal as if it is added with other liquids rather than the shampoo..</li>
            <li> Then I put on the L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Masque and left it on while I finished showering about 10 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> I have my young hair back!  </li>
            <li> My hair is normal to dry and this shampoo left soft, silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have been through the wringer the last 3 years with my hair and it became very overprocessed, dry and damaged.  </li>
            <li> use this with the Intense Repair Masque....and other Loreal conditioners..what a suprise...</li>
            <li> My hair felt softer than it normally does with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> Not worth the really high price.</li>
            <li> The first time around you will see very little soap suds because it is going to work on the dirt and grime.  </li>
            <li> I relocated to the United States and noticed that this particular shampoo is not available in local shops.</li>
            <li> I would say only use this on coarse, curly, dry hair.</li>
            <li> so it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> think the price is high for such a small bottle and would&lt;br /&gt;not buy for myself.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo, please buy the conditioner which is a must, for all dry, damaged, frizzy hair...</li>
            <li> Vendor shipped earlier than expected ship date.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that needs all the conditioning available.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since long</li>
            <li> My hair is now shinny which it hasn&#x27;t been in a long time.</li>
            <li> tried fixing my hair like normal but ended up putting my hair up with a thick head band for the next 24 hours to cover up the monstrosity.</li>
            <li> alternate it with other shampoos by Loreal.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> My hair was badly damaged, and it&#x27;s going to take a&lt;br /&gt;few more shampoos, but I can definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> So that you understand how dry, I didn&#x27;t wash it for two weeks</li>
            <li> I have found my cure for dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing shampoo I have found for my hair, which tends to be coarser and dry</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still really dry.</li>
            <li> She couldtn&#x27;t believe how dry my hair was</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m post menopausal and my hair had gotten so dry and scraggly</li>
            <li> My hair is supper damaged, dry, curyl and frizy.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product, which is a shame because I absolutely love the absolute repair conditioning spray from the same line.</li>
            <li> Beware - the shampoo is marked down because the product is watered down.</li>
            <li> It was finally controllable after about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get any type of lather with it, so I ended up throwing it away and returning to my previous purchase of the smaller bottle.</li>
            <li> I have a relaxed hair that is very dry</li>
            <li> I did put in a little leave-in conditioner I regularly use as well.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly, dry, frizzy hair....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> My hair was breaking at a rapid alarming rate no matter what I did.  </li>
            <li> , I did go to makeupalley.com and there are a few similar reviews on that site.</li>
            <li> I find my hair stays cleaner after using this shampoo than any other product that I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I was 12 weeks away from my wedding and extremely upset.</li>
            <li> However, once I received it I found that the product is NOT the same quality as the one purchased from my hair salon (smaller 8.45 oz size costing approximately $21.00).  </li>
            <li> I have a naturally curly hair, very thick</li>
            <li> Either this was not the real Loreal product, or something went terribly wrong in production/packaging.</li>
            <li> Too heavy - weighed my hair down.  </li>
            <li> My stylist turned me on to this shampoo -- it&#x27;s a little pricey, but it will save your hair.</li>
            <li> This came with shampoo all spilled out in the package and got over other items that it was shipped with -- it was a mess!!</li>
            <li> After two weeks, my hair was starting to get some oil in it but not enough that it looked or felt dirty.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money by trying to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not as thick as expected.</li>
            <li> It was WAY too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves roots greasy like they haven&#x27;t even been washed and makes my hair heavy and dull.</li>
            <li> It is a product concetrado, requiring a small amount.</li>
            <li> It smelled awful, didn&#x27;t lather well, and left my hair feeling more dirty than before I washed it.  </li>
            <li> Not happy and not worth the money</li>
            <li> no moisture whatsoever, and it was hard to brush.</li>
            <li> Never again at least from here.</li>
            <li> so I am forced to buy it online.  </li>
            <li> Im seriously at a loss.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because it was not the same.</li>
            <li> I have color treated thin hair and</li>
            <li> I just know I cannot believe i spent $23 on this crap.</li>
            <li> Feel like this may be a fake.</li>
            <li> Its FAKE..</li>
            <li> I blew it dry and could not believe how awful my hair felt.</li>
            <li> My hair suffers terribly in the winter - the dry heat, cold, and lack of moisture makes my hair brittle and prone to severe breakage.</li>
            <li> Really bad and wont buy it again.</li>
            <li> Sometimes people don&#x27;t realize that their water is what makes the hair look bad.</li>
            <li> Gave it away! :(</li>
            <li> Horrible, made my hair sticky and greasy looking.</li>
            <li> OMG I have never used something this terrible.</li>
            <li> It is awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> my niece asked for this so I had no idea of the product,&lt;br /&gt;I think the price is high for such a small bottle and would&lt;br /&gt;not buy for myself.</li>
            <li> Horrible, made my hair sticky and greasy looking. Did not order from amazon, actually bought this at my hair salon. I am, 5 days later, still trying to get the residue out of my roots from the only 2 times I used it. Very disappointed in this product, which is a shame because I absolutely love the absolute repair conditioning spray from the same line. Will be returning this for my money back.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, wonderful stuff! I have extremely dry and frizzy hair. So that you understand how dry, I didn&#x27;t wash it for two weeks (once a week is my normal time) before I used L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Neofibrine Repairing Shampoo for Very Damaged Hair for the first time. After two weeks, my hair was starting to get some oil in it but not enough that it looked or felt dirty. It was finally controllable after about a week and a half. When I used the shampoo, I immediately felt a difference. My hair felt softer than it normally does with other shampoos. It felt like I was conditioning it. I washed my hair twice and used the L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Conditioner, rinsing it out immediately. Then I put on the L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Masque and left it on while I finished showering about 10 minutes or so. I did put in a little leave-in conditioner I regularly use as well. I was going to put a chemical straightener on it after I used this shampoo but it was so soft and shiny, especially compared to normal, that I changed my mind and will use this shampoo and conditioners a few more times before I decide to use the straightener. A chemical straightener will take the frizz out and comes with such rich conditioners that your hair is soft and manageable and you don&#x27;t even have to use a flat iron with it. But, this shampoo and the conditioners are almost as good as a straightener without the chemicals. The new girl at work today said, \\&quot;Your hair looks different. What did you do to it?\\&quot;. It was these products that I used for the first time yesterday.  This is a real review by a real individual who has absolutely nothing to do with Loreal. I plan to post this same review for all three products. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different and what works for me may not be the thing for you but you will not know unless you try it.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo, please buy the conditioner which is a must, for all dry, damaged, frizzy hair...I have extremely curly, dry, frizzy hair.... this repairs it in a matter of 2 weeks...just turns it soft &amp; silky....I love it....its costs soooo much in salons....best price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Product is OK, but the Aveda repair products makes the hair feel much smoother before conditioning. Have to use alot of product for longer hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product keeps my hair shiny and Healthy .&lt;br /&gt;I I recommend to everyone. If you can try it and you will see the difference</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for! Vendor shipped earlier than expected ship date. Very pleased with the product and the service.</li>
            <li> My hair is normal to dry and this shampoo left soft, silky and shiny. It is a product concetrado, requiring a small amount. The performance is very good.</li>
            <li> If the $26.29 price of this 18.9 oz shampoo seems too good to be true, you are correct!  I couldn&#x27;t believe that the manufacturer would drop the cost of this large size container and was so happy to find it.  However, once I received it I found that the product is NOT the same quality as the one purchased from my hair salon (smaller 8.45 oz size costing approximately $21.00).  Beware - the shampoo is marked down because the product is watered down. When compared to the product I purchased from my salon (I still have some) it is SO obvious. It takes twice as much shampoo to lather up and hair is left frizzy and unconditioned.  I wasted my money by trying to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> Good price for this product</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not as thick as expected. Takes 10-15 pumps to get a good lather and I have medium length hair. I was hoping for more at this price.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about 5 years ago when my salon carried it and it honestly improved my hair.  Now I can&#x27;t find it ANYWHERE in stores so I am forced to buy it online.  This is definitely a shampoo that you have to lather, rinse, and REPEAT!  The first time around you will see very little soap suds because it is going to work on the dirt and grime.  It&#x27;s expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I been buying so many products for my hair, and believe me my hair is so hard to please! I have a naturally curly hair, very thick and I live in a very humid State... Florida, so with all this factors I need a good conditioner for my type of hair and to beat up the frizziness that the weather could cause to my hair. This is one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;d like to try the mask as well, definitely I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it but definitely not a big fan. Makes my hair super tangled...</li>
            <li> Same as Salon overpriced product.</li>
            <li> I got this ones and my sister love the shampoo</li>
            <li> I have long hair that needs all the conditioning available.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best shampoo for my hair that is on the market and  at a reasonable price too.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Since I started using it, I can see some improvement in the softness of my hair.  My hair was badly damaged, and it&#x27;s going to take a&lt;br /&gt;few more shampoos, but I can definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be so calming and hydrating for my naturally curly, sometimes colored hair. Spendy, but worth it</li>
            <li> I can not sing the praises of this shampoo enough.  I have been through the wringer the last 3 years with my hair and it became very overprocessed, dry and damaged.  Thanks to L&#x27;Oreal and Absolut Repair I am still able to highlight my hair without worry about my hair becoming too dry.  Great prices thorugh Amazon over the salon.  And trust me not every salon carries this product so buying on Amazon is a huge money and time saver.</li>
            <li> I have used Absolut Repair shampoo and conditioner for over 6 years and LOVE IT!  This was not the real deal.  It smelled awful, didn&#x27;t lather well, and left my hair feeling more dirty than before I washed it.  Either this was not the real Loreal product, or something went terribly wrong in production/packaging.</li>
            <li> I color my hair about every 4 weeks and refresh the color every 2 weeks only because I have very vibrant red hair. This product has not only preserved my color in between coloring but I no longer need to refresh the color ever 2 weeks like I used to before! Leaves my heavily treated hair soft and smooth and looking wonderful!</li>
            <li> My stylist turned me on to this shampoo -- it&#x27;s a little pricey, but it will save your hair. My over-processed, brittle hair transformed into soft, touchable hair over a matter of weeks.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase the smaller Absolut Repair shampoo, but when I saw this I thought it was a better deal....come to find out it really wasn&#x27;t as this is nothing like the shampoo I had gotten before. I couldn&#x27;t get any type of lather with it, so I ended up throwing it away and returning to my previous purchase of the smaller bottle. Feel like this may be a fake.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the original Loreal.. Its FAKE.. Don&#x27;t buy it.. Smell is different and the foam is too much than normal as if it is added with other liquids rather than the shampoo.. I am really dissapointed</li>
            <li> I have my young hair back!  After coloring and aging in general, my hair had become kind of coarse.  This whole line is excellent and brought back the silkiness to my hair!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo.  I find my hair stays cleaner after using this shampoo than any other product that I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the price on Amazon is SO much better than in the salon. I love how it makes my hair so shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I got this product for much cheaper than I would from my Hair stylist. (If I went there, I would have gotten the smaller bottle for this price)</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo, conditioner and mask and I am very happy I did so.  My hair was breaking at a rapid alarming rate no matter what I did.  I have a relaxed hair that is very dry no matter all the treatments I did.  Now, after only one application of this brand, the moisture as returned to my hair making it manageable.  I have found my cure for dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! My hair girl recommended it to me and now raves about how healthy my hair is. I highlight, so you can imagine how good it feels to not have dried out, frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> I purchased the shampoo and conditioner because of a sample I received of each. I was disappointed because it was not the same. My hair did not respond to this product. The sample obviously had something different in it. I didn&#x27;t want to deal with sending it back. Gave it away! :(</li>
            <li> Too heavy - weighed my hair down.  I love the Loreal Professional Color Shampoo/Conditioner.  Will stick with that - it&#x27;s a lot lighter and smells great.</li>
            <li> Love how silky it makes my hair feel.  The moisturizing shampoo I have found for my hair, which tends to be coarser and dry</li>
            <li> This product is simply fantastic.....I never used this product.....but i really loved and i advised for everyone who is looking for a great product</li>
            <li> This product smells delicious, but unfortunately, left buildup in my hair Ina MAJOR way. I literally had to use vinegar to get the gunk off. Maybe it has something to do with the lactic acid? Who even knows</li>
            <li> I waited so excited for this product to arrive. I received it today finally!! I was so happy. But..in the shower it made my hair feel a bit straw like..not really soft as I thought it would feel. My hair feels very dry and wacky. I regret buying this. And I wish I didnt even try it! :/&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to Happily Use Loreal 5 damage repair shampoo and conditioner..and most importantly aphogee shampoo and 2minute reconstructor. These actually leave my hair feeling healthy shiny nice and strong.</li>
            <li> my item was sent between the dates given. it was a pleasure doing business i was happy with my product. i would recommend others to use this service.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for those of use with oily hair that needs extra care and nutrients because of color damage.  I highly recommend this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and could not be more pleased in how promptly it was delivered and appropriately packaged!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as a Christmas present at her request. She loves this shampoo. It makes her hair very soft and she uses just a dab so it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I already knew the range of products and are very good.&lt;br /&gt;good price for the quantity. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> My Wife love this product</li>
            <li> Loreal Series Expert Absolut Repair  along with the conditioner is a can&#x27;t miss combination!! My hair suffers terribly in the winter - the dry heat, cold, and lack of moisture makes my hair brittle and prone to severe breakage. I use the Series Expert Liss Ultime Masque (purple container) conditioner; the combination has saved my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since long and I like it. I relocated to the United States and noticed that this particular shampoo is not available in local shops. I trued few other products here but none of those products were as good as this one is.... Atlastm, I found this shampoo and other related products on amazon for a reasonable price :)</li>
            <li> I have color treated thin hair and this shampoo and conditioner have made my hair shiner and stronger than ever! I love, love, love this product! It is concentrated so you really dont have to use that much. It is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice shampoo, will buy it again</li>
            <li> They now have Loreal products that are a lot cheaper and I think just as effective.  I like this product but I don&#x27;t see much difference between this and the other Loreal conditioner I bought at the supermarket really.  This is the professional grade conditioner so there may be some experts out there who can tell me what the difference is.  I have extremely dry fine hair and use several products including Moroccan Oil but it&#x27;s still really dry.</li>
            <li> It is a really good product, and the seller is completely recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been getting balayage for years and have never had my hair damaged from bleach.  The last time my stylist highlighted me she somehow fried the more dry prone areas of my head (crown, layers, etc). I was 12 weeks away from my wedding and extremely upset. This shampoo and it&#x27;s conditioner counterpart completely saved my hair.  It absolutely works wonders. It took my hair from looking like it was caught in a flame to the damage being unnoticeable. If I use the repair system too many days in a row it does start to make your hair feel &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; so after several uses I started to switch between this system and a high end hydrating system.</li>
            <li> love this product. Its the only thing that works on my over processed colored hair. Better than Moroccan shampoo!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this and swears on this product more than the scientific truth of earth going around the sun! I believe her. This must be good.</li>
            <li> I would definitely go with the Loreal Hair Balm instead of the shampoo.  This shampoo is just an ordinary shampoo, but the balm I found made a huge difference in the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> This&#x27;s open when I received.</li>
            <li> I used many hair products including others in Loreal, but this reduced my hairfall to a considerable extent. Well appreciable and recommended product!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair feel soft.  I discovered its hydrating properties through my hairdresser and the shampoo works just as well at home.</li>
            <li> Ok, I have used  A LOT of different repair shampoos and the biggest complaint I have had thus far is that I don&#x27;t notice a difference after continued use. I got this shampoo because my salon uses professional loreal products, and i want to find out how to get my hair to feel like it does fresh out of the salon...i always wondered why my hair feel so amazing then and I cannot for the life of me duplicate that at home. So, I ordered this and the conditioner. I like the conditioner, its fine, nothing special. But the shampoo....OMG I have never used something this terrible. After i got out of the shower and brushed my hair i immediately noticed that it kind of felt like straw. I thought i had not rinsed it out enough, so I ran it under the faucet one more time to be sure i got everything out. I blew it dry and could not believe how awful my hair felt. It honestly felt like there was a thick oily film on my roots but the rest of my hair (the most damaged part) still felt as dry as straw, no moisture whatsoever, and it was hard to brush. Not to mention for the first time ever I got mattes in my hair after the shower?!&lt;br /&gt;I tried fixing my hair like normal but ended up putting my hair up with a thick head band for the next 24 hours to cover up the monstrosity. I honestly cannot believe this stuff has gotten such good reviews...Im seriously at a loss.&lt;br /&gt;But, I did go to makeupalley.com and there are a few similar reviews on that site. One girl said it maybe the new Lactic Acid in the ingredients? Who knows? I just know I cannot believe i spent $23 on this crap.</li>
            <li> I have fine, color treated hair and this is simply the best product I&#x27;ve ever used! The lactic acid formula really does work to plump and condition the strands of the hair. I get great volume but also a lot of softness. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather like others, but its not because its ineffective. When you rinse you can literally feel the volume in your hair. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of pro grade shampoo/conditioners and have never found one that measures up to this one. After using the lactic acid line for nearly a year now-even my stylist has commented on how much more healthy my hair feels and looks. This line also has the most wonderful smell to it- I even get compliments on how my hair smells sometimes. I love, love, love this product-try it and you&#x27;ll be addicted, too!</li>
            <li> Love this it&#x27;s very creamy almost like a conditioner, would recommend this product leaves your hair really soft. And it&#x27;s great if you follow up with the conditioner worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo to have soft silky hair! It really helps dry hair. I also bought conditioner with it. Good for dry and freezy hair.</li>
            <li> It was WAY too heavy for my hair. It was greasy right after my shower. I would say only use this on coarse, curly, dry hair.</li>
            <li> Found out this is what they use at the salon. Works better for me than any keratin product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this shampoo. I had purchased loreal before and it was great product, this shampoo make our hair grassy and looks like dirty. I think it wasn&#x27;t loreal inside, just a cheap shampoo. Really bad and wont buy it again.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo ever!  Leaves hair so soft and shiny you almost don&#x27;t need conditioner.  Great smell too.  This Professional line of Loreal hair products is the best they have ever produced.</li>
            <li> It works good. Sometimes people don&#x27;t realize that their water is what makes the hair look bad. Also used the mask and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for one year and my hair is so healthy and so shiny. I really recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;to those people who want a nice and strong hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay…kinda pricey</li>
            <li> I used to buy Loreal products from my hair stylist but this one seemed to be a great deal, so I decided to purchase it online. It is awful. Leaves roots greasy like they haven&#x27;t even been washed and makes my hair heavy and dull. Never again at least from here.</li>
            <li> I am loving this shampoo.  My hair is soft, shiny, and so manageable. I would highly recommend this product.  Thank-you</li>
            <li> One of my favorites!&lt;br /&gt;I alternate it with other shampoos by Loreal.&lt;br /&gt;Hair is healthy and not heavy with the use of this shampoo</li>
            <li> A hairdresser turned me onto this shampoo. She couldtn&#x27;t believe how dry my hair was so she GAVE me this product - she was so concerned about the condition of my hair. I use it along with Absolut Repair Cellular Mask. My hair is now shinny which it hasn&#x27;t been in a long time. I&#x27;m post menopausal and my hair had gotten so dry and scraggly and now I&#x27;m very happy with how my hair looks.</li>
            <li> My hair is supper damaged, dry, curyl and frizy.  I understand that I shouldn&#x27;t use shampoos with sulfur, such as this shampoo, as my regular cleanser.  However, for the purpose of a deep cleaning it did ok, no better than the generic brands in my oppinion.</li>
            <li> Great Service! and great product</li>
            <li> use this with the Intense Repair Masque....and other Loreal conditioners..what a suprise...it will help minimize breakage of your hair...  :)</li>
            <li> It was a huge disappointent because both of them &amp;#34;exploded&amp;#34; in the box.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great!! It gives a smooth and light feel. I would recommend it over most of other shampoos that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Works great on my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Weighs my hair down...and puts a coating on it making it feel sticky.  Not happy and not worth the money</li>
            <li> Good quality product.</li>
            <li> like it says absolut repair, yes, it is.&lt;br /&gt;i felt that not good for very oily hair, but good for dry and verydamage hair.</li>
            <li> It is fair enough. Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.  Not worth the really high price.</li>
            <li> This came with shampoo all spilled out in the package and got over other items that it was shipped with -- it was a mess!!</li>
