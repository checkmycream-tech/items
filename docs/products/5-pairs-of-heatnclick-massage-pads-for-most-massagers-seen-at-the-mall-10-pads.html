            <li>Perfect product &amp; fast sending!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>Fairly durable, these pads can be reused many times before you need to replace.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work with our IQ Massager, and we were able to buy more than one or two sets which was very nice.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for at a good price!</li>
            <li>Very good and very relaxing</li>
            <li>As good as original brand for TENS</li>
            <li>Great Product, works really well with my tens unit!</li>
            <li>and I was able to use one pair for one month.</li>
            <li>nothing more to say why the word requirements?</li>
            <li>They were the best for a sore back</li>
            <li>Love the pads for the mini massager, just wish they lasted longer on the sticky ness of them.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re OK, they seem to work.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding replacement.</li>
            <li>They do what they&#x27;re supposed to do, I just wish they were a bit more sticky &amp; thicker.</li>
            <li>it serves its purpose, however, you will get 3-5 uses from the sticky gel, then you need to lay on top of them or they won&#x27;t stick to you.</li>
            <li>I need to order more.</li>
            <li>my Palm Massager perfectly will be ordering more in the future</li>
            <li>They have snaps on back and fit perfect.</li>
            <li>The adhesive is much better than the original making better contact.</li>
            <li>easy to buy and well delivered</li>
            <li>Works fine with my SoCool massager.</li>
            <li>As described and works fine for us.</li>
            <li>They fit my device</li>
            <li>Fit my irest machine.</li>
            <li>fit my healthmate tens unit.</li>
            <li>This produced fit</li>
            <li>arrived on time and is working good so far.</li>
            <li>Recently, I purchased Heatnclick&#x27;s pads to replace Earthing&#x27;s and they are vastly superior in many ways.</li>
            <li>found more pads on a cruise in Fort Lauderdale, and needed more with new mesager&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Only used once so far but it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>They are a great value as compared to other pads</li>
            <li>Super deal, now I have lots of extras.</li>
            <li>These are exactly the size to fit my Healthmate</li>
            <li>work just as expected, good price, would recommend</li>
            <li>These work great and are a good replacement as long as you only need the &#x27;smaller&#x27; pads.</li>
            <li>I rinsed them off quickly with luke warm water, to make sure no body oils stayed on the pads, but still, the stickiness did not last long at all.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Love the stickiness and length of time they last.</li>
            <li>and they work pretty well.</li>
            <li>good or better than the ones that came with my expensive Tens IQ Unit.</li>
            <li>I am disappointed original pad for Pinook were excellent</li>
            <li>Really caused issues.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price</li>
            <li>liked them, sticky stuff only last about three uses.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>May be a little gummier but ok to use and they stick.</li>
            <li>I really needed these as my old ones wouldn&#x27;t stick anymore.  </li>
            <li>These work great, and for the price can&#x27;t really go wrong.</li>
            <li>These are long-lasting pads that are also easy to reactivate with a little water.</li>
            <li>Cost is far less than original equipment and they seem exactly the same.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin beware.</li>
            <li>These are the same as the pad that came with my IQ massager and the price is much cheaper than buying them at the show I went to.</li>
            <li>The sticky surface is a little different than the originals but work fine.  </li>
            <li>The sticky pads were exactly what we expected.</li>
            <li>I needed new pads for my Pinook mini massager for my lower back and couldn&#x27;t seem to find them local.</li>

            <li> Some of the gel type stuff is a little thin on one of them.</li>
            <li> Product not great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive and fraught with problems.</li>
            <li> just hate to pay the $.</li>

            <li> Excellent Product!!!!  Works great and sticks just as good as the Original (Pinook)..  Price is Great..  5 Pairs for the price of 1 from Pinook.</li>
            <li> Very good and very relaxing</li>
            <li> They do what they&#x27;re supposed to do, I just wish they were a bit more sticky &amp; thicker. I&#x27;ll continue to buy them.</li>
            <li> good deal --- work well and good price</li>
            <li> Only used once so far but it works perfectly.  Fits my mini masseuse massager.</li>
            <li> Product not great. it serves its purpose, however, you will get 3-5 uses from the sticky gel, then you need to lay on top of them or they won&#x27;t stick to you. I rinsed them off quickly with luke warm water, to make sure no body oils stayed on the pads, but still, the stickiness did not last long at all.</li>
            <li> These are long-lasting pads that are also easy to reactivate with a little water. They adhere well and are compatable with all snap type units. I gave the item 4 stars instead of 5 because the fabric covering is a little stiff and does not flex well over some areas of the body. They are a great value as compared to other pads and I have purchased them twice already.</li>
            <li> They work great with my Hi-Dow.</li>
            <li> These work great and are a good replacement as long as you only need the &#x27;smaller&#x27; pads.</li>
            <li> Loved these Massage pads... I need to order more.</li>
            <li> WORKE GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>

            <li> Worked as well as originals. May be a little gummier but ok to use and they stick.</li>
            <li> Perfect product &amp; fast sending!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> This produced fit my Palm Massager perfectly will be ordering more in the future</li>
            <li> Inexpensive replacement pads. Cost is far less than original equipment and they seem exactly the same.</li>
