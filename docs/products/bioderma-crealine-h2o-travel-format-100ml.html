            <li>This is a great multi tasking product</li>

            <li>This product has been getting a lot of attention on beauty blogs and in magazines as great makeup remover, but I don&#x27;t agree.</li>

            <li>As a pro makeup artist I get to try so many products - but this one was most recommended, so I gave it a try!!!</li>

            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>This is effective in removing makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cleansing water, nicely scented.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product, although not quite the &amp;#34;holy-grail&amp;#34; some people claim, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing helped clear my acne, but also works as a awesome makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try it first before spending a lot of money, and I loved it!</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing product I have used for removing makeup.</li>
            <li>Super effective (removes mascara!)</li>
            <li>quick delivery, easy transaction, and great product.</li>
            <li>Yes, I am the reason why companies are able to charge exorbitant prices for travel-sized packaging.  </li>
            <li>Bioderma has been a permanent staple in the skin care routine for a year or more.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product</li>
            <li>Love the Bioderma and how it does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>This allows you to try it out and make sure you don&#x27;t react.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I am sure I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>This has replaced all my other make up removers because it works PERFECTLY.</li>
            <li>will be purchasing this in the full size!</li>
            <li>This really is the most amazing makeup remover.</li>
            <li>It does not take off mascara easily - for that stick with Bi-Facil.</li>
            <li>Bioderma can remove eye make up easily</li>
            <li>Now I use it every night to remove my makeup and Waterproof eyeliner, makes it easy to remove.</li>
            <li>At first I liked this</li>
            <li>If you have dryer skin, you are probably fine with this alone.</li>
            <li>Wish it was available in the US.</li>
            <li>I wonder if someone just filled mine with stinky mineral water?  </li>
            <li>I bought some there , and found it is good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Leaves skin clean and moisturized</li>
            <li>I then used the Bioderma cleansing water to clean my face and all the rashes was gone in two days.</li>
            <li>daily-dirt from your skin.&lt;br /&gt;The travel size is handy for trips and the regular size fits easily in  a medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff</li>
            <li>Just glad I didn&#x27;t spring for the huge size, a I just bought a similar product from Boots on clearance at Target, and I thought it worked just as well.</li>
            <li>but it is worth the investment.</li>
            <li>It is made for sensitive skin so most people will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You will like it, it&#x27;s worth all the hype.</li>
            <li>Ripped off, yes, but not crazy.  </li>
            <li>This item melts make-up right off your skin without any harshness or residue.</li>
            <li>It would be great for travel, because of the small size, and saves space because it is a dual purpose product.</li>
            <li>Removed any last traces of makeup, gentle, effective.</li>
            <li>I use this to remove my make up in the evening, it&#x27;s very gentle.  </li>
            <li>In proportion, the bigger bottle is way better price</li>
            <li>It cleans away any makeup the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>They report authentic Biodermas purchased in France is a completely different formulation than what I received.</li>
            <li>It removes makeup quickly, only by touching the eye with a cotton pad.</li>
            <li>love this product so much that I recently ordered the 500mL and for now I will recomend Bioderma to everyone!</li>
            <li>Great makeup remover for my sensitive (eczema, sensitive, dry, congested and oily)!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really for sensitive skin like me and its really clean dirt on my skin too....</li>
            <li>and it really cleans your make-up and  </li>
            <li>It does take off make-up and leaves your skin feeling fresh and soft.  </li>
            <li>Gentle and does want it claims.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gentle to my eyes.</li>
            <li>and gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I have seen similar comments from purchasers of this seller and they confirmed these are counterfeit Biodermas.</li>
            <li>I much prefer jojoba oil to remove my makeup.</li>
            <li>At first I was honestly a little hesitate buying this product but after reading more into it I decided to give it a shot</li>
            <li>But, I found that my skin became a bit irritated because it took several pieces of cotton pads to get to a point where the cotton pads came clean.</li>
            <li>I am going to purchase the full size when I get low.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read so much about this product that it would have to be made of diamond water to live up to the press.</li>
            <li>This travel version of the classic will serve me well.</li>
            <li>I only use to remove my shadow/liner, so this lil buddy is lasting :-).  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I bought the little bottle.    </li>
            <li>In my defense (batting eyelashes), I travel 30-40% of the time for work and I rationalize purchases like this one by affirming the need to maintain my comfort and normal routines whilst on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very surprised.</li>
            <li>within the first week my skin was getting clearer and clearer, evened out my skin tone and left my skin feeling so</li>
            <li>Admittedly; I am a sucker for &#x27;mini&#x27; versions of my favorite things.  </li>
            <li>I tore my retina last year and and very cautious about what I use around my eyes - retina detachment surgery hurts like hell, never want to experience that again - for 18 months I refused to put eyeliner or shadow around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>and even so, I have to rub and rub my eyes with this stuff on a cotton ball in order to remove the makeup completely.</li>
            <li>nearly every time I&#x27;ve used it</li>
            <li>Travel size is very convenient, but doesn&#x27;t allow you to open the bottle to refill.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered a small size before buying a big one.</li>
            <li>I ordered this mainly to try it out, but since it&#x27;s not readily available where I live I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be ordering this as well.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if I&#x27;m using it right but doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>It removes makeup easily and without irritating your skin and eyes.</li>
            <li>It really takes all makeup off including mascara without drying out your face and all you need is a little</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It really takes all makeup off including mascara without drying out your face and all you need is a little</li>
            <li> but I HAD dry a flaky skin prior to using this product and it is all gone now.</li>
            <li> I was looking for this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I wish it was available in CVS/Riteaid/Walgreens and less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the review, and it was as I expected.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no idea</li>
            <li> This really works - seriously!  </li>
            <li> Next time, just get a small bottle and pour it in.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely not worth the money</li>
            <li> Not worth the hype at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear heavy makeup, but I had to try this to remove my eyeliner because other stuff burned my eyes.  </li>
            <li> but after a few days, it worked like any other makeup remover.</li>
            <li> It smelled odd, a bit like water from the gutter.</li>
            <li> but I wanted the little one for traveling.</li>
            <li> I bought into the hype and have to say that the Bioderma Crealine H2O is no better than any other drugstore makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth that excessive price just for the little traveling bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought small one to try it out.</li>
            <li> I bought the small size just to see if it would be compatiable with my skin</li>
            <li> just mascara and small sweep of powdered eye shadow for liner-</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> There was rashes on my face recently due to use of wrong products.</li>
            <li> I seriously wish places in the U.S. would start selling it</li>
            <li> Its expensive, but it works.  </li>
            <li> The product is expensive because it is imported from France</li>
            <li> The worst part is that it caused break outs under my eyes</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> discovered on recommendation of a friend in Paris.  She removed make-up and city &amp;#34;grime&amp;#34;...I bought some there , and found it is good for sensitive skin and it really cleans your make-up and  daily-dirt from your skin.&lt;br /&gt;The travel size is handy for trips and the regular size fits easily in  a medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff</li>
            <li> I use this to remove my make up in the evening, it&#x27;s very gentle.  I just wish it was a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I&#x27;m using it right but doesn&#x27;t work well. It doesn&#x27;t take make up off well.</li>
            <li> This is effective in removing makeup. But, I found that my skin became a bit irritated because it took several pieces of cotton pads to get to a point where the cotton pads came clean. This is essentially water in texture so wiping your face multiple times with cotton pads soaked in a watery solution can irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product that removes make-up with ease and works great.&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that it is too expense for the quantity given. In proportion, the bigger bottle is way better price but I wanted the little one for traveling. Next time, just get a small bottle and pour it in. It&#x27;s not worth that excessive price just for the little traveling bottle.</li>
            <li> This really is the most amazing makeup remover. I seriously wish places in the U.S. would start selling it b/c it takes off waterproof mascara like it&#x27;s nothing.</li>
            <li> Admittedly; I am a sucker for &#x27;mini&#x27; versions of my favorite things.  Yes, I am the reason why companies are able to charge exorbitant prices for travel-sized packaging.  In my defense (batting eyelashes), I travel 30-40% of the time for work and I rationalize purchases like this one by affirming the need to maintain my comfort and normal routines whilst on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, Good Skin Care &#x3D; Good Self Care....and Bioderma has been a permanent staple in the skin care routine for a year or more.  LOVE this product so I put up with the price.</li>
            <li> Love the Bioderma and how it does not irritate my skin. This travel version of the classic will serve me well.</li>
            <li> I ordered the larger size after trying the travel size.  It does take off make-up and leaves your skin feeling fresh and soft.  It does not take off mascara easily - for that stick with Bi-Facil.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful. This has replaced all my other make up removers because it works PERFECTLY. I don&#x27;t have to scrub to get even waterproof make up off. I highly recommend this and I will be ordering more soon!!</li>
            <li> Have always like this product. Wish it was available in the US. Leaves skin clean and moisturized</li>
            <li> Bioderma makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did nothing and wasted my money...think I got a placebo of the real product?  I was warned not to purchase Bioderma from Amazon!</li>
            <li> It really takes all makeup off including mascara without drying out your face and all you need is a little</li>
            <li> Heard about this from Lisa Eldridge, and I love it!  The best makeup remover I have ever used- Thank you</li>
            <li> This really works - seriously!  Its expensive, but it works.  I don&#x27;t wear heavy makeup, but I had to try this to remove my eyeliner because other stuff burned my eyes.  This works, no burning.  I tore my retina last year and and very cautious about what I use around my eyes - retina detachment surgery hurts like hell, never want to experience that again - for 18 months I refused to put eyeliner or shadow around my eyes.  The doctor cleared and assured me liner/shadow would not hurt my eyes, but when things started burning me I got frightened.  This does not burn.  This removes my liner/shadow.  I wish it was available in CVS/Riteaid/Walgreens and less expensive.  I only use to remove my shadow/liner, so this lil buddy is lasting :-).  Next time I will get the bigger one.</li>
            <li> I had seen this product reviewed multiple times on YouTube and decided that I would try it as the cleanser I had been using wasn&#x27;t working in the way I wanted it too. This product is awesome! It cleans away any makeup the first time you use it. I like to use it a second time to penetrate deep into my pores.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was great as it arrived on the date that it said it would and considering the time of year (Christmas) I was very surprised. The product is expensive because it is imported from France but it is worth the investment. I recomend trying the small 100mL bottle first. This allows you to try it out and make sure you don&#x27;t react. It is made for sensitive skin so most people will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product so much that I recently ordered the 500mL and for now I will recomend Bioderma to everyone!</li>
            <li> I already use the great product, just needed the travel size!  If you have not tried it go ahead and buy it.  You will like it, it&#x27;s worth all the hype.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really for sensitive skin like me and its really clean dirt on my skin too....I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This item melts make-up right off your skin without any harshness or residue. This travel size item was prefect to try out.</li>
            <li> I bought small one to try it out. Great product. Gentle and does want it claims. However, has some difficulties of removing  waterproof makeup.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product I have used for removing makeup. Not only that, but I HAD dry a flaky skin prior to using this product and it is all gone now. I am going to purchase the full size when I get low. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> quick delivery, easy transaction, and great product. I bought the small size just to see if it would be compatiable with my skin and it&#x27;s perfect. will be purchasing this in the full size!</li>
            <li> Bioderma can remove eye make up easily and it&#x27;s gentle to my eyes. Next time I will buy larger size.</li>
            <li> As a pro makeup artist I get to try so many products - but this one was most recommended, so I gave it a try!!! Used it at events and NYFW .... I was impressed. Now I use it every night to remove my makeup and Waterproof eyeliner, makes it easy to remove. LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing helped clear my acne, but also works as a awesome makeup remover. This is a great multi tasking product</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. It&#x27;s also really great when you don&#x27;t have access to the bathroom sink. No water required.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read so much about this product that it would have to be made of diamond water to live up to the press. It&#x27;s a cleansing water, nicely scented. It saves you the additional step of having to use an eye makeup remover in addition to washing your face. That&#x27;s about it. It would be great for travel, because of the small size, and saves space because it is a dual purpose product. Just glad I didn&#x27;t spring for the huge size, a I just bought a similar product from Boots on clearance at Target, and I thought it worked just as well.</li>
            <li> This product has been getting a lot of attention on beauty blogs and in magazines as great makeup remover, but I don&#x27;t agree. I bought into the hype and have to say that the Bioderma Crealine H2O is no better than any other drugstore makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of eye makeup- just mascara and small sweep of powdered eye shadow for liner- and even so, I have to rub and rub my eyes with this stuff on a cotton ball in order to remove the makeup completely. The worst part is that it caused break outs under my eyes nearly every time I&#x27;ve used it, so in the trash it goes. Bummer.</li>
            <li> I was looking for this for a long time. I wanted to try it first before spending a lot of money, and I loved it! For sure will be buying it every time I run out! This travel size is perfect for my makeup case.</li>
            <li> At first I was honestly a little hesitate buying this product but after reading more into it I decided to give it a shot and i&#x27;m so happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;I use this for a makeup remover for eyes and face and actually use it as a toner too. within the first week my skin was getting clearer and clearer, evened out my skin tone and left my skin feeling so soft.&lt;br /&gt;I will deffinatly be repurchasing this product in  a bigger size too.</li>
            <li> Great makeup remover for my sensitive (eczema, sensitive, dry, congested and oily)! Super effective (removes mascara!) and gentle on my skin. I remove my makeup with this every night and then wash my face with vivite hydrating cleanser (and my clarisonic!). I would say that you could skip washing your face after this, but only every once in a while if you tend to breakout or have oily skin. If you have dryer skin, you are probably fine with this alone. I use the 500 ml and it lasts for months!</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the review, and it was as I expected. Great product and great trade. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this a try after hearing all the hype. I wonder if someone just filled mine with stinky mineral water?  This product did not remove my makeup at all. Forget about waterproof mascara. It smelled odd, a bit like water from the gutter. I have absolutely no idea if I got a dud but it was sealed with the plastic tear off tab.  I am amazed by the things people have written about this product.  It is absolutely not worth the money and I am so glad I bought the little bottle.    [...]    I am coming back to edit this review. I have seen similar comments from purchasers of this seller and they confirmed these are counterfeit Biodermas. They report authentic Biodermas purchased in France is a completely different formulation than what I received. Turns out it was just stinky mineral water. Ripped off, yes, but not crazy.  BEWARE</li>
            <li> I am using this product since couple of years, and never found anything close as great as that. It calms the skin. It removes makeup quickly, only by touching the eye with a cotton pad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product, although not quite the &amp;#34;holy-grail&amp;#34; some people claim, in my opinion. It removes makeup easily and without irritating your skin and eyes. I ordered this mainly to try it out, but since it&#x27;s not readily available where I live I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be ordering this as well.</li>
            <li> Removed any last traces of makeup, gentle, effective. I wish they sold this in the US. Travel size is very convenient, but doesn&#x27;t allow you to open the bottle to refill.</li>
            <li> At first I liked this but after a few days, it worked like any other makeup remover. I would wake up with stuff all under my eyes and have to scrub my face to get anything off. Not worth the hype at all. I&#x27;m glad I ordered a small size before buying a big one. I much prefer jojoba oil to remove my makeup.</li>
            <li> There was rashes on my face recently due to use of wrong products. I then used the Bioderma cleansing water to clean my face and all the rashes was gone in two days. This is an amazing product. I am sure I will buy it again.</li>
