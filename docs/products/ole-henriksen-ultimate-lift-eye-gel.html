            <li>Wonderful product that really works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not diminishing puffiness as effectively as I&#x27;d like &amp;</li>

            <li>I heard great reviews so thought it would be worth a try and the money</li>
            <li>Not any more.  </li>

            <li>keep in the fridge for an even better eye cooling experience</li>
            <li>I love the cooling sensation and how it de-puffs</li>
            <li>COMFORTING AND REFRESHING.</li>
            <li>BUT THIS DOES NOT AND HAS ALREADY GIVEN ME SMOOTHER MORE LIFTED EYES.</li>
            <li>I love this eye gel.  </li>
            <li>but it does reduce puffiness and makes me look more well rested.  </li>
            <li>Yes, the price tag makes it a bit of a treat, but now that I&#x27;m used to it, it feels soothing and makes me look more well rested.</li>
            <li>Probably paying more for the name.  </li>
            <li>The Truth face cresm was ok, but</li>
            <li>I also noticed that there is no puffiness and even lines seem more diminished.  </li>
            <li>My lids look better when I wipe it on as instructed on the jar, then use a blunt point to shape my eye lids by pushing the blunt point along the top of my eye lids along my eyes to define my lids.</li>
            <li>It worked the FIRST NIGHT!!!</li>
            <li>so I get a nice cool gel at night before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>lol doesn&#x27;t do much for under eye wrinkles but does have a cool soothing feel and gel firms and tightens</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to have diagnosed, and in my case I just needed to make dietary changes to improve my thyroid condition.</li>
            <li>AT the sweet ripe age of 65, I&#x27;ve been blessed with pretty good skin.  </li>
            <li>A cool and refreshing to keep wrinkles at bay.  </li>
            <li>The original has a strong cucumber scent - this does not.  </li>
            <li>I agreed to wait for the backorder since they had contacted me and had added a free product.</li>
            <li>Fortunately i did not pay for the gukk size jar of this product.  </li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t have an effect on my circles- which are large, as I have an infant daughter :)</li>
            <li>nothing special.</li>
            <li>When I applied it, it felt cool</li>
            <li>When I did a quick internet search and saw that it was $38.00, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I cant beleive how quickly I noticed a difference once I started using the eye gel.</li>
            <li>Works great, makes my eyes less puffy in the morning.</li>
            <li>Easy to use gel, will know more in the future!</li>
            <li>I was immediately contacted by the seller via both email and voicemail, and they explained that there was such an overwhelming response to the People magazine article,that the product was on backorder but that they would throw in a free product.</li>

            <li>It is a bit sticky, but the morning results are worth it.</li>
            <li>My eyes look brighter and more alive.  </li>
            <li>but we&#x27;ll worth it.</li>
            <li>which is why I ordered the product and everything that was stated positively about the product is true.  </li>
            <li>It certainly wasn&#x27;t as extreme as the stinging I&#x27;ve felt using skin peels at my dermatologist&#x27;s office, but it wasn&#x27;t pleasant.  </li>
            <li>AMAZINGly, this gel single handedly reversed the trend.</li>
            <li>I am 28 years old and just started noticing fine lines around my eyes, I bought this eye gel hoping to help with them.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it feels wonderful on the eyes!</li>
            <li>First night I used this I woke up to my eyes</li>
            <li>If it did not burn I would have only been able to wear it at night as my make up would have stuck to it.</li>
            <li>The first time I put it on, it felt like a burning.  </li>
            <li>I am giving this product a three because initially it did work ok in taking out the swelling in my eyes as well as lifiting droopy</li>
            <li>so like i was aying if i had more money and say could afford to buy a product for each individual problem</li>
            <li>say a product that solely worked on lines and than another for swelling and say another for my lids than perhaps i would be ok with this product not doing any of what it was advertised but being one of the only products that has an effect on drooping lids that i have seen IF you can stand the feeling that the lids are being lifted by glue and</li>
            <li>first, I didn&#x27;t really like this eye gel.  </li>
            <li>I had obtained a sample a long time ago and had liked it so much that ordered the full size; but then, the hyper-intense sensation which did NOT feel cooling - quite the opposite, in fact - began to alarm me, so I discontinued its use.</li>
            <li>The eye gel and the free product arrived just a week later.</li>
            <li>Also very sticky, sat on my skin until it ended up on my pillow</li>
            <li>It ages him so much</li>
            <li>and I THINK I&#x27;ve noticed some real difference.  </li>
            <li>I just thought I&#x27;d give this product a try since I heard so much about it...</li>
            <li>I like it show much, puffy eyes gone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks now and this gel works really, really well.</li>
            <li>However, after I&#x27;d used it a couple of times it was as if my skin got used to it because I never had an issue with stinging again and instead, came to really like this product.  </li>
            <li>The whole area looks brighter and healthier, which I appreciate.  </li>
            <li>Really gets rid of crows feet over night.</li>
            <li>But at least it makes you feel good about yourself when you look in the mirror.</li>
            <li>As mentioned by other reviewers, the gel is very sticky, but feels refreshing, yet..</li>
            <li>I could only find the original at MAC.</li>
            <li>While the coolness of it may make your eyes feel more lively, it has done absolutely nothing for my puffiness and dark circles.  </li>
            <li>but i am not sure a product that doesant even go on as nice as any department store brand i have used should be given that high a grade BUT</li>
            <li>CROWS FEET IS MAINLY MY PROBLEM</li>
            <li>I have used it for awhile now and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend Mally.</li>
            <li>Then I received this Eye Gel as part of a larger Ole Henriksen set and because I&#x27;ve had good experiences with the brand in the past</li>
            <li>The product, however, doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>dont care toabuse my eyes this way because the skin is so thin and fragil something like this cant be good for this sensitive area...</li>
            <li>I would not even consider my skin to be very sensitive but this burnt it.</li>
            <li>I am now fully converted, an avid user and will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li>but as my gut instinct INSISTED I should just stick to what I know, buying this was a waste of $40.00    While it does work, the same type of product sold by Avon at a much cheaper price, works THAT MUCH BETTER.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy not to have thin, dry skin and using all that greasy stuff they put on their faces.  </li>
            <li>She must&#x27;ve had professional work done on her eyes/face and wouldn&#x27;t admit it.  </li>
            <li>I had read in magazines that it was like having professional treatment done to your eyes.  </li>
            <li>It is very sticky initially when you put it on.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Though because I&#x27;m still relatively young, my wrinkles in this area are pretty minor.)</li>
            <li>Trying to find an effective eye gel for bags is frustrating.</li>
            <li>It was ok, no better and no worse than any other eye cream.  </li>
            <li>so i will use it up only on the lids since thier a little tougher skin than my under eye area and try to enjoy the lifted look despite the rest..</li>
            <li>Plus, I developed an odd red bump under right eye from it that subsided after discontinuing.  </li>
            <li>I have gone through a whole container and notice absolutely no difference.  </li>
            <li>Then red bumps popped up near outer corner of one eye.</li>
            <li>I first started using this stuff a little over a year ago</li>
            <li>also this is not the first product that seems to be designed to lift a lid using this sticky ingrediant however that product came from the drug store and was a third less money than this was</li>
            <li>Puffiness has gone down noticeably, and the fine lines are starting to be less.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend Mally.</li>
            <li> Then I received this Eye Gel as part of a larger Ole Henriksen set and because I&#x27;ve had good experiences with the brand in the past</li>
            <li> The product, however, doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> dont care toabuse my eyes this way because the skin is so thin and fragil something like this cant be good for this sensitive area...</li>
            <li> I would not even consider my skin to be very sensitive but this burnt it.</li>
            <li> I am now fully converted, an avid user and will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> but as my gut instinct INSISTED I should just stick to what I know, buying this was a waste of $40.00    While it does work, the same type of product sold by Avon at a much cheaper price, works THAT MUCH BETTER.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy not to have thin, dry skin and using all that greasy stuff they put on their faces.  </li>
            <li> She must&#x27;ve had professional work done on her eyes/face and wouldn&#x27;t admit it.  </li>
            <li> I had read in magazines that it was like having professional treatment done to your eyes.  </li>
            <li> It is very sticky initially when you put it on.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Though because I&#x27;m still relatively young, my wrinkles in this area are pretty minor.)</li>
            <li> Trying to find an effective eye gel for bags is frustrating.</li>
            <li> It was ok, no better and no worse than any other eye cream.  </li>
            <li> so i will use it up only on the lids since thier a little tougher skin than my under eye area and try to enjoy the lifted look despite the rest..</li>
            <li> Plus, I developed an odd red bump under right eye from it that subsided after discontinuing.  </li>
            <li> I have gone through a whole container and notice absolutely no difference.  </li>
            <li> Then red bumps popped up near outer corner of one eye.</li>
            <li> I first started using this stuff a little over a year ago</li>
            <li> also this is not the first product that seems to be designed to lift a lid using this sticky ingrediant however that product came from the drug store and was a third less money than this was</li>
            <li> Puffiness has gone down noticeably, and the fine lines are starting to be less.</li>
            <li> Now that these symptoms have died down, the eye lift gel works even better--my upper lid is always clearly defined.</li>
            <li> Like I said, it is very sticky when applying, but just keep rubbing it in and then let it dry a few minutes before applying whatever else you apply.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t typically have sensitive eyes either.</li>
            <li> B000A0ADUW Ole Henriksen Blue Black Berry Enzyme Facial Mask, 3.5 Fluid Ounce]].  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it has helped the upper lid because that&#x27;s not really a problem for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also worth noting that although the container is small, you really only need to put a small amount on at one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also took awhile to dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every single night for 2 weeks and have noticed no difference.</li>
            <li> ... would i go out of my way to ever by this product again NO for me that one effect is not worth it for me especially with the drying effect it has...</li>
            <li> like i said gave it a three for the partial effect that i noticed</li>
            <li> Absolutely no difference seen with this.</li>
            <li> , I was curious to give it</li>
            <li> because i half listened to that do to it only being said in a few places if you research the product...</li>
            <li> after its been opened &amp;#34;im not sure if this is why possibly being exposed to air??</li>
            <li> I was driving down the road the other day and looked in my rear view mirror and what did I see???  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a night owl with a day job, which means I stay up late and still get up for my 8am starting time.  </li>
            <li> It takes away inflammation and dark circles under eyes.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because I do have the wrinkles, bags and dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Not worth $</li>
            <li> so again dont know if being exposed to the air or what would cause the product to work less than it did on arrival.</li>
            <li> No true results.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other eye creams and, as usual, nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> It appears a little sticky</li>
            <li> A little sticky on the face</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t give details, but from what she says it tightens up the little wrinkles under her eyes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste the $38 bucks on it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the wrinkles, but I have noticed a visible difference on my bags and dark circles.  </li>
            <li> No more bags and less darkness.  </li>
            <li> Negative aspects of this product is that it is EXTREMELY sticky.</li>
            <li> I am over 50 and have no crow&#x27;s feet, but do have some dark puffiness under my eyes, so I bought this product based on the reviews expecting, at least, for the puffiness to go away.  </li>
            <li> but I bought $200+ worth of Oke Henriksen products and was so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the wrong side of 35 and recently, I&#x27;d noticed an additional fold in my eyelid.</li>
            <li> I found that this eye gel actually made my eyes look WORSE in the morning!</li>
            <li> Makes your eyes look younger and not so tired!</li>
            <li> This is the only eye gel that doesn&#x27;t leave my eyes greasy or with a weird crusty eye.</li>
            <li> I already rated this item so not sure why I&#x27;m rating it again</li>
            <li> i went immeditely to my Mally Eye Gel which is my usual nite treatment.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, even though the cold does feel nice, I find it very inconvenient to keep the container in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li> it loses the ability to reduce swelling  </li>
            <li> One jar lasts at least 3 months.</li>
            <li> However, desperate times call for desperate measures, so I started using the gel again at night to see if the weird crease in my eyelid would smooth out.</li>
            <li> The product feels sticky for a while after application, and leaves a slightly unpleasant pulling sensation that doesn&#x27;t transfer, unfortunately, to a visual pull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very skeptical about facial creams/reviews, but I decided to go out on a limb and try this.  </li>
            <li> When my husband doesn&#x27;t get enough sleep, which is quite often, he gets really bad bags under his eyes that truly look like pus pockets.  </li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have that tired look.</li>
            <li> Started as a tingle and got worse.</li>
            <li> in fact i think that the sticky consistency makes my under eye problem worse at times by drying it out imagine wene you peel glue away after its gotten on your hands dryed gets kinda flakey</li>
            <li> Nothing dramatic.  </li>
            <li> cant say i hate it because of partial effect having done something</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but for the Amazon price, I thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked, to say the least.  </li>
            <li> BOUGHT THIS AFTER READING A RANDOM BLOG</li>
            <li> Buying an expensive one that doesn&#x27;t work for you...</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t notice any change unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Too bad because I do like the Booster Serum in this brand.</li>
            <li> to no avail..does not work! :(</li>
            <li> All my life I hated having oily skin but looking around at some of my friends</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a night owl with a day job, which means I stay up late and still get up for my 8am starting time.  I&#x27;m on the wrong side of 35 and recently, I&#x27;d noticed an additional fold in my eyelid.I had obtained a sample a long time ago and had liked it so much that ordered the full size; but then, the hyper-intense sensation which did NOT feel cooling - quite the opposite, in fact - began to alarm me, so I discontinued its use. However, desperate times call for desperate measures, so I started using the gel again at night to see if the weird crease in my eyelid would smooth out. AMAZINGly, this gel single handedly reversed the trend. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. I am now fully converted, an avid user and will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I happened to be reading a People magazine interview of Kate Gosselin. When asked if she&#x27;d ever had any work done on her eyes, she replied no, but a friend had recommended Ole Henrickson ultimate lift eye gel to her. She called it her \\&quot;Botox in a jar\\&quot; and that she noticed a difference in the appearance of her eyes in a short period of time. I noticed her eyes in the photo in the magazine and they looked amazing. When I did a quick internet search and saw that it was $38.00, I decided to give it a try. I was immediately contacted by the seller via both email and voicemail, and they explained that there was such an overwhelming response to the People magazine article,that the product was on backorder but that they would throw in a free product. I agreed to wait for the backorder since they had contacted me and had added a free product. The eye gel and the free product arrived just a week later. The seller has very good customer service. The product, however, doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype. I&#x27;ve been using it every single night for 2 weeks and have noticed no difference. Gosselin probably lied, no big surprise there. She must&#x27;ve had professional work done on her eyes/face and wouldn&#x27;t admit it.  I&#x27;ll keep using the eye gel since it isn&#x27;t hurting anything and cost me $38 plus shipping. Maybe in a month or two I&#x27;ll notice a difference, but I doubt it.</li>
            <li> AT the sweet ripe age of 65, I&#x27;ve been blessed with pretty good skin.  All my life I hated having oily skin but looking around at some of my friends I&#x27;m happy not to have thin, dry skin and using all that greasy stuff they put on their faces.  I began using Ole Henriksen Sheer Transformation this year around my lips and neck area.  This lead me to try the Ole Henriksen Ultimate Lift Eye Gel because of claims that it reduced puffy eyes.  My upper eye lids are always puffy in the morning, well, they used to be.  Not any more.  This stuff actually works.  I&#x27;m amazed!  I keep it in the fridge as others have stated and it works perfectly for me.  In the evenings after cleaning the kitchen and setting up coffee for the morning, I just reach in the fridge and use the tip of my ring finger to gather some gel from the lid and do my eyes in the kitchen.  Keep jar on it&#x27;s side and when you open it you&#x27;ll never get that goop under your finger nails.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week so I haven&#x27;t gotten to the jar yet.  It worked the FIRST NIGHT!!!</li>
            <li> First night I used this I woke up to my eyes almost swollen shut. Looked like I had cried all night. Horrible product. Also very sticky, sat on my skin until it ended up on my pillow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very skeptical about facial creams/reviews, but I decided to go out on a limb and try this.  When my husband doesn&#x27;t get enough sleep, which is quite often, he gets really bad bags under his eyes that truly look like pus pockets.  It ages him so much and he&#x27;s only 42.  I talked him into trying this gel just to see and I have seen an amazing difference.  He always looks refreshed now.  When his eyes are not puffy, he literally looks to be in his mid-30&#x27;s.  It may not work for everyone, but it definitely works for him!</li>
            <li> Works so well! I used to have bags under my eyes every morning and this stuff makes them go away immediately.</li>
            <li> Well, maybe not but I have to say I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results.  It&#x27;s been a month since I began using this product and I THINK I&#x27;ve noticed some real difference.  I didn&#x27;t have a lot of lines around the eyes to begin with but what I did have seemed to have softened.  I intend to re-order when the time comes.  The price is \\&quot;right\\&quot; on this gel and there just might be something to it!  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Trying this gel on the recommendation of Kate Gosselin...  Easy to use gel, will know more in the future!</li>
            <li> I just thought I&#x27;d give this product a try since I heard so much about it...but as my gut instinct INSISTED I should just stick to what I know, buying this was a waste of $40.00    While it does work, the same type of product sold by Avon at a much cheaper price, works THAT MUCH BETTER.  Try it ladies, you won&#x27;t regret it.  ANEW CLINICAL Eye Lift $28.00 (219-312).</li>
            <li> Kate Goslin stated she used this product so I tried it and it is the best eye gel I have ever used!</li>
            <li> This product is great - it smooths away the puffiness under your eyes and makes them look brighter. I put on at night as directed and there is no greasy feeling - it dries immediately.  I&#x27;ve been using for two weeks and you can see the difference.    Don&#x27;t misunderstand me - it doesn&#x27;t make you look 25 again!  But at least it makes you feel good about yourself when you look in the mirror. You don&#x27;t have that tired look. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this religously for almost 8 weeks.  While the coolness of it may make your eyes feel more lively, it has done absolutely nothing for my puffiness and dark circles.  Sometimes you have to keep rubbing it in to get the wetness to go away.  Don&#x27;t waste the $38 bucks on it.  Although it will last you awhile.</li>
            <li> love it! saw a difference within a week!</li>
            <li> I am 28 years old and just started noticing fine lines around my eyes, I bought this eye gel hoping to help with them. I found that this eye gel actually made my eyes look WORSE in the morning! It made my eyes puffy. As mentioned by other reviewers, the gel is very sticky, but feels refreshing, yet..to no avail..does not work! :(</li>
            <li> This product is satisfactory.  I had read in magazines that it was like having professional treatment done to your eyes.  I did not experience that. It was ok, no better and no worse than any other eye cream.  It also took awhile to dry.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product that really works. Great packaging and fastshipping</li>
            <li> I cant beleive how quickly I noticed a difference once I started using the eye gel. My eyes have not looked this good in a couple of years!</li>
            <li> I had a sample of this eye gel last year &amp; it was wonderful but now I think I&#x27;ll try something else once I&#x27;m done with this. It&#x27;s not diminishing puffiness as effectively as I&#x27;d like &amp; it&#x27;s sticky so application can be tricky.</li>
            <li> Nice eye gel, especially nice when kept in frig for morning puffiness.  I use at night and in the am.</li>
            <li> Works great, makes my eyes less puffy in the morning. It is also sticky however works great when you wake up in the morning with refreshed eyes.</li>
            <li> Best I have tried and I have tried many.  Nothing will remove the bags under my eyes, but this makes them almost unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> /best eye gel ever!  Put it in the refrigerator and it feels awesome!  Works great.  Visibly reduces lines and puffiness.</li>
            <li> I like it show much, puffy eyes gone.</li>
            <li> I would not even consider my skin to be very sensitive but this burnt it. I did not get it in my eyes at all, it just burnt my flesh. Started as a tingle and got worse. I ended up needing to wash it off. It was also very sticky and dried sticky. If it did not burn I would have only been able to wear it at night as my make up would have stuck to it. I heard great reviews so thought it would be worth a try and the money but I was wrong. I would not buy this again and I would not recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I am over 50 and have no crow&#x27;s feet, but do have some dark puffiness under my eyes, so I bought this product based on the reviews expecting, at least, for the puffiness to go away.  I have gone through a whole container and notice absolutely no difference.  Furthermore, even though the cold does feel nice, I find it very inconvenient to keep the container in the refrigerator. The product feels sticky for a while after application, and leaves a slightly unpleasant pulling sensation that doesn&#x27;t transfer, unfortunately, to a visual pull. Not a good product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product!  I suffer from puffy circles under my eyes and this has eliminated that problem.  It is part of my nightly routine.  It takes away inflammation and dark circles under eyes.  I put it under my eyes, on my eye lids and out to my temples.  You can literally feel it working.  Love it and will purchase as needed!  Makes your eyes look younger and not so tired!</li>
            <li> This is the only eye gel that doesn&#x27;t leave my eyes greasy or with a weird crusty eye. My skin feels tighter after use.</li>
            <li> This is my go to product in the morning and sometimes before bed.&lt;br /&gt;Please try it and you will love it too!!!</li>
            <li> I saw this product on QVC, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the $42 to get it.  That is kind of pricey.  I purchased this because I do have the wrinkles, bags and dark circles under my eyes.  I have tried other eye creams and, as usual, nothing worked.  I was skeptical, but for the Amazon price, I thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl.  It is very sticky initially when you put it on.  The first time I put it on, it felt like a burning.  However, I guess that&#x27;s the &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; affect.  It did go away and caused no irritation.  I was driving down the road the other day and looked in my rear view mirror and what did I see???  No more bags and less darkness.  I was shocked, to say the least.  I&#x27;m not sure about the wrinkles, but I have noticed a visible difference on my bags and dark circles.  I do use it day and night even though it&#x27;s for night time use.  I wanted faster results.  Like I said, it is very sticky when applying, but just keep rubbing it in and then let it dry a few minutes before applying whatever else you apply.  I will definitely keep using and hope the wrinkles go away in time.  I don&#x27;t know if it has helped the upper lid because that&#x27;s not really a problem for me.</li>
            <li> I like this product and it lifts the below-the-eye area nicely. Nothing dramatic.  But it improves the area. I have used it for awhile now and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> A cool and refreshing to keep wrinkles at bay.  It appears a little sticky so I use at night before going to bed.</li>
            <li> love this stuff! keep in the fridge for an even better eye cooling experience</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction.  I like the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye gel now for a couple of weeks.  I love the cooling sensation and how it de-puffs my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Negative aspects of this product is that it is EXTREMELY sticky. Like, wake up the next morning and your hair is stuck to it, sticky. Also, it doesn&#x27;t have an effect on my circles- which are large, as I have an infant daughter :)</li>
            <li> BOUGHT THIS AFTER READING A RANDOM BLOG AND IT IS JUST SUPERB. COMFORTING AND REFRESHING. ALOT OF THE EYECREAMS BURN MY EYES AND MAKE THEM WATER ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT BUT THIS DOES NOT AND HAS ALREADY GIVEN ME SMOOTHER MORE LIFTED EYES. CROWS FEET IS MAINLY MY PROBLEM BUT THEY SEEM TO BE SMOOTHING OUT AND ITS ONLY BEEN 4 WEEKS. WILL BUY AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks now and this gel works really, really well. Puffiness has gone down noticeably, and the fine lines are starting to be less. Highly recommend this product. Ps - I do leave it in the refrigerator so I get a nice cool gel at night before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I love this eye gel.  It is cooling on the eyes and does not irritate my eyes at all.  The oder came on time and nicely packed.  I am very happy with this product</li>
            <li> I am giving this product a three because initially it did work ok in taking out the swelling in my eyes as well as lifiting droopy i lids and giving you that arched i brow look but after its been opened &amp;#34;im not sure if this is why possibly being exposed to air?? it loses the ability to reduce swelling  so we are left with what can it still do well it still can lift droopy i lids its like a sticky glue or molding gel? wene it is applied to lids if you work your fingers in an upwards direction and physically pull your lid skin up it gives the impression that that the droopy lids have been lifted so i said to myself that thier are probably women out thier that do not mind a product that does somthing entrely different than what ws advertised since the way it was marketed i bought it for its supposed wrinkle reduction and swelling reducing benefits under the eye and it does niether in fact i think that the sticky consistency makes my under eye problem worse at times by drying it out imagine wene you peel glue away after its gotten on your hands dryed gets kinda flakey and you can peel it off thats kind of what it seems like and i realy dont care toabuse my eyes this way because the skin is so thin and fragil something like this cant be good for this sensitive area... o and it also burns after you have used a couple times so again dont know if being exposed to the air or what would cause the product to work less than it did on arrival. so like i was aying if i had more money and say could afford to buy a product for each individual problem say a product that solely worked on lines and than another for swelling and say another for my lids than perhaps i would be ok with this product not doing any of what it was advertised but being one of the only products that has an effect on drooping lids that i have seen IF you can stand the feeling that the lids are being lifted by glue and how it kinda has a drying  yucky ness after the fact  ,,, kate gosselin claimed to have used this and perhaps that is why people accuse her of having had multiple surgeries i will give it that it does give a cosmetically lifted look for the lid... also this is not the first product that seems to be designed to lift a lid using this sticky ingrediant however that product came from the drug store and was a third less money than this was... would i go out of my way to ever by this product again NO for me that one effect is not worth it for me especially with the drying effect it has... but i have a jar of it so i will use it up only on the lids since thier a little tougher skin than my under eye area and try to enjoy the lifted look despite the rest..like i said gave it a three for the partial effect that i noticed but i am not sure a product that doesant even go on as nice as any department store brand i have used should be given that high a grade BUT cant say i hate it because of partial effect having done something o and i read that this was supposed to be kept in the fridge in fairness maby because i half listened to that do to it only being said in a few places if you research the product...so maby its me IDK but will not rebuy</li>
            <li> like it good results.</li>
            <li> This is a replica.  The original has a strong cucumber scent - this does not.  I could only find the original at MAC.</li>
            <li> After using this product for about 3 nights, I got a bumpy rash under my eyes. I quit using it until the rash went away, and gave it another try in case something else caused the rash. The next morning, my eye was swollen shut! I have never had any allergic reaction to anything before this.</li>
            <li> I wish this product worked for me. Trying to find an effective eye gel for bags is frustrating. Buying an expensive one that doesn&#x27;t work for you...ahhhhh. Absolutely no difference seen with this. Gotta move on. Plus, I developed an odd red bump under right eye from it that subsided after discontinuing.  It didn&#x27;t itch or hurt, the bump was just ...there. Nice texture and smell though. Not worth $</li>
            <li> I first started using this stuff a little over a year ago and I have never looked back!  A little goes a long way and it feels wonderful on the eyes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m early in my thirties and haven&#x27;t used many eye-specific products because I&#x27;m not convinced I need them (yet).  In college, I used an eye cream from Benefit (which I believe has since been discontinued) but because I didn&#x27;t see any discernible benefit, I stopped and never used one again.  Then I received this Eye Gel as part of a larger Ole Henriksen set and because I&#x27;ve had good experiences with the brand in the past, I was curious to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I didn&#x27;t really like this eye gel.  I have sensitive skin and I found it stung the skin underneath my eyes.  It certainly wasn&#x27;t as extreme as the stinging I&#x27;ve felt using skin peels at my dermatologist&#x27;s office, but it wasn&#x27;t pleasant.  However, after I&#x27;d used it a couple of times it was as if my skin got used to it because I never had an issue with stinging again and instead, came to really like this product.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a discernible difference with wrinkles yet, (Though because I&#x27;m still relatively young, my wrinkles in this area are pretty minor.) but it does reduce puffiness and makes me look more well rested.  The whole area looks brighter and healthier, which I appreciate.  And also now that there is no stinging I think it feels really nice on.  It as a cooling effect that reminds me a lot of the [[ASIN:B000A0ADUW Ole Henriksen Blue Black Berry Enzyme Facial Mask, 3.5 Fluid Ounce]].  It&#x27;s also worth noting that although the container is small, you really only need to put a small amount on at one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I quite like this eye gel.  Yes, the price tag makes it a bit of a treat, but now that I&#x27;m used to it, it feels soothing and makes me look more well rested.</li>
            <li> I already rated this item so not sure why I&#x27;m rating it again but I bought $200+ worth of Oke Henriksen products and was so disappointed.  No true results.  I do like however the African Red Tea Mist.  This eye gel is ok not the best for the price.  Probably paying more for the name.  Not something I would order again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! The only gel that has worked for my eyes! I am over 40 and already was noticing some sagging. This did the trick.</li>
            <li> This gives me the best result of any night eye treatment. It is a bit sticky, but the morning results are worth it. Reduces puffiness and tightens while firming the under eye area. This is a must have for my skin care arsenal. One jar lasts at least 3 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 and find this gel helpful w my crows feet I gained from having a child lol doesn&#x27;t do much for under eye wrinkles but does have a cool soothing feel and gel firms and tightens</li>
            <li> Fortunately i did not pay for the gukk size jar of this product.  When I applied it, it felt cool and I thought that was nice. But then I noticed I had puffy , sticky white marks under my eyes. Then red bumps popped up near outer corner of one eye. Within 15 minutes my eyes were watering and burning.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t typically have sensitive eyes either. I finally had to wash it off. i went immeditely to my Mally Eye Gel which is my usual nite treatment.  For under my eyes. I HIGHLY recommend Mally. It truly delivers on puffiness and circles.&lt;br /&gt;My sample jar of this ptoduct is in th trash can.Too bad because I do like the Booster Serum in this brand. The Truth face cresm was ok, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> I had seen it on line while looking up something else and the reviews were great which is why I ordered the product and everything that was stated positively about the product is true.  My eyes look brighter and more alive.  I also noticed that there is no puffiness and even lines seem more diminished.  This product is a definite keeper.  Jan</li>
            <li> Second purchase. Really gets rid of crows feet over night. A little sticky on the face but we&#x27;ll worth it.</li>
            <li> I like it now that I&#x27;ve discovered how to use it. Wiping it on is not enough. My lids look better when I wipe it on as instructed on the jar, then use a blunt point to shape my eye lids by pushing the blunt point along the top of my eye lids along my eyes to define my lids. The blunt point I use is the tip of a hair comb with a pointed end or rat tail handle. UPDATE: I&#x27;ve learned that I have hypothyroid problems, and that one of the ways it affects you physically can be to cause your eye lids to be puffy and sag. It&#x27;s easy to have diagnosed, and in my case I just needed to make dietary changes to improve my thyroid condition. Now that these symptoms have died down, the eye lift gel works even better--my upper lid is always clearly defined. I haven&#x27;t found anything that works quite as well.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my fiancé on her request. She loves this stuff. I&#x27;m a dude so I can&#x27;t give details, but from what she says it tightens up the little wrinkles under her eyes.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t notice any change unfortunately.</li>
