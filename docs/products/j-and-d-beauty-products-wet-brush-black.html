            <li>\\&quot;Sure, go ahead, good luck!\\&quot;  </li>

            <li>This is a great brush to keep in my beach bag so that I can quickly brush my hair when I get out of the water.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a cheap $5 Walmart brush for about 3 years now which has held up fairly well</li>
            <li>and now it is easy breezy!  </li>
            <li>This worked great the first day...</li>
            <li>It is amazing how easily it glides through my hair.  </li>
            <li>I think my dog and cats love it even more than I do.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got this.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a lot more.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s cheap!  </li>
            <li>We love it and it works so well</li>
            <li>It cannot reach to brush through most of my head.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended, or purchased, this brush many, many times.  </li>
            <li>Order two - you&#x27;ll love them.</li>
            <li>Was recommended to me by my hair stylist - fabulous product!</li>
            <li>Would love to have one in my shower too, but it does not have a hole to hang it on.  </li>
            <li>The price is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I just love it and how easy it is to do any hairdo</li>
            <li>I have to say it is the best brush I have ever used on wet hair - and I can not believe it took me 43 years to find it.  </li>
            <li>wish my mom had this brush when I was young because brushing my hair would have been a much more pleasant</li>
            <li>so I take it easy.</li>
            <li>I was super surprised by how great it felt.  </li>
            <li>Not only did it feel great, there&#x27;s also no tangle or pulling</li>
            <li>like I get with the cheap dollar brush.  </li>
            <li>Using a different kind of brush with the Kenra is not as effective as this brush is.  </li>
            <li>Detangling was quick, easy, and Pain Free.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent brush that works well for fine or thick hair.  </li>
            <li>Looks are deceiving though and this brush certainly is built very cheaply.</li>
            <li>This is not the best quality brush, but it detangled my toddlers&#x27; hair and neither one of them complained.  </li>
            <li>I have since bought spares for my gym bag and the after bath brush out with my little girl is so much more pleasant now.</li>
            <li>, she can even comb her own wet hair most of the time.  </li>
            <li>Very impressed from the first nylon mason brush that I ordered, so I ordered the mixed bristle not only for me but also for my two girls!</li>
            <li>It is painless but probably better suited on fine or short hair.</li>
            <li>Our stylist tried it on her hair and it went right through the tangles with no problem and more importantly, no crying!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made brushing my hair when I get out of the shower so much easier and just pain free.</li>
            <li>it is worth every cent.</li>
            <li>I use it right after I shampoo and condition my hair and it \\&quot;brushes\\</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it to anyone with fine hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s really east to clean.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was worth getting this brush that cost a little more than at the dollar store, but after my first time using it</li>
            <li>The wet brush does the job of both, I love it!</li>
            <li>Great brush for long or short hair.</li>
            <li>This brush has saved me so much time!  </li>
            <li>Overall this brush is pretty good on wet hair.</li>
            <li>Great for wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li>This brush has changes may 5 year old daughter before she&#x27;s screaming pain when i brush her hair.the wet brush work like magic!</li>
            <li>I am going to get one for my niece because she is super tender headed and has super long hair!</li>
            <li>So much cheaper at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>after that, not so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d still recommend it as I feel it&#x27;ll last longer than those cheap dollar brushes.  </li>
            <li>this brush has just found that magic touch and brushes through my wet hair like a knife cuts through butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have long hair that tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair and it so easy to get through my hair without breaking.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to de-tangle hair quite well without ripping the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fabric where the bristles come out of gets wet in the shower, and takes a long time to dry out - not what I would think would be a good thing for a brush claiming to be a good wet brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It got out all the shed hairs, and left my hair smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I have to cradle the main part of the brush to use it.  </li>
            <li>I love wet brushes and purchased them in the past from a salon for a lot more money.  </li>
            <li>It really looks just like any other brush with very soft/flexible bristles, nothing special or unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice smooth finish after a shower in just a few minutes instead of a mess of knots that takes me a lot of time and her a lot of tears to get out.</li>
            <li>This brush really does detangle hair gently with little to no painful snags.  </li>
            <li>I would like to see this available with a larger handle in the future.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>It is absolutely brilliant for wet hair, especially if your hair is thick or curly.  </li>
            <li>I live on the coast so am frequently in the ocean / pool.  </li>
            <li>Is gentle to hair even when wet and can brush straight through without hair breaking or tangling.</li>
            <li>I have medium coarse hair and this brush doesn&#x27;t penetrate it very well.</li>
            <li>My daughter has long, straight hair and a lot of it!  </li>
            <li>The beaded tips on my old brush break off after about 6 months, so</li>
            <li>The soft rubber surface of the grip has not worn off yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but really I don&#x27;t care one bit because I have finally found THE brush for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really gentle, doesn&#x27;t pull out your hair, but it actually detangles your hair.</li>
            <li>To sum it up, the J&amp;D Wet Brush is totally worth</li>
            <li>I was amazed when it went right through my snarled wet mop with ease.  </li>
            <li>I notice that I don&#x27;t see as much hair left on the brush as I normally would with a regular brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is way easier on my fine hair, which always gets tangled, especially when it&#x27;s wet than even a wooden paddle brush or soft bristle brush.  </li>
            <li>If you have a little girl with long, fine hair buy this brush.  </li>
            <li>Once I hit APL, detangling was becoming a Serious pain.  </li>
            <li>I have thick but very fine hair that tangles easily--especially in the winter time (dry air).</li>
            <li>So gentle on your wet hair and no pain brushing through tangles.</li>
            <li>For an eight year old she has tons of hair that knots up constantly.  </li>
            <li>I have been using two brushes for years, one soft bristle brush and one regular detangling brush.</li>
            <li>My daughter has really tangly hair and this brush works miracles when her hair is wet.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think it brushes as well when my hair is dry because it takes a little longer to get all the knots sorted out and my hair to be smooth and silky</li>
            <li>can I only hope that this new one will last longer.  </li>
            <li>This brush is almost considered a &amp;#34;Miracle&amp;#34; in my book because of how easily and smoothly it brushes through my extremely long and straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on the spur of the moment expecting to be completely disappointed because I had reached the point that I just did not believe anything would work because of the constant let downs over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The brush still works fine as long as I don&#x27;t comb hard.</li>
            <li>I first got the brush in I was like I totally over paid for this thing I could have bought the same brush from any store for a few bucks......</li>
            <li>have had long hair since I was a little girl, sure I&#x27;ve caught it real short a few times just to try something different and follow the &amp;#34;trend&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> My daughter has really tangly hair and this brush works miracles when her hair is wet.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it brushes as well when my hair is dry because it takes a little longer to get all the knots sorted out and my hair to be smooth and silky</li>
            <li> can I only hope that this new one will last longer.  </li>
            <li> This brush is almost considered a &amp;#34;Miracle&amp;#34; in my book because of how easily and smoothly it brushes through my extremely long and straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on the spur of the moment expecting to be completely disappointed because I had reached the point that I just did not believe anything would work because of the constant let downs over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The brush still works fine as long as I don&#x27;t comb hard.</li>
            <li> I first got the brush in I was like I totally over paid for this thing I could have bought the same brush from any store for a few bucks......</li>
            <li> have had long hair since I was a little girl, sure I&#x27;ve caught it real short a few times just to try something different and follow the &amp;#34;trend&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This brush is much gentler than any other I&#x27;ve used to detangle wet hair, but I do use Kenra Blow-Dry Spray also.  </li>
            <li> the bottom line is these are recommended, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair.</li>
            <li> It detangles their fur too and reaches down to the skin for a soft scrub.  </li>
            <li> Except I have very long curly hair and the bristles to this brush are quite short.</li>
            <li> This particular brush seems a little lightweight compared to the other ones I have.  </li>
            <li> I have coarse 3b/c curls, and up until now was using a wide toothed comb to detangle.  </li>
            <li> I am 43 and have always had long hair.  </li>
            <li> but I always return to my long hair..</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this to all the parents out there that have kids that cannot stand the sight of a brush and brake down in tears and a tantrum, that have fear in their eyes because of the torture they feel when getting brushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gets the tangles out of my granddaughters hair though, wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s called \\&quot;The Wet</li>
            <li> Brush\\&quot; because your hair probably has to be wet in order for it to not break doing its job.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no pulling, knotting or breaking -</li>
            <li> My hairdresser introduced me to the wet brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly the soft round tips have fallen off after a few months of use and now have sharp ends which scratches at the scalp when combing.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and always have a tangled mess after taking a shower.  </li>
            <li> My wife used the third and said it worked as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;She has long hair and has complained of knots for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, as does my 4 year old daughter, and once it gets wet it can be extremely difficult (read impossible) to brush out.  </li>
            <li> They really stand behind their product!</li>
            <li> This brush sucks- pulls my hair out (dry and wet) and the bristles started to bend and break after 2-3 uses.</li>
            <li> The bristles have those little plastic tips on the end for comfort.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts whether this would work on my little girls girl hair</li>
            <li> In the past if I didn&#x27;t have a very wide toothed comb I was in trouble.  </li>
            <li> The bristles bent with just a few strokes.</li>
            <li> But they are priced right, so it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> To all the Black Women out there...we have a Winner!  </li>
            <li> I lost Less hair than I usually do with the detangling comb, and I could run my fingers through my curls effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> as you can imagine my shock and surprise when this brush just knocked all my negative thoughts out of the ball park is beyond words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I read the glowing reviews and thought this was the brush that was going to work perfectly on my thick, wavy, midlength hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles are very thin and not strong.</li>
            <li> While I think the brush works well, the handle is very small and since I have carpal tunnel it is difficult to hold.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought several of these in different colors after trying one for myself.  I have long hair that tangles easily.  This brush really does detangle hair gently with little to no painful snags.  I think my dog and cats love it even more than I do.  They all jockey for position when I pull their brush out.  (It helps to have them in different colors.)  It detangles their fur too and reaches down to the skin for a soft scrub.  Simple things are often the best and everyone I&#x27;ve given one to has loved it.  It&#x27;s a great stocking stuffer too.</li>
            <li> I have medium coarse hair and this brush doesn&#x27;t penetrate it very well. The bristles bent with just a few strokes. It&#x27;s called \\&quot;The Wet Brush\\&quot; because your hair probably has to be wet in order for it to not break doing its job. To me that&#x27;s unacceptable. I&#x27;ve had a cheap $5 Walmart brush for about 3 years now which has held up fairly well and I&#x27;ve used it vigorously. This brush looked similar to that one and that&#x27;s why I bought it. Looks are deceiving though and this brush certainly is built very cheaply.</li>
            <li> Love love love this brush.  Saw it at the salon for $20.00.  So much cheaper at Amazon.  Great brush for long or short hair. I have long hair and it so easy to get through my hair without breaking.  Bought one for my hair dresser too.  She also loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought three of these. This is not the best quality brush, but it detangled my toddlers&#x27; hair and neither one of them complained.  That alone makes it a great buy.  My wife used the third and said it worked as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;She has long hair and has complained of knots for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the bottom line is these are recommended, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll last a long time.  But they are priced right, so it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing brush. So gentle on your wet hair and no pain brushing through tangles. I ordered 3 just in case they discontinue it. I will never be without this brush again!</li>
            <li> I like having this brush to speed the daily process of combing - now brushing - through my hair after a shower. It&#x27;s still wise not to just pull and yank so I take it easy. But it does work well. I&#x27;m glad I got this.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush that works well for fine or thick hair.  Great for wet or dry hair.  The bristles have those little plastic tips on the end for comfort.</li>
            <li> I read the glowing reviews and thought this was the brush that was going to work perfectly on my thick, wavy, midlength hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is meh...ok. The bristles are very thin and not strong. I imagine that they will break soon. It does seem to de-tangle hair quite well without ripping the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fabric where the bristles come out of gets wet in the shower, and takes a long time to dry out - not what I would think would be a good thing for a brush claiming to be a good wet brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a series of brushes that are all the same brush here on Amazon - I purchased several at the same time, and they are identical except for the branding.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts whether this would work on my little girls girl hair but she didn&#x27;t fuss at all when I used it.  Before I was combing her hair with a softer bristle brush then using a detangler brush afterwards.  Now I only need to use this one.</li>
            <li> LOVE! best brush in the world. it was received in perfect condition and looked exactly like the picture provided online.</li>
            <li> I love wet brushes and purchased them in the past from a salon for a lot more money.  This particular brush seems a little lightweight compared to the other ones I have.  It gets the tangles out of my granddaughters hair though, wet or dry.</li>
            <li> This worked great the first day... after that, not so much. I have pretty thick hair. I use it right after I shampoo and condition my hair and it \\&quot;brushes\\&quot; it but does nothing to get knots out--just sort of glosses over them. I was expecting a lot more.</li>
            <li> To all the Black Women out there...we have a Winner!  I have coarse 3b/c curls, and up until now was using a wide toothed comb to detangle.  Once I hit APL, detangling was becoming a Serious pain.  Then I used this brush!  WOW!  Detangling was quick, easy, and Pain Free.  It got out all the shed hairs, and left my hair smooth and soft.  I lost Less hair than I usually do with the detangling comb, and I could run my fingers through my curls effortlessly.  Love it!  And it&#x27;s cheap!  I&#x27;m sure even ladies with Type 4 hair will be Very pleased.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long, straight hair and a lot of it!  For an eight year old she has tons of hair that knots up constantly.  Our stylist tried it on her hair and it went right through the tangles with no problem and more importantly, no crying!  I came home and ordered one immediately.  We love it and it works so well, she can even comb her own wet hair most of the time.  It leaves a nice smooth finish after a shower in just a few minutes instead of a mess of knots that takes me a lot of time and her a lot of tears to get out.</li>
            <li> Overall this brush is pretty good on wet hair. Except I have very long curly hair and the bristles to this brush are quite short. It cannot reach to brush through most of my head. It is painless but probably better suited on fine or short hair.</li>
            <li> I am 43 and have always had long hair.  I love this brush.  I have to say it is the best brush I have ever used on wet hair - and I can not believe it took me 43 years to find it.  Buy it - it is worth every cent.</li>
            <li> This brush is way easier on my fine hair, which always gets tangled, especially when it&#x27;s wet than even a wooden paddle brush or soft bristle brush.  It is great for after shower or swimming.</li>
            <li> This brush has changes may 5 year old daughter before she&#x27;s screaming pain when i brush her hair.the wet brush work like magic! the best brush i never have.</li>
            <li> Very impressed from the first nylon mason brush that I ordered, so I ordered the mixed bristle not only for me but also for my two girls! As what they say, your hair is like your \\&quot;crown\\&quot;, so why not splurge for the best !! A lifetime, great investment for your hair!</li>
            <li> I have recommended, or purchased, this brush many, many times.  It is absolutely brilliant for wet hair, especially if your hair is thick or curly.  Absolutely no pulling, knotting or breaking - the brush just slides through.  GREAT for kids who dislike hair brushing.  My daughter keeps one in the shower, and there is always one in the beach bag.  Order two - you&#x27;ll love them.</li>
            <li> This brush is the best ever!! Is gentle to hair even when wet and can brush straight through without hair breaking or tangling. I have hair that is longer than shoulder length and am able to get out of the shower or lake and immediately brush through my hair with no pain or tangles!! Was recommended to me by my hair stylist - fabulous product!</li>
            <li> I have long hair and always have a tangled mess after taking a shower.  This brush has saved me so much time!  It is amazing how easily it glides through my hair.  I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, as does my 4 year old daughter, and once it gets wet it can be extremely difficult (read impossible) to brush out.  In the past if I didn&#x27;t have a very wide toothed comb I was in trouble.  My hairdresser introduced me to the wet brush.  I actually laughed at her when she suggested brushing out my hair with it.  \\&quot;Sure, go ahead, good luck!\\&quot;  I was amazed when it went right through my snarled wet mop with ease.  If you have a little girl with long, fine hair buy this brush.  Trust me.  I have since bought spares for my gym bag and the after bath brush out with my little girl is so much more pleasant now.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was worth getting this brush that cost a little more than at the dollar store, but after my first time using it I was super surprised by how great it felt.  Not only did it feel great, there&#x27;s also no tangle or pulling like I get with the cheap dollar brush.  The beaded tips on my old brush break off after about 6 months, so can I only hope that this new one will last longer.  To sum it up, the J&amp;D Wet Brush is totally worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update 11/12/2012*&lt;br /&gt;Sadly the soft round tips have fallen off after a few months of use and now have sharp ends which scratches at the scalp when combing. The brush still works fine as long as I don&#x27;t comb hard. I&#x27;d still recommend it as I feel it&#x27;ll last longer than those cheap dollar brushes.  The soft rubber surface of the grip has not worn off yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update 1/24/2013*&lt;br /&gt;J&amp;D Beauty sent a replacement brush! Amazing customer service! They really stand behind their product! Five stars!</li>
            <li> This brush is almost considered a &amp;#34;Miracle&amp;#34; in my book because of how easily and smoothly it brushes through my extremely long and straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on the spur of the moment expecting to be completely disappointed because I had reached the point that I just did not believe anything would work because of the constant let downs over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had long hair since I was a little girl, sure I&#x27;ve caught it real short a few times just to try something different and follow the &amp;#34;trend&amp;#34; but I always return to my long hair..I just love it and how easy it is to do any hairdo I want!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combs, moisturizers, oils, creams, conditioners, treatments, you name it simply would not cut it for my hair for some reason but this brush has just found that magic touch and brushes through my wet hair like a knife cuts through butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish my mom had this brush when I was young because brushing my hair would have been a much more pleasant experience!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it brushes as well when my hair is dry because it takes a little longer to get all the knots sorted out and my hair to be smooth and silky but really I don&#x27;t care one bit because I have finally found THE brush for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got the brush in I was like I totally over paid for this thing I could have bought the same brush from any store for a few bucks......It really looks just like any other brush with very soft/flexible bristles, nothing special or unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as you can imagine my shock and surprise when this brush just knocked all my negative thoughts out of the ball park is beyond words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this to all the parents out there that have kids that cannot stand the sight of a brush and brake down in tears and a tantrum, that have fear in their eyes because of the torture they feel when getting brushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do it for them but also for you piece of mind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this and buy it again.itely recommend this and buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using two brushes for years, one soft bristle brush and one regular detangling brush. The wet brush does the job of both, I love it! It&#x27;s really gentle, doesn&#x27;t pull out your hair, but it actually detangles your hair. Plus it&#x27;s really east to clean.</li>
            <li> My daughter has really tangly hair and this brush works miracles when her hair is wet.  It works best after conditioner is applied and I brush the conditioner through.  Then after rinsing her hair the brush just glides through her hair.  I used to dread combing/brushing her hair and now it is easy breezy!  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these brushes for me and my daughter.  While I think the brush works well, the handle is very small and since I have carpal tunnel it is difficult to hold.  I have to cradle the main part of the brush to use it.  I would like to see this available with a larger handle in the future.</li>
            <li> I have thick but very fine hair that tangles easily--especially in the winter time (dry air). This brush is a life saver!! It&#x27;s made brushing my hair when I get out of the shower so much easier and just pain free. I definitely recommend it to anyone with fine hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> This brush sucks- pulls my hair out (dry and wet) and the bristles started to bend and break after 2-3 uses. I tried to return it, but the return period was a week or something really short, so I missed the cut off date.</li>
            <li> This brush is much gentler than any other I&#x27;ve used to detangle wet hair, but I do use Kenra Blow-Dry Spray also.  Using a different kind of brush with the Kenra is not as effective as this brush is.  I even bought one for my daughter&#x27;s stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> This brush works great! The price is pretty good. I was recommended by a cousin of mine who is a hair stylist to get one because it doesn&#x27;t cause breakage, it takes out knots easily, and is great for people who are tender headed. I&#x27;m not tender headed, but I can feel the difference. I notice that I don&#x27;t see as much hair left on the brush as I normally would with a regular brush. I definitely recommend this brush for all ages! I am going to get one for my niece because she is super tender headed and has super long hair!</li>
            <li> I live on the coast so am frequently in the ocean / pool.  This is a great brush to keep in my beach bag so that I can quickly brush my hair when I get out of the water.  Would love to have one in my shower too, but it does not have a hole to hang it on.  My mother used it when she came to visit and immediately ordered one from Amazon as well.</li>
