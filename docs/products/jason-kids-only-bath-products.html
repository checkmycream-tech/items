            <li>smells nice.</li>
            <li>She has very fine, curly hair and this works nicely.  </li>
            <li>Nice fruity scent (but strong!).</li>
            <li>This conditioner has been great to smooth her hair and make it more manageable.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and keep her hair tangle free.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my 2 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li>Honestly, Suave was better than what I got.</li>
            <li>This conditioner works wonderfully for leaving the hair soft and detangled.  </li>
            <li>I was not in love with this conditioner, but I really liked it.</li>

            <li>Looking for something more &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>We love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Having your 3 year-old ask for \\&quot;luxurious\\&quot; hair is a bonus, so darned cute.  </li>
            <li>Works great on both my kids hair, straight and wavy.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>the squeeze more out.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>We both love the smell.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing again, and I recommend purchasing for kids for the healthy, organic, cleansing properties.</li>
            <li>Does make my daughters hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>The scent is okay and not over-powering, just not as \\&quot;yummy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>My kids love love love this smell.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>My girls love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>This smells great and makes my kid&#x27;s hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Unless I come across something significantly better, I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I just wish it had a better rating on EWG.</li>
            <li>decided to try one more brand before just giving up.</li>
            <li>It smells great, you don&#x27;t have to use too much and love the ingredients.</li>
            <li>and I wanted something safe for him ( chemical wise this was very highly rated by EWG for being safe).</li>
            <li>so much I might use it on my own hair!</li>
            <li>Smells great and works very well to de-tangle fine hair.</li>
            <li>Works well, nice mild scent.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it&#x27;s chemical free!</li>
            <li>This conditioner works great and makes her hair very soft and easy to brush/comb without the tangles.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner smells great and keeps the tangles out of my 5 year old&#x27;s curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I like this stuff and am happy to have found a natural product for my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and my kids hair is silky smooth.</li>
            <li>This works great to detangle my daughter&#x27;s curls (18 months old)</li>
            <li>, I use it with the shampoo for my daughter&#x27;s hair and it leaves it soft and smelling great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle (doesn&#x27;t burn her eyes), smells good, and works well.</li>
            <li>It works fairly well on my daughter&#x27;s hair, which tends to be very tangly.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my daughters hair easy to comb though and a lot better off than the chemical filled options out there.  </li>
            <li>priced right, nice smell, but not too strong.</li>
            <li>I rubs in easily.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you smell on the bottle but after washing and rinsing well it just leaves a nice mild fruity scent of clean hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell strong or chemically, just sort of fruity.</li>
            <li>but I did not find it to be strong at all.</li>
            <li>bit smelly for our taste, but better price point than the tried and true CA Baby.</li>
            <li>Her fine hair is left silky smooth, soft, hydrated, and best of all tangle free!</li>
            <li>This is a light citrus-berry.</li>
            <li>I even enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>Rinsed out great, just don&#x27;t put on big globs.</li>
            <li>Overall a great conditioner for kids.</li>
            <li>We tend to leave it in their hair for a bit, maybe 1-5 minutes... then lightly rinse.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found for getting the snarls out and won&#x27;t sting their little eyes!</li>
            <li>The product itself is okay, but the bottle gets misshapen after the first squirt.  </li>
            <li>This is the first conditioner/detangler that I really love for my daughter.</li>
            <li>Works great at detangling my daughters long hair.</li>
            <li>I feel better about my kids using it since it&#x27;s more natural</li>
            <li>Smell is reminiscent of something from my childhood and makes me happy ;)</li>
            <li>It smells good, it doesn&#x27;t leave a film on their hair, and it is the first conditioner to leave my daughter&#x27;s hair soft instead of brittle.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it helps with knots because my girls are always full of knots</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many of their products and they all work really well, but they all have something off with the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Again, a great alternative to those other chemical laced conditioners.</li>
            <li>, it agitates her tremendously.</li>
            <li>Works quickly.</li>
            <li>Not as &amp;#34;detangling&amp;#34; as a conditioner with lots of sulfates and parables but does the job just fine, has a nice scent, and hair is nice and soft when dry.</li>
            <li>I have a curly haired 4 year old and this stuff is pretty effective with the tangles.</li>
            <li>This makes her hair shiny, soft, and amazingly easy to brush (quite a feat for fine, curly hair).</li>
            <li>Great conditioner - works miracles on our little one&#x27;s tangle-prone &amp;#34;cotton candy&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li>The last conditioner we were using worked fine too but smelled of coconuts, which I love</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s all natural, but it doesn&#x27;t work as a detangling product, which is the reason I bought it.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my young daughter who has many a tangle in her hair.</li>
            <li>i tried spray in detangler without success.</li>
            <li>While washing, my kids have to suffer through it as it is so powerful.  </li>
            <li>this product is mild smelling and really does the job!</li>
            <li>After using her hair is easy to comb through and is super soft.  </li>
            <li>In the morning is when my oldest child generally has the most tangles</li>
            <li>My daughter has long fine hair and it gets tangled easily.  </li>
            <li>my three year old hates having her hair wash, with fine hair and tangles</li>
            <li>I like the organic nature of the product, but would like it better if it left her hair a bit softer.</li>
            <li>this comes pretty close.</li>
            <li>Brushing her hair was so, so much easier!</li>
            <li>Its tear free and all natural.</li>
            <li>This one works really well, but the sweet smell is too much.</li>
            <li>First I tried a 2 in one shampoo/conditioner, that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>It did help more than the Mixed Chicks</li>
            <li>good for thin hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li>I love Jason products and the fact that they are more natural than other brands.</li>
            <li>My daughters have different hair, oldest has thick but fine hair, like me, so it snarls easily and my youngest has curly hair that is dry and very tangle-y and it works great on both of their hair!</li>
            <li>Smells great and makes my little girls hair perfectly soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>The price is amazing because you use less of this produce than others</li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;m very particular about smells, I tend to not continue using their products.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has very curly &amp; coarse hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>Really helps get the knots out.</li>
            <li>fast delivery, product as described</li>
            <li>I use this with the Jason detangling shampoo, so I definitely expected a better result.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this as we will continue buying this!</li>
            <li>and this really helped to get it detangled and brush will recommend</li>
            <li>Can that really be nontoxic?&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t get the snarls out of her very curly hair.</li>
            <li>At her next bath, I smoothed this on after shampooing and it made her hair smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li>I thought both Shampoo and Conditioner worked really well.</li>
            <li>I used many other brands on my kids hair, Aveeno, Suave, Johnson &amp; Johnson...</li>
            <li>disappointed, shampoo great but not the conditioner, its ok.</li>
            <li>The Conditioner itself is thick and easy to apply to a squirming child, smells very nice and last a long while.   </li>
            <li>Best of all I love the fact that I am not pouring a bunch of nasty chemicals on my daughter&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It gives your little one the softest, yummiest smelling most luxurious hair.  </li>
            <li>Could be a little more detangling but works well.</li>
            <li>I like this for my little girl&#x27;s tangly curly hair, but the smell wasn&#x27;t my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Ingredients are natural and my toddler loves it and it&#x27;s so much easier to comb</li>
            <li>I have 3 year old twins with VERY curly hair.</li>
            <li>Finally a product that makes hair easy to comb a couple of days in a row without daily washing.</li>
            <li>Most of them leave your hair stiff or tangly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but not better than another children&#x27;s detangling conditioner I use.  </li>
            <li>My hair is also shiny and touchable SOFT!</li>
            <li>As for my 12 mo old she now has no cradle cap!  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is fine and just below her shoulders, not thick and heavy.</li>
            <li>My toddler has fine, slightly wavy hair, but it tangles up easily on the back (especially when she sleeps on her back).</li>
            <li>My baby after use Jason kids Conditioner it is really soft hair</li>
            <li>I use this shampoo and conditioner for my 2 year old triplets</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>gets the tangles out of my 2 1/2 year old daughter&#x27;s hair without the tears.</li>
            <li>(I use it on my 3 yr old)</li>
            <li>Her hair is soft after we use it.</li>
            <li>I bought this conditioner after I gave my 2 year old daughter a bath</li>
            <li>I know it says &amp;#34;kids only&amp;#34; but my husband and I have been looking for a paraben and chemical free shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling stiff.</li>
            <li>Leaves my daughters long straight hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Tried other natural baby conditioners, such as California Baby, and this is the only one that works on my child&#x27;s fine hair.</li>
            <li>Started using this conditioner on my girls&#x27; hair (one very thick, two very fine,) and have used it myself, in a pinch.</li>
            <li>I wish it has the same scent as the Jason Extra Gentle hair products.</li>
            <li>Some people complained about strong smell</li>
            <li>I use what is left on my hand on my one year old and it makes his hair so shiny!</li>
            <li>Gave this a try due to all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>but I am able to comb through my thick long wavy/curly hair with ease.</li>
            <li>My 12 mo old had pretty bad cradle cap and my 4yr old had lots of knots in her fine hair.</li>
            <li>Use for my 3 year old twins who have long curly hair.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;It makes my kids&#x27; long hair soft and supple.</li>
            <li>A small amount may be absorbed into the skin and can be toxic.  </li>
            <li>I have tried 4 different \\&quot;natural\\&quot; detangler and had very little success with them.</li>

            <li> Not the best smell in the world, the shampoo smells much better, but amazing at detangling.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells great and works amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells good and works good.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> Smells good, works well.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll keep looking for a good detangling conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great, safe product with a wonderful smell that leaves my daughters hair silky and smooth</li>

            <li> This conditioner, and the shampoo, smell nice..</li>
            <li> Smells nice too but not overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> smells nice.</li>
            <li> She has very fine, curly hair and this works nicely.  </li>
            <li> Nice fruity scent (but strong!).</li>
            <li> This conditioner has been great to smooth her hair and make it more manageable.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell and keep her hair tangle free.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my 2 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li> Honestly, Suave was better than what I got.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works wonderfully for leaving the hair soft and detangled.  </li>
            <li> I was not in love with this conditioner, but I really liked it.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this conditioner, it is light and pleasant.</li>

            <li> This works wonderful because not only does it smell amazing</li>
            <li> This product has done the trick and has a very light scent.</li>
            <li> Looking for something more &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> We love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Having your 3 year-old ask for \\&quot;luxurious\\&quot; hair is a bonus, so darned cute.  </li>
            <li> Works great on both my kids hair, straight and wavy.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> the squeeze more out.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> We both love the smell.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing again, and I recommend purchasing for kids for the healthy, organic, cleansing properties.</li>
            <li> Does make my daughters hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> The scent is okay and not over-powering, just not as \\&quot;yummy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My kids love love love this smell.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> My girls love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> This smells great and makes my kid&#x27;s hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Unless I come across something significantly better, I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I just wish it had a better rating on EWG.</li>
            <li> decided to try one more brand before just giving up.</li>
            <li> It smells great, you don&#x27;t have to use too much and love the ingredients.</li>
            <li> and I wanted something safe for him ( chemical wise this was very highly rated by EWG for being safe).</li>
            <li> so much I might use it on my own hair!</li>
            <li> Smells great and works very well to de-tangle fine hair.</li>
            <li> Works well, nice mild scent.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it&#x27;s chemical free!</li>
            <li> This conditioner works great and makes her hair very soft and easy to brush/comb without the tangles.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner smells great and keeps the tangles out of my 5 year old&#x27;s curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I like this stuff and am happy to have found a natural product for my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and my kids hair is silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This works great to detangle my daughter&#x27;s curls (18 months old)</li>
            <li> , I use it with the shampoo for my daughter&#x27;s hair and it leaves it soft and smelling great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle (doesn&#x27;t burn her eyes), smells good, and works well.</li>
            <li> It works fairly well on my daughter&#x27;s hair, which tends to be very tangly.</li>
            <li> and it leaves my daughters hair easy to comb though and a lot better off than the chemical filled options out there.  </li>
            <li> priced right, nice smell, but not too strong.</li>
            <li> I rubs in easily.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you smell on the bottle but after washing and rinsing well it just leaves a nice mild fruity scent of clean hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell strong or chemically, just sort of fruity.</li>
            <li> but I did not find it to be strong at all.</li>
            <li> bit smelly for our taste, but better price point than the tried and true CA Baby.</li>
            <li> Her fine hair is left silky smooth, soft, hydrated, and best of all tangle free!</li>
            <li> This is a light citrus-berry.</li>
            <li> I even enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> Rinsed out great, just don&#x27;t put on big globs.</li>
            <li> Overall a great conditioner for kids.</li>
            <li> We tend to leave it in their hair for a bit, maybe 1-5 minutes... then lightly rinse.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found for getting the snarls out and won&#x27;t sting their little eyes!</li>
            <li> The product itself is okay, but the bottle gets misshapen after the first squirt.  </li>
            <li> This is the first conditioner/detangler that I really love for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Works great at detangling my daughters long hair.</li>
            <li> I feel better about my kids using it since it&#x27;s more natural</li>
            <li> Smell is reminiscent of something from my childhood and makes me happy ;)</li>
            <li> It smells good, it doesn&#x27;t leave a film on their hair, and it is the first conditioner to leave my daughter&#x27;s hair soft instead of brittle.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it helps with knots because my girls are always full of knots</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many of their products and they all work really well, but they all have something off with the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Again, a great alternative to those other chemical laced conditioners.</li>
            <li> , it agitates her tremendously.</li>
            <li> Works quickly.</li>
            <li> Not as &amp;#34;detangling&amp;#34; as a conditioner with lots of sulfates and parables but does the job just fine, has a nice scent, and hair is nice and soft when dry.</li>
            <li> I have a curly haired 4 year old and this stuff is pretty effective with the tangles.</li>
            <li> This makes her hair shiny, soft, and amazingly easy to brush (quite a feat for fine, curly hair).</li>
            <li> Great conditioner - works miracles on our little one&#x27;s tangle-prone &amp;#34;cotton candy&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> The last conditioner we were using worked fine too but smelled of coconuts, which I love</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s all natural, but it doesn&#x27;t work as a detangling product, which is the reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my young daughter who has many a tangle in her hair.</li>
            <li> i tried spray in detangler without success.</li>
            <li> While washing, my kids have to suffer through it as it is so powerful.  </li>
            <li> this product is mild smelling and really does the job!</li>
            <li> After using her hair is easy to comb through and is super soft.  </li>
            <li> In the morning is when my oldest child generally has the most tangles</li>
            <li> My daughter has long fine hair and it gets tangled easily.  </li>
            <li> my three year old hates having her hair wash, with fine hair and tangles</li>
            <li> I like the organic nature of the product, but would like it better if it left her hair a bit softer.</li>
            <li> this comes pretty close.</li>
            <li> Brushing her hair was so, so much easier!</li>
            <li> Its tear free and all natural.</li>
            <li> This one works really well, but the sweet smell is too much.</li>
            <li> First I tried a 2 in one shampoo/conditioner, that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It did help more than the Mixed Chicks</li>
            <li> good for thin hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li> I love Jason products and the fact that they are more natural than other brands.</li>
            <li> My daughters have different hair, oldest has thick but fine hair, like me, so it snarls easily and my youngest has curly hair that is dry and very tangle-y and it works great on both of their hair!</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my little girls hair perfectly soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> The price is amazing because you use less of this produce than others</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;m very particular about smells, I tend to not continue using their products.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has very curly &amp; coarse hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> Really helps get the knots out.</li>
            <li> fast delivery, product as described</li>
            <li> I use this with the Jason detangling shampoo, so I definitely expected a better result.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this as we will continue buying this!</li>
            <li> and this really helped to get it detangled and brush will recommend</li>
            <li> Can that really be nontoxic?&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t get the snarls out of her very curly hair.</li>
            <li> At her next bath, I smoothed this on after shampooing and it made her hair smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> I thought both Shampoo and Conditioner worked really well.</li>
            <li> I used many other brands on my kids hair, Aveeno, Suave, Johnson &amp; Johnson...</li>
            <li> disappointed, shampoo great but not the conditioner, its ok.</li>
            <li> The Conditioner itself is thick and easy to apply to a squirming child, smells very nice and last a long while.   </li>
            <li> Best of all I love the fact that I am not pouring a bunch of nasty chemicals on my daughter&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It gives your little one the softest, yummiest smelling most luxurious hair.  </li>
            <li> Could be a little more detangling but works well.</li>
            <li> I like this for my little girl&#x27;s tangly curly hair, but the smell wasn&#x27;t my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Ingredients are natural and my toddler loves it and it&#x27;s so much easier to comb</li>
            <li> I have 3 year old twins with VERY curly hair.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that makes hair easy to comb a couple of days in a row without daily washing.</li>
            <li> Most of them leave your hair stiff or tangly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but not better than another children&#x27;s detangling conditioner I use.  </li>
            <li> My hair is also shiny and touchable SOFT!</li>
            <li> As for my 12 mo old she now has no cradle cap!  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is fine and just below her shoulders, not thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> My toddler has fine, slightly wavy hair, but it tangles up easily on the back (especially when she sleeps on her back).</li>
            <li> My baby after use Jason kids Conditioner it is really soft hair</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo and conditioner for my 2 year old triplets</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> gets the tangles out of my 2 1/2 year old daughter&#x27;s hair without the tears.</li>
            <li> (I use it on my 3 yr old)</li>
            <li> Her hair is soft after we use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner after I gave my 2 year old daughter a bath</li>
            <li> I know it says &amp;#34;kids only&amp;#34; but my husband and I have been looking for a paraben and chemical free shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling stiff.</li>
            <li> Leaves my daughters long straight hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Tried other natural baby conditioners, such as California Baby, and this is the only one that works on my child&#x27;s fine hair.</li>
            <li> Started using this conditioner on my girls&#x27; hair (one very thick, two very fine,) and have used it myself, in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I wish it has the same scent as the Jason Extra Gentle hair products.</li>
            <li> Some people complained about strong smell</li>
            <li> I use what is left on my hand on my one year old and it makes his hair so shiny!</li>
            <li> Gave this a try due to all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> but I am able to comb through my thick long wavy/curly hair with ease.</li>
            <li> My 12 mo old had pretty bad cradle cap and my 4yr old had lots of knots in her fine hair.</li>
            <li> Use for my 3 year old twins who have long curly hair.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;It makes my kids&#x27; long hair soft and supple.</li>
            <li> A small amount may be absorbed into the skin and can be toxic.  </li>
            <li> I have tried 4 different \\&quot;natural\\&quot; detangler and had very little success with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of other detanglers that I happened to have samples of on her hair, but they didn&#x27;t work anywhere near as well.</li>
            <li> The price is a little high, but will probably buy again because I know it works for her hair.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this for my daughters long hair.  </li>
            <li> It is not heavy, weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> Natural ingredients, although some are subject to debate for example</li>
            <li> It leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair dry and frizzy, and it&#x27;s constantly getting tangled.</li>
            <li> It has a light scent and made my daughters hair super soft and has helped with her awful tangles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was just not right for my daughter&#x27;s hair type, the seller (what was actually in the bottle) or the actual product itself.</li>
            <li> but it takes a really long time to rinse out, even if you use a teeny bit.</li>
            <li> Use this on all four of my granddaughters&#x27; long hair.</li>
            <li> it was a little ofter after I brushed it but still left tangles.</li>
            <li> Leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair feeling dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> My three year olds hair was getting dry</li>
            <li> all of them seem to dry their hair out.</li>
            <li> She is not even 2 yet and her curls tend to get a bit dry on the ends and it tangles a lot.</li>
            <li> My twin daughters have very long curly hair and this product is a dream!</li>
            <li> I could brush it wet or dry and there were no knots.</li>
            <li> I used this as the instructions said to, but added a pea-sized amount while her hair was still soaking wet.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s kind of annoying when you have to store it and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands but they always left her hair feeling heavy or waxy.</li>
            <li> It also works wonders on the tangles and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> little goes a LONG way with this too.</li>
            <li> I will stick with the other brand.</li>
            <li> Sodium benzoate is a preservative added to hair and other products.  </li>
            <li> This smells great and a little goes a long way, which is why the price isn&#x27;t awful when you realize how little you need.</li>
            <li> Then I tried Mixed Chicks leave in conditioner, that just made their hair stiff and by the time it dried</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> We shampoo a usual, rinse then apply a &amp;#34;hersey kiss&amp;#34; amount to my daughters long hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has really thick hair, and this is the only child conditioner I could find, that would detangle her hair.  </li>
            <li> Was looking for something without parabens, etc., that detangles well without being irritating to a young child&#x27;s eyes.</li>
            <li> The fact that amazon requires so many words is annoying though.</li>
            <li> Love this for my son, he used to HATE washing his hair</li>
            <li> I refuse to use a conventional detangling conditioner as those typically contain formaldehyde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter had long thick hair</li>
            <li> my little one had tangles in her hair after shampooing.</li>
            <li> I used this product after I wash my little girls hair with the ultra drying shampoo and it did nothing.  </li>
            <li> Saved us a lot of pain and crying.</li>
            <li> Always keeps my daughters thicky wavy/curly hair tame.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thin curly hair and it was always dry and frizzy after washing.  </li>
            <li> It can be difficult to brush after bath time if not properly conditioned.  </li>
            <li> but I still had to use the spray in No More</li>
            <li> but since I switched to this product there&#x27;s no more fighting.  </li>
            <li> My toddler has fine hair that tangles horribly.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find products without this ingredient.</li>
            <li> It was hardly a conditioner, let alone a detangler.</li>
            <li> and so it&#x27;s a bit hard getting out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to squeeze it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Wish it came as an unscented version, but at least the brushing battles have stopped in our house.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works well, it&#x27;s just really thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking that the plastic is too thick.</li>
            <li> My 7-year-old daughter has straight, slightly thick hair that comes down to the bottom of her shoulder blades, and hair-brushing time is usually a miserable battle.</li>
            <li> This definitely does detangle my daughter&#x27;s hair, but it&#x27;s impossible to wash out leaving her hair slightly slimy feeling and dirty looking.  </li>
            <li> this does soften and detangle my daughter&#x27;s hair, but it is tough to rinse out, and she acts like it burns her eyes a bit too.</li>
            <li> BUT I was not happy to read sodium benzoate in the ingredients list.  </li>
            <li> But, unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work on my daughter&#x27;s hair as well as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> No more Tangles which, to me, smells awful and perfumy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically impossible to find a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible.</li>
            <li> Has a terrible chemically smell, leaves a film on my daughter&#x27;s hair, and doesn&#x27;t even detangle!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> works well with my girls&#x27; very fine hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has really thick hair, and this is the only child conditioner I could find, that would detangle her hair.  It also smells great!</li>
            <li> My toddler has fine, slightly wavy hair, but it tangles up easily on the back (especially when she sleeps on her back). I use this only on the back of the head. It detangles hair almost instantly. It&#x27;s gentle (doesn&#x27;t burn her eyes), smells good, and works well. I love Jason products and the fact that they are more natural than other brands.</li>
            <li> Gave this a try due to all the positive reviews.  It&#x27;s okay, but not better than another children&#x27;s detangling conditioner I use.  I will stick with the other brand.</li>
            <li> It smells good and works good. I can&#x27;t say it helps with knots because my girls are always full of knots no matter what we use.</li>
            <li> Use for my 3 year old twins who have long curly hair.  This combined w/the teeny genie brush has helped their hair stay knot-free and they even sit still to let me brush it!  The orange smell is a bonus - everyone smells delicious after they use.</li>
            <li> Fruity smell is a bit overpowering. Helps with tangles. Looking for something more &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> We love this stuff.  It gives your little one the softest, yummiest smelling most luxurious hair.  Having your 3 year-old ask for \\&quot;luxurious\\&quot; hair is a bonus, so darned cute.  Functionally it is great, my daughter&#x27;s hair brushes out beautifully without tangles or pain when we use this product.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling conditioner. It works fairly well on my daughter&#x27;s hair, which tends to be very tangly. I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair feeling dry and brittle.  I like the organic nature of the product, but would like it better if it left her hair a bit softer.</li>
            <li> Always keeps my daughters thicky wavy/curly hair tame. The Conditioner itself is thick and easy to apply to a squirming child, smells very nice and last a long while.   The price is a little high, but will probably buy again because I know it works for her hair.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my toddler&#x27;s hair and it works great.  BUT I was not happy to read sodium benzoate in the ingredients list.  Sodium benzoate is a preservative added to hair and other products.  A small amount may be absorbed into the skin and can be toxic.  It is hard to find products without this ingredient.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner. Really helps get the knots out. My daughter has very curly &amp; coarse hair that tangles easily. I put this in &amp; can then brush it out.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a children&#x27;s conditioner that would work for both my son and daughter and that was gentle enough for them for everyday use.  This one is great.  My daughter has long fine hair and it gets tangled easily.  It can be difficult to brush after bath time if not properly conditioned.  This conditioner works great and makes her hair very soft and easy to brush/comb without the tangles.  It works great on my son&#x27;s hair as well.  This conditioner smells really great.  The last conditioner we were using worked fine too but smelled of coconuts, which I love but my husband couldn&#x27;t stand.  So now we found one with a scent that we both like and one that works great on our kid&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect product. My baby after use Jason kids Conditioner it is really soft hair so I will keep use again!</li>
            <li> This conditioner rocks.  My daughter has curly, tangle prone, fine-ish hair.  This conditioner, and the shampoo, smell nice..oh so fruity..and it leaves my daughters hair easy to comb though and a lot better off than the chemical filled options out there.  I feel better about my kids using it since it&#x27;s more natural and it works..what else can I ask for?  I used it once on myself and my hair loved it!</li>
            <li> Works great on both my kids hair, straight and wavy. Natural ingredients, although some are subject to debate for example soybean oil (to GMO or to not GMO) and sodium benzoate (cancer concerns). It&#x27;s basically impossible to find a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; beauty product that can please everyone, but this comes pretty close.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of reviews. My 7-year-old daughter has straight, slightly thick hair that comes down to the bottom of her shoulder blades, and hair-brushing time is usually a miserable battle. I used this as the instructions said to, but added a pea-sized amount while her hair was still soaking wet. It worked wonderfully. Brushing her hair was so, so much easier! I&#x27;ve used a couple of other detanglers that I happened to have samples of on her hair, but they didn&#x27;t work anywhere near as well. This is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have a curly haired 4 year old and this stuff is pretty effective with the tangles. Kinda slimy - but it works.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo and conditioner for my 2 year old triplets and I love it. Its tear free and all natural.</li>
            <li> fast delivery, product as described</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s all natural, but it doesn&#x27;t work as a detangling product, which is the reason I bought it. It leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair dry and frizzy, and it&#x27;s constantly getting tangled. I use this with the Jason detangling shampoo, so I definitely expected a better result. For the price, I&#x27;ll look for something else.</li>
            <li> Great for chlorinated hair.  doesn&#x27;t hurt eyes and leaves hair shiney!  my daughter likes the smell as well.  I will continue to buy this one!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Smells great and gets through though tangles.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Could be a little more detangling but works well.</li>
            <li> Great, safe product with a wonderful smell that leaves my daughters hair silky and smooth</li>
            <li> My three year olds hair was getting dry and I wanted something safe for him ( chemical wise this was very highly rated by EWG for being safe). You only need a pea sized amount it works so well! I use what is left on my hand on my one year old and it makes his hair so shiny!</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my little girls hair perfectly soft and manageable. I will continue to buy this product in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner that I use for myself. I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My problem with Jason products is the smell.  I&#x27;ve used many of their products and they all work really well, but they all have something off with the fragrance.  Because I&#x27;m very particular about smells, I tend to not continue using their products.  This one works really well, but the sweet smell is too much.</li>
            <li> The product itself is okay, but the bottle gets misshapen after the first squirt.  It doesn&#x27;t go back to the regular shape.  That&#x27;s kind of annoying when you have to store it and the squeeze more out.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this conditioner, it is light and pleasant. It also works wonders on the tangles and a little bit goes a long way. Best of all I love the fact that I am not pouring a bunch of nasty chemicals on my daughter&#x27;s head. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> works great! smells great! good for thin hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li> Perfect for my 2 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li> disappointed, shampoo great but not the conditioner, its ok. still looking for a conditioner without sls, and chemicals that can detangle and give body to hair organically.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has been great for my child&#x27;s hair. It has a light scent and made my daughters hair super soft and has helped with her awful tangles.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells great and keeps the tangles out of my 5 year old&#x27;s curly hair.  We have used it for almost 2 years now.  It is great!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my young daughter who has many a tangle in her hair. To be blunt, what I ordered sucked. It was hardly a conditioner, let alone a detangler. I don&#x27;t know if it was just not right for my daughter&#x27;s hair type, the seller (what was actually in the bottle) or the actual product itself. Honestly, Suave was better than what I got. Just saying...for her hair type, which I noted, don&#x27;t bother. Or...maybe try it from an actual reatailer? I don&#x27;t know as it got many great reviews...</li>
            <li> We switched from Cali Baby conditioner to this and have never looked back. This conditioner actually works. Highly recommend. The shampoo is great too.</li>
            <li> my three year old hates having her hair wash, with fine hair and tangles, it agitates her tremendously. this product is mild smelling and really does the job!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Have been using it for my daughter for years. Not the best smell in the world, the shampoo smells much better, but amazing at detangling.</li>
            <li> This is the first conditioner/detangler that I really love for my daughter. I&#x27;ve tried other brands but they always left her hair feeling heavy or waxy. This makes her hair shiny, soft, and amazingly easy to brush (quite a feat for fine, curly hair). We both love the smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell strong or chemically, just sort of fruity. (She says it smells like lollipops.) I like this stuff so much I might use it on my own hair!</li>
            <li> I like this stuff and am happy to have found a natural product for my daughter&#x27;s hair. I will be purchasing again, and I recommend purchasing for kids for the healthy, organic, cleansing properties.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff on my girls for years and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found for getting the snarls out and won&#x27;t sting their little eyes! My daughters have different hair, oldest has thick but fine hair, like me, so it snarls easily and my youngest has curly hair that is dry and very tangle-y and it works great on both of their hair!</li>
            <li> my little one had tangles in her hair after shampooing. i tried spray in detangler without success. this stuff smells great and works amazing. highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works well, it&#x27;s just really thick and so it&#x27;s a bit hard getting out of the bottle.  Does make my daughters hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! An amazing detangler.</li>
            <li> Ingredients are natural and my toddler loves it and it&#x27;s so much easier to comb her curly hear after the bath.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner - works miracles on our little one&#x27;s tangle-prone &amp;#34;cotton candy&amp;#34; hair. Smell is reminiscent of something from my childhood and makes me happy ;)</li>
            <li> My daughter has thin curly hair and it was always dry and frizzy after washing.  This conditioner has been great to smooth her hair and make it more manageable.  Smells nice too but not overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> My toddler has fine hair that tangles horribly. I have tried 4 different \\&quot;natural\\&quot; detangler and had very little success with them. I refuse to use a conventional detangling conditioner as those typically contain formaldehyde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, this conditioner rocks!  Her fine hair is left silky smooth, soft, hydrated, and best of all tangle free! I wish it has the same scent as the Jason Extra Gentle hair products. This is a light citrus-berry. The scent is okay and not over-powering, just not as \\&quot;yummy\\&quot;. Try this conditioner for your tangled kiddo, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Works well, nice mild scent.</li>
            <li> My kids love love love this smell.  But, unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work on my daughter&#x27;s hair as well as I&#x27;d like.  I ended up using Twig leave-in instead.</li>
            <li> I know it says &amp;#34;kids only&amp;#34; but my husband and I have been looking for a paraben and chemical free shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling stiff. Most of them leave your hair stiff or tangly. This works wonderful because not only does it smell amazing but I am able to comb through my thick long wavy/curly hair with ease. My hair is also shiny and touchable SOFT! So this is not just for kids. Highly recommend this as we will continue buying this!</li>
            <li> I used this product after I wash my little girls hair with the ultra drying shampoo and it did nothing.  I did not like it and will not suggest people with curly hair buy this product.</li>
            <li> I have used Jason Kids Only Shampoo and conditioner for over a year on my daughter.  She has very fine, curly hair and this works nicely.  It has a pleasant smell and keep her hair tangle free.</li>
            <li> Was looking for something without parabens, etc., that detangles well without being irritating to a young child&#x27;s eyes. This product has done the trick and has a very light scent.</li>
            <li> Tried other natural baby conditioners, such as California Baby, and this is the only one that works on my child&#x27;s fine hair. Wish it came as an unscented version, but at least the brushing battles have stopped in our house.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the BEST! We have tried YES to carrots and the TruKid brand, this stuff blows them out of the water. It smells good, it doesn&#x27;t leave a film on their hair, and it is the first conditioner to leave my daughter&#x27;s hair soft instead of brittle. We are an all natural/organic product using family and it&#x27;s great to come across one that works so well.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Finally a product that makes hair easy to comb a couple of days in a row without daily washing.</li>
            <li> This works great as a conditioner. My daughter&#x27;s hair is fine and just below her shoulders, not thick and heavy. It smells great and gets the job done. We love it!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and my kids hair is silky smooth. I&#x27;ve contemplated buying this for myself.</li>
            <li> Started using this conditioner on my girls&#x27; hair (one very thick, two very fine,) and have used it myself, in a pinch. It works well. Not as &amp;#34;detangling&amp;#34; as a conditioner with lots of sulfates and parables but does the job just fine, has a nice scent, and hair is nice and soft when dry. We like it.</li>
            <li> Perfect I and would suggest to anyone. Good quality. I like to use for myself. The fact that amazon requires so many words is annoying though.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t condition at all.</li>
            <li> This works great to detangle my daughter&#x27;s curls (18 months old) but it takes a really long time to rinse out, even if you use a teeny bit.</li>
            <li> This was recomended to me by my sister in law and I couldn&#x27;t be happier, great product, I use it with the shampoo for my daughter&#x27;s hair and it leaves it soft and smelling great</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible. Has a terrible chemically smell, leaves a film on my daughter&#x27;s hair, and doesn&#x27;t even detangle!</li>
            <li> Works wonders when this is paired with the companion shampoo&lt;br /&gt;It makes my kids&#x27; long hair soft and supple. Works just as well as chemical-full regular shampoos/conditoners. Nice fruity scent (but strong!).</li>
            <li> My girls and I love this product! I have 3 year old twins with VERY curly hair. This stuff is wonderful and makes combing so much easier! I even diluted some to use as a detangling spray. My girls love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a LONG way with this too. The price is amazing because you use less of this produce than others so it last for quite some time. In our house it lasted longer than the shampoo.</li>
            <li> this does soften and detangle my daughter&#x27;s hair, but it is tough to rinse out, and she acts like it burns her eyes a bit too.</li>
            <li> Smells like a fruit salad (so my son won&#x27;t use it) but works like a miracle on my daughter&#x27;s tangly hair.  Works quickly.</li>
            <li> Use this on all four of my granddaughters&#x27; long hair. My daughters friend wanted to know where I got it. Most importantly, it&#x27;s chemical free!</li>
            <li> This conditioner works wonderfully for leaving the hair soft and detangled.  The smell, however, is totally overpowering.  While washing, my kids have to suffer through it as it is so powerful.  After rinsing, it wears off and becomes bearable.</li>
            <li> This smells great and makes my kid&#x27;s hair nice and soft. Works great at detangling my daughters long hair. I even enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> Product works great but it&#x27;s hard to squeeze it out of the bottle. I&#x27;m thinking that the plastic is too thick. That&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing. I also use it diluted with water in a spray bottle in the morning before my kid goes to school.</li>
            <li> I was not in love with this conditioner, but I really liked it. Unless I come across something significantly better, I will continue to use it. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works well on my children&#x27;s hair.  Again, a great alternative to those other chemical laced conditioners.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST detangler I&#x27;ve ever used!  Within seconds, it detangles my son&#x27;s curly hair after shampooing. I will def be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> gets the tangles out of my 2 1/2 year old daughter&#x27;s hair without the tears. Rinsed out great, just don&#x27;t put on big globs.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works very well to de-tangle fine hair.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner!  Leaves my daughters long straight hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Smells good, works well.</li>
            <li> I have to put a lot for it to untangle my son&#x27;s hair and his hair is short.</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner that works on my daughters&#x27; hair. I just wish it had a better rating on EWG. I&#x27;m hoping the company will improve the ingredients.</li>
            <li> this stuff works great. My daughter had long thick hair and this really helped to get it detangled and brush will recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend. priced right, nice smell, but not too strong. Overall a great conditioner for kids. (I use it on my 3 yr old)</li>
            <li> Jury&#x27;s out on the strong Scent! Can that really be nontoxic?&lt;br /&gt;A bit smelly for our taste, but better price point than the tried and true CA Baby. (And slicker hair conditioning qualities.)</li>
            <li> I recently bought this for my daughters long hair.  After using her hair is easy to comb through and is super soft.  It is not heavy, weighing it down.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My twin daughters have very long curly hair and this product is a dream! The only detangler I use on their hair!</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve used yet! I used many other brands on my kids hair, Aveeno, Suave, Johnson &amp; Johnson... all of them seem to dry their hair out. My 12 mo old had pretty bad cradle cap and my 4yr old had lots of knots in her fine hair. I decided to try conditioner to see if that would help. First I tried a 2 in one shampoo/conditioner, that didn&#x27;t work. Then I tried Mixed Chicks leave in conditioner, that just made their hair stiff and by the time it dried it was a little ofter after I brushed it but still left tangles. Then I tried Johnson &amp; Johnson No more Tangles which, to me, smells awful and perfumy. It did help more than the Mixed Chicks but I still had to use the spray in No More Tangles.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try one more brand before just giving up. I have already been using Jason brand shampoo but my retailer doesn&#x27;t sell the conditioner. I added it to my subscribe and save and have been using it for 5 days now. It works great! It smells great! It&#x27;s mostly organic! Whats not to love?!  It has a pleasant citrus smell (I say orange but my kids and husband say lemon). We shampoo a usual, rinse then apply a &amp;#34;hersey kiss&amp;#34; amount to my daughters long hair. I rubs in easily. I also comb her hair while there&#x27;s conditioner in it but thats just my preference. We tend to leave it in their hair for a bit, maybe 1-5 minutes... then lightly rinse. We comb hair again before bed. In the morning is when my oldest child generally has the most tangles and I swear she has not one! I can now brush her hair without tears and hastle.  As for my 12 mo old she now has no cradle cap!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product!</li>
            <li> smells nice. Her hair is soft after we use it.</li>
            <li> I like this for my little girl&#x27;s tangly curly hair, but the smell wasn&#x27;t my favorite.  But if you are looking for something to detangle, this will do the trick.</li>
            <li> Love this for my son, he used to HATE washing his hair but since I switched to this product there&#x27;s no more fighting.  It smells great, you don&#x27;t have to use too much and love the ingredients. It does a great job conditioning. Will continue to purchase this.</li>
            <li> This definitely does detangle my daughter&#x27;s hair, but it&#x27;s impossible to wash out leaving her hair slightly slimy feeling and dirty looking.  I guess I&#x27;ll keep looking for a good detangling conditioner.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner after I gave my 2 year old daughter a bath and I couldn&#x27;t get the snarls out of her very curly hair. At her next bath, I smoothed this on after shampooing and it made her hair smooth and manageable. I could brush it wet or dry and there were no knots. Saved us a lot of pain and crying. I&#x27;m going to purchase the shampoo too after our current shampoo runs out.</li>
            <li> It does a great job on my daughters very-fine-curly hair. She is not even 2 yet and her curls tend to get a bit dry on the ends and it tangles a lot. I thought both Shampoo and Conditioner worked really well. It makes it easier to brush and detangle, especially if I comb it with the conditioner still on hair, before rinsing. Some people complained about strong smell but I did not find it to be strong at all. Maybe if you smell on the bottle but after washing and rinsing well it just leaves a nice mild fruity scent of clean hair. I love it!</li>
            <li> This smells great and a little goes a long way, which is why the price isn&#x27;t awful when you realize how little you need.</li>
