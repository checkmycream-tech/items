            <li>Good  fast services excellent product</li>
            <li>These are an amazing razor blade.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing shave</li>
            <li>but they get the job done and can probably be reused after taken to a very fine stone</li>
            <li>The injector pack is very easy and safe to use and have a handy used blade compartment in the bottom to safely dispose of your blades.</li>
            <li>Very safe and unique.</li>
            <li>Love the container that keeps them stowed and the dispensing mechanism.</li>
            <li>Japanese craftsmanship at its best!</li>
            <li>really love these blades.  </li>
            <li>I love it when I just have to barley</li>
            <li>Way better than shaving with any 4 blade razor.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>b/c the cheaper blades were a bit more forgiving</li>
            <li>Very cool dispenser with disposable container on bottom.</li>
            <li>Nice disposal system,  very much worth the money.</li>
            <li>Great razor,  last many shaves.</li>
            <li>Amazing blades from a stellar maker.</li>
            <li>best blades for feather artist club razors......very very sharp blades but closest shave ever produced from a replaceable razor blade system for myself</li>
            <li>Yes, the sharpest will do just fine.</li>
            <li>The Super are their most aggressive.</li>
            <li>I tried every shavette type blade on the market from the cheap ones to Gillette platinums.</li>
            <li>The shave is fantastic and irritation free.  </li>
            <li>They are considerably more than I was paying but it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I realized the cheap blades were NOT shaving anywhere as close</li>
            <li>It was always a pain to toss my cheap blades b/c</li>
            <li>so to not dig with the corners, smooth</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s about 2 more shaves than I get from the multi-bladed safety razors, and the shave is just as close and far more comfortable to me.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.  </li>
            <li>If you have never use a straight razor you may wanna practice on your arms before you shave your face:)</li>
            <li>Great, sharp.  </li>
            <li>Great blades, Very sharp.</li>
            <li>to get a sense how much better, I did try my cheap straight razor blades one time for kicks and WOW!  </li>
            <li>Bit pricey yes but after using them ,worth it.</li>
            <li>, I recommend them if you have a fierce beard, the handle that these go to is very durable, I have had mine for years, totally a great investment especially if you are considering going to a straight razor eventually.</li>
            <li>Never again, I&#x27;m a convert to these blades and while my initial switch to a straight razor was to save money (tired of paying Gillette&#x27;s extortion for new refills on their n-bladed safety razors) and the cheap blades were so unbelievably cheap, I&#x27;m still willing to pay more for these great razors (Still probably come out way ahead dollar wise using these).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started with a very cheap razor (the ones that cost like $5 for 100 blades) and while that was a big improvement over a normal razor, I didn&#x27;t realize the shave could get even better.  </li>
            <li>If you have a thick beard I recommend shaving after a hot shower, using pre-shave oil, a good quality shaving cream on top of the oil applied with a badger hair brush, then using these blades.</li>
            <li>These swipe right through it with ease.</li>
            <li>Very close and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of blades, but these are the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li>and I found the Super Pro to be much sharper than the Pro.</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>Its awesome sharp so be careful</li>
            <li>First time with these</li>
            <li>I also love the dispenser which makes reloading very simple.  </li>
            <li>My old cheap blade was all manual and was a pain.</li>
            <li>I use these blades exclusively for my old school hot towel/shaves on my clients, close as you can get to the original straight razor!</li>
            <li>These high quality, super sharp blades are just what I needed to make using my Deluxe SS shavette a truly pleasurable experience.</li>
            <li>About a week ago, these Professional Super blades came in.</li>
            <li>Really nothing comes close to these.</li>
            <li>If you use a straight razor (which I do also from Feather)</li>
            <li>Very close shave</li>
            <li>The cut is still there after a week, but it&#x27;s starting to heal to a point where I could use it to shave about two days ago and it is smooth, folks.</li>
            <li>It really is an experience shaving with Feather blades.</li>
            <li>A whole lot faster then stropping and sharpening all the time.  </li>
            <li>The shaves I provide are so much easier on me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a straight razor for shaving for years now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a barber and wanted to try the blades out before I committed to a whole case.  </li>
            <li>Because of the ease an quality of these blades I&#x27;ve relegated my &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; straight razors to the display cabinet.</li>
            <li>and I love a sharp blade.  </li>
            <li>Clean shave and solid...</li>
            <li>These are great for thick hair!!</li>
            <li>But haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference with my other blades</li>
            <li>Brand new</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a smooth and simple glide, it virtually eliminates all razor burn!</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t buy if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Super sharp blades.  </li>
            <li>and it came with a box of the Feather Professional blades.</li>
            <li>It took about 4 hours for it to completely clot and stop bleeding.</li>
            <li>Although the Professional blades seem to shave closer.</li>
            <li>Yes they are a bit more expensive, but they are totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Removes many days of thick beard growth with no problem.  </li>
            <li>These are easy to use and install, Very sharp and last about 5-7 shaves.</li>
            <li>As a Master barber I use these daily, and I assure there is no better product, and I count on them to make me a better Master barber as well.</li>
            <li>I thought my cheap blades were sharp - those are butter knives compared this this!!!  </li>
            <li>The length of the blade is great vs using a D.E. broken in half</li>
            <li>I purchased these for the first time a few months ago and WOW!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these, as long as you do nothing but load &#x27;em and shave.</li>
            <li>you have to be mindful it cuts if not careful.</li>
            <li>These seem to last longer than the Feather Artist Club Professional Blades.  </li>
            <li>You simply MUST pay attention when shaving with any straight razor, and these Feather blades certainly do not suffer fools.  </li>
            <li>The Supers last me about 7 shaves each, and my beard is pretty stiff.  </li>
            <li>The holes don&#x27;t still completely line up, but when you slide the Mr. C blade tray back into the razor, it&#x27;s snug enough to not come loose.</li>

            <li> Extremely sharp, please use caution when pressing up against skin.</li>
            <li> Sharper than sharp.</li>
            <li> Ok...these are sharp.</li>
            <li> How Sharp?</li>
            <li> These are sharp, sharp, sharp.</li>
            <li> So sharp it felt as if there was no razor in the shavette.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate because of reviews of people scared of how sharp they are.</li>
            <li> I use each blade about 4 times before tossing - or 2 sessions (I shave twice per session, one with the grain, one against the grain) and it stays sharp.  </li>
            <li> One pack will last me a year at least.</li>
            <li> So I grabbed what I thought was a thick enough magazine, pushed down on the blade and....</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard, and these give noticeably improved performance compared to the black label Professional blades.</li>
            <li> VERY sharp.</li>
            <li> I would buy again if find them less elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Work with the Jatai Feather Artist Club SS Folding Black Razor - 202  </li>
            <li> They cut through a 1/2&amp;#34; thick magazine and then went in another 1/16&amp;#34; of an inch into my thumb on the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used 6 times a few times but by the 6th time, I can feel the blade dull a bit</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little expensive, but for thick beards they&#x27;re the only type of blade I use.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick course beard and dull Mach 3 blades in a single use.</li>
            <li> These blades are SCARY sharp.</li>
            <li> When I used these, its definitely not good to apply a lot of pressure</li>
            <li> you cannot go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> I realized something was wrong when I started bleeding everywhere.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with a Feather blade.</li>
            <li> I was worried about someone cutting themselves if I just threw them in our trash can (have dogs that tip over the can once in a while and didn&#x27;t want them to get cut).  </li>
            <li> and it gave me terrible razor burn.  </li>

            <li> Amazing blades from a stellar maker. Feather does not miss around. These are sharp and can be used several times. Really nothing comes close to these. If you use a straight razor (which I do also from Feather) you cannot go wrong with these. Love the container that keeps them stowed and the dispensing mechanism. Very safe and unique. Japanese craftsmanship at its best!</li>
            <li> Dope! But haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference with my other blades</li>
            <li> Great blades, Very sharp. If you have never use a straight razor you may wanna practice on your arms before you shave your face:)</li>
            <li> i wish these came in titanium and had a larger pack but they get the job done and can probably be reused after taken to a very fine stone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to keep this short....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: DAMN! These things are SHARP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: DAMN! These things are SHARP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love these blades.  They are as sharp-as-Hell, but in my view that&#x27;s a bonus.  You simply MUST pay attention when shaving with any straight razor, and these Feather blades certainly do not suffer fools.  The Supers last me about 7 shaves each, and my beard is pretty stiff.  That&#x27;s about 2 more shaves than I get from the multi-bladed safety razors, and the shave is just as close and far more comfortable to me.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.  I&#x27;ll be using them for a long while.</li>
            <li> Its awesome sharp so be careful</li>
            <li> OMG!  These are sharp.  I wish I could strop my razor to this level.  Feather makes the best blades.</li>
            <li> Received an Artist Club Razor as a gift and I did my homework on the type of feather blade I wanted. Yes, the sharpest will do just fine. These blades are the only ones that I shave with for 3 days of the week. All the others including the feather DE blades get tossed after one shave.</li>
            <li> Fits the feather blade handle as expected. Extremely sharp, please use caution when pressing up against skin. Has a neat safety design when dispensing removable blades.</li>
            <li> Great blades. Very close shave</li>
            <li> I use these blades exclusively for my old school hot towel/shaves on my clients, close as you can get to the original straight razor!</li>
            <li> Great razor,  last many shaves. Never cut or nic&#x27;d with these. Nice disposal system,  very much worth the money. A+</li>
            <li> perfect companion for my shavette</li>
            <li> These are easy to use and install, Very sharp and last about 5-7 shaves. I have a very thick course beard and dull Mach 3 blades in a single use. My electric gets stuck in my beard if i let it grow for 3 days. These swipe right through it with ease. Very close and clean.</li>
            <li> These blades are incredible.  The difference between blade systems are like night and day.  Yes they are a bit more expensive, but they are totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Clean shave and solid...Even though I thought I would not have to use two blades on one shave. I would buy again if find them less elsewhere. Wish me luck</li>
            <li> Sharper than sharp. I love it when I just have to barley touch my skin to shave. Way better than shaving with any 4 blade razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of blades, but these are the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.  They&#x27;re a little expensive, but for thick beards they&#x27;re the only type of blade I use.</li>
            <li> Ok...these are sharp. VERY sharp. How Sharp? They cut through a 1/2&amp;#34; thick magazine and then went in another 1/16&amp;#34; of an inch into my thumb on the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Backstory: I got a Mr.C Razor from ebay. Brand new and it came with a box of the Feather Professional blades. I took one out, cleaned it and had an impressive shave. About a week ago, these Professional Super blades came in. I popped one into the Mr.C, but for some reason the holes don&#x27;t 100% line up and the holder divet appeared to have some leftover metal in it. I tried forcing the blade in, but the only way to do so is with the blade edge facing out. So I grabbed what I thought was a thick enough magazine, pushed down on the blade and....the damn thing went through the magazine and into my thumb. I realized something was wrong when I started bleeding everywhere. I bled for about 1:36 seconds and then wrapped my finger up. It took about 4 hours for it to completely clot and stop bleeding. In hindsight, I should have used something metal, but the magazine was the closest thing to me since I didn&#x27;t want to walk through the house and to the garbage butt naked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most impressive thing was the cut was so damn surgical, that I didn&#x27;t even feel any pain. The cut is still there after a week, but it&#x27;s starting to heal to a point where I could use it to shave about two days ago and it is smooth, folks. The holes don&#x27;t still completely line up, but when you slide the Mr. C blade tray back into the razor, it&#x27;s snug enough to not come loose. The length of the blade is great vs using a D.E. broken in half and I found the Super Pro to be much sharper than the Pro. It really is an experience shaving with Feather blades. I highly recommend these, as long as you do nothing but load &#x27;em and shave. Your thumbs will thank you for it.</li>
            <li> Be careful.  These are sharp, sharp, sharp.</li>
            <li> Very nice blades! I tend to have sensitive skin when shaving and poor quality blades really show a day or afterward. The dispenser is very nice and well thought out, the blades are great!</li>
            <li> These blades just work!  A whole lot faster then stropping and sharpening all the time.  I love my feather razor and these blades are what I use every day.  One pack will last me a year at least.</li>
            <li> The verdict is in. I tried every shavette type blade on the market from the cheap ones to Gillette platinums. Now these I finally got to after I finally got a feather. First time with these and I got the smoothest shave with zero irritation. So sharp it felt as if there was no razor in the shavette. Don&#x27;t hesitate because of reviews of people scared of how sharp they are. Very cool dispenser with disposable container on bottom. Bit pricey yes but after using them ,worth it.</li>
            <li> These are an amazing razor blade. As a Master barber I use these daily, and I assure there is no better product, and I count on them to make me a better Master barber as well. The shaves I provide are so much easier on me. It&#x27;s such a smooth and simple glide, it virtually eliminates all razor burn! A MUST HAVE ........</li>
            <li> Great, sharp.  Removes many days of thick beard growth with no problem.  If you have a thick beard I recommend shaving after a hot shower, using pre-shave oil, a good quality shaving cream on top of the oil applied with a badger hair brush, then using these blades.</li>
            <li> best blades for feather artist club razors......very very sharp blades but closest shave ever produced from a replaceable razor blade system for myself</li>
            <li> they work in my feather razor and cut the hairs on my chinny chin chin. do a good job of it also</li>
            <li> Great product. The best razor I have owned.</li>
            <li> These are great for thick hair!! Wouldn&#x27;t buy if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Everything about these blades is absolutely awesome thank you very much I just wish that I could add them to my Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a straight razor for shaving for years now.  I started with a very cheap razor (the ones that cost like $5 for 100 blades) and while that was a big improvement over a normal razor, I didn&#x27;t realize the shave could get even better.  I purchased these for the first time a few months ago and WOW!  I thought my cheap blades were sharp - those are butter knives compared this this!!!  The shave is fantastic and irritation free.  I use each blade about 4 times before tossing - or 2 sessions (I shave twice per session, one with the grain, one against the grain) and it stays sharp.  I have used 6 times a few times but by the 6th time, I can feel the blade dull a bit and I love a sharp blade.  They are considerably more than I was paying but it is well worth it.  It took me a while to be careful with it b/c the cheaper blades were a bit more forgiving and I used to apply a lot of pressure while shaving.  When I used these, its definitely not good to apply a lot of pressure - you just need a &amp;#34;feather&amp;#34; touch and it works beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to get a sense how much better, I did try my cheap straight razor blades one time for kicks and WOW!  I realized the cheap blades were NOT shaving anywhere as close and it gave me terrible razor burn.  Never again, I&#x27;m a convert to these blades and while my initial switch to a straight razor was to save money (tired of paying Gillette&#x27;s extortion for new refills on their n-bladed safety razors) and the cheap blades were so unbelievably cheap, I&#x27;m still willing to pay more for these great razors (Still probably come out way ahead dollar wise using these).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the built-in used razor disposal system is a great touch.  It was always a pain to toss my cheap blades b/c I was worried about someone cutting themselves if I just threw them in our trash can (have dogs that tip over the can once in a while and didn&#x27;t want them to get cut).  You just slip in a blade after it&#x27;s used underneath and its safelyput away until you&#x27;ve used all the blades.  This is a big plus for safety.  I also love the dispenser which makes reloading very simple.  My old cheap blade was all manual and was a pain.</li>
            <li> Good  fast services excellent product</li>
            <li> These high quality, super sharp blades are just what I needed to make using my Deluxe SS shavette a truly pleasurable experience. I have a tough beard, and these give noticeably improved performance compared to the black label Professional blades.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing shave it goes through the hair like butter....you have to be mindful it cuts if not careful. Awesome shave....</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with a Feather blade. The Super are their most aggressive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a barber and wanted to try the blades out before I committed to a whole case.  Totally awesome.  Last a long time, rounded edges so to not dig with the corners, smooth, I recommend them if you have a fierce beard, the handle that these go to is very durable, I have had mine for years, totally a great investment especially if you are considering going to a straight razor eventually.</li>
            <li> These blades are SCARY sharp. The injector pack is very easy and safe to use and have a handy used blade compartment in the bottom to safely dispose of your blades. Because of the ease an quality of these blades I&#x27;ve relegated my &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; straight razors to the display cabinet.</li>
            <li> Super sharp blades.  Work with the Jatai Feather Artist Club SS Folding Black Razor - 202  These seem to last longer than the Feather Artist Club Professional Blades.  Although the Professional blades seem to shave closer.</li>
