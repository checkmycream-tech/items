            <li>I was so glad that Amazon.com offered it.  </li>
            <li>I am over-the-moon with this product and am so glad I did the subscribe and save option for this product as it is now a staple in my hair styling regimen.</li>

            <li>Love this spray, been using for years.</li>
            <li>I love the product and worry that Nexxus will do away with it.</li>
            <li>so I use this more as a detangling spray in the morning.</li>
            <li>Love how this makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Nice clean smell and</li>
            <li>but this product definately helps defy most of my frizz, keep it smelling great, and feeling healthful and soft!</li>
            <li>It was the best brand name I could find and I have dry, somewhat frizzy hair.     </li>
            <li>I love the smell, it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>

            <li>It takes out the tangles, smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable..</li>
            <li>Works great on my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available to order online.</li>
            <li>Humectress Luxe- that used to wok very well, but it seems that they&#x27;ve changed these formulas and now they aren&#x27;t so good.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on reviews that, in addition to being good for dry hair, it was a good de-tangler.  </li>
            <li>I noticed after the first use that my hair was softer, had more body and looked 100% better, also its fragrance is fabulous!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it gets tangled a lot.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair but a lot of it.</li>
            <li>Great for maintaining low maintennance hair!</li>
            <li>The search for great hair products continues, but this is definitely not it.</li>
            <li>and it wouldn&#x27;t feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>For years, fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great daily moisturizer</li>
            <li>As soon as it settles, I am able to brush my wet, knotty hair, it smells very nice and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Pros: smells great and fresh; provided some moisture; provided some extra conditioner for damaged hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
            <li>It is now one of my special favorites because of how soft it makes my hair and how nice it smells.  </li>
            <li>I noticed immediately that after I used this spray on my damp hair that I was able to get my brush through it much easier.</li>
            <li>The salesman quickly dispatch.</li>
            <li>I became a big fan of Nexxus products a couple years ago when I decided to start using a better quality shampoo and conditional (better as opposed to Pantene or TRESemme).</li>
            <li>I use it while my hair is still damp and it leaves it soft and very easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Humectress works great for getting the tangles out and doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down.</li>
            <li>Easy to use too much of.</li>
            <li>This might be good for dry hair, but not oily haired girls.</li>
            <li>Also the smell is clean and fresh.price is very reasonable for quality of product</li>
            <li>Makes my damaged blonde curls really come back to life and the smell is great!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky soft and shiny and looks so healthy now.</li>
            <li>Love this - makes my hair silky soft.  </li>
            <li>If you have dry hair, I recommend an argan oil hair treatment or spray - it&#x27;s more natural and effective.</li>
            <li>It feels nice and clean too unlike other sprays that feels sticky.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, doesn&#x27;t way the hair down and works as a detangler as well.  </li>
            <li>This is certainly one of the products they should NOT discontinue!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light-weight, leaves my hair feeling soft and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  </li>
            <li>Skipped very fast.</li>
            <li>i really notice a difference!</li>
            <li>But overall I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have hair to my butt and try to not do more than 4 sprays total.</li>
            <li>MY hair is past my waist and this is just perfect for the last 10 inches, which tend to get alittle flyway in winter.</li>
            <li>Smooth hair, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>it is MOISTURE exactly what your hair needs.  </li>
            <li>pretty well.</li>
            <li>I purchased this at Walmart a few months ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Nexxus Leave-In Spray for a long time and was pleased to find it at a discounted price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My hair only feels soft and light with a light scent.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair super soft and silky without</li>
            <li>I cannot give an accurate review until I have properly used the product.</li>
            <li>It makes brushing my hair when damp much easier.</li>
            <li>Very please with delivery.  </li>
            <li>My hair has become much softer and shinier since using this spray.</li>
            <li>used the whole bottle before writing this review, and I have to say it didn&#x27;t do too much for me.</li>
            <li>I notice a big difference in the way my hair feels, the light weight formula makes a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>My hair got even more dried out and kind of crunchy making weird impressions and bends and seems to have a bit more breakage.</li>
            <li>I have thick, coarse hair that is prone to frizzing--and as I color it, too, trying to keep it healthy is a top priority.</li>
            <li>left residue; caused my hair to feel like it was full of product at the end of the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It also makes your hair smell heavenly, extra shiny and super soft, I’ve used this for about seven years now and would never be caught without it…</li>
            <li>My fine blonde permed hair finally moisturized and not frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have tried other leave in conditioners but none are as light as this.</li>
            <li>So when I was in need of a new leave-in conditioner, I searched out Nexxus brand.</li>
            <li>I say this because my i dont style my hair because its naturally bunny soft and straight.</li>
            <li>It did not &amp;#34;moisturize&amp;#34; as I thought it would and instead, left me with hair that felt either the same or even a bit more dry.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I miss the old leave in spray conditioners that Nexxus used to make.</li>
            <li>I started with the moisturizing shampoo and conditioner that Nexxus offers</li>
            <li>I really wanted to improve the texture of my hair further and so looked into some of Nexxus&#x27; leave in treatments.</li>
            <li>I was trying to pin point why my hair has been so wonderfully soft and frizz</li>
            <li>I prefer this spray leave-in type over the pump/wipe in type, it&#x27;s far easier to apply.</li>
            <li>At the time I figured that it was probably one of those things that take a while to make our hair look good, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li>It did more damage than repair because my hair was essentially in the same condition and at the end of the day, it would feel weighted down by the spray</li>
            <li>Apparently, based on reviews I&#x27;ve seen, there were old formulas for some of Nexxus&#x27; products -including</li>
            <li>sprays to calm it down</li>
            <li>Cannot live without this spray on, no rinse conditioner, especially in winter!</li>
            <li>It is light enough that it doesn&#x27;t leave my fine, thin hair weighed down.</li>
            <li>was sell two types of the product; the current one -for those who it works for-, and the old one -for those who this one works for-, idk.</li>
            <li>Just enough to help with detangling after washing and to help make my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>But this spray works really well calming their hair down.  </li>
            <li>I have very bushy and frizzy hair, especially when I wear it natural, which I used to hate doing, but now with this spray, it looks so nice and managed that now I do not mind not styling my hair for work...</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and moisturized, both after shampooing, and on dry hair in-between shampoos.  </li>
            <li>Works greata nd helps my dry hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>I was disappointed, it barely smelled like coconut, it smelled more like another chemical hair product, and the first time I used it on my hair, it actually caused lots of breakage.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have very thick 3A, B &amp; C curls that is unprocessed.  </li>

            <li> I purchased this at Walmart a few months ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Nexxus Leave-In Spray for a long time and was pleased to find it at a discounted price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My hair only feels soft and light with a light scent.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair super soft and silky without</li>
            <li> I cannot give an accurate review until I have properly used the product.</li>
            <li> It makes brushing my hair when damp much easier.</li>
            <li> Very please with delivery.  </li>
            <li> My hair has become much softer and shinier since using this spray.</li>
            <li> used the whole bottle before writing this review, and I have to say it didn&#x27;t do too much for me.</li>
            <li> I notice a big difference in the way my hair feels, the light weight formula makes a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> My hair got even more dried out and kind of crunchy making weird impressions and bends and seems to have a bit more breakage.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair that is prone to frizzing--and as I color it, too, trying to keep it healthy is a top priority.</li>
            <li> left residue; caused my hair to feel like it was full of product at the end of the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It also makes your hair smell heavenly, extra shiny and super soft, I’ve used this for about seven years now and would never be caught without it…</li>
            <li> My fine blonde permed hair finally moisturized and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have tried other leave in conditioners but none are as light as this.</li>
            <li> So when I was in need of a new leave-in conditioner, I searched out Nexxus brand.</li>
            <li> I say this because my i dont style my hair because its naturally bunny soft and straight.</li>
            <li> It did not &amp;#34;moisturize&amp;#34; as I thought it would and instead, left me with hair that felt either the same or even a bit more dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I miss the old leave in spray conditioners that Nexxus used to make.</li>
            <li> I started with the moisturizing shampoo and conditioner that Nexxus offers</li>
            <li> I really wanted to improve the texture of my hair further and so looked into some of Nexxus&#x27; leave in treatments.</li>
            <li> I was trying to pin point why my hair has been so wonderfully soft and frizz</li>
            <li> I prefer this spray leave-in type over the pump/wipe in type, it&#x27;s far easier to apply.</li>
            <li> At the time I figured that it was probably one of those things that take a while to make our hair look good, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> It did more damage than repair because my hair was essentially in the same condition and at the end of the day, it would feel weighted down by the spray</li>
            <li> Apparently, based on reviews I&#x27;ve seen, there were old formulas for some of Nexxus&#x27; products -including</li>
            <li> sprays to calm it down</li>
            <li> Cannot live without this spray on, no rinse conditioner, especially in winter!</li>
            <li> It is light enough that it doesn&#x27;t leave my fine, thin hair weighed down.</li>
            <li> was sell two types of the product; the current one -for those who it works for-, and the old one -for those who this one works for-, idk.</li>
            <li> Just enough to help with detangling after washing and to help make my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> But this spray works really well calming their hair down.  </li>
            <li> I have very bushy and frizzy hair, especially when I wear it natural, which I used to hate doing, but now with this spray, it looks so nice and managed that now I do not mind not styling my hair for work...</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and moisturized, both after shampooing, and on dry hair in-between shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Works greata nd helps my dry hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed, it barely smelled like coconut, it smelled more like another chemical hair product, and the first time I used it on my hair, it actually caused lots of breakage.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have very thick 3A, B &amp; C curls that is unprocessed.  </li>
            <li> If too much is used it will make hair stiff and need to be washed out.</li>
            <li> My only problem with the product is that it can leave my hair feeling greasy if I only use as a leave-in conditioner, and do not use flat iron.</li>
            <li> I did more research and found other postings on other hair and beauty sites where users described the same negative experience I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s becoming increasingly difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> before I flat iron my hair</li>
            <li> , I have very long thick hair and this product makes it soft and manageable, can&#x27;t live without it..will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> If you have dry, brittle hair or you just got color put on this product will give you back the moisture that the product stole from you when you got the color.  </li>
            <li> I use this product on my hair long immediately after washing it I can easily use a comb through my hair without any tangles; it’s like butter only as thin as water and never weighs your hair down.  </li>
            <li> One thing that kinda sucks is the bottle is pretty small, but it seems pretty concentrated, and a little seems to go a long way.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to buy it as long as I can find it.</li>
            <li> My hair was so dry and frizzy and even though the Nexxus moisturizing shampoo and conditioner helped a lot I still had issues with</li>
            <li> Their shampoo and conditioners have suited my hair well since I started using them and after using the &#x27;for dry hair&#x27; and &#x27;for color treated hair&#x27; types, I decided to try the Lightweight version.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair, but even people with naturally straight hair have problems with it, and the rave reviews that you see about this product might be ones from when the old formula existed, or maybe people with very thin hair, I feel it might work for people with that hair, idk, but all Nexxus had to do</li>
            <li> -less recently</li>
            <li> so it is very dry and lifeless.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I poured a little into a 3oz bottle to take with me on flights in addition to the shampoo and conditioner which I also portioned into smaller containers.</li>
            <li> it being overly dry due to my use of curling irons, wands, and straighteners.</li>
            <li> This is a knock-off product and not really a Nexus product.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I live in west Texas, where the water here is very hard on your hair and skin.</li>
            <li> the greasy feel that other products tend to do.</li>
            <li> I tried putting water on their hair and other hair</li>
            <li> Isnt greasy or stiff when dry.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, dry hair, and use this when I straighten my hair with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Then everyday in the morning before I comb my hair</li>
            <li> I spray some on my hand and rub my fingers through my hair and then apply a few drops of walnut oil as well.  </li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> Plus is helps tame fizziness after my hair has dried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only stuff my hair will take, which is frustrating but at least I found something I can use!</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in stores, so I keep ordering it online.      </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find this spray in the stores</li>
            <li> Subtle scent.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a little expensive.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that was a pain to brush out after my shower.</li>
            <li> Completely useless.</li>
            <li> I used them for years, and was sorry to see them discontinued.</li>
            <li> I bought the wrong item, but that&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> A faint hint of coconut</li>
            <li> This makes it VERY difficult to comb through afterwards.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Makes my damaged blonde curls really come back to life and the smell is great!!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews that, in addition to being good for dry hair, it was a good de-tangler.  I couldn&#x27;t get a comb through my hair when I tried it.</li>
            <li> Yes it is very good.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer. Subtle scent. Love it. My fine blonde permed hair finally moisturized and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> I lke Nexus products!</li>
            <li> Great for maintaining low maintennance hair! I say this because my i dont style my hair because its naturally bunny soft and straight. but this product definately helps defy most of my frizz, keep it smelling great, and feeling healthful and soft! I do agree it adds plenty of softness! i bought this as a leave in conditioner in hopes that i could better maintain my hair and it deffinately does!  ~if you have a teen girl, or daughter with tangly hair this will be her new best friend!  ~ (would not reccomend for course hair as you may need a more hydrating product!)  i really notice a difference! i washed my hair tonight distributed the spray evenly through brushing and its helped me achieve the softest hair at my school!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have very thick 3A, B &amp; C curls that is unprocessed.  before I flat iron my hair I put this on and some walnut oil.  Then everyday in the morning before I comb my hair I spray some on my hand and rub my fingers through my hair and then apply a few drops of walnut oil as well.  My hair looks and feels great!</li>
            <li> I can not speak highly enough of this product. I color my hair monthly so it is very dry and lifeless. I noticed after the first use that my hair was softer, had more body and looked 100% better, also its fragrance is fabulous! Great product.</li>
            <li> I discovered this conditioner by accident. I was traveling and had forgotten my conditioner.  I bought it at a drugstore.  It was the best brand name I could find and I have dry, somewhat frizzy hair.     It is now one of my special favorites because of how soft it makes my hair and how nice it smells.  The softness and smell stay in your hair all day.  It is hard to find in stores, so I keep ordering it online.      One thing that kinda sucks is the bottle is pretty small, but it seems pretty concentrated, and a little seems to go a long way.      The Nexxus \\&quot;Botanluxe\\&quot;  is a similiar product with a similiar smell and effect.</li>
            <li> Apparently, based on reviews I&#x27;ve seen, there were old formulas for some of Nexxus&#x27; products -including Humectress Luxe- that used to wok very well, but it seems that they&#x27;ve changed these formulas and now they aren&#x27;t so good. I bought this with the highest expectancy. I was disappointed, it barely smelled like coconut, it smelled more like another chemical hair product, and the first time I used it on my hair, it actually caused lots of breakage. At the time I figured that it was probably one of those things that take a while to make our hair look good, but I was wrong. It didn&#x27;t do anything, after a while the breakage did stop though, but it didn&#x27;t do anything that it said it would at all for me. I have relaxed hair, but even people with naturally straight hair have problems with it, and the rave reviews that you see about this product might be ones from when the old formula existed, or maybe people with very thin hair, I feel it might work for people with that hair, idk, but all Nexxus had to do was sell two types of the product; the current one -for those who it works for-, and the old one -for those who this one works for-, idk.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair soft and manageable. I love the smell, it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> prompt shipping, I have very long thick hair and this product makes it soft and manageable, can&#x27;t live without it..will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone with frizzy curly hair!  So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this leave-in conditioner for years.  It leaves my hair soft and moisturized, both after shampooing, and on dry hair in-between shampoos.  It&#x27;s becoming increasingly difficult to find.  I don&#x27;t know if Nexxus is eliminating some of their product line, or what&#x27;s going on with them.  This is certainly one of the products they should NOT discontinue!  I&#x27;ll continue to buy it as long as I can find it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have very thick, dry hair, and use this when I straighten my hair with a flat iron. It leaves my hair very smooth, and silky. My only problem with the product is that it can leave my hair feeling greasy if I only use as a leave-in conditioner, and do not use flat iron. But overall I love this product.</li>
            <li> Light spray! Skipped very fast. I cannot give an accurate review until I have properly used the product. I have been recommended by my beautician to get this spray for my damaged/breaking hair. Lets see how it goes!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s the only stuff my hair will take, which is frustrating but at least I found something I can use! I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without this spray on, no rinse conditioner, especially in winter! Takes care of any static electricity issues!</li>
            <li> This product seems to be a perfect example of how everyone&#x27;s hair has its own idiosyncratic issues. When this was suggested by Amazon as a good item for me, I took the bait after reading some but not all of the reviews. I have thick, coarse hair that is prone to frizzing--and as I color it, too, trying to keep it healthy is a top priority. I used this just one time and it did the opposite of what it was advertised to do. My hair got even more dried out and kind of crunchy making weird impressions and bends and seems to have a bit more breakage. My scalp also started to itch a bit after use. The search for great hair products continues, but this is definitely not it. Now that I&#x27;ve had this experience I did more research and found other postings on other hair and beauty sites where users described the same negative experience I&#x27;ve had. It seems that the gals with thinner hair seem happier with it than those of us with a lot of hair that&#x27;s prone to frizz.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!!!!  Leaves my hair super soft and silky without the greasy feel that other products tend to do.</li>
            <li> Reading a review after purchase I noticed that it looks like we are all talking about a different product here.  My bottle looks like the one in the picture except with out the &amp;#34;CAVIAR&amp;#34; and a different leave in spray! Cero Customer Service. I decided to kept the bottle and got my lesson of not buying perfumes and hair products on line.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Nexxus Leave-In Spray for a long time and was pleased to find it at a discounted price on Amazon. It&#x27;s a must have, especially after you wash your hair. I use it while my hair is still damp and it leaves it soft and very easy to manage. Great for all types of hair!!</li>
            <li> like this, doesn&#x27;t leave the hair too sticky</li>
            <li> Completely useless. I threw mine in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Easy to use too much of. If too much is used it will make hair stiff and need to be washed out. I have hair to my butt and try to not do more than 4 sprays total. It makes brushing my hair when damp much easier. It has the best results with air drying your hair, but using a blow dryer isn&#x27;t a problem with it. Ideally you should not let the hair dryer cook your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel this is now a regular must have in addition to the Nexxus shampoo and conditioner. Convenient trio to compliment my Google Nexus phone. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I poured a little into a 3oz bottle to take with me on flights in addition to the shampoo and conditioner which I also portioned into smaller containers.</li>
            <li> I miss the old leave in spray conditioners that Nexxus used to make. I used them for years, and was sorry to see them discontinued. I order a three pack of this newer product, and don&#x27;t like the smell. I will probably be looking for a different product soon. ;(</li>
            <li> Very please with delivery.  I bought the wrong item, but that&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s fault. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this leave in spray.  It takes out the tangles, smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable..</li>
            <li> This item was.fantastic! It lives up to its namesake. It left my hair so shiny &amp; manageable. I will continue to buy this product for years to comem</li>
            <li> Good Product, is an excellent beauty line for hair, this product is wonderful.  The salesman quickly dispatch. Is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing spray.  Smells good, doesn&#x27;t way the hair down and works as a detangler as well.  Nice clean smell and amazon has a good cost on it.</li>
            <li> Love this leave in conditioner doesn&#x27;t cause greasiness.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that was a pain to brush out after my shower. I started with the moisturizing shampoo and conditioner that Nexxus offers and I loved the feel of my hair after using it for a couple of weeks. I really wanted to improve the texture of my hair further and so looked into some of Nexxus&#x27; leave in treatments. I live in west Texas, where the water here is very hard on your hair and skin. My hair was so dry and frizzy and even though the Nexxus moisturizing shampoo and conditioner helped a lot I still had issues with it being overly dry due to my use of curling irons, wands, and straighteners. I came across this moisturizer leave-in spray and decided to give it a go. I noticed immediately that after I used this spray on my damp hair that I was able to get my brush through it much easier. My hair has become much softer and shinier since using this spray. I also couple this spray with Nexxus&#x27; split end binder and heat protector spray. The results I&#x27;ve had are amazing. I LOVE my hair! It&#x27;s silky soft and shiny and looks so healthy now.</li>
            <li> Like the product, perfect for me. I like sprays. But it&#x27;s a little expensive.</li>
            <li> Works great on my naturally curly hair. Isnt greasy or stiff when dry.</li>
            <li> MY hair is past my waist and this is just perfect for the last 10 inches, which tend to get alittle flyway in winter. I have tried other leave in conditioners but none are as light as this. This doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair.</li>
            <li> Works greata nd helps my dry hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at Walmart a few months ago and loved it.  It&#x27;s light-weight, leaves my hair feeling soft and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  When I went back to buy it again, I couldn&#x27;t find it in any store in my town.  I was so glad that Amazon.com offered it.  It is the best leave-in conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Smooth hair, soft and shiny. Husband loves it.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my hair long immediately after washing it I can easily use a comb through my hair without any tangles; it’s like butter only as thin as water and never weighs your hair down.  It also makes your hair smell heavenly, extra shiny and super soft, I’ve used this for about seven years now and would never be caught without it…I just love, love, love Nexxus Humextress Luxe!!!</li>
            <li> I buy this for my kids to use in the morning.  Their hair tends to stick out when they get up.  I tried putting water on their hair and other hair sprays to calm it down but it doesn&#x27;t work.  But this spray works really well calming their hair down.  It feels nice and clean too unlike other sprays that feels sticky.  It&#x27;s hard to find this spray in the stores so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available to order online.</li>
            <li> Pros: smells great and fresh; provided some moisture; provided some extra conditioner for damaged hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: left residue; caused my hair to feel like it was full of product at the end of the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the whole bottle before writing this review, and I have to say it didn&#x27;t do too much for me. It did more damage than repair because my hair was essentially in the same condition and at the end of the day, it would feel weighted down by the spray and it wouldn&#x27;t feel silky and smooth. It did not &amp;#34;moisturize&amp;#34; as I thought it would and instead, left me with hair that felt either the same or even a bit more dry. If you have dry hair, I recommend an argan oil hair treatment or spray - it&#x27;s more natural and effective.</li>
            <li> I was trying to pin point why my hair has been so wonderfully soft and frizz-less recently and then I realized it coincided with when I purchased this leave-in conditioner. I became a big fan of Nexxus products a couple years ago when I decided to start using a better quality shampoo and conditional (better as opposed to Pantene or TRESemme). Their shampoo and conditioners have suited my hair well since I started using them and after using the &#x27;for dry hair&#x27; and &#x27;for color treated hair&#x27; types, I decided to try the Lightweight version. I notice a big difference in the way my hair feels, the light weight formula makes a noticeable difference. So when I was in need of a new leave-in conditioner, I searched out Nexxus brand. I prefer this spray leave-in type over the pump/wipe in type, it&#x27;s far easier to apply. As soon as it settles, I am able to brush my wet, knotty hair, it smells very nice and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling. My hair only feels soft and light with a light scent. And it looks wonderful! I have very bushy and frizzy hair, especially when I wear it natural, which I used to hate doing, but now with this spray, it looks so nice and managed that now I do not mind not styling my hair for work...it brings control to my unruly tresses! I am over-the-moon with this product and am so glad I did the subscribe and save option for this product as it is now a staple in my hair styling regimen.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel healthy but leaves no greasy residue and does not contain alcohol. Also the smell is clean and fresh.price is very reasonable for quality of product</li>
            <li> Leaves a great scent. Its a lite mist and I use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> Love this spray, been using for years.</li>
            <li> this is a nice lightweight leave in.  Perfect for my fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;It does have silicones so I do not use it too often..but when I do I find it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it gets tangled a lot.  Humectress works great for getting the tangles out and doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have used this item for years and swear by it.  If you have dry, brittle hair or you just got color put on this product will give you back the moisture that the product stole from you when you got the color.  It is not oil it is MOISTURE exactly what your hair needs.  I love the product and worry that Nexxus will do away with it.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair and avoid conditioning it in the shower because of it. This makes it VERY difficult to comb through afterwards. I bought this stuff hoping that it would help with the tangles without adding excess oil to my hair, but it does. Just one spray makes it look like I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in days. This might be good for dry hair, but not oily haired girls.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair but a lot of it. I have a lot of problems with knots so I use this more as a detangling spray in the morning. Plus is helps tame fizziness after my hair has dried. If you&#x27;ve never tried it, it smells great. A faint hint of coconut</li>
            <li> Great for my fine hair.  Just enough to help with detangling after washing and to help make my hair soft and shiny.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all.</li>
            <li> works very well leaves hair lightly conditioned with a very nice fragrance</li>
            <li> This is a knock-off product and not really a Nexus product.&lt;br /&gt;Note the 2 X&#x27;s in the spelling. I gave it 3 stars because it&lt;br /&gt;works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Love this - makes my hair silky soft.  very good for using after swimming in the sea. Comb just glides through hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It is light enough that it doesn&#x27;t leave my fine, thin hair weighed down. But it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. For years, fantastic. That&#x27;s all I need to say.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, it leaves your hair smelling good.</li>
            <li> Love how this makes my hair feel. Great daily moisturizer</li>
