            <li> This product works very nicely on my natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> Ok so I got to say I&#x27;m actually Hispanic, long straight hair and I loooooove this stuff. It&#x27;s the only &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll use on my hair. I use to be in the military and had to have a neat bun. I have short hair in the back of my point tail that looks nappy, I hate gels because it leaves that white residu and I don&#x27;t like washing my hair everyday, that&#x27;s one is the reasons I keep it really healthy. I found this at Walmart one day and decided to try it, I also read a person left a review to use a brush, so I did. Man, my hair looks neat, it doesn&#x27;t come apart, when I don&#x27;t wash it, it does get a little hard, but no white stuff!!! I notice Walmart is always out of it, so I but mine here in packs... One will last me about a month. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;m a believer, I love this stuff, and highly recommend it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my pictures I have a before and after. I just put some creme on a small patch so you can see the difference. It&#x27;s really not the greatest picture but it puts away all the freeze hairs and adds a natural shine</li>
            <li> got it cause my sister recommended it Love it</li>
            <li> I have 100% virgin black hair and I love this product. I use it to make my fly-aways stay in place, as well as for my edges. I use it on my daughters as well. It is less greasy than a lot of products on the market and it does not flake.</li>
            <li> Was melted when I got it spilled or something in the bag was not so happy wish I can get a replacement</li>
            <li> This is a lovely product. I used several edge control product, but this is my choice.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky, or heavy and its perfect for the perfect pony tail.</li>
            <li> I love it! My hair looks great all day.</li>

            <li> Great Shipping ! I have really curly hair and wanted to try this product and it doesn&#x27;t hold my edges. I&#x27;ll stick with Olive Oil edge control.</li>
            <li> Great product! It not only keeps your edges sleek all day but it conditions as well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Its not too greasy and really works well on my edges</li>
            <li> This arrived in the mail the other day.  I love it.  I am in an area where it is quite difficult to find products my type of hair.  I love that I can order it on line and it comes right to the door.  This arrived in a big bubble package, in tact, and ready to use.  Also this product smells so very nice on my hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! Being an African America female, edges can sometimes be a struggle! It holds my edges ALL day! I love this one soo much better than olive oil. All you need is a little bit and it goes along way. Will be purchasing again when I run out.</li>
            <li> This amazing gel is absolutely wonderful. Just in care you&#x27;re going natural or styling relaxed hair, Perfect Edges helps to tame frizzy edges while maintaining the style all day.</li>
            <li> Hate it. Very strong odor greasy and not hold.</li>

            <li> Best ege control leaves your hair whitout  those white marks from those other brands nd the price is very fair I like to stack up a few</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick &amp; it hold my edges together real nice</li>
            <li> Works well on the edges... Make them look perm. Only issue is that you will have to reapply throughout the day.</li>
