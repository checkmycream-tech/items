            <li>My friend, who is a professional, purchased this item for me</li>
            <li>the light is too small</li>
            <li>I had a little hiccup in my order but the seller did a quick fix</li>

            <li>I purchased this and received in time, but when I received the product and tried this it would not dry my nails.  </li>
            <li>The only negative was the light is compact and you have to be careful not to smudge your polish on the big toe.</li>

            <li> Love the set! It gives you everything you need  from start to finish!</li>
            <li> Great little gel nail kit for home.  Be sure to go to the website to watch how to do it or your polish will peel off from being on your cuticles.  The pink polish is very hot pink.  I love the little UV light because it has auto on and off.  Works great!  Buying this one as a gift now.</li>
            <li> This kit is awesome! Everything arrived in great condition and in a timely manner. The kit is easy to use with clear instructions. You can save lots of money by painting your own nails with this set if you are spending $25-35 on a shelac manicure every two weeks. I had to take my time in the beginning to make sure the polish cured correctly but you can have both hands finished in about 30 minutes with 4 coats on each finger. I highly recommend this kit to anyone who loves shelac manicures!</li>
            <li> when I received my Gel Kit I was never expecting it this early WOW!!!! Delivery was fast I give it ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.  I was really exited to use my Gel Kit to see how it work.. I was  definitely satisfy with the product I do recommended it awesome!!! I even look it up on You Tube to see how you can use your regular nail polish with the Gel Kit I love the results!!! The only thing is that if you don&#x27;t wait into your regular nail polish is completely dry your nail will have like dent on you nail after you apply the Gel top coat....  I&#x27;m really happy that I can still use my regular nail polish :))) I  definitely will buy this product again!!!  This foto I post I use my regular nail polish and water paint to do the design and newspaper and I love the results very satisfy :)))</li>
            <li> Love wish it had better directions on how to use it all but I do love it works great !!!</li>
            <li> This has been one of my best investmenst this year and it is becoming a very fun hobby. It has saved me many trips to the beauty salon. The two colors that come with this kit are beautiful. With instructions on YouTube everyone can use this product like a pro.</li>
            <li> the light is too small</li>
            <li> Very good kit for the beginning definitely!&lt;br /&gt;It is very simple in use and good quality! I&#x27;m very happy to have it :)&lt;br /&gt;And this polish I can wear for 1 weeks as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna.</li>
            <li> This kit has everything you need to start doing gel nails. It didn&#x27;t  come with instructions though which would of been nice. You can get all the instructions on the Gelish site. It arrived quick. I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, only down side is the lamp is small so as other reviews state , one hand at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this product! I love doing my own nails since I am a perfectionist and ALWAYS find something wrong when I go to the nail shop to get them done. This product will pay for itself after just a couple of times that you use it. So worth it!</li>
            <li> I am loving it! It saves money... and time, I don&#x27;t have to go wait in line at the salon to get my nails done... this kit has everything you need to get started... I had a little hiccup in my order but the seller did a quick fix and I am satisfied.... ladies buy this and you will love it!</li>
            <li> My friend, who is a professional, purchased this item for me so I could do my own nails at home. This kit is perfect for do-it-yourselfers at home. I have three tips: 1. There are great instructional videos and tips on YouTube that you should watch until you are a pro at home. 2. Do your two thumbs first and place them in the light separate from the rest of your hand. Then do the remaining 4 fingers, one hand at a time.3. Use foil and cotton to soak off one hand at a time, it&#x27;s easier. It takes a little bit longer but is less frustrating. As one reviewer mentioned, the light is a little small for feet unless you have narrow feet, so be careful. Remember, after about four uses, you are money ahead! That&#x27;s exciting.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother, and she absolutely loved it! This product is great and the gel last for so long I would definitely buy this again</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! Fast shipping love it !! It so worth it works great now I am never going to a nail salon! I can do it my self now:)&lt;br /&gt;If you are not sure how to use it look on youtube it&#x27;s super easy to use after you seen a video.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!! I opened it right away and used it, worked like a charm! Great quality items! The only negative was the light is compact and you have to be careful not to smudge your polish on the big toe. Works the best when you polish one hand at a time. Highly recommend this product for at home gel polish DIY girls like myself.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to keep my nails between manicures and I was skeptical about doing it myself but this kit is GREAT! This rating is based on the product. Its a great product at a great price and it arrived on time as expected. Thank you</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my fiance because it was the one she picked out. Overall it was ok, but from what I understand the quality is less than optimal. I made the purchase thinking she wouldnt have to go to the nail salon everytime she wants her nails done, but now it kind of seems like she&#x27;ll still go to get her nails done and I&#x27;ll be out the $100+. Hopefully it gets better with practice.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping! So happy I spent the money for this set. Works great. I have recommended this product and seller to all my friends. Only downfall was I didn&#x27;t receive the UV gloves that were in the description but was not a deal breaker for me. This item has already paid for itself in the 3 manicures I have given myself. Now time to stock up on colors!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing, I&#x27;ve have never done dyi nails and this kit was so easy and it really does give the results like in the salon, I love it!</li>
            <li> This kit works perfect. Mine came with directions. Nails are supposed to be tacky until you finish the last coat. I haven&#x27;t had any problems. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It took some getting use to but I love it!  I like that the drying time is quick and how helpful it is to keep my nails from breaking!</li>
            <li> The purchase was somewhat disappointing because I did not receive any directions with the kit nor did I receive a glove as per the advertisement.  I had to go online to see how to use my kit.  However, the results after my applications were wonderful.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and received in time, but when I received the product and tried this it would not dry my nails.  You can not return the product once you have received.  DO NOT PURCHASE!!!</li>
            <li> It takes too long to dry my nails. I thought it was going to be quicker but not. Am triying to sell it now</li>
            <li> Love my kit works wonders on my nails and worth every penny</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking i can save some money, this polish is nice but the light does not work, it does not dry your nails, I am very dissapointed</li>
