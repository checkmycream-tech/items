            <li>Do reccomended it strongly.</li>
            <li>I think this product is not the original it seems to lose it&#x27;s scent very quickly</li>
            <li>Never had a \\&quot;Free Shipping\\</li>
            <li>I get 2 or 3 comments weekly about how much women are loving the scent.  </li>
            <li>A few years ago I tried to find the best cologne for me.  </li>
            <li>I bought a huge bottle, just so I could enjoy this year-round.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in the original box, plastic sealed.</li>
            <li>all the original wrapping.i sprayed it and let it air out.</li>
            <li>The scent it light, not overbearing and the ladies love it, which is obviously the most important factor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I personally love the way Only The Brave smells, and get compliments frequently.</li>
            <li>but sweet.</li>
            <li>I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend who only sticks to the same cologne, but I know he will love to wear this one, is that good :)</li>
            <li>thank you very much!</li>
            <li>Purchased this for Christmas and got it much cheaper than the retail stores and shipping was speedy!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so amazing, lasting and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of Jean Paul, YSL, Armani Code, A-Men, Pacco Rabane, and this Diesel scent is at or near the top of the list.</li>
            <li>Both my husband and 23 year old son love this cologne.</li>
            <li>So this way I kind of get the male scent I like as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean, sexy smell that I can&#x27;t get enough of.</li>
            <li>So I went to my local Macy&#x27;s and sprayed 5 of the most popular colognes on different sample cards.  </li>
            <li>Great scent but hard to find.</li>
            <li>Thanks for sending it on time for Christmas!</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my cousin and he really loves it!</li>
            <li>I have about 25 different colognes and this is top 3</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy again :)</li>
            <li>my husband wore this cologne when we first met.</li>
            <li>He is very pleased with it and will spray it just to mess with me.</li>
            <li>smell barely last 30 minutes after being gone it does smell good but only for a couple of minutes!&lt;br /&gt;Try to return it but find out they DO NOT take returns so just avoid</li>
            <li>smell barely last 30 minutes after being gone it does smell good but only for a couple of minutes!&lt;br /&gt;Try to return it but find out they DO NOT take returns so just avoid this.</li>
            <li>Scent did not seem as strong as prior bottles bought from store.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend spending the extra $15 to get the bigger bottle of 4.2oz, totally worth it and an amazing fragance!</li>
            <li>Plus, you can&#x27;t get this much amount with this price elsewhere~</li>
            <li>&quot; delivered so fast.</li>
            <li>Very versatile.</li>
            <li>haha.  </li>
            <li>Thanks discountPerfumes&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Has a young, light smell to it, not very heavy.</li>
            <li>other one  for sure</li>
            <li>Short and simple, this scent has gotten many complements from the ladies and it last, even through a smoke filled bar</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance for years since high school.</li>
            <li>I bought him a new bottle because he never buys himself anything.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the real deal</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s going to be surprised on Christmas morning.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased diesel before at major department stores and the real diesel has a longer lasting scent.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you&#x27;re a well dressed man younger than</li>
            <li>only issue that I would like to echo is that it does wear off a little too quickly.  </li>

            <li> Highly recommended if you&#x27;re a well dressed man younger than</li>
            <li> only issue that I would like to echo is that it does wear off a little too quickly.  </li>
            <li> really big, and will definetly last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like tho.</li>
            <li> My boss awkwardly leans in alot of time to get extra wiffs, definitely a favorite with the ladies.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant because of the few negative reviews but its authenticity was more than proven due to</li>
            <li> the smell and color is the same and it lasts very long hours on him and he came to know it is the real deal not diluted or fake.</li>
            <li> Comes exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> it is not a real diesel product s.</li>
            <li> I got it for my dad on his bday a few years ago in a smaller size.</li>
            <li> If I could talk my husband into wearing this everyday, I would.</li>
            <li> Sorry DOES NOT smell the same as one I bought at the mall.</li>
            <li> , it has a bit of a musky scent to it which I like and usually my husband does not.</li>
            <li> but I saved instead of paying $57 or so at retailers for the small one</li>
            <li> Bought this cologne for my husband, whose been wearing this for at least 5 years he does not wear anything else.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I bought this cologne and have been wearing it ever since.</li>
            <li> Do not buy from here, unless you&#x27;re looking to buy a expensive glass bottle of rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> I hardly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt; Compralo!!!</li>
            <li> I probably just got a bad bottle.</li>
            <li> this stuff STINKS!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Good product. Would buy again. Comes exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Scent is similar to department store, but disappears after 15 mins. It&#x27;s a shame because I love this scent. I probably just got a bad bottle. I&#x27;ll probably buy cologne on eBay from now on. Much more authentic.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great.... Or lets say my husband smells great ;)  Thanks for sending it on time for Christmas!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my cousin and he really loves it! He wears it every morning! Even before bedtime! He got compliment from peers and teachers in school! And I&#x27;m planning to buy it again as a birthday gift for my friend! Plus, you can&#x27;t get this much amount with this price elsewhere~</li>

            <li> Great scent, everyone loves the smell.</li>
            <li> Great cologne, it smells great. I use 1 spray on a short 5-7 hour time frame but for all day i use 2 sprays. Believe me this stuff is great, at getting a woman or smelling good for an interview and seem like you know your stuff. Awesome cologne smells great and stays on for a LONG time DEFINITELY recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a really great scent. I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> Short and simple, this scent has gotten many complements from the ladies and it last, even through a smoke filled bar I was about to still smell this cologne.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend wears this and I love it.  Smells amazing</li>
            <li> I ordered on a Tuesday and I got it on Friday! Never had a \\&quot;Free Shipping\\&quot; delivered so fast. It arrived in the original box, plastic sealed. I definitely recommend spending the extra $15 to get the bigger bottle of 4.2oz, totally worth it and an amazing fragance! I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend who only sticks to the same cologne, but I know he will love to wear this one, is that good :)</li>
            <li> Scent did not seem as strong as prior bottles bought from store.</li>
            <li> The product was ok and arrives on time. Thank you.</li>
            <li> If I could talk my husband into wearing this everyday, I would. It&#x27;s a clean, sexy smell that I can&#x27;t get enough of.</li>
            <li> Great Product and Great Service</li>
            <li> I smell like a champ!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son after I smelled it on another.  He&#x27;s going to be surprised on Christmas morning.  I bought him the biggest one that I could find.  It got here quickly, and I&#x27;ll probably buy more from this seller because of the wonderful deal I got.</li>
            <li> I am the type guy who marches to the beat of his own drum.  This is a great signature scent for me.  I get 2 or 3 comments weekly about how much women are loving the scent.  And I love the attention it helps bring my way.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Jean Paul, YSL, Armani Code, A-Men, Pacco Rabane, and this Diesel scent is at or near the top of the list. I&#x27;ll come home and spray this scent on because it smells so good. My boss awkwardly leans in alot of time to get extra wiffs, definitely a favorite with the ladies. This is a good buy. I&#x27;ll spray this and still can smell it 8 hours later. This is a good product.</li>
            <li> real fast delivery product is perfect</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. In the stores it is a smaller bottle and almost the same price. Will buy another.</li>
            <li> Very good! Remains in the body throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This is what gets the ladies...</li>
            <li> Awesome product, super quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Great product! One of the smoothest colognes I have . Very versatile. Doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like tho. Do reccomended it strongly. I have about 25 different colognes and this is top 3</li>
            <li> it is not a real diesel product s. i ha ve been using it bu t it is not what i am used too.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Only buy if you already know this fragrance otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;The smell barely last 30 minutes after being gone it does smell good but only for a couple of minutes!&lt;br /&gt;Try to return it but find out they DO NOT take returns so just avoid this.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I TOTALLY AGREE!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this I bought it for my fianc√© it&#x27;s his favorite the size of the bottle for the price is amazing. Will definitely buy again :)</li>
            <li> I love this cologne. Not overpowering.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I tried to find the best cologne for me.  Like a signature smell. haha.  So I went to my local Macy&#x27;s and sprayed 5 of the most popular colognes on different sample cards.  I brought them to work and asked all the ladies which one they thought was the best, and 6 for 6 they picked this one.  Needless to say, I bought this cologne and have been wearing it ever since.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of Diesel on my hubby.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and very responsible seller</li>
            <li> I think this product is not the original it seems to lose it&#x27;s scent very quickly I have purchased diesel before at major department stores and the real diesel has a longer lasting scent.</li>
            <li> Thanks discountPerfumes&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this cologne with everyone&lt;br /&gt;Smell so great:-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li> This is one of my top fragrances. Women are always commenting on how good I smell. Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> Este perfume √© excelente!</li>
            <li> Awesome smell, received on time as expected</li>
            <li> excellent fragrance is durable and very special.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend</li>
            <li> my husband wore this cologne when we first met. It&#x27;s so yummy. I bought him a new bottle because he never buys himself anything. I wanted him to have the biggest one they make. Glad I did. He is very pleased with it and will spray it just to mess with me. He knows how much I love it and it gets him some extra attention. Hehe! Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> great, very very good</li>
            <li> I have to say it....this stuff STINKS!  In a really, really GREAT way.  Amazon has the best price I could find online and elsewhere.  I bought a huge bottle, just so I could enjoy this year-round.  The scent it light, not overbearing and the ladies love it, which is obviously the most important factor.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue that I would like to echo is that it does wear off a little too quickly.  I would say you&#x27;ll get a good 4 or so hours out of an application.  Regardless, I love it and will wear it for years to come.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and 23 year old son love this cologne. Purchased this for Christmas and got it much cheaper than the retail stores and shipping was speedy!! I would definitely recommend this fragrance!!</li>
            <li> Sorry DOES NOT smell the same as one I bought at the mall. I have them both and compared the two. The one I bought here smells like rubbing alcohol with a hint of scent. Very disappointed. Won&#x27;t be buying from them again. Do not buy from here, unless you&#x27;re looking to buy a expensive glass bottle of rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> my son and husband both love this scent.. I like it, it has a bit of a musky scent to it which I like and usually my husband does not. So this way I kind of get the male scent I like as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent cologne! I got it for my dad on his bday a few years ago in a smaller size. When he finally ran out he asked if I could get it for him again. And amazon has the best deal!</li>
            <li> Fist time I bought this perfume I fell in love with it&#x27;s aroma.  It&#x27;s so amazing, lasting and girls love it to die. I hardly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt; Compralo!!!</li>
            <li> Only buy if you already know this fragrance otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;The smell barely last 30 minutes after being gone it does smell good but only for a couple of minutes!&lt;br /&gt;Try to return it but find out they DO NOT take returns so just avoid this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance for years since high school. I was a little hesitant because of the few negative reviews but its authenticity was more than proven due to all the original wrapping.i sprayed it and let it air out. Wears and smells just like I&#x27;ve always known it but I saved instead of paying $57 or so at retailers for the small one</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this thing! really big, and will definetly last a very long time. Has a young, light smell to it, not very heavy. Just enough so when someone gets close or hugs you they can smell it.</li>
            <li> I loved and recommend</li>
            <li> I personally love the way Only The Brave smells, and get compliments frequently. Highly recommended if you&#x27;re a well dressed man younger than 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit woodsy... but sweet.</li>
            <li> i love it cant camplaing at all I f I rang out I ll buy and other one  for sure</li>
            <li> Great scent but hard to find. I got a great deal on this item.</li>
