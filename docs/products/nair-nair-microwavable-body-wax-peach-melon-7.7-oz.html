    <ol>
            <li>This wax was the best I could buy at Wall-Mart for 7 dollars.</li>

            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get over how wonderful it was!  </li>
            <li>but this smells great and gets all the hair!</li>
            <li>Very good.</li>
            <li>It does smell very good though.</li>
            <li>I do have to say that the sent is really pleasant</li>
            <li>This product smells good</li>
            <li>I just loved the way wax spreads on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>and I have tried many!</li>
            <li>Great product and  easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t break the hairs.</li>
            <li>Everything else I have used wasn&#x27;t effective in removing hair or caused one problem or another.</li>
            <li>, I gave it to my sister to try who is an expert at waxing her own legs as she&#x27;s been doing it since she was in her teens.</li>
            <li>I liked the scent.</li>
            <li>absolute best there is</li>
            <li>I bought this for my bikini wax and it took me a minute or two to get started, but I was thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>I have years of experience on waxing myself, and for me, this kind of wax didn&#x27;t work so well.</li>
            <li>Its awesome this is water/sugar based wax as its easy to wipe off any residual wax and trust me for my first time</li>
            <li>When I can no longer buy it in the store, it is so nice to still be able to get it.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best microwavable wax on the market.</li>
            <li>By far the best wax out there.</li>
            <li>and it was easy peasy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s water rinseable, which is very important.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and clean up is easy.</li>
            <li>It is quick, easy and mess-free !!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product every since it came out many years ago.</li>
            <li>takes off most of the hair</li>
            <li>just make sure you do it evenly because i didnt</li>
            <li>but i wish it came with more applicators and more cloth strips because i need to get more now.</li>
            <li>But I do love them.</li>
            <li>LOVE this wax.</li>
            <li>One 7.7 oz container can be used to cover both arms, twice, and them some more.</li>
            <li>And to top it off, it removed some hair but broke off others</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m beyond pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for many many years.  </li>
            <li>But I wax my face with it mostly.  </li>
            <li>I have written a similar review before and have to say this is the best wax product I have tried</li>
            <li>The wax consistency is light and silky, it smells great, it is gentle on the skin, yet incredibly effective.</li>
            <li>Love this product for do it yourself waxing at home.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get any better (but the smell sucked-wish it was like it used to be without scent-but then again they don&#x27;t make that either).  </li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy it at the drug store for like $8.</li>
            <li>it wont work but all in all its pretty good.</li>
            <li>Buy it and enjoy. :)</li>
            <li>Can be washed easily with water.</li>
            <li>I really like this wax, you have to make it really smooth and warm</li>
            <li>I bought it the other day and used it on my fiance, mom and myself AND LOVED IT!  </li>
            <li>clean up is a breeze.</li>
            <li>I hope Amazon follows up on this review, and comes up with a deal with Nair, so the customers can purchase wax at a more reasonable price on Amazon, they way it used to be.</li>
            <li>the time I had finished waxing I had decided that I am definitely gonna write a review telling how good</li>
            <li>It really quick and pain-free.</li>
            <li>It only took me about 3 strips to do my whole bikini area and it was near perfect.</li>
            <li>I heated it up to the right temp &amp; consistency.</li>
            <li>( I probably didn&#x27;t spell that right)</li>
            <li>It works beautifully, the residue washes off, there is very little irritation (you are pulling hairs after all!)</li>
            <li>I love the smell, the effective hair removal, and the fact that it is sugar-based and water-soluable - just like Nad&#x27;s only much less expensive, smells wonderful and is a absolute easy, pleasure to use!  </li>
            <li>Besides that I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, in fact I rushed back to Walmart at 1am to buy all they had left, 3 boxes for $6.00!!</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about the strips being washable but because of the sugar wax, all the gunk just dissolves leaving you with a fresh strip- awesome!</li>
            <li>The amount of product is this package is easily twice what one would in other brands, which are often marketed as ready made wax strips, which are not as good as having access to was that one can apply to the skin directly.</li>
            <li>but the wax is SUPER messy and it pulls more on skin than hair!</li>
            <li>Thanks Nair!  </li>
            <li>Okay so I decided to give waxing a try since shaving doesn&#x27;t last and epilating</li>
            <li>This was so great, can be used again and again, just warm it up in the microwave, so much better than the really pricey cold wax strips which most of the time don&#x27;t work properly anyway because they&#x27;ve been kept in the store shelves for too long!</li>
            <li>all it really did was make my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>It removed hair reasonably well.</li>
            <li>and then it works really well.</li>
            <li>When I used too much wax the strip pulled absolutely nothing off.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work very well at all.</li>
            <li>I got fantastic, one yank results from using just enough wax to cover the hairs.</li>
            <li>its been a week or two now and my hair still hasnt grown back which is very exciting</li>
            <li>BTW I had to re-microwave it only thrice which is like good coz even for other products you have to do it.</li>
            <li>I bought this wax and was so excited to use it last night.</li>
            <li>This Nair product is leaps and bounds better than all the other DIY waxing products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>i mainly used it on my legs</li>
            <li>This product is very sticky, makes a mess on your skin, doesn&#x27;t take the hair out easily.</li>
            <li>not the greatest product but with the price its not so bad.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had no secondary skin reactions.</li>
            <li>I could do a better job than few &amp;#34;professionals&amp;#34; at the beauty salon</li>
            <li>Strong enough for coarse hair, and still washes off with water.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it works like a charm for me!</li>
            <li>Also, the ability to rinse and reuse the wax strips is extremely convenient and sugar wax is way better for your skin than regular wax!</li>
            <li>I had this product from Wallmart first time and payed only $7.</li>
            <li>Hard wax works better.</li>
            <li>With ready made wax strips one would inevitably miss spots.</li>
            <li>I suspect many of the negative reviews come from novice waxers.</li>
            <li>Initially, I applied too much wax which prevented the hairs from adhering.</li>
            <li>I am sick of shaving and for winter time, waxing seems ideal.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the strip waxing much compared to the just wax and pull methodFor me not so harsh but will try this</li>
            <li>a little surprised when first received it, but relieved after I tried it,</li>
            <li>but a different version (maybe an old version) from what I thought it is.</li>
            <li>I mean, I have used other nair products, and this wax compare to the other I used to use is not as good as the Devine microwaveable orchid kit .</li>
            <li>When you apply this wax is a little mess, but easy to use.</li>

            <li> When you apply this wax is a little mess, but easy to use.</li>
            <li> A thin layer pulled every single hair leaving me with baby smooth skin.</li>
            <li> If you have hair like me this is a complete waste of time and money and if possible I would give it 0 stars.</li>
            <li> (I bought it a long time ago for my legs)</li>
            <li> using this coupled with shaving i had the smoothest legs ive had in a long time for about 2 days.</li>
            <li> The key with sugar wax is applying a thin, consistent layer.</li>
            <li> Walmart only has it listed online, but they do not really have it, has been out of stock for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have dark coarse hair and this product does the job without ripping my skin off.</li>
            <li> Didnt work just left a sticky mess everywhere.</li>
            <li> , stubborn hairs take a little extra time before they come out.  </li>
            <li> You get a supply of washable cloth strips, a big tub of sugar wax, a little stick for spreading, and a few bonus wax strips for an upper lip or eyebrow.</li>
            <li> It was horribly painful, pulling skin more than anything else.</li>
            <li> Big waste of money.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Italian and I have very coarse and thick hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product and I will be using this for a very long time!</li>
            <li> The wax doesn&#x27;t stay heated long so by the time u finish waxing half of one leg</li>
            <li> Also it can be washed away with water or with a wet cloth which makes it extremely convenient.</li>
            <li> I cannot understand why Nair and other companies keep making those ready-to-use strips that do not work.</li>
            <li> it got maybe every other hair on my legs</li>
            <li> But the 1/4 it left behind, it simply broke off leaving a whisker feel.</li>
            <li> But its a little harder to use on the thicker , shorter hairs.  </li>
            <li> so your hair has to be longer than the average stubble or else</li>
            <li> so the wife will stop telling me to turn down the tv.</li>
            <li> Other products are too harsh on my skin and irritate it</li>
            <li> I found it messy to use.</li>
            <li> When using this product on my legs it would only pull out about 10 hairs and they were randomly placed, so I would have to go over the same place at least 5 times.</li>
            <li> and i have blonde slighty thin hair.</li>
            <li> just wasn&#x27;t my thing, and I can honestly say I HATED IT!</li>
            <li> I have long used this style of product and was not happy when I could no longer find it in stores.  </li>
            <li> Why is this now so expensive all the sudden?</li>
            <li> and i think its worth it because i hate shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my go to product to remove my pesky, unfortunate facial hair!</li>
            <li> Also work in small sections, no wider than 2 fingers.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical since I have sensitive skin and the word \\&quot;Nair\\</li>
            <li> It would hardly pull off any hair, just hurt a lot pulling on skin.     </li>

            <li> This wax was the best I could buy at Wall-Mart for 7 dollars. It&#x27;s water rinseable, which is very important. Why is this now so expensive all the sudden?</li>
            <li> When I can no longer buy it in the store, it is so nice to still be able to get it.</li>
            <li> Just want to let you know that I have been a Nad&#x27;s user since it came out in the mid 1990&#x27;s.  I used it on myself as well as my fiance, mom, nieces and friends.  Only recently did my friend (who I used Nad&#x27;s on) tell me about your peach melon sugar wax.  I was very skeptical since I have sensitive skin and the word \\&quot;Nair\\&quot; means \\&quot;irritating and smelly chemicals\\&quot;.  She assured me over and over how wonderful your melon wax was.  (She found it when she couldn&#x27;t afford to buy the Nad&#x27;s since Nad&#x27;s is usually $20.00 a jar!)  I bought it the other day and used it on my fiance, mom and myself AND LOVED IT!  I couldn&#x27;t get over how wonderful it was!  I love the smell, the effective hair removal, and the fact that it is sugar-based and water-soluable - just like Nad&#x27;s only much less expensive, smells wonderful and is a absolute easy, pleasure to use!  I threw out the rest of my Nad&#x27;s.  I never thought I&#x27;d say this, but for me, it&#x27;s only Nair from now on.  PLEASE DON&#x27;T DISCONTINUE THIS PRODUCT.  I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have lot of experience in hair removing waxes. I had tryed some in USA, that are terrible! Finally I found this one and I can say, that&#x27;s comparable with those in Europe. Very good.</li>
            <li> This was so great, can be used again and again, just warm it up in the microwave, so much better than the really pricey cold wax strips which most of the time don&#x27;t work properly anyway because they&#x27;ve been kept in the store shelves for too long! Go for this!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product every since it came out many years ago. It works beautifully, the residue washes off, there is very little irritation (you are pulling hairs after all!) and I&#x27;ve had no secondary skin reactions. Everything else I have used wasn&#x27;t effective in removing hair or caused one problem or another. When my local (world&#x27;s largest retail) store stopped carrying it, I panicked, but Amazon came to the rescue!</li>
            <li> i mainly used it on my legs so your hair has to be longer than the average stubble or else it wont work but all in all its pretty good. takes off most of the hair just make sure you do it evenly because i didnt and now im stuck with patches of hair that i keep having to go back and remove. my skin got some red bumps but it went away after a day. its been a week or two now and my hair still hasnt grown back which is very exciting and i think its worth it because i hate shaving. This product smells good but i wish it came with more applicators and more cloth strips because i need to get more now.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my legs, underarms, and stomach. It would hardly pull off any hair, just hurt a lot pulling on skin.     If I had problems just because I&#x27;m a novice (though I tried it multiple times, so you&#x27;d think I&#x27;d make headway with it), I gave it to my sister to try who is an expert at waxing her own legs as she&#x27;s been doing it since she was in her teens. She didn&#x27;t have any luck with it either so we chucked it. Big waste of money.</li>
            <li> Works well for me. Can be washed easily with water.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say. But I do love them. I use them with the tv. so the wife will stop telling me to turn down the tv. I use them so I can here it when she runs the vac or the dish washer.</li>
            <li> I found it messy to use. Maybe next time I&#x27;ll try the strips that come prewaxed. I liked the scent. It removed hair reasonably well. But both times I used it, wax got dripped all around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year now! It&#x27;s my go to product to remove my pesky, unfortunate facial hair! I have sensitive skin and it works like a charm for me! I&#x27;ve even gotten my sister and my mom into using the product as well! It&#x27;s the ONLY thing that I use and that works for me! Other products are too harsh on my skin and irritate it but this smells great and gets all the hair! A little goes a long way with this product and I will be using this for a very long time!</li>
            <li> I really like this wax, you have to make it really smooth and warm and then it works really well. It really quick and pain-free. Also it can be washed away with water or with a wet cloth which makes it extremely convenient. It is quick, easy and mess-free !!</li>
            <li> LOVE this wax. I had my bikini done by a beautician and then I found this wax in the back of my bathroom cupboard (I bought it a long time ago for my legs) did my boyfriend&#x27;s eyebrows and he helped me do my bikini and it was easy peasy! Also, the ability to rinse and reuse the wax strips is extremely convenient and sugar wax is way better for your skin than regular wax! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to dyi hair removal.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Didnt work just left a sticky mess everywhere. Hard wax works better. I wouldnt recommend if you have course hair.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best microwavable wax on the market. One 7.7 oz container can be used to cover both arms, twice, and them some more. The only problem is that this product keeps getting more expensive, since it has disappeared from store shelves (CVS, RiteAid, Target and Walgreens) do not carry this. Walmart only has it listed online, but they do not really have it, has been out of stock for a very long time. The amount of product is this package is easily twice what one would in other brands, which are often marketed as ready made wax strips, which are not as good as having access to was that one can apply to the skin directly. With ready made wax strips one would inevitably miss spots. I hope Amazon follows up on this review, and comes up with a deal with Nair, so the customers can purchase wax at a more reasonable price on Amazon, they way it used to be.</li>
            <li> I bought this wax and was so excited to use it last night. I am sick of shaving and for winter time, waxing seems ideal. It was horribly painful, pulling skin more than anything else. And to top it off, it removed some hair but broke off others so I wound up feeling like I hadn&#x27;t shaved on a couple of days because I am covered with stubble!! It did remove about 3/4 of the hair, which is the only reason I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars. But the 1/4 it left behind, it simply broke off leaving a whisker feel. Not happy and will not buy again! The scent is pleasant and clean up is easy. That&#x27;s all I can say about it. *sigh* Pain for nothing.</li>
            <li> absolute best there is</li>
            <li> Ive been wanting a brazilian for forever but Im too much of a chicken to go to a salon. I just so happen to find these on the clearance aisle in walmart for $2.00!!! I don&#x27;t care how painful it is for 2 bucks I&#x27;ll take it! So I bought a box went home and tortured myself and I&#x27;m beyond pleased with the result. With my experience it is imperative to apply a thin layer of wax. When I used too much wax the strip pulled absolutely nothing off. A thin layer pulled every single hair leaving me with baby smooth skin. Also work in small sections, no wider than 2 fingers. Its awesome this is water/sugar based wax as its easy to wipe off any residual wax and trust me for my first time I was covered in it.  One caveat I had was the film over the wax was tough to take off, I ended getting wax all over my hands just trying to pull all the film off before microwaving. Besides that I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, in fact I rushed back to Walmart at 1am to buy all they had left, 3 boxes for $6.00!! WHOO HOOO!</li>
            <li> Just what I expected. PAINFUL though to wax, but it does the job. I would definitely order additional waxing strips though.</li>
            <li> I bought this nair wax for my underarms, and it just wouldn&#x27;t take any of the hair off! I followed all the directions, and kept failing each time. The hair wouldnt stick to the pad. I heated it up to the right temp &amp; consistency. I think im going to try it for my legs because the hair is thinner on my legs, but if it doesn&#x27;t do anything there, then it&#x27;s going to be returned. It does smell very good though.</li>
            <li> Great product and  easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t break the hairs. I could do a better job than few &amp;#34;professionals&amp;#34; at the beauty salon</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot but is a little expensive . I had this product from Wallmart first time and payed only $7. When you apply this wax is a little mess, but easy to use.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  I have been using this for many many years.  I don&#x27;t see it in Walgrees, CVS or rite aid anymore.  But I wax my face with it mostly.  I have dark coarse hair and this product does the job without ripping my skin off.</li>
            <li> I have written a similar review before and have to say this is the best wax product I have tried and I have tried many! The wax consistency is light and silky, it smells great, it is gentle on the skin, yet incredibly effective. I cannot understand why Nair and other companies keep making those ready-to-use strips that do not work. This is the closest to salon quality.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Italian and I have very coarse and thick hair. When using this product on my legs it would only pull out about 10 hairs and they were randomly placed, so I would have to go over the same place at least 5 times. If you have hair like me this is a complete waste of time and money and if possible I would give it 0 stars.</li>
            <li> I just loved the way wax spreads on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;It made waxing so easy.&lt;br /&gt;Before buying this product even I read all the reviews and was confused if I should buy it or not. Then I thought atleast let me give it a try. So I bought it and the time I had finished waxing I had decided that I am definitely gonna write a review telling how good this product it.&lt;br /&gt;For all those getting confused with the reviews on points like you need to re-microwave it then I&#x27;ll say nobody can go against the laws of physics of things getting cold with time. BTW I had to re-microwave it only thrice which is like good coz even for other products you have to do it. I do recommend this product. Buy it and enjoy. :)</li>
            <li> not the greatest product but with the price its not so bad. it got maybe every other hair on my legs and i have blonde slighty thin hair. using this coupled with shaving i had the smoothest legs ive had in a long time for about 2 days. all it really did was make my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> Love this product for do it yourself waxing at home. clean up is a breeze. Just need water. no sticky residue.</li>
            <li> Yeah I wrote nair about them no longer making this product.  What a shame.  Strong enough for coarse hair, and still washes off with water.  Can&#x27;t get any better (but the smell sucked-wish it was like it used to be without scent-but then again they don&#x27;t make that either).  When will companies learn?  Now I have to go somewhere else.  Thanks Nair!  Idiots.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected. No complaints</li>
            <li> The manufacturer has discontinued this product and I wish they wouldn&#x27;t have. I used to be able to buy it at the drug store for like $8. Now that quantity is reduced the price is insane but still lasts me like a year.</li>
            <li> but a different version (maybe an old version) from what I thought it is. a little surprised when first received it, but relieved after I tried it,</li>
            <li> By far the best wax out there. I suspect many of the negative reviews come from novice waxers. Waxing takes some time and patience but this kit delivers salon-quality results. You get a supply of washable cloth strips, a big tub of sugar wax, a little stick for spreading, and a few bonus wax strips for an upper lip or eyebrow. The key with sugar wax is applying a thin, consistent layer. I bought this for my bikini wax and it took me a minute or two to get started, but I was thrilled with the results. Initially, I applied too much wax which prevented the hairs from adhering. I got fantastic, one yank results from using just enough wax to cover the hairs. It only took me about 3 strips to do my whole bikini area and it was near perfect. Works well on the legs and underarms too. I was skeptical about the strips being washable but because of the sugar wax, all the gunk just dissolves leaving you with a fresh strip- awesome! Will definitely repurchase if they ever bring these back.</li>
            <li> This product is very sticky, makes a mess on your skin, doesn&#x27;t take the hair out easily. I mean, I have used other nair products, and this wax compare to the other I used to use is not as good as the Devine microwaveable orchid kit . I have years of experience on waxing myself, and for me, this kind of wax didn&#x27;t work so well.</li>
            <li> But its a little harder to use on the thicker , shorter hairs.  I use it only on my upper lip and I have noticed a couple of thicker, stubborn hairs take a little extra time before they come out.  I now just pluck them out if they&#x27;re the only ones left after I wax.  Otherwise, I have no problems with this product.</li>
            <li> I have long used this style of product and was not happy when I could no longer find it in stores.  This Nair product is leaps and bounds better than all the other DIY waxing products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I was hoping  it was by description it was the cold wax that could be ripped off without strips but it wasn&#x27;t.I really don&#x27;t like the strip waxing much compared to the just wax and pull methodFor me not so harsh but will try this</li>
            <li> Okay so I decided to give waxing a try since shaving doesn&#x27;t last and epilating ( I probably didn&#x27;t spell that right) just wasn&#x27;t my thing, and I can honestly say I HATED IT! Maybe it was just the product but the wax is SUPER messy and it pulls more on skin than hair! I mean you&#x27;ll wax an area on your leg and u&#x27;ll go through some pain and remove barley any hair at all. The wax doesn&#x27;t stay heated long so by the time u finish waxing half of one leg u need to reheat it -_-. I do have to say that the sent is really pleasant but thats not enough of a reason for anyone to buy it. Maybe i&#x27;ll try a different product for waxing but I must say this one is AWFUL!!</li>
