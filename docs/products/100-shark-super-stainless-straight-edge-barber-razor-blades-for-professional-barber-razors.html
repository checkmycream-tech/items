            <li>These cut very nicely and better than any razor I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>They are the first I&#x27;ve bought and they seem to do their intended job, perfectly.</li>
            <li>(I have never had a better tool for that than these razors!</li>
            <li>Turns out these are much better than the ones I was using!</li>
            <li>Cheap &amp; works great.</li>
            <li>These are amazing and give me the smoothest closest shave i have ever had.</li>
            <li>These razors are amazing.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve shaved a couple friends with these and they did amazing,</li>
            <li>One blade is good for one use, they do OK job.</li>
            <li>Nice blades.</li>
            <li>I was using the Luxor Pro Master Razor Deluxe Safety Notch Barber Razor for this test from Amazon.</li>
            <li>nice, but it should be thicker and sharper</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great shave now all I need is a nice case and brush set.</li>
            <li>Nice blades at a nice price, a heack of a lot cheaper</li>
            <li>If you use a compatible straight razor, these blades are perfect.  </li>
            <li>so to each his own,</li>
            <li>he says they&#x27;re great ... not bad for the price and</li>
            <li>This is a very good, economical shave, I like much better than those jobs with ALL those blades-</li>
            <li>Great sharp blades excellent shave</li>
            <li>Awesome blades, Super sharp and a great value!</li>
            <li>nice blades, maybe not the most quality (??)</li>
            <li>Ok I have to be honest , idk if its my hair type but these blades leave me with cuts all over my face</li>
            <li>These razors are good and worth every penny!</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly into my Parker straight razor.  </li>
            <li>it light smooth and feels great</li>
            <li>They are exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to be and do a great job at shaving.</li>
            <li>and you get very very close and smooth shaves without nicks, cuts nor rash!!!  </li>
            <li>(I bought the Shavette for those mornings where you just don&#x27;t want to strop) and using that as a reference point, the Dovo blades were about 80% as pleasant as a real straight and these blades vary from 40-70%.</li>
            <li>Each blade comes in its own wrapper, very good edge, no reason to ever go back cartridge blades again.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t suggest trying to use them for more than a shave or 2.</li>
            <li>Love these Shark blades.</li>
            <li>Overall very happy!</li>
            <li>Nice smooth cut.</li>
            <li>Love these blades.</li>
            <li>more but ironically disposable razors seem to have thicker, sturdier blades.</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>I knew I would need more blades, since these are not intended to be resharpened, or stropped.</li>
            <li>a price makes them even better.</li>
            <li>So I saw these online and bought them, they&#x27;re a hundred times better.</li>
            <li>The edge is great and provides a really close, smooth shave!  </li>
            <li>Def enjoyed the fact they were pre snapped though.</li>
            <li>They mostly sit in a medicine cabinet with stints on the counter or in a travel bag.</li>
            <li>and I just told most of my friends</li>
            <li>/&gt;Blades are more of a trial and error process.</li>
            <li>I have not tried the Chrome Sharks but those may be better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure glad while searching the Internet that I came across these Shark razor blades.</li>
            <li>I use these singles in my straight razor and am happy.</li>
            <li>what more can I say?</li>
            <li>The recipient is pleased with them.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>They are better than trying to sharping every time.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of these</li>
            <li>I have been doing many razor cuts with these blades.  </li>
            <li>They are ok for saloon use where it is disposed after one time use.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ultimately glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li>Most people say they get 7 shaves out of each blade</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these razors.</li>
            <li>Razor shark:)</li>
            <li>Sometimes simpler the better.</li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>To me, this is a way better solution than honing /</li>
            <li>I bought these to use in my shavette, and they get my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>but I still need to practice shaving more and more to avoid cuts.</li>
            <li>No problem here though. :-)</li>
            <li>HUSBAND WAS SO GLAD THAT ORDERED THIS FOR HIM.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s it, just OK.  </li>
            <li>My second time buying these, these are excellent razors.</li>
            <li>and I find that none of them shave better and more closer than these blades.</li>
            <li>Great disposable straight razor blades</li>
            <li>Great for anyone with a straight razor.</li>
            <li>What else is required of them that I should have to comment more?</li>
            <li>:) .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will buy more of these when I run out.</li>
            <li>The Diamond Edge Professional Straight Razor works great with these blades of great price and durability.</li>
            <li>I would recommend them to any of my friends and anybody who is interested in getting any good razors.</li>
            <li>these blades are really pretty good and worked on me pretty good, So if this is your type of shaving you may wanna look into these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These blades are great on the first shave (three passes on a week&#x27;s worth of growth).</li>
            <li>Great as far as I can tell</li>
            <li>(Filled up my two more words).</li>
            <li>I am a new straight razor user and these give an excellent shave every time.</li>
            <li>That being said I have tried other razor brands over the years, and I find these to be the best at what they do.  </li>
            <li>Great blades, excellent price (much cheaper than cartridges) and can shave my facial hair off effectively for 6-7 different shaves.</li>
            <li>Easy to change</li>
            <li>Canned stuff is very light in comparison and the blade will go over your face too quickly and the difference in resistance between hair and shaving cream can lead to slips.</li>
            <li>The sharpness factor was a bit surprising given that I have read good reviews on these blades and other reviewers seemed to think they were the sharpest.</li>
            <li>I am used to Personna blades, and these just felt alot weaker and during a full face shave where I would use one Personna, I would see myself using two or more of these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others but these are just fine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fine with these and look at the price&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li>These are the best budget priced half blades I have used.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use them to shave my entire face, more to outline and edge the lines on my beard/goatee/mustache, and these really do an impeccable job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to straight razor shaving, but these feel very good.  </li>
            <li>I had given the Shark Super Stainless blade a fair chance to shave and all I got was the shark eating my face.</li>
            <li>These are smooth blades that care for your skin.</li>
            <li>it is a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li>the cost of blades are cheap.</li>
            <li>Cheap razors, but they aren&#x27;t cheaply made.</li>
            <li>This blades are useful for many applications</li>
            <li>Cheap way to shave.</li>
            <li>Buy &#x27;em, enjoy &#x27;em, or throw &#x27;em away if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Great blades and hold an edge for several shaves.  </li>
            <li>It takes about three shaves to learn well how to shave with these type of blades,,, once you do it is smooth sailing</li>
            <li>The FROMM razors definitely last much longer and are another great option, but because they cost quite a bit more, I think the Shark razors are a better value</li>
            <li>you will enjoy the closeness of the shave without having to go to the barber.</li>
            <li>Even if you have to go through a lot of beard, you can always switch it out because they are so cheap.</li>
            <li>Well, they&#x27;re securely packaged as well.</li>
            <li>razors are great use them on my son when I shave him with the straight razor, product was deliver fast.</li>
            <li>Just remember practice makes perfect, master the technique of shaving with a straight razor, and you will look forward to your next shave.</li>
            <li>I use these with a popular men&#x27;s shaving oil sold here on Amazon, and thus far it is the closest shave I&#x27;ve been able to get.  </li>
            <li>Clean and fine.  </li>
            <li>That makes it very economical.  </li>
            <li>If you invest in a good badger hair brush, mug and mug shave soap (High quality, high glycerin soap - NOT Williams - eBay has tons of home made shave soaps that are excellent) and learn the proper way to straight shave, you&#x27;ll be glad you switched.</li>
            <li>Great product fast delivery I highly recommend vender.</li>
            <li>They are great starter blades for anyone trying to learn wet shaving, but very quickly you should move on.</li>
            <li>my first time buying these blades, and they became my favorite.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping an great blades for the shop way better than derby blades wouldnt change back to them to save my life</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still practicing my skills using my razor, but it&#x27;s good to know that these blades are of a consistently and reliably high quality.</li>
            <li>In terms of these razors working in combination with this injectable straight razor, I think they present a very good value.</li>
            <li>Ideal for barbers, very sharp (not Winston blades but up to par).</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t cut clean like Astras or BlueBirds.</li>
            <li>They are clean, and will not cut the skin of customers, if you use it correctly.  </li>
            <li>But the problem is now solved with the slimmer more deftly manageable Shark blades, which I have recently discovered.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no straight razor aficionado, but these work great.</li>
            <li>Great blades exactly as described and saves your self from snapping the regular blades.</li>
            <li>You get a better shave for a much lower cost.</li>
            <li>(Assuming they have a good edge on them, and receive proper care.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;i really dont have much more to say about the product though got what i asked for</li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading I discovered a straight razor would be a better value.  </li>
            <li>you want an old-fashioned type blade (of the type of old barbershops and the kind used to &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; people)  that will slice a strand of hair that is thrown over it, then I suggest you look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Not bad at all for price.</li>
            <li>The wrapper from the new blades works great to dispose of the old</li>
            <li>I have a pretty strong beard and haven&#x27;t had any issues while using these.  </li>
            <li>Besides, it makes shaving very interesting with the classic straight razor style.</li>
            <li>They are extremely sharp and hold on the sharpness even after you finished shaving which it is great because i had to go through two or three of the ones I used before.</li>
            <li>Great product and works as expected!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sharp and cuts great.</li>
            <li>But the savings are tremendous.  </li>
            <li>Got my order quick.  </li>
            <li>I can recommend these and they are by far cheaper and more comfortable than disposables.</li>
            <li>Will surely buy more of these blades, for further use when doing razor line ups, and skin fades.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaving takes about 30 minutes, unlike its 5 minute super razors they sell today.</li>
            <li>Good for a close shave, blades are pretty standard, none were bent or chipped so far, which is nice.</li>
            <li>The fact that you get so many blades for such a great price is definitely a winner.  </li>
            <li>Cheap, sharp, good value.</li>
            <li>Super sharp, nice close shave!</li>
            <li>Great blades, very sharp</li>
            <li>Blades seem to be inconsistent, once in a while you will get one that is not sufficiently sharp, most however are capable of producing a good shave (once).</li>
            <li>(You have to be careful on the first shave or two), and great value for 100 blades.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed because it is so nice and sharp, gives a super smooth cut.</li>
            <li>I use these blades in my Parker straight razor and find that the first shave is usually okay.</li>
            <li>great shave, only once so far but a clean shave</li>
            <li>I will definitely keep buying more!</li>
            <li>and it is so much cheaper!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not sure I&#x27;d get these again, a little more $$ for more consistent quality is probably worth it.</li>
            <li>I have already used this a few times and I am happy with the blades.</li>
            <li>I tried a cheap straight razor from Sally&#x27;s before trying this and it tore my face up.</li>
            <li>and they hold securely in my razor for a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Pricier than the ones I used, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>All in all, price/value ratio makes them worth buying.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I can only get one shave out of each blade, 2 shaves would be nice</li>
            <li>Can not beat the price Will order some more if I am still alive when I run out.</li>
            <li>economical and close shave.</li>
            <li>Definitely economical as well.</li>
            <li>Worth your time.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy, though.</li>
            <li>These are really cheap and nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li>I gotta say the Shark and the Lord seemed equal in quality to me and not sharp at all, the Royal Reds were the best of the three I&#x27;ve tried so far, I&#x27;d like to get a Feather</li>
            <li>Good, sharp blades.  </li>
            <li>These blades are priced right, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>The price is right</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was sharper than those 4 blades thing and with the right patience anyone can reach their desired shaved</li>
            <li>I used one to cut off some troublesome callouses, and it just whizzed right through them like butter.</li>
            <li>Since I started using a straight razor I no longer have to spend a lot of money to get that clean shaven look.</li>
            <li>I never try to use one of them for more than a single shaving session, but they work just fine in my razor and get the job done.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anyone interested in using cocaine for the first time (or the 500th)!</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, the price is so good that using a new blade every day is only pennies</li>
            <li>These blades have worked great for me, They are just has sharp and high quality as the DOVO razors that came with my razor.  </li>
            <li>They should fit most straight razors that use disposable blades and are WAY cheaper than standard razors.</li>
            <li>I bought these razors to fit in my new barber razor.  </li>
            <li>these are so cheap that it you can use a new one every shave.  </li>
            <li>They work great a bit on the thin light side.</li>
            <li>so they are great for several uses, and a box of 100 at so low</li>
            <li>These blades work great and last several shaves.</li>
            <li>So unless you like blood loss and pain do not buy the Shark Super Stainless blades.</li>
            <li>Love using these they leave me with a very close shave and so far I haven&#x27;t found any issues with it.</li>
            <li>nice individually wrapped and ready to be used.</li>
            <li>cant beat 100 blades for $5 I bought a dovo razor for the red insert, the black insert if for full size razors, but I haven&#x27;t used these, I&#x27;ve read good things!</li>
            <li>When the blades dull you&#x27;ll know during the first pull, some beard oil helps also and a good shaving soap ( dont go cheap nere)</li>
            <li>so i use these as a single use blade and they work amazing.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I was new to SE shaving, nicked myself a couple times, but on the 3rd shave I had no issues, and now I get as good of a shave as anything I got from a modern cassette razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of using them for more than one shave.</li>
            <li>And They Were Pretty Good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you dont see the damage hot water does</li>
            <li>: The miniature box and individual wrapping is all that is needed to keep a blade safe.</li>
            <li>: Set aside the price for a minute and consider how much room 100 of the Quattro or Mach 3 blades would take up!</li>
            <li>Make sure you try out different razors.</li>
            <li>They tug and pull and do not last more</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I ordered these when i first started using a shavette.</li>
            <li>I think these are better than the Merkur German brand that sells at Art of Shaving.</li>
            <li>now use double edge razor, and it is so much better.</li>
            <li>As stated in the title these razors are a must have for someone (like myself) who uses cocaine on a consistent basis.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a safety razor guy and you&#x27;re considering this injectable straight razor combo, go for it!</li>
            <li>But read up on it first.</li>
            <li>Just be patient at first.</li>
            <li>The only thing is i wish the ends of the blades were rounded a bit more.</li>
            <li>I have been buying these blades on the regular for about 3 months now &amp; love the product.</li>
            <li>but it was worth it thanks</li>
            <li>Heads up: good blade means less cuts!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve gotten in the habit of using blades once, and then throwing them away, then I guess these are fine, but I&#x27;d rather pay just a little bit more for the Shark</li>
            <li>Not as sharp as a Feather, but I&#x27;m an Astra / Shark / Feather kind of guy</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try a different set next time for comparison, but $8 for 100 shaves is pretty good</li>
            <li>All these multiple blades are a just a waste and normal marketing.&lt;br /&gt;Single blade shaving is the best way !!!</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>It is sharp and nice, I recommend it</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>For the last 10 years I have been using the FROMM injectable &amp;#34;hair shaper&amp;#34; which is intended really more for Salon use rather than a straight razor shave.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and I will most likely be purchasing more next year.</li>
            <li>Sharp, cheap, they work fine.</li>
            <li>I will be upgrading to a classic straight razor, but will keep the Parker and extra Shark blades handy for when the classic razor needs honing.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a straight edge</li>
            <li>You may be able to get a sharper edge with a traditional straight razor, as another reviewer had said, but then you have to strop it and hone it, and this is so much easier.</li>
            <li>Wow super fast shipping, and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>These blades are very sharp amazing price.</li>
            <li>new to this type of shaving - BUY these...!!</li>
            <li>I use each blade about three times before I change it, but I&#x27;m told they are easily used five or more times at least.</li>
            <li>might buy another set from a more reputable dealer where I can see it before I buy it, but that&#x27;s further down the road.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing for the price and the packaging is tight and well made.</li>
            <li>These blades came with my razor and had very high reviews</li>
            <li>very high quality straight razors.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m comfortable with personna shavette and a traditional straight razor shaving.  </li>
            <li>Started straight blade shaving.</li>
            <li>See my posting for the &amp;#34;Parker SR1 Stainless Steel Straight Edge Razor&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Sharper blades</li>
            <li>For those men who use a straight blade razer you can not beat the price.</li>
            <li>No matter how much you try a toddler will get into things they aren&#x27;t supposed to.</li>
            <li>SOOOO much cheaper than buying razors from the store.  </li>
            <li>I bought these blades for a Parker SR1 straight razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow I had a straight edge razor which I was using to see if Straight Razor/Edge Shaving was a workable option for</li>
            <li>Once you get the pressure and angles figured out, you won&#x27;t cut yourself very often.  </li>
            <li>that being said, after two attempts with shaving with a straight razor i have given up.  </li>
            <li>before you think about shaving with a straight razor, my barber in town said nothing shaves closer than a mach4 blade.  </li>
            <li>Not only are they inexpensive but they do a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>I use them for my straight edge razor.</li>
            <li>These blades however give me a real close shave.</li>
            <li>Since that razor cuts real close, I found this blade worked correctly without nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li>Using this while my straight is being re-honed.  </li>
            <li>Straight one blade shaver for years.</li>
            <li>So these are really a one shot deal.</li>
            <li>These did the trick to accompany the gift straight razor I purchased.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to buy them for my Parker SRB straight razor.</li>
            <li>Haha I am not getting ripped off paying for razors at the store anymore, $25 dollars for a pack of razors just does not make sense.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for something that wouldn&#x27;t tear up my face as much.</li>
            <li>Bought this to accompany the barber-style straight razor I got.</li>
            <li>Use them in a shavette, and they&#x27;ll take care of your shaving needs very well.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Shark razors to go along with the Parker SR1 Stainless Steel Straight Edge Razor.</li>
            <li>As others have said, the quality is very hit or miss.</li>
            <li>All in all despite the flimsy feel they do their job very well.</li>
            <li>However, for noobs to wet shaving and veterans alike I urge you to look elsewhere as most of these will just end up not being used and sit in your medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>Not just from lack of experience - for some reason these seems to be really aggressive and slice into bumps on my face.  </li>
            <li>They were delivered in a very timelymanner.</li>
            <li>You get a very close shave with these.</li>
            <li>once I got used to shaving with a straight edge I stopped nicking myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just picked up a Parker  SR1 stainless steel straight edge razor.</li>
            <li>With that I also picked up a Van Der Hagen premium shave set &amp;#34;soap, bowl,and brush&amp;#34; I would recommend all to anyone looking for a very close shave.</li>
            <li>stropping a straight edge razor.  </li>
            <li>and it came with my straight razor.</li>
            <li>I use the parker straight razor.</li>
            <li>Works well with the Parker SR1 Stainless Steel Straight Edge Razor I purchased here on Amazon as well!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t used these much.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a box of straight edge razors</li>
            <li>I can get at least about two good shaves with my Wilkinson blades.</li>
            <li>The blades are super sharp and clean.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Parker SR1 Stainless Steel Straight Edge Razor, since it only came with 5 Shark Super Stainless Straight Edge Barber Razor Blades.</li>
            <li>Will update if other blades are better</li>
            <li>Sharp blades, want more could you want</li>
            <li>whether if its just a simple rugged shave or a clean close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>considering whether or not to get this, bulk value is really the main selling point.  </li>
            <li>Dull quickly, but work great when sharp.</li>
            <li>Super sharp but can&#x27;t hold an edge for more than one shave as my beard is kinda coarse.</li>
            <li>They seem very fragile when you first unwrap one, but as soon as you correctly place it in your straight razor it is sturdy and easy to line your facial hair.</li>
            <li>2 full shaves out of one blade versus the previuos brand where i would have to change a blade after only doing one side of my face</li>
            <li>Bought it last year and the box is still full.</li>
            <li>(In all fairness, I have pretty sensitive skin.)  </li>
            <li>Just practice your blade technique, because they&#x27;ll cut right through your skin as well if you&#x27;re not careful!</li>
            <li>They come much sharper than I could ever get my &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; straight, they go in quick (I use a Parker SR1) and hold their edge fine for 3 passes across my thick stubble.  </li>
            <li>Love these blades always very sharp</li>
            <li>I am new to straight razor shaving and these blades perform as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Im new to this and dont really know the difference...</li>
            <li>live straight razor shaving</li>
            <li>I love how the razors come in the half size</li>
            <li>I was spending more $$$ on Feather blades, but then realized I could buy 100 of these for less than $8.</li>
            <li>and I still have more than half the box.</li>
            <li>Fits Older Hand Held Shaver from 30 Years Ago.</li>
            <li>Great blades last a least to line ups for me.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t write a decent review for this</li>
            <li>one scar is because i dropped my razor in the middle of a shave, lucky for me</li>
            <li>/&gt;The blades may work better in a different razor or with a different shaving soap and or cream .</li>
            <li>Decent shave, but</li>
            <li>highly recommended</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Great product, stays sharp for a few shaves.</li>
            <li>So far the three I&#x27;ve opened (mostly to check them out) have been incredibly sharp though.</li>
            <li>Even with that little glitch these still provide a better shave.</li>
            <li>The Shark blades are listed here as \\&quot;for Professional Barber Razors,\\&quot; and I think they would be fine inexpensive purchase for professional barbers who only need single-use blades.  </li>
            <li>When I switched over to much sharper and higher quality blades I quickly noticed the difference and since I needed less pressure to shave</li>
            <li>The blades are extremely sharp and get cut easily.</li>
            <li>Merkur Super and Shark Chrome, I can use twice each side, and they still feel pretty sharp.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using these blades more than twice per blade as it tends to get dull after the first use.</li>
            <li>I always get a MUCH cleaner and closer shaved with these than I did with my old electric razor.  </li>
            <li>great price too for 100 blades, can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li>This saves loads of money compared with normal razor blades.</li>
            <li>My shavette holds them pretty close to the edge, so the flimsiness doesn&#x27;t impact me much, but if you have a smaller shavette you may notice the flex.</li>
            <li>It takes me a lot longer then a normal razor</li>
            <li>I wasnt sure how long they would last and was planning on throwing them away after each use</li>
            <li>The great reviews (and relatively low price) here for the Shark blades prompted me to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shark blades are good, but I was a bit disappointed overall.  </li>
            <li>I tried these with a Dovo shavette and the shave is quite a bit worse than Dovo blade, even when it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>each blade is individually wrapped and easy to open even with one hand.</li>
            <li>Way more value for the money when compared with typical fixed razors.  </li>
            <li>and I had to work these for a bit to get them to seat properly whereas the derby blades slipped right in.  </li>
            <li>Send me the right product next time!</li>
            <li>By this time I had five cuts on the side of my face and blood running down the side of my face, and this is normally the easy part of the face to shave.</li>
            <li>Always heat the beard with lots of hot water (showering first is best), learn how to make a proper mug and brush lather, wet the beard, apply lather, pull the skin tight and shave in the direction AWAY from your hand (in the direction your beard grows) using minimal pressure in short strokes.</li>
            <li>They give a very close smooth shave and are lasting well so far, I get several shaves per blade.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re a barber, you have to give these blades a try ( sharp and smooth)</li>
            <li>These blades are sharp and work fantastic.</li>
            <li>I shave every 4 days and it is important for me to have a razor sharp blade when I shave.</li>
            <li>sharp, smooth, and eliminates nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li>I use them once, and then switch to a new blade.</li>
            <li>I shave about every week with a new razor.</li>
            <li>I am new to using these style blades</li>
            <li>but with 100 blades for five bucks why not use a new one</li>
            <li>my well soaped face with a new Shark razor blade</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve put a new blade in</li>
            <li>and i also rinse the blade in rubbing alcohol for a second so that it dries extremely fast and slowing down the rust process even more.  </li>
            <li>I have a really thick beard and these were so dull that I would have to use more force to shave and this resulted in more nicks and cuts (ouch!).</li>
            <li>have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The Dovo blades that came with the Shavette were great and would last me about five to seven solid shaves before they started getting noticeably dull.  </li>
            <li>I shave every other day and I notice a significant difference in performance between shave 1 and shave 2.</li>
            <li>if you use hot, the micro metal pores open and rust</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was the first blade I ever purchased, and will probably the last one.</li>
            <li>After that, I started noticing significantly more hair tugging, and I would wind up with razor burn or other red splotchy skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>reason I give them 2 stars instead of 1 is because they give you SOOO many in comparison to other blades at the same price level, so if you’re looking for quantity over quality these are the way to go.</li>
            <li>but like I said if you have sensitive skin get the derby, your face will thank you!</li>
            <li>Shark razor blades are an exceptional value and will last you a long time because you don&#x27;t have to change them out every other shave.</li>
            <li>how much is there to review about it honestly other than the price is right, no pun intended</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used one so far, so maybe the first was just a dud...  </li>
            <li>It essentially got the job done, and I didn&#x27;t have near the razor burn or cuts as the first, but I&#x27;m still a bit skeptic.  </li>
            <li>Old-timey packaging is a pleasant nostalgic throwback.  </li>
            <li>When paired with any Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream i have never gotten even a bit of irritation, even having very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The new technology is definitely sacrificing quality for time, I recommend these over the modern alternatives nay day.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my new straight edge that I got recently.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t have super coarse facial hair).  </li>
            <li>They are also good for other uses as long as you&#x27;re careful.</li>
            <li>As long as you clean the blade after use, it&#x27;ll usually last me all week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These little guys are incredibly sharp, and super cheap.</li>
            <li>Super Sharp.</li>
            <li>Super sharp.</li>
            <li>These are super sharp, and I can use them for a couple weeks before I need to change them.</li>
            <li>that&#x27; felt more dull than the one I just took out.  </li>
            <li>But honestly, I work with scalpels that are less sharp than these blades.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It wasn&#x27;t as it turned out for it seems my skin is just too soft for the Super Sharp blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are Super Sharp as advertized, but don&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These blades are cheap, sharp half blades that fit the Dovo Shavette&#x27;s red adapter.</li>
            <li>Because of the low price, high count, and infrequence of my shaves, I use a new blade each time, so I can&#x27;t speak much for the durability of the blade, but every blade is super sharp out of the box and cuts through my facial hair as if it weren&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re like me and want to escape spending huge amount of money on those expensive cartridges and want to maintain the same shave that you love you</li>
            <li>He said that he breaks out when using a regular shaver, but with these straight edge blades it doesn&#x27;t seem to cause that problem.</li>
            <li>I change the blade after two shaves but they could probably last much longer.</li>
            <li>I was surprised with how well they work.</li>
            <li>A must have for an old fashioned shave.</li>
            <li>Thankfully the straight razors that use these things are very simple to change out</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time and money and</li>
            <li>I use with my straight edge razor and they last.</li>
            <li>But, in the old days I used a DE safety razor and there were two blades as opposed to one................</li>
            <li>ive been using unbranded double edge razors prior to this and have yet to find better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used about 15 blades so far</li>
            <li>These blades come packed very neat, wrapped individually.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a moustache since my 1969 arrival in Vietnam as a young infantry officer.  </li>
            <li>Damn near a lifetime supply of razors sharp enough to shave my Italian face, and they&#x27;re cheap!</li>
            <li>I got the MD Sicilian not long ago and ordered a box of these because reviews rated them high and said they were so sharp,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They are cheap enough that I generally use a new one every day or every other day.</li>
            <li>They stay sharp after multiple shaves, and fit my shavette well.</li>
            <li>They sent me full razor blades instead of half razor blades.  </li>
            <li>Very good razors, very, very sharp, and they last for a couple shaves on my really tough beard.</li>
            <li>For the price, these are extremely affordable and you will get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>not bad, they tug a little bit if you ask me.  </li>
            <li>That super sharp kind is scary to me</li>
            <li>I used these in my Parker Shavette when I first started to learn wet shaving.</li>
            <li>and I only use a new blade every 2 weeks</li>
            <li>He is now back to his old razor!  </li>
            <li>These blades are NOT sharp.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I accidentally ordered the wrong razors for my holder, but these little razors are definitely sharp and will give you a clean line up, I suppose, if you have the right holder for it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shark makes a product that last multiple shaves at a very economical price haven&#x27;t bought a new pack since late 2011 and now its early 2013</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve yet to open a single blade that looks anything but brand new - no rust, dulling, or issues even though the box has gotten light water splashed on it a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>All in all, they fulfill the uses of a &amp;#34;Razor.&amp;#34; They aren&#x27;t really meant to last that long</li>
            <li>Blade Is Much Sharper Then Expected.</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t really shave as well during the second shave and especially not during the third.</li>
            <li>Went back to old school.  </li>
            <li>First few blades have done me well so far.  </li>
            <li>Next I washed of my face and used a hot wet towel again and then used Edge shaving cream and tried shaving again.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately the variation kind of makes me dread</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these blades as a single use blade.</li>
            <li>First off I didn&#x27;t know these were half blades when I ordered them.</li>
            <li>As other reviews have mentioned, these Shark injectables will dull pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>This blades are sharp and seems to hold their sharpness very well as i can get</li>
            <li>What other razors can you use to shave for a whole year for under $7?  </li>
            <li>these are absolutely blazing sharp in a shavette.  </li>
            <li>Its hard to get used to new things but after learning how to shave with a straight  edge i will never go back to new fancy razors</li>
            <li>I like a nice even glide while cutting through soap and hair with nearly even resistance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever run out), mad cheap, cool graphic on the front.</li>
            <li>They can be a teeny tiny bit dull, but that&#x27;s fine for me as I do not need the sharpest blade ever (especially in areas of privacy).  </li>
            <li>only problem is that some are not sharp.</li>
            <li>I have to switch them out every couple of days since the blades dull after a couple of full shaves.</li>
            <li>If you are trying out these straight/double edge razors first time like I was, from those typical gilette ones, try double edge and you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li>They get the job done: cut your facial hair and your neck if not careful.  </li>
            <li>It barely even shaves, they just rip my facial hair out in patches.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The one that was shipped to me was old, beat-up, and wrapped in enough packing tape to strip the yellow print off of the box trying to open it</li>
            <li>Very sharp and ready to use.</li>
            <li>I used them for the first time this morning and they were a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li>I use 2 of the half&#x27;s to make one whole and shave with that :D.</li>
            <li>I did not see that these are just half a straight edge, so</li>
            <li>Though at 9 cents a blade that is still much cheaper than the typical multi-blade cartridges for disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>blades are quite strong for how thin they are and have a lot of flex.</li>
            <li>and they have not rusted or gone dull when I pull out a new one it is ready to go.</li>
            <li>All in all, for a machined edge, these blades are okay, but fail to meet the performance standards met by conventional straight razors.</li>
            <li>unless you see the photo on the box, you might not know this is not a full straight blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been shaving with a straight razor long, but my word these are sharp.  </li>
            <li>They do have two little dots of wax or something on them that was used to keep the wrapper on that may need to be wiped off depending on how much blade your razor exposes.</li>
            <li>sharp, when new out of the box.</li>
            <li>I just opened the 5th today and probably could have kept the first two a little longer and stretched this to June.</li>
            <li>They last a very long time and much sharper than other brands I have tried.</li>

            <li> These cut very nicely and better than any razor I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> They are the first I&#x27;ve bought and they seem to do their intended job, perfectly.</li>
            <li> (I have never had a better tool for that than these razors!</li>
            <li> Turns out these are much better than the ones I was using!</li>
            <li> Cheap &amp; works great.</li>
            <li> These are amazing and give me the smoothest closest shave i have ever had.</li>
            <li> These razors are amazing.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve shaved a couple friends with these and they did amazing,</li>
            <li> One blade is good for one use, they do OK job.</li>
            <li> Nice blades.</li>
            <li> I was using the Luxor Pro Master Razor Deluxe Safety Notch Barber Razor for this test from Amazon.</li>
            <li> nice, but it should be thicker and sharper</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great shave now all I need is a nice case and brush set.</li>
            <li> Nice blades at a nice price, a heack of a lot cheaper</li>
            <li> If you use a compatible straight razor, these blades are perfect.  </li>
            <li> so to each his own,</li>
            <li> he says they&#x27;re great ... not bad for the price and</li>
            <li> This is a very good, economical shave, I like much better than those jobs with ALL those blades-</li>
            <li> Great sharp blades excellent shave</li>
            <li> Awesome blades, Super sharp and a great value!</li>
            <li> nice blades, maybe not the most quality (??)</li>
            <li> Ok I have to be honest , idk if its my hair type but these blades leave me with cuts all over my face</li>
            <li> These razors are good and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly into my Parker straight razor.  </li>
            <li> it light smooth and feels great</li>
            <li> They are exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to be and do a great job at shaving.</li>
            <li> and you get very very close and smooth shaves without nicks, cuts nor rash!!!  </li>
            <li> (I bought the Shavette for those mornings where you just don&#x27;t want to strop) and using that as a reference point, the Dovo blades were about 80% as pleasant as a real straight and these blades vary from 40-70%.</li>
            <li> Each blade comes in its own wrapper, very good edge, no reason to ever go back cartridge blades again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suggest trying to use them for more than a shave or 2.</li>
            <li> Love these Shark blades.</li>
            <li> Overall very happy!</li>
            <li> Nice smooth cut.</li>
            <li> Love these blades.</li>
            <li> more but ironically disposable razors seem to have thicker, sturdier blades.</li>
            <li> Love these.  </li>
            <li> I knew I would need more blades, since these are not intended to be resharpened, or stropped.</li>
            <li> a price makes them even better.</li>
            <li> So I saw these online and bought them, they&#x27;re a hundred times better.</li>
            <li> The edge is great and provides a really close, smooth shave!  </li>
            <li> Def enjoyed the fact they were pre snapped though.</li>
            <li> They mostly sit in a medicine cabinet with stints on the counter or in a travel bag.</li>
            <li> and I just told most of my friends</li>
            <li> /&gt;Blades are more of a trial and error process.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the Chrome Sharks but those may be better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure glad while searching the Internet that I came across these Shark razor blades.</li>
            <li> I use these singles in my straight razor and am happy.</li>
            <li> what more can I say?</li>
            <li> The recipient is pleased with them.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> They are better than trying to sharping every time.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more of these</li>
            <li> I have been doing many razor cuts with these blades.  </li>
            <li> They are ok for saloon use where it is disposed after one time use.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ultimately glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li> Most people say they get 7 shaves out of each blade</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these razors.</li>
            <li> Razor shark:)</li>
            <li> Sometimes simpler the better.</li>
            <li> and I love them.  </li>
            <li> To me, this is a way better solution than honing /</li>
            <li> I bought these to use in my shavette, and they get my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> but I still need to practice shaving more and more to avoid cuts.</li>
            <li> No problem here though. :-)</li>
            <li> HUSBAND WAS SO GLAD THAT ORDERED THIS FOR HIM.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s it, just OK.  </li>
            <li> My second time buying these, these are excellent razors.</li>
            <li> and I find that none of them shave better and more closer than these blades.</li>
            <li> Great disposable straight razor blades</li>
            <li> Great for anyone with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> What else is required of them that I should have to comment more?</li>
            <li> :) .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will buy more of these when I run out.</li>
            <li> The Diamond Edge Professional Straight Razor works great with these blades of great price and durability.</li>
            <li> I would recommend them to any of my friends and anybody who is interested in getting any good razors.</li>
            <li> these blades are really pretty good and worked on me pretty good, So if this is your type of shaving you may wanna look into these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These blades are great on the first shave (three passes on a week&#x27;s worth of growth).</li>
            <li> Great as far as I can tell</li>
            <li> (Filled up my two more words).</li>
            <li> I am a new straight razor user and these give an excellent shave every time.</li>
            <li> That being said I have tried other razor brands over the years, and I find these to be the best at what they do.  </li>
            <li> Great blades, excellent price (much cheaper than cartridges) and can shave my facial hair off effectively for 6-7 different shaves.</li>
            <li> Easy to change</li>
            <li> Canned stuff is very light in comparison and the blade will go over your face too quickly and the difference in resistance between hair and shaving cream can lead to slips.</li>
            <li> The sharpness factor was a bit surprising given that I have read good reviews on these blades and other reviewers seemed to think they were the sharpest.</li>
            <li> I am used to Personna blades, and these just felt alot weaker and during a full face shave where I would use one Personna, I would see myself using two or more of these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others but these are just fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fine with these and look at the price&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li> These are the best budget priced half blades I have used.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use them to shave my entire face, more to outline and edge the lines on my beard/goatee/mustache, and these really do an impeccable job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to straight razor shaving, but these feel very good.  </li>
            <li> I had given the Shark Super Stainless blade a fair chance to shave and all I got was the shark eating my face.</li>
            <li> These are smooth blades that care for your skin.</li>
            <li> it is a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li> the cost of blades are cheap.</li>
            <li> Cheap razors, but they aren&#x27;t cheaply made.</li>
            <li> This blades are useful for many applications</li>
            <li> Cheap way to shave.</li>
            <li> Buy &#x27;em, enjoy &#x27;em, or throw &#x27;em away if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Great blades and hold an edge for several shaves.  </li>
            <li> It takes about three shaves to learn well how to shave with these type of blades,,, once you do it is smooth sailing</li>
            <li> The FROMM razors definitely last much longer and are another great option, but because they cost quite a bit more, I think the Shark razors are a better value</li>
            <li> you will enjoy the closeness of the shave without having to go to the barber.</li>
            <li> Even if you have to go through a lot of beard, you can always switch it out because they are so cheap.</li>
            <li> Well, they&#x27;re securely packaged as well.</li>
            <li> razors are great use them on my son when I shave him with the straight razor, product was deliver fast.</li>
            <li> Just remember practice makes perfect, master the technique of shaving with a straight razor, and you will look forward to your next shave.</li>
            <li> I use these with a popular men&#x27;s shaving oil sold here on Amazon, and thus far it is the closest shave I&#x27;ve been able to get.  </li>
            <li> Clean and fine.  </li>
            <li> That makes it very economical.  </li>
            <li> If you invest in a good badger hair brush, mug and mug shave soap (High quality, high glycerin soap - NOT Williams - eBay has tons of home made shave soaps that are excellent) and learn the proper way to straight shave, you&#x27;ll be glad you switched.</li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery I highly recommend vender.</li>
            <li> They are great starter blades for anyone trying to learn wet shaving, but very quickly you should move on.</li>
            <li> my first time buying these blades, and they became my favorite.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping an great blades for the shop way better than derby blades wouldnt change back to them to save my life</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still practicing my skills using my razor, but it&#x27;s good to know that these blades are of a consistently and reliably high quality.</li>
            <li> In terms of these razors working in combination with this injectable straight razor, I think they present a very good value.</li>
            <li> Ideal for barbers, very sharp (not Winston blades but up to par).</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cut clean like Astras or BlueBirds.</li>
            <li> They are clean, and will not cut the skin of customers, if you use it correctly.  </li>
            <li> But the problem is now solved with the slimmer more deftly manageable Shark blades, which I have recently discovered.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no straight razor aficionado, but these work great.</li>
            <li> Great blades exactly as described and saves your self from snapping the regular blades.</li>
            <li> You get a better shave for a much lower cost.</li>
            <li> (Assuming they have a good edge on them, and receive proper care.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;i really dont have much more to say about the product though got what i asked for</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading I discovered a straight razor would be a better value.  </li>
            <li> you want an old-fashioned type blade (of the type of old barbershops and the kind used to &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; people)  that will slice a strand of hair that is thrown over it, then I suggest you look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all for price.</li>
            <li> The wrapper from the new blades works great to dispose of the old</li>
            <li> I have a pretty strong beard and haven&#x27;t had any issues while using these.  </li>
            <li> Besides, it makes shaving very interesting with the classic straight razor style.</li>
            <li> They are extremely sharp and hold on the sharpness even after you finished shaving which it is great because i had to go through two or three of the ones I used before.</li>
            <li> Great product and works as expected!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp and cuts great.</li>
            <li> But the savings are tremendous.  </li>
            <li> Got my order quick.  </li>
            <li> I can recommend these and they are by far cheaper and more comfortable than disposables.</li>
            <li> Will surely buy more of these blades, for further use when doing razor line ups, and skin fades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving takes about 30 minutes, unlike its 5 minute super razors they sell today.</li>
            <li> Good for a close shave, blades are pretty standard, none were bent or chipped so far, which is nice.</li>
            <li> The fact that you get so many blades for such a great price is definitely a winner.  </li>
            <li> Cheap, sharp, good value.</li>
            <li> Super sharp, nice close shave!</li>
            <li> Great blades, very sharp</li>
            <li> Blades seem to be inconsistent, once in a while you will get one that is not sufficiently sharp, most however are capable of producing a good shave (once).</li>
            <li> (You have to be careful on the first shave or two), and great value for 100 blades.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed because it is so nice and sharp, gives a super smooth cut.</li>
            <li> I use these blades in my Parker straight razor and find that the first shave is usually okay.</li>
            <li> great shave, only once so far but a clean shave</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep buying more!</li>
            <li> and it is so much cheaper!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not sure I&#x27;d get these again, a little more $$ for more consistent quality is probably worth it.</li>
            <li> I have already used this a few times and I am happy with the blades.</li>
            <li> I tried a cheap straight razor from Sally&#x27;s before trying this and it tore my face up.</li>
            <li> and they hold securely in my razor for a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Pricier than the ones I used, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> All in all, price/value ratio makes them worth buying.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I can only get one shave out of each blade, 2 shaves would be nice</li>
            <li> Can not beat the price Will order some more if I am still alive when I run out.</li>
            <li> economical and close shave.</li>
            <li> Definitely economical as well.</li>
            <li> Worth your time.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the buy, though.</li>
            <li> These are really cheap and nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li> I gotta say the Shark and the Lord seemed equal in quality to me and not sharp at all, the Royal Reds were the best of the three I&#x27;ve tried so far, I&#x27;d like to get a Feather</li>
            <li> Good, sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> These blades are priced right, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The price is right</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was sharper than those 4 blades thing and with the right patience anyone can reach their desired shaved</li>
            <li> I used one to cut off some troublesome callouses, and it just whizzed right through them like butter.</li>
            <li> Since I started using a straight razor I no longer have to spend a lot of money to get that clean shaven look.</li>
            <li> I never try to use one of them for more than a single shaving session, but they work just fine in my razor and get the job done.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone interested in using cocaine for the first time (or the 500th)!</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, the price is so good that using a new blade every day is only pennies</li>
            <li> These blades have worked great for me, They are just has sharp and high quality as the DOVO razors that came with my razor.  </li>
            <li> They should fit most straight razors that use disposable blades and are WAY cheaper than standard razors.</li>
            <li> I bought these razors to fit in my new barber razor.  </li>
            <li> these are so cheap that it you can use a new one every shave.  </li>
            <li> They work great a bit on the thin light side.</li>
            <li> so they are great for several uses, and a box of 100 at so low</li>
            <li> These blades work great and last several shaves.</li>
            <li> So unless you like blood loss and pain do not buy the Shark Super Stainless blades.</li>
            <li> Love using these they leave me with a very close shave and so far I haven&#x27;t found any issues with it.</li>
            <li> nice individually wrapped and ready to be used.</li>
            <li> cant beat 100 blades for $5 I bought a dovo razor for the red insert, the black insert if for full size razors, but I haven&#x27;t used these, I&#x27;ve read good things!</li>
            <li> When the blades dull you&#x27;ll know during the first pull, some beard oil helps also and a good shaving soap ( dont go cheap nere)</li>
            <li> so i use these as a single use blade and they work amazing.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I was new to SE shaving, nicked myself a couple times, but on the 3rd shave I had no issues, and now I get as good of a shave as anything I got from a modern cassette razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of using them for more than one shave.</li>
            <li> And They Were Pretty Good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you dont see the damage hot water does</li>
            <li> : The miniature box and individual wrapping is all that is needed to keep a blade safe.</li>
            <li> : Set aside the price for a minute and consider how much room 100 of the Quattro or Mach 3 blades would take up!</li>
            <li> Make sure you try out different razors.</li>
            <li> They tug and pull and do not last more</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I ordered these when i first started using a shavette.</li>
            <li> I think these are better than the Merkur German brand that sells at Art of Shaving.</li>
            <li> now use double edge razor, and it is so much better.</li>
            <li> As stated in the title these razors are a must have for someone (like myself) who uses cocaine on a consistent basis.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a safety razor guy and you&#x27;re considering this injectable straight razor combo, go for it!</li>
            <li> But read up on it first.</li>
            <li> Just be patient at first.</li>
            <li> The only thing is i wish the ends of the blades were rounded a bit more.</li>
            <li> I have been buying these blades on the regular for about 3 months now &amp; love the product.</li>
            <li> but it was worth it thanks</li>
            <li> Heads up: good blade means less cuts!  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve gotten in the habit of using blades once, and then throwing them away, then I guess these are fine, but I&#x27;d rather pay just a little bit more for the Shark</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as a Feather, but I&#x27;m an Astra / Shark / Feather kind of guy</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try a different set next time for comparison, but $8 for 100 shaves is pretty good</li>
            <li> All these multiple blades are a just a waste and normal marketing.&lt;br /&gt;Single blade shaving is the best way !!!</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> It is sharp and nice, I recommend it</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> For the last 10 years I have been using the FROMM injectable &amp;#34;hair shaper&amp;#34; which is intended really more for Salon use rather than a straight razor shave.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and I will most likely be purchasing more next year.</li>
            <li> Sharp, cheap, they work fine.</li>
            <li> I will be upgrading to a classic straight razor, but will keep the Parker and extra Shark blades handy for when the classic razor needs honing.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a straight edge</li>
            <li> You may be able to get a sharper edge with a traditional straight razor, as another reviewer had said, but then you have to strop it and hone it, and this is so much easier.</li>
            <li> Wow super fast shipping, and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp amazing price.</li>
            <li> new to this type of shaving - BUY these...!!</li>
            <li> I use each blade about three times before I change it, but I&#x27;m told they are easily used five or more times at least.</li>
            <li> might buy another set from a more reputable dealer where I can see it before I buy it, but that&#x27;s further down the road.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazing for the price and the packaging is tight and well made.</li>
            <li> These blades came with my razor and had very high reviews</li>
            <li> very high quality straight razors.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m comfortable with personna shavette and a traditional straight razor shaving.  </li>
            <li> Started straight blade shaving.</li>
            <li> See my posting for the &amp;#34;Parker SR1 Stainless Steel Straight Edge Razor&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Sharper blades</li>
            <li> For those men who use a straight blade razer you can not beat the price.</li>
            <li> No matter how much you try a toddler will get into things they aren&#x27;t supposed to.</li>
            <li> SOOOO much cheaper than buying razors from the store.  </li>
            <li> I bought these blades for a Parker SR1 straight razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow I had a straight edge razor which I was using to see if Straight Razor/Edge Shaving was a workable option for</li>
            <li> Once you get the pressure and angles figured out, you won&#x27;t cut yourself very often.  </li>
            <li> that being said, after two attempts with shaving with a straight razor i have given up.  </li>
            <li> before you think about shaving with a straight razor, my barber in town said nothing shaves closer than a mach4 blade.  </li>
            <li> Not only are they inexpensive but they do a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> I use them for my straight edge razor.</li>
            <li> These blades however give me a real close shave.</li>
            <li> Since that razor cuts real close, I found this blade worked correctly without nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li> Using this while my straight is being re-honed.  </li>
            <li> Straight one blade shaver for years.</li>
            <li> So these are really a one shot deal.</li>
            <li> These did the trick to accompany the gift straight razor I purchased.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to buy them for my Parker SRB straight razor.</li>
            <li> Haha I am not getting ripped off paying for razors at the store anymore, $25 dollars for a pack of razors just does not make sense.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for something that wouldn&#x27;t tear up my face as much.</li>
            <li> Bought this to accompany the barber-style straight razor I got.</li>
            <li> Use them in a shavette, and they&#x27;ll take care of your shaving needs very well.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Shark razors to go along with the Parker SR1 Stainless Steel Straight Edge Razor.</li>
            <li> As others have said, the quality is very hit or miss.</li>
            <li> All in all despite the flimsy feel they do their job very well.</li>
            <li> However, for noobs to wet shaving and veterans alike I urge you to look elsewhere as most of these will just end up not being used and sit in your medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Not just from lack of experience - for some reason these seems to be really aggressive and slice into bumps on my face.  </li>
            <li> They were delivered in a very timelymanner.</li>
            <li> You get a very close shave with these.</li>
            <li> once I got used to shaving with a straight edge I stopped nicking myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just picked up a Parker  SR1 stainless steel straight edge razor.</li>
            <li> With that I also picked up a Van Der Hagen premium shave set &amp;#34;soap, bowl,and brush&amp;#34; I would recommend all to anyone looking for a very close shave.</li>
            <li> stropping a straight edge razor.  </li>
            <li> and it came with my straight razor.</li>
            <li> I use the parker straight razor.</li>
            <li> Works well with the Parker SR1 Stainless Steel Straight Edge Razor I purchased here on Amazon as well!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t used these much.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a box of straight edge razors</li>
            <li> I can get at least about two good shaves with my Wilkinson blades.</li>
            <li> The blades are super sharp and clean.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Parker SR1 Stainless Steel Straight Edge Razor, since it only came with 5 Shark Super Stainless Straight Edge Barber Razor Blades.</li>
            <li> Will update if other blades are better</li>
            <li> Sharp blades, want more could you want</li>
            <li> whether if its just a simple rugged shave or a clean close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> considering whether or not to get this, bulk value is really the main selling point.  </li>
            <li> Dull quickly, but work great when sharp.</li>
            <li> Super sharp but can&#x27;t hold an edge for more than one shave as my beard is kinda coarse.</li>
            <li> They seem very fragile when you first unwrap one, but as soon as you correctly place it in your straight razor it is sturdy and easy to line your facial hair.</li>
            <li> 2 full shaves out of one blade versus the previuos brand where i would have to change a blade after only doing one side of my face</li>
            <li> Bought it last year and the box is still full.</li>
            <li> (In all fairness, I have pretty sensitive skin.)  </li>
            <li> Just practice your blade technique, because they&#x27;ll cut right through your skin as well if you&#x27;re not careful!</li>
            <li> They come much sharper than I could ever get my &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; straight, they go in quick (I use a Parker SR1) and hold their edge fine for 3 passes across my thick stubble.  </li>
            <li> Love these blades always very sharp</li>
            <li> I am new to straight razor shaving and these blades perform as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Im new to this and dont really know the difference...</li>
            <li> live straight razor shaving</li>
            <li> I love how the razors come in the half size</li>
            <li> I was spending more $$$ on Feather blades, but then realized I could buy 100 of these for less than $8.</li>
            <li> and I still have more than half the box.</li>
            <li> Fits Older Hand Held Shaver from 30 Years Ago.</li>
            <li> Great blades last a least to line ups for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t write a decent review for this</li>
            <li> one scar is because i dropped my razor in the middle of a shave, lucky for me</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades may work better in a different razor or with a different shaving soap and or cream .</li>
            <li> Decent shave, but</li>
            <li> highly recommended</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Great product, stays sharp for a few shaves.</li>
            <li> So far the three I&#x27;ve opened (mostly to check them out) have been incredibly sharp though.</li>
            <li> Even with that little glitch these still provide a better shave.</li>
            <li> The Shark blades are listed here as \\&quot;for Professional Barber Razors,\\&quot; and I think they would be fine inexpensive purchase for professional barbers who only need single-use blades.  </li>
            <li> When I switched over to much sharper and higher quality blades I quickly noticed the difference and since I needed less pressure to shave</li>
            <li> The blades are extremely sharp and get cut easily.</li>
            <li> Merkur Super and Shark Chrome, I can use twice each side, and they still feel pretty sharp.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using these blades more than twice per blade as it tends to get dull after the first use.</li>
            <li> I always get a MUCH cleaner and closer shaved with these than I did with my old electric razor.  </li>
            <li> great price too for 100 blades, can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> This saves loads of money compared with normal razor blades.</li>
            <li> My shavette holds them pretty close to the edge, so the flimsiness doesn&#x27;t impact me much, but if you have a smaller shavette you may notice the flex.</li>
            <li> It takes me a lot longer then a normal razor</li>
            <li> I wasnt sure how long they would last and was planning on throwing them away after each use</li>
            <li> The great reviews (and relatively low price) here for the Shark blades prompted me to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shark blades are good, but I was a bit disappointed overall.  </li>
            <li> I tried these with a Dovo shavette and the shave is quite a bit worse than Dovo blade, even when it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> each blade is individually wrapped and easy to open even with one hand.</li>
            <li> Way more value for the money when compared with typical fixed razors.  </li>
            <li> and I had to work these for a bit to get them to seat properly whereas the derby blades slipped right in.  </li>
            <li> Send me the right product next time!</li>
            <li> By this time I had five cuts on the side of my face and blood running down the side of my face, and this is normally the easy part of the face to shave.</li>
            <li> Always heat the beard with lots of hot water (showering first is best), learn how to make a proper mug and brush lather, wet the beard, apply lather, pull the skin tight and shave in the direction AWAY from your hand (in the direction your beard grows) using minimal pressure in short strokes.</li>
            <li> They give a very close smooth shave and are lasting well so far, I get several shaves per blade.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re a barber, you have to give these blades a try ( sharp and smooth)</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp and work fantastic.</li>
            <li> I shave every 4 days and it is important for me to have a razor sharp blade when I shave.</li>
            <li> sharp, smooth, and eliminates nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li> I use them once, and then switch to a new blade.</li>
            <li> I shave about every week with a new razor.</li>
            <li> I am new to using these style blades</li>
            <li> but with 100 blades for five bucks why not use a new one</li>
            <li> my well soaped face with a new Shark razor blade</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put a new blade in</li>
            <li> and i also rinse the blade in rubbing alcohol for a second so that it dries extremely fast and slowing down the rust process even more.  </li>
            <li> I have a really thick beard and these were so dull that I would have to use more force to shave and this resulted in more nicks and cuts (ouch!).</li>
            <li> have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The Dovo blades that came with the Shavette were great and would last me about five to seven solid shaves before they started getting noticeably dull.  </li>
            <li> I shave every other day and I notice a significant difference in performance between shave 1 and shave 2.</li>
            <li> if you use hot, the micro metal pores open and rust</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was the first blade I ever purchased, and will probably the last one.</li>
            <li> After that, I started noticing significantly more hair tugging, and I would wind up with razor burn or other red splotchy skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> reason I give them 2 stars instead of 1 is because they give you SOOO many in comparison to other blades at the same price level, so if you’re looking for quantity over quality these are the way to go.</li>
            <li> but like I said if you have sensitive skin get the derby, your face will thank you!</li>
            <li> Shark razor blades are an exceptional value and will last you a long time because you don&#x27;t have to change them out every other shave.</li>
            <li> how much is there to review about it honestly other than the price is right, no pun intended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one so far, so maybe the first was just a dud...  </li>
            <li> It essentially got the job done, and I didn&#x27;t have near the razor burn or cuts as the first, but I&#x27;m still a bit skeptic.  </li>
            <li> Old-timey packaging is a pleasant nostalgic throwback.  </li>
            <li> When paired with any Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream i have never gotten even a bit of irritation, even having very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The new technology is definitely sacrificing quality for time, I recommend these over the modern alternatives nay day.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my new straight edge that I got recently.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t have super coarse facial hair).  </li>
            <li> They are also good for other uses as long as you&#x27;re careful.</li>
            <li> As long as you clean the blade after use, it&#x27;ll usually last me all week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These little guys are incredibly sharp, and super cheap.</li>
            <li> Super Sharp.</li>
            <li> Super sharp.</li>
            <li> These are super sharp, and I can use them for a couple weeks before I need to change them.</li>
            <li> that&#x27; felt more dull than the one I just took out.  </li>
            <li> But honestly, I work with scalpels that are less sharp than these blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t as it turned out for it seems my skin is just too soft for the Super Sharp blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are Super Sharp as advertized, but don&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These blades are cheap, sharp half blades that fit the Dovo Shavette&#x27;s red adapter.</li>
            <li> Because of the low price, high count, and infrequence of my shaves, I use a new blade each time, so I can&#x27;t speak much for the durability of the blade, but every blade is super sharp out of the box and cuts through my facial hair as if it weren&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re like me and want to escape spending huge amount of money on those expensive cartridges and want to maintain the same shave that you love you</li>
            <li> He said that he breaks out when using a regular shaver, but with these straight edge blades it doesn&#x27;t seem to cause that problem.</li>
            <li> I change the blade after two shaves but they could probably last much longer.</li>
            <li> I was surprised with how well they work.</li>
            <li> A must have for an old fashioned shave.</li>
            <li> Thankfully the straight razors that use these things are very simple to change out</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time and money and</li>
            <li> I use with my straight edge razor and they last.</li>
            <li> But, in the old days I used a DE safety razor and there were two blades as opposed to one................</li>
            <li> ive been using unbranded double edge razors prior to this and have yet to find better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used about 15 blades so far</li>
            <li> These blades come packed very neat, wrapped individually.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a moustache since my 1969 arrival in Vietnam as a young infantry officer.  </li>
            <li> Damn near a lifetime supply of razors sharp enough to shave my Italian face, and they&#x27;re cheap!</li>
            <li> I got the MD Sicilian not long ago and ordered a box of these because reviews rated them high and said they were so sharp,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are cheap enough that I generally use a new one every day or every other day.</li>
            <li> They stay sharp after multiple shaves, and fit my shavette well.</li>
            <li> They sent me full razor blades instead of half razor blades.  </li>
            <li> Very good razors, very, very sharp, and they last for a couple shaves on my really tough beard.</li>
            <li> For the price, these are extremely affordable and you will get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> not bad, they tug a little bit if you ask me.  </li>
            <li> That super sharp kind is scary to me</li>
            <li> I used these in my Parker Shavette when I first started to learn wet shaving.</li>
            <li> and I only use a new blade every 2 weeks</li>
            <li> He is now back to his old razor!  </li>
            <li> These blades are NOT sharp.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I accidentally ordered the wrong razors for my holder, but these little razors are definitely sharp and will give you a clean line up, I suppose, if you have the right holder for it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shark makes a product that last multiple shaves at a very economical price haven&#x27;t bought a new pack since late 2011 and now its early 2013</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to open a single blade that looks anything but brand new - no rust, dulling, or issues even though the box has gotten light water splashed on it a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> All in all, they fulfill the uses of a &amp;#34;Razor.&amp;#34; They aren&#x27;t really meant to last that long</li>
            <li> Blade Is Much Sharper Then Expected.</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t really shave as well during the second shave and especially not during the third.</li>
            <li> Went back to old school.  </li>
            <li> First few blades have done me well so far.  </li>
            <li> Next I washed of my face and used a hot wet towel again and then used Edge shaving cream and tried shaving again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the variation kind of makes me dread</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these blades as a single use blade.</li>
            <li> First off I didn&#x27;t know these were half blades when I ordered them.</li>
            <li> As other reviews have mentioned, these Shark injectables will dull pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> This blades are sharp and seems to hold their sharpness very well as i can get</li>
            <li> What other razors can you use to shave for a whole year for under $7?  </li>
            <li> these are absolutely blazing sharp in a shavette.  </li>
            <li> Its hard to get used to new things but after learning how to shave with a straight  edge i will never go back to new fancy razors</li>
            <li> I like a nice even glide while cutting through soap and hair with nearly even resistance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever run out), mad cheap, cool graphic on the front.</li>
            <li> They can be a teeny tiny bit dull, but that&#x27;s fine for me as I do not need the sharpest blade ever (especially in areas of privacy).  </li>
            <li> only problem is that some are not sharp.</li>
            <li> I have to switch them out every couple of days since the blades dull after a couple of full shaves.</li>
            <li> If you are trying out these straight/double edge razors first time like I was, from those typical gilette ones, try double edge and you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> They get the job done: cut your facial hair and your neck if not careful.  </li>
            <li> It barely even shaves, they just rip my facial hair out in patches.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The one that was shipped to me was old, beat-up, and wrapped in enough packing tape to strip the yellow print off of the box trying to open it</li>
            <li> Very sharp and ready to use.</li>
            <li> I used them for the first time this morning and they were a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I use 2 of the half&#x27;s to make one whole and shave with that :D.</li>
            <li> I did not see that these are just half a straight edge, so</li>
            <li> Though at 9 cents a blade that is still much cheaper than the typical multi-blade cartridges for disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> blades are quite strong for how thin they are and have a lot of flex.</li>
            <li> and they have not rusted or gone dull when I pull out a new one it is ready to go.</li>
            <li> All in all, for a machined edge, these blades are okay, but fail to meet the performance standards met by conventional straight razors.</li>
            <li> unless you see the photo on the box, you might not know this is not a full straight blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been shaving with a straight razor long, but my word these are sharp.  </li>
            <li> They do have two little dots of wax or something on them that was used to keep the wrapper on that may need to be wiped off depending on how much blade your razor exposes.</li>
            <li> sharp, when new out of the box.</li>
            <li> I just opened the 5th today and probably could have kept the first two a little longer and stretched this to June.</li>
            <li> They last a very long time and much sharper than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp and high quality razors.</li>
            <li> seemed dull right out of the box</li>
            <li> They are inconsistent in quality and they seem dull right out of the box.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty dull by the end of the second.</li>
            <li> I use a new blade for every shave and at less than $7 per box</li>
            <li> I decided to start shaving with a straight razor because I heard it was more cost-effective, and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Fit the Parker well, the only negative I observed was, I thought they would stay sharper a little longer.  </li>
            <li> Not realizing this only half of the Double-Edge, I was surprised this type ever existed.</li>
            <li> Use the same side of one of these Shark Stainless blades a second time, and they feel dull.  </li>
            <li> After getting use to a straight razor, no more ingrown hairs or razor bumps.</li>
            <li> These will last me a long time</li>
            <li> Only single use, depending on your beard might need to use two per shave.</li>
            <li> Small enough package that it went right into my shower kit without having to remove all the excess packaging and waste.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and last for multiple shaves.  </li>
            <li> the half blades that some with the dovo are a little less par then the full size ones they came with.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last long, but they are sharp while they last.</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve to the shaving, but as long as you lather up well, even if you have sensitive skin like me, you can shave just as close as any other razor, with minimal scarring.</li>
            <li> In comparison with the Dovo blades, the Shark blades are thinner and go dull much quicker.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about these razors.</li>
            <li> and so i was surprised when I opened them, other than that they are sharp.  </li>
            <li> 100 blades lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Every since I started wet shaving, my skin has toughened up, and I no longer have any red bumps or ingrown hairs, or any sensitivities to climate changes after a shave.</li>
            <li> I was pissed off by now, I then finished shaving with my normal blade with no more blood loss.</li>
            <li> Lasts long.  </li>
            <li> Lasts longer than long.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The product should speak for itself, but since it&#x27;s not alive I&#x27;ll type the review for it,</li>
            <li> I got it open, the blades were individually wrapped, but all the corners of the packaging for each blade was worn and/or bent down.  </li>
            <li> These blades are sharp and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> one single blade goes a long way</li>
            <li> now for sensitive skin have the aftershave ready, I was getting cut quite a bit, these suckers are SHARP!!!</li>
            <li> The blades come in a very small package so it won&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> Sharp, simple, single-sided razor blades.  </li>
            <li> and I can only use depillatory on other places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With 120 blades per box, a box cost at just over $7 and me only shaving every other day it doesn&#x27;t bother me to use them once per shave.</li>
            <li> Having had some time behind a straight edge in my shaving endeavors, the switch to the shavette was rather simple and I couldn&#x27;t have been happier with my mistake, A smoothe shaving blade with not a hint of razor burn.</li>
            <li> I carefully gathered them back up and put them carefully away.</li>
            <li> The only thing was, I got them and they were double blades, no big deal, you just get a set of wire cutters or tin snips and cut them in half, resulting in 200 half blades.</li>
            <li> Bought these blades because I got tired of paying way too much at the local grocery for 8 \\&quot;halves\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, and they last for a long time.</li>
            <li> also picked up a box of Lord single edge blades and my razor</li>
            <li> they are single time use</li>
            <li> The only minor complaint is the yellow wrapping of each blade; if the wrapping gets wet, it will leave yellow residue on whatever it touches.  </li>
            <li> These blades seem dull when new.</li>
            <li> The overall performance of the Shark blades during those shaves, while satisfactory, was still noticeably a step down from that of the Dovo blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;One blade can be used for two (personal) shaves before dulling down.</li>
            <li> ....wish I&#x27;d have bought these in the beginning of my straight razor trials - I&#x27;d have saved myself endless nicks, quarts of blood, and a few dollars thrown in to boot...!!...</li>
            <li> Even with 3 days of growth the blades stay sharp enough to avoid nicks, though admittedly trying to push it more than that is a bad idea.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and last a lot longer than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> Used the on my Matador open comb razor and razo rock black tie.</li>
            <li> you will still be spending less than on the big name razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same box of razors for over a year and a half</li>
            <li> only regret is that I bought the half blades not the DE blades where I would have the option of using a safety razor rather than a SE.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to my previous brand.</li>
            <li> These are the type of blade that came with my straight razor, once I ran out I bought some other brand from the local beauty shop, they were terrible, I have never cut myself shaving more than with those razors.</li>
            <li> however I have some others that are actually sharper and hold an edgwe a little longer..</li>
            <li> For what little extra it cost I picked up a box of a hundred.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how different other brands of half blade are, but I have no complaints about these.</li>
            <li> Lots of razors for not much.</li>
            <li> Be careful with them.</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But do be a bit careful as &#x27;believe me&#x27;</li>
            <li> , that is what dulls the blade faster than shaving with it.  </li>
            <li> I prefer Astra blades that cost the about the same as this SS Shark and lasts quite a few saves.  </li>
            <li> came with a few of the Royal Red blades.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful not to cut your fingers up doing it.</li>
            <li> Again you could use it over a few times if it is personal razor.</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
            <li> as advertised, just what i expected.  </li>
            <li> I get about 3 shaves with no discernible drop in sharpness, but I have very thin facial hair that won&#x27;t abrade the blade as much as others&#x27; will.</li>
            <li> They are tiny, thin, half as wide as normal razors, and they are freaking sharp.</li>
            <li> For some reason, if this blade works for you, it still is not great choice for you because it dulls its sharpness so you need to change it for new one every single time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about half and half, but I overall I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> Be careful, like I said they are sharp</li>
            <li> but they seem to dull quickly on the tough stubble that passes for hair on my face</li>
            <li> This is definitely down to poor technique and not poor quality.  </li>
            <li> I do not recommend them simply due to the fact that I find them to be inconsistent in sharpness and a bit flimsy.</li>
            <li> These blades are amazingly sharp.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used any other ones.</li>
            <li> I might have 1 in 3 that are not as sharp as the rest, but when I find one that works</li>
            <li> As sharp as he needs them to be</li>
            <li> Razor sharp is razor sharp, so other than that what is there to write about?</li>
            <li> Extremely sharp...</li>
            <li> they are plenty sharp</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp and cut well.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have room and money for all sorts of other accessories.</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp.  </li>
            <li> The blades were marginally sharp.  </li>
            <li> Not as sharp as I like.</li>
            <li> Reasonably sharp and seem well made.</li>
            <li> This lends them to some other applications like scraping sticker goop off of surfaces</li>
            <li> With a double-edge you do not know if you have overused side side and not the other.</li>
            <li> Sharp.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;ll get an extremely sharp blade that will make shaving a snap, other times it feels like I&#x27;m pulling the hair out myself.</li>
            <li> They are extremely sharp and my wife immediately noticed the difference in closeness.</li>
            <li> bought mine on Ebay as they were better priced; try them you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I will probably not use these unless I run out of my other blades.</li>
            <li> Quite sharp.</li>
            <li> Yep...These are sharp</li>
            <li> They are sharp as heck though, one time the blade went through the folded towel and cut my finger on the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are so sharp that I have never cut myself shaving with them.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp.</li>
            <li> Really sharp shaving blades.</li>
            <li> Sharp blades.</li>
            <li> I must start out by saying that I have really thick and rough facial hair.  </li>
            <li> These are sharp but not super sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 2 blades so far, and both have been very very dull.</li>
            <li> these little guys are incredibly sharp; it is extremely easy to badly cut yourself if you don&#x27;t pay attention to what you are doing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through about half the box now and these are consistently sharp.  </li>
            <li> but I only get 2 or 3 before it becomes dull or nicked.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only had one blade that was dull out of the wrapper.</li>
            <li> , I use the same blade at least three times and it still works.</li>
            <li> 100 blades is a least a years supply if you switch out about every third shave.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.  </li>
            <li> The 10 for a dollar BiC knock off razors last me for at least 3-4 shaves.</li>
            <li> This will last me at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> I have thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick facial hair.  </li>
            <li> I have a thick beard and it took several passes to get the close shave I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li> These blades always show up as sharp as they can be!</li>
            <li> Then look in the mirror at your baby&#x27;s butt smooth face and congratulate yourself for not flushing 5 bucks down the drain on a single stupid, vibrating, 8-bladed Gillette POS.</li>
            <li> Very Very Sharp.</li>
            <li> you get alot of the razors and they are very sharp...</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades.</li>
            <li> now that i use only cold water to rinse my blades they last about 4 times as long.  </li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp and give you a close shave.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp</li>
            <li> Yep, very sharp.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp and hold an edge for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> They are a lot for the money and very sharp..</li>
            <li> These shark blades are very sharp and don&#x27;t have any kinks in them.</li>
            <li> They do seem to be very sharp as I would expect.</li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp where 2 passes can get you a barber like finish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Half A Blade.</li>
            <li> and then maybe half of another one.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I purchased half blades</li>
            <li> I have both these and the derby half blades.  </li>
            <li> I had less irritation, cuts and a closer shave over all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why everyone doesn&#x27;t wet shave.</li>
            <li> While purchasing DE blades I accidentally selected these little gems while building my order, after the blades arrived I discovered what I did, rather than returning them I picked up a Parker shavette to make use of these blades.  </li>
            <li> Never got a bug cut with these but a couple little nicks</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m just doing it all wrong, but I went back to regular razors.</li>
            <li> and they last at least two shaves so no complaints!</li>
            <li> With a little pratice (take your time and watch youtube videos)</li>
            <li> Each blade is individually wrapped which helps with disposal of the blade as you can just put it back in the wrapper and throw it out with little danger of cutting anything.</li>
            <li> advised though:  carelessness while shaving with these comes with a heavy price.  </li>
            <li> reviewing an object is a waste of time when there is a required amount of words.</li>
            <li> A few cuts here</li>
            <li> Maybe this half blade not too bad because you are forced to use until not good any more.</li>
            <li> little secret, the mark 4 blades will last a long time if you only rinse the blade with cold water.  </li>
            <li> Been using them for a while now(a year, year and a half?!).</li>
            <li> Grabbed my beard pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Big plus these bad boys come pre split and individually wrapped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I just occasionally have a bad day while shaving, or if some of the blades are just a bit off; but there occasionally seems to be some problems.</li>
            <li> Nowadays, when you buy razors they are very expensive and do not last very long.</li>
            <li> Not really sure about the blades because I got these with a Dreadnought Shavette</li>
            <li> but I usually throw them away after one.  </li>
            <li> Box is small</li>
            <li> No more comments</li>
            <li> The same thing it was pulling the facial hair so bad that it was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> i have a very heavy beard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably being ridiculous, but I have little fingers at home and want something between them and a blade, if they some how get in the trash.</li>
            <li> Extremely thin and sharp but also bend against your face when shaving.</li>
            <li> Got tired of 30 dollars from replacement blades from my other shaver.</li>
            <li> Found couple of blades that were dull and unusable.</li>
            <li> One out of five are dull but still usable.</li>
            <li> And it is still dull.</li>
            <li> Just like with knives, people get cut using dull edges.  </li>
            <li> Though my biggest complaint is  inconsistent sharpness.</li>
            <li> Regular dual-edged blades are unwieldy and dangerous --  </li>
            <li> And I have thick wiskers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have too thick a beard</li>
            <li> use Aveeno shave gel, which is thick and moisturizing and still get a close shave.</li>
            <li> I have relatively thick hair</li>
            <li> Because they are razors I&#x27;ve also used them to cut all sorts of tags, shirts strings, and other random stuff (after shaving with them) and had no issues at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> These blades are no better or worse than others.  </li>
            <li> I have not experienced a dull one yet.</li>
            <li> but I think for everyday barbering purposes they&#x27;re too expensive, so for now until I find a sharper blade I&#x27;m stickin with the Royal Reds.</li>
            <li> First shave gave me about eight cuts and the worst razor burn</li>
            <li> and I think they&#x27;re pretty horrible.</li>
            <li> These are scary sharp very thin blades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough for me to do this without experience.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re just bulky, expensive and hard to shave with.</li>
            <li> I never thought they would be so thin.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something thicker but these are paper thin.</li>
            <li> poor quality blade would not give me a close shave .</li>
            <li> Husband says they are very dull, and he has cut his face to pieces using this set!  </li>
            <li> Not impressed with these.</li>
            <li> So I gave up using gilette pro razors with batteries and expensive cartridges and started using blades</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Ill be buying them again when the time comes</li>
            <li> I bought them because all the two and three blade disposables caused me ingrown hair and razor bumps; not to mention expensive for one time use.  </li>
            <li> I am not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> It is already hard to go downstroke, and almost impossible to do upstroke with this crap.</li>
            <li> I think I got a bad box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you will regret it so badly.</li>
            <li> and then it started pulling on the hair really bad, so I reapplied the shaving soap again and tried shaving again.</li>
            <li> Do Not Buy This Worthless</li>
            <li> I do not use this crap at my place.)</li>
            <li> This is indeed worthless crap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My bad!</li>
            <li> Do not buy it&#x27;s the worst razor I&#x27;ve ever tried to use</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very sharp, and they last for a long time. This saves loads of money compared with normal razor blades.</li>
            <li> They get the job done: cut your facial hair and your neck if not careful.  Cheaper than regular razors and going to the barber.</li>
            <li> Have lasted me for years.</li>
            <li> i recomend this for thouse that does&#x27;nt like to go to the barber chop, whit this toy you can do it at home.</li>
            <li> These blades are priced right, but you get what you pay for. I do not recommend them simply due to the fact that I find them to be inconsistent in sharpness and a bit flimsy. My shavette holds them pretty close to the edge, so the flimsiness doesn&#x27;t impact me much, but if you have a smaller shavette you may notice the flex. The sharpness factor was a bit surprising given that I have read good reviews on these blades and other reviewers seemed to think they were the sharpest.</li>
            <li> These blades are amazingly sharp. I don&#x27;t suggest trying to use them for more than a shave or 2. I shave every other day and I notice a significant difference in performance between shave 1 and shave 2.</li>
            <li> The price is right and I get about 4-6 neck shaves from 1 blade.</li>
            <li> Lots of razors for not much. They seem very fragile when you first unwrap one, but as soon as you correctly place it in your straight razor it is sturdy and easy to line your facial hair.</li>
            <li> Bought these 2 years ago and still have some left. I get about 3 shaves out of each blade.</li>
            <li> This blades are sharp and seems to hold their sharpness very well as i can get 2 full shaves out of one blade versus the previuos brand where i would have to change a blade after only doing one side of my face</li>
            <li> For that price and quality you will never regret. These are smooth blades that care for your skin. 1st shave in years I had with no blood !!</li>
            <li> I bought these razors to fit in my new barber razor.  They&#x27;re individually wrapped and packed neatly in the box.  I&#x27;m still practicing my skills using my razor, but it&#x27;s good to know that these blades are of a consistently and reliably high quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan- these are so cheap that it you can use a new one every shave.  You get a better shave for a much lower cost.</li>
            <li> Love these Shark blades. They are cheap enough that I generally use a new one every day or every other day. I prefer these shorter ones to the longer ones as this is all the shaving surface I need.</li>
            <li> Good blades. They do have two little dots of wax or something on them that was used to keep the wrapper on that may need to be wiped off depending on how much blade your razor exposes.</li>
            <li> Very Very Sharp. Fits Older Hand Held Shaver from 30 Years Ago. It&#x27;s Half A Blade. Fits Perfect. Blade Is Much Sharper Then Expected.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used any other ones. Got two boxes of these. Been using them for a while now(a year, year and a half?!). I like them!</li>
            <li> These blades are the best and this is the best price I have found for them!! Also i received them promptly after ordering. Great buy :-)</li>
            <li> Great blades last a least to line ups for me. I have not experienced a dull one yet. Overall very happy!</li>
            <li> I use these blades in my Parker straight razor and find that the first shave is usually okay. The second can potentially flay the skin from your face if you have thicker hair. I use them once, and then switch to a new blade. Seems to have solved the problems I was having. I will be upgrading to a classic straight razor, but will keep the Parker and extra Shark blades handy for when the classic razor needs honing. All in all, for a machined edge, these blades are okay, but fail to meet the performance standards met by conventional straight razors. (Assuming they have a good edge on them, and receive proper care.)</li>
            <li> I used a different brand of blades and let me tell you they don&#x27;t come close to these. They are extremely sharp and hold on the sharpness even after you finished shaving which it is great because i had to go through two or three of the ones I used before. Pricier than the ones I used, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I am new to straight razor shaving and these blades perform as advertised.  The only minor complaint is the yellow wrapping of each blade; if the wrapping gets wet, it will leave yellow residue on whatever it touches.  The blades come in a very small package so it won&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> Used the on my Matador open comb razor and razo rock black tie. These gave incredible shaves, close, no nicks cuts or razor burns, exellent blades</li>
            <li> Good, sharp blades.  Not as sharp as a Feather, but I&#x27;m an Astra / Shark / Feather kind of guy and I like these.</li>
            <li> Super sharp, nice close shave!</li>
            <li> Super Sharp. 100 blades lasts a long time</li>
            <li> While purchasing DE blades I accidentally selected these little gems while building my order, after the blades arrived I discovered what I did, rather than returning them I picked up a Parker shavette to make use of these blades.  Having had some time behind a straight edge in my shaving endeavors, the switch to the shavette was rather simple and I couldn&#x27;t have been happier with my mistake, A smoothe shaving blade with not a hint of razor burn. I can get 3 solid 3-pass shaves from these up to 5 if I push them before they start tugging on my whiskers.</li>
            <li> seemed dull right out of the box</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t write a decent review for this but my husband makes me order this every 3-4 months, so I&#x27;m guessing that it must be really good. He said that he breaks out when using a regular shaver, but with these straight edge blades it doesn&#x27;t seem to cause that problem. I think I will stick to waxing.</li>
            <li> Shark blades are awesome.  I love how the razors come in the half size so I don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking them. They fit perfectly into my Dovo Shavette Handle and give a great shave.  The best part about them is the price.  I use a new blade for every shave and at less than $7 per box it is a fantastic deal. I only shave about every 3 days so these will last me forever.  What other razors can you use to shave for a whole year for under $7?  Each blade is individually wrapped which helps with disposal of the blade as you can just put it back in the wrapper and throw it out with little danger of cutting anything.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth cut. Would definitely buy again...</li>
            <li> Very sharp and ready to use. Haven&#x27;t gotten a nick or razor burn since!</li>
            <li> Works great, gets great shaves</li>
            <li> But for 8 bucks and 100 of them, who&#x27;s to complain</li>
            <li> Started straight blade shaving. Got these with a Parker shaver   They work great a bit on the thin light side. Never got a bug cut with these but a couple little nicks</li>
            <li> See my posting for the &amp;#34;Parker SR1 Stainless Steel Straight Edge Razor&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Sharper blades I&#x27;ve never seen. Be careful with them.</li>
            <li> Very good razors. They get the job done. And I have thick wiskers. Regular razors don&#x27;t cut it..Best investment I ever made.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been shaving with a straight razor long, but my word these are sharp.  After I replace a blade I find that for 1 or 2 shaves after I have tiny nicks I didn&#x27;t even feel. This is definitely down to poor technique and not poor quality.  But honestly, I work with scalpels that are less sharp than these blades.</li>
            <li> They stay sharp after multiple shaves, and fit my shavette well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 2 blades so far, and both have been very very dull. I would not recommend it to anyone planning to use these for shaving, especially if you are planning to shave your head, like me.</li>
            <li> Great blades! Cheap &amp; works great.</li>
            <li> Be careful. It&#x27;s tough for me to do this without experience. I&#x27;m going to check youtube for instructions. It takes me a lot longer then a normal razor but it is a close shave and the cost of blades are cheap.</li>
            <li> I must start out by saying that I have really thick and rough facial hair.  The fact that you get so many blades for such a great price is definitely a winner.  I might have 1 in 3 that are not as sharp as the rest, but when I find one that works well I can use it multiple times.  Definitely a steal for the money you spend and will be purchasing these again in the future!!</li>
            <li> These blades are great on the first shave (three passes on a week&#x27;s worth of growth). They work well on the second shave too (3 passes, one week later), but I wouldn&#x27;t bother using the same blade again for a third shave unless you resharpen it. They&#x27;re pretty dull by the end of the second.</li>
            <li> They do the work for me. I&#x27;ve tried others but these are just fine, I use the same blade at least three times and it still works.</li>
            <li> For those men who use a straight blade razer you can not beat the price. Quality product and great service.</li>
            <li> I ought these for my boyfriend ... he says they&#x27;re great ... not bad for the price and one single blade goes a long way</li>
            <li> For the price, these are extremely affordable and you will get your money&#x27;s worth. Some people say they get 2 shaves out of it, I get one quality shave out of a blade and then maybe half of another one. 120 for the price is a deal.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these ! As sharp as he needs them to be</li>
            <li> ....wish I&#x27;d have bought these in the beginning of my straight razor trials - I&#x27;d have saved myself endless nicks, quarts of blood, and a few dollars thrown in to boot...!!...new to this type of shaving - BUY these...!!</li>
            <li> Love these blades. I never thought they would be so thin. You may be able to get a sharper edge with a traditional straight razor, as another reviewer had said, but then you have to strop it and hone it, and this is so much easier. I&#x27;m not a big fan of using them for more than one shave. If you change it every time, you&#x27;re gonna get the best shave every time. I keep the paper wrapper to put the blade back in before I throw it in the trash. Feels safer to me that way. I&#x27;m probably being ridiculous, but I have little fingers at home and want something between them and a blade, if they some how get in the trash. I definitely leave my Parker with no blade in it when I&#x27;m not using it. No matter how much you try a toddler will get into things they aren&#x27;t supposed to.</li>
            <li> Cheap, sharp, good value.</li>
            <li> What can I say these blades are awesome! best shave I ever got. I will definitely purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> Razor sharp is razor sharp, so other than that what is there to write about? each blade is individually wrapped and easy to open even with one hand. I use each blade about three times before I change it, but I&#x27;m told they are easily used five or more times at least. At that rate I&#x27;ll never need to buy razor blades again.</li>
            <li> Extremely thin and sharp but also bend against your face when shaving. I would buy more but ironically disposable razors seem to have thicker, sturdier blades.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp and high quality razors. Although I cut that hell out myself while using them, I think they would very effective in the hands of a person who knows how to use them.</li>
            <li> you get alot of the razors and they are very sharp... it works out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i really dont have much more to say about the product though got what i asked for</li>
            <li> one scar is because i dropped my razor in the middle of a shave, lucky for me i caught me above the belt!.</li>
            <li> my first time buying these blades, and they became my favorite. if you&#x27;re a barber, you have to give these blades a try ( sharp and smooth)</li>
            <li> Great product and works as expected! Extremely sharp...</li>
            <li> Good quality at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using a shavette about 2 years ago.  I will not go back to using a regular disposable razor again.  These are well sharpened, good quality  blades which can be used for 3 or maybe 4 shaves.  After that it has to be disposed of.  But the savings are tremendous.  And you are not putting something in a landfill that will leach toxins into the soil.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping an great blades for the shop way better than derby blades wouldnt change back to them to save my life</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I purchased half blades and so i was surprised when I opened them, other than that they are sharp.  I use 2 of the half&#x27;s to make one whole and shave with that :D.</li>
            <li> Love these.  SOOOO much cheaper than buying razors from the store.  One blade last me four shaves.  I have thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Parker SR1 Stainless Steel Straight Edge Razor, since it only came with 5 Shark Super Stainless Straight Edge Barber Razor Blades. I knew I would need more blades, since these are not intended to be resharpened, or stropped. They are Super Sharp as advertized, but don&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they were delivered, the wrapped blades had spilled out all over the inside of the delivery box. I carefully gathered them back up and put them carefully away. The box should have been sealed with a piece of scotch tape for delivery.</li>
            <li> I bought these blades for a Parker SR1 straight razor.  It barely even shaves, they just rip my facial hair out in patches.  Not sure if I&#x27;m just doing it all wrong, but I went back to regular razors.</li>
            <li> Work wonderfully. Cheap razors, but they aren&#x27;t cheaply made. I&#x27;m no straight razor aficionado, but these work great. Buy them.</li>
            <li> Damn near a lifetime supply of razors sharp enough to shave my Italian face, and they&#x27;re cheap! What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> These are great blades! I am a new straight razor user and these give an excellent shave every time. I don&#x27;t have too thick a beard so they are great for several uses, and a box of 100 at so low a price makes them even better. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> Good price, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> These are scary sharp very thin blades. They hold in place well with my razor. I wasnt sure how long they would last and was planning on throwing them away after each use but they hold edge well and will probably get 3 shaves before disposing.</li>
            <li> These razors are good and worth every penny! I would recommend them to any of my friends and anybody who is interested in getting any good razors.</li>
            <li> These are the type of blade that came with my straight razor, once I ran out I bought some other brand from the local beauty shop, they were terrible, I have never cut myself shaving more than with those razors. So I saw these online and bought them, they&#x27;re a hundred times better. The only thing was, I got them and they were double blades, no big deal, you just get a set of wire cutters or tin snips and cut them in half, resulting in 200 half blades. Great product, stays sharp for a few shaves.</li>
            <li> I Tried Some Of These Awhile Back And They Were Pretty Good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow I had a straight edge razor which I was using to see if Straight Razor/Edge Shaving was a workable option for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t as it turned out for it seems my skin is just too soft for the Super Sharp blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these blades are really pretty good and worked on me pretty good, So if this is your type of shaving you may wanna look into these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But do be a bit careful as &#x27;believe me&#x27; they are plenty sharp O.K.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just so you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nuff Said.&lt;br /&gt;IndianaED</li>
            <li> Use them to shape my beard. One blade is good for one use, they do OK job. Found couple of blades that were dull and unusable. All in all, price/value ratio makes them worth buying.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last long, but they are sharp while they last. This blades are useful for many applications but I only shave with them</li>
            <li> Got my order quick.  They fit perfectly into my Parker straight razor.  The edge is great and provides a really close, smooth shave!  Heads up: good blade means less cuts!  These are GREAT!</li>
            <li> Bought it last year and the box is still full. I shave about every week with a new razor. Very sharp blades.</li>
            <li> Nice blades. One out of five are dull but still usable. Not bad at all for price. I use with dovo shAvette</li>
            <li> razors are great use them on my son when I shave him with the straight razor, product was deliver fast. highly recommended</li>
            <li> Not impressed with these. I am used to Personna blades, and these just felt alot weaker and during a full face shave where I would use one Personna, I would see myself using two or more of these. Def enjoyed the fact they were pre snapped though.</li>
            <li> II get about four shaves per blade.  That makes it very economical.  They&#x27;re sharp and cut well.  Once you get the pressure and angles figured out, you won&#x27;t cut yourself very often.  I get good close shaves.</li>
            <li> Im new to this and dont really know the difference... Great as far as I can tell</li>
            <li> Super sharp. definitely buying again. solid bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> These razors are great,have been using them with great results.you will not be disappointed.i use them on a merkur had and a parker SR1.</li>
            <li> that being said, after two attempts with shaving with a straight razor i have given up.  this is now a gift to my barber in the philippines who will be very happy with it.  before you think about shaving with a straight razor, my barber in town said nothing shaves closer than a mach4 blade.  little secret, the mark 4 blades will last a long time if you only rinse the blade with cold water.  if you use hot, the micro metal pores open and rust, that is what dulls the blade faster than shaving with it.  you dont see the damage hot water does but it is there.  now that i use only cold water to rinse my blades they last about 4 times as long.  i have a very heavy beard and i also rinse the blade in rubbing alcohol for a second so that it dries extremely fast and slowing down the rust process even more.  this advice will save you money if you use these type razors.</li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp and give you a close shave.  This is a great product and brand.  I will definitely keep buying more!</li>
            <li> I ordered these by mistake.  Not the sellers fault.</li>
            <li> Cost: Even if you buy a $200 razor handle to go with these you will still be spending less than on the big name razors. Not only are they inexpensive but they do a fantastic job. I&#x27;ve had the same box of razors for over a year and a half and it still has plenty of blades to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharpness: My standard routine is twice a week shaving (unless there is some sort of big to-do on Tuesday) and I make a point to change the blade weekly. Even with 3 days of growth the blades stay sharp enough to avoid nicks, though admittedly trying to push it more than that is a bad idea. If for some reason I switch to a daily routine I still get a solid week of shaves from each blade before having to discard. Because they are razors I&#x27;ve also used them to cut all sorts of tags, shirts strings, and other random stuff (after shaving with them) and had no issues at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality: The miniature box and individual wrapping is all that is needed to keep a blade safe. They mostly sit in a medicine cabinet with stints on the counter or in a travel bag. I&#x27;ve yet to open a single blade that looks anything but brand new - no rust, dulling, or issues even though the box has gotten light water splashed on it a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other: Set aside the price for a minute and consider how much room 100 of the Quattro or Mach 3 blades would take up! This box of 100 occupies that space of about 4 of them. You&#x27;ll have room and money for all sorts of other accessories.</li>
            <li> These are incredible for the price. Each blade comes in its own wrapper, very good edge, no reason to ever go back cartridge blades again. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good Price, Helluva lot cheaper than shaving with cartridges. I have already used this a few times and I am happy with the blades.</li>
            <li> Cheap way to shave. I can say that the razors are $0.05 a peace and they last at least two shaves so no complaints!</li>
            <li> Love these blades always very sharp</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp and work fantastic. I change the blade after two shaves but they could probably last much longer.</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp.  These are among my favorites. 100 blades is a least a years supply if you switch out about every third shave. I can recommend these and they are by far cheaper and more comfortable than disposables.</li>
            <li> use them all the time</li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp amazing price. I was surprised with how well they work. I use them for my straight edge razor.</li>
            <li> So I gave up using gilette pro razors with batteries and expensive cartridges and started using blades and I never regretted buying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was sharper than those 4 blades thing and with the right patience anyone can reach their desired shaved whether if its just a simple rugged shave or a clean close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I run out of blades I&#x27;d definitely order this one and I just told most of my friends so I think they already ordered already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me and want to escape spending huge amount of money on those expensive cartridges and want to maintain the same shave that you love you should give this a try</li>
            <li> About 3 good shaves I&#x27;d say. I&#x27;m fine with these and look at the price&lt;br /&gt;Long live straight razor shaving</li>
            <li> I tried out several brands before and they all left me with ingrown hairs. These blades however give me a real close shave. I probably get about 5 solid passes before I change to the next one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades are more of a trial and error process. Make sure you try out different razors. Different skins react differently.</li>
            <li> I tried a 25 pack.  The blades were marginally sharp.  They tug and pull and do not last more than a couple of shaves.  I saved them for my vintage, open comb, Gillette razor.  Since that razor cuts real close, I found this blade worked correctly without nicks and cuts.  I prefer Astra blades that cost the about the same as this SS Shark and lasts quite a few saves.  I have not tried the Chrome Sharks but those may be better.</li>
            <li> These blades are no better or worse than others.  One thing though, they are obviously made in a non-English speaking country .  Where else would you find saloon (sic) blades instead of salon blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of shaver that uses the blade only once. I don&#x27;t even use both sides. I was spending more $$$ on Feather blades, but then realized I could buy 100 of these for less than $8. At that price, I can afford to toss these after a shave. The best part: I shave with a fresh blade every time and it&#x27;s not hurting my pockets.</li>
            <li> Pack of 100 for a couple bucks. Can&#x27;t go wrong. Nice and sharp. Work best with a lathered beard. A must have for an old fashioned shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure glad while searching the Internet that I came across these Shark razor blades. It is exactly what I was looking for. Just remember practice makes perfect, master the technique of shaving with a straight razor, and you will look forward to your next shave.</li>
            <li> 100 blades for a great price.  I&#x27;m new to straight razor shaving, but these feel very good.  I&#x27;ll buy them again!</li>
            <li> Using this while my straight is being re-honed.  Awesome product, very happy.</li>
            <li> Good for 1, maybe 2 shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through about half the box now and these are consistently sharp.  I&#x27;ll try a different set next time for comparison, but $8 for 100 shaves is pretty good I think.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed, and they last a while as well. Very sharp and they go great with my razor</li>
            <li> These blades have worked great for me, They are just has sharp and high quality as the DOVO razors that came with my razor.  Ill be buying them again when the time comes</li>
            <li> Great blades.  Made in Egypt.  Old-timey packaging is a pleasant nostalgic throwback.  Way more value for the money when compared with typical fixed razors.  Well packaged to prevent accidental cuts.  First few blades have done me well so far.  I have thick facial hair.  It regrows entirely by about 6pm.  I use these with a popular men&#x27;s shaving oil sold here on Amazon, and thus far it is the closest shave I&#x27;ve been able to get.  I</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing fancy, fit perfectly in my razor.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t asking for much.&lt;br /&gt;But they&#x27;re definitely razor blades that shave.</li>
            <li> Great item for the price</li>
            <li> These blades always show up as sharp as they can be! Works great with my Parker Shavette. If you are looking for a way to save money, then check these out and check out the Parker Barber Razors/Shavettes!</li>
            <li> These blades came with my razor and had very high reviews so I ordered them with my razor. They give a very close smooth shave and are lasting well so far, I get several shaves per blade. This is a very good, economical shave, I like much better than those jobs with ALL those blades- they&#x27;re just bulky, expensive and hard to shave with. The heads are so heavy with all those blades and the lightweight cheap plastic handle- not comfortable to hold or weighted well.</li>
            <li> very high quality straight razors. They last a very long time and much sharper than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I am new to using these style blades but I&#x27;m comfortable with personna shavette and a traditional straight razor shaving.  I got the MD Sicilian not long ago and ordered a box of these because reviews rated them high and said they were so sharp,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also picked up a box of Lord single edge blades and my razor came with a few of the Royal Red blades.  I gotta say the Shark and the Lord seemed equal in quality to me and not sharp at all, the Royal Reds were the best of the three I&#x27;ve tried so far, I&#x27;d like to get a Feather but I think for everyday barbering purposes they&#x27;re too expensive, so for now until I find a sharper blade I&#x27;m stickin with the Royal Reds.</li>
            <li> I think I got a bad box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one that was shipped to me was old, beat-up, and wrapped in enough packing tape to strip the yellow print off of the box trying to open it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got it open, the blades were individually wrapped, but all the corners of the packaging for each blade was worn and/or bent down.  This leads me to believe that the box was dropped or has been handled improperly during its storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might buy another set from a more reputable dealer where I can see it before I buy it, but that&#x27;s further down the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, I&#x27;m going to go with another vendor for my half-blades.</li>
            <li> Sharks are great blades for the money. I use these singles in my straight razor and am happy. Get two to three shaves with them, but I use them as my last pass after using a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I find that each blade lasts me about 3 days (shaving twice a day).  A great alternative to clunky cartridge blades that cost 20 bucks for 8.  This package will last me almost a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why everyone doesn&#x27;t wet shave. These little guys are incredibly sharp, and super cheap. I buy one package a year, and I don&#x27;t recycle any blades. Every since I started wet shaving, my skin has toughened up, and I no longer have any red bumps or ingrown hairs, or any sensitivities to climate changes after a shave. Why are you not buying these?</li>
            <li> Great blades exactly as described and saves your self from snapping the regular blades. Straight one blade shaver for years. All these multiple blades are a just a waste and normal marketing.&lt;br /&gt;Single blade shaving is the best way !!!</li>
            <li> I did not see that these are just half a straight edge, so unless you see the photo on the box, you might not know this is not a full straight blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bad!</li>
            <li> great shave, only once so far but a clean shave</li>
            <li> They are razors...what more can I say? They are tiny, thin, half as wide as normal razors, and they are freaking sharp. All in all, they fulfill the uses of a &amp;#34;Razor.&amp;#34; They aren&#x27;t really meant to last that long so they don&#x27;t really shave as well during the second shave and especially not during the third. So these are really a one shot deal. That&#x27;s why you buy 100 of them for $5. Thankfully the straight razors that use these things are very simple to change out so it&#x27;s not a hassle at all to change them out. Just be careful not to cut your fingers up doing it. Honestly, I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about these razors. They are the first I&#x27;ve bought and they seem to do their intended job, perfectly. Buy &#x27;em, enjoy &#x27;em, or throw &#x27;em away if you don&#x27;t. You&#x27;ll only lose $5 in the end.</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive razors. I ordered these when i first started using a shavette. Im into bodybuilding so during a calorie deficit I shave my abs and beard, i use one razor to shave my abs,beard, and beard again the next day. Shark is a good quality company</li>
            <li> Merkur Super and Shark Chrome, I can use twice each side, and they still feel pretty sharp.  Use the same side of one of these Shark Stainless blades a second time, and they feel dull.  If you&#x27;ve gotten in the habit of using blades once, and then throwing them away, then I guess these are fine, but I&#x27;d rather pay just a little bit more for the Shark Chrome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using a Merkur #33C safety razor, which might matter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one so far, so maybe the first was just a dud...  But it definitely didn&#x27;t give me the nicest or closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  First shave gave me about eight cuts and the worst razor burn I&#x27;ve ever had.  Second time I honed the blade with a strop.  It essentially got the job done, and I didn&#x27;t have near the razor burn or cuts as the first, but I&#x27;m still a bit skeptic.  Will update if other blades are better</li>
            <li> Super sharp but can&#x27;t hold an edge for more than one shave as my beard is kinda coarse.</li>
            <li> These blades are cheap, sharp half blades that fit the Dovo Shavette&#x27;s red adapter. Very solid shave with this match up.</li>
            <li> Blades appear and feel to be thicker than others. Not as sharp as I like. Didn&#x27;t cut clean like Astras or BlueBirds. Grabbed my beard pretty bad. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Great price for the amount of blades you get!</li>
            <li> I bought these upon recommendation. I was new to SE shaving, nicked myself a couple times, but on the 3rd shave I had no issues, and now I get as good of a shave as anything I got from a modern cassette razor. As long as you clean the blade after use, it&#x27;ll usually last me all week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that I bought the half blades not the DE blades where I would have the option of using a safety razor rather than a SE.</li>
            <li> These did the trick to accompany the gift straight razor I purchased.  The recipient is pleased with them. Great price for quantity.</li>
            <li> These are the best budget priced half blades I have used. They work great in my Dovo shavette, absolutely wonderful to have while on road trips.</li>
            <li> Great sharp blades excellent shave they are single time use but with 100 blades for five bucks why not use a new one</li>
            <li> These blades are great!  Very sharp and last a lot longer than I anticipated. I will continue to buy them for my Parker SRB straight razor.</li>
            <li> Husband says they are very dull, and he has cut his face to pieces using this set!  He is now back to his old razor!  What a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Very nice. I love them.</li>
            <li> These blades seem dull when new.</li>
            <li> Great product - great shave everytime.  This one pack has lasted me over a year, with plenty of blades to go still.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great blades, excellent price (much cheaper than cartridges) and can shave my facial hair off effectively for 6-7 different shaves.</li>
            <li> No complaints from my boyfriend yet!</li>
            <li> I think these are better than the Merkur German brand that sells at Art of Shaving.</li>
            <li> these are absolutely blazing sharp in a shavette.  i have heard mixed reviews on shark double edge blades but using these in a parker SR1 is like shaving with a lightsaber!  the hair almost falls off in terror hahahaha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;be advised though:  carelessness while shaving with these comes with a heavy price.  stay focused on what you&#x27;re doing or you will end up with lots of paper stuck to your face</li>
            <li> Reasonably sharp and seem well made. I can only get one shave out of each blade, 2 shaves would be nice but they seem to dull quickly on the tough stubble that passes for hair on my face&lt;br /&gt;That said, the price is so good that using a new blade every day is only pennies</li>
            <li> They are better than trying to sharping every time.&lt;br /&gt;Nice and easy.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to friends , I even bought another box</li>
            <li> Great blades and hold an edge for several shaves.  I would buy them again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Haha I am not getting ripped off paying for razors at the store anymore, $25 dollars for a pack of razors just does not make sense.  I feel these razors give me a good close shave</li>
            <li> Yep, very sharp.  I will be ordering more of these</li>
            <li> Great price! Works well with Dovo shavette!</li>
            <li> These blades work great and last several shaves.</li>
            <li> Do Not Buy This Worthless CRAP!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first blade I ever purchased, and will probably the last one. I just shaved with this blade because I had to (This is the only blade I have put in my girlfriend&#x27;s house. I do not use this crap at my place.) It is already hard to go downstroke, and almost impossible to do upstroke with this crap. You will bleed every time this blade touches your skin. For some reason, if this blade works for you, it still is not great choice for you because it dulls its sharpness so you need to change it for new one every single time. And it is still dull. This is indeed worthless crap. Do not waste your time and money and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use double edge razor, and it is so much better. If you are trying out these straight/double edge razors first time like I was, from those typical gilette ones, try double edge and you won&#x27;t regret. That is really awesome.</li>
            <li> I have been doing many razor cuts with these blades.  They are clean, and will not cut the skin of customers, if you use it correctly.  Will surely buy more of these blades, for further use when doing razor line ups, and skin fades.</li>
            <li> Use these in combination w/ my Parker SR1. They fit perfectly and I get 2-3 shaves out of each. I will NEVER go back to cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> THEY WILL NEVER RUN OUT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW DOES THIS COMPANY MAKE MONEY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice blades, maybe not the most quality (??) But it always lasts through one shave. Don&#x27;t ever reuse the blades bro you will regret it so badly. You don&#x27;t like it? They&#x27;re cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, you will NEVER RUN OUT OF THESE THINGS, I SWEAR THEY REPRODUCE IN THE BOX.</li>
            <li> Sharpest blades around from a company that does not test products on animals.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t of a very good quality.  I was hoping for something that wouldn&#x27;t tear up my face as much.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I accidentally ordered the wrong razors for my holder, but these little razors are definitely sharp and will give you a clean line up, I suppose, if you have the right holder for it.</li>
            <li> Dull quickly, but work great when sharp. Change often and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Sharp, cheap, they work fine.</li>
            <li> I purchased these blades to go with my Dovo Shavette.  Great blades, very sharp (You have to be careful on the first shave or two), and great value for 100 blades.</li>
            <li> Because of the low price, high count, and infrequence of my shaves, I use a new blade each time, so I can&#x27;t speak much for the durability of the blade, but every blade is super sharp out of the box and cuts through my facial hair as if it weren&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li> I shaved about one inch of my well soaped face with a new Shark razor blade and then it started pulling on the hair really bad, so I reapplied the shaving soap again and tried shaving again. The same thing it was pulling the facial hair so bad that it was ridiculous. Next I washed of my face and used a hot wet towel again and then used Edge shaving cream and tried shaving again. And guess what? The same thing. By this time I had five cuts on the side of my face and blood running down the side of my face, and this is normally the easy part of the face to shave. I was pissed off by now, I then finished shaving with my normal blade with no more blood loss. I had given the Shark Super Stainless blade a fair chance to shave and all I got was the shark eating my face. So unless you like blood loss and pain do not buy the Shark Super Stainless blades. I was using the Luxor Pro Master Razor Deluxe Safety Notch Barber Razor for this test from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product came in 3 days as it said ! Very happy with it! The blades are super sharp and clean. Great buy and I do recommend this product to people who cut. Will buy again when I go out again lol.</li>
            <li> As stated in the title these razors are a must have for someone (like myself) who uses cocaine on a consistent basis.  That being said I have tried other razor brands over the years, and I find these to be the best at what they do.  I would recommend these to anyone interested in using cocaine for the first time (or the 500th)!</li>
            <li> nice, but it should be thicker and sharper</li>
            <li> Great blades for my shavette. Very sharp and hold an edge for quite awhile. Great price!</li>
            <li> I buy one of these each year. These are amazing and give me the smoothest closest shave i have ever had.</li>
            <li> Bought this to accompany the barber-style straight razor I got. I don&#x27;t know how different other brands of half blade are, but I have no complaints about these. Big box (I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever run out), mad cheap, cool graphic on the front. Each blade is individually wrapped in waxy paper to prevent rust (after 10 months no blades are opening rusty). I get about 3 shaves with no discernible drop in sharpness, but I have very thin facial hair that won&#x27;t abrade the blade as much as others&#x27; will. Regardless, you can change the blade after one use or 5 depending on your desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found these to work well with any shaving cream, but prefer thicker shaving soaps applied w/ a brush. Canned stuff is very light in comparison and the blade will go over your face too quickly and the difference in resistance between hair and shaving cream can lead to slips. I like a nice even glide while cutting through soap and hair with nearly even resistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are quite strong for how thin they are and have a lot of flex. This lends them to some other applications like scraping sticker goop off of surfaces (I have never had a better tool for that than these razors! they flex to the surface and get things off in one stroke).</li>
            <li> Great blades.  They&#x27;ll last me forever (I don&#x27;t have super coarse facial hair).  When (and if) I ever run out, I&#x27;ll order these again.</li>
            <li> Blades seem to be inconsistent, once in a while you will get one that is not sufficiently sharp, most however are capable of producing a good shave (once).</li>
            <li> The sharpest razors I have used</li>
            <li> Sharp, simple, single-sided razor blades.  Use them in a shavette, and they&#x27;ll take care of your shaving needs very well.  I always get a MUCH cleaner and closer shaved with these than I did with my old electric razor.  The new technology is definitely sacrificing quality for time, I recommend these over the modern alternatives nay day.</li>
            <li> It takes about three shaves to learn well how to shave with these type of blades,,, once you do it is smooth sailing and you get very very close and smooth shaves without nicks, cuts nor rash!!!  Good shaving and it is so much cheaper!!</li>
            <li> I use razors to shave. Yes, I am a woman.  Wax and I don&#x27;t get along and I can only use depillatory on other places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading I discovered a straight razor would be a better value.  There are several hundred of these razor blades in a pack and I only use a new blade every 2 weeks (I don&#x27;t need to shave that much)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them on my legs, underarms and ahem, private area.  They can be a teeny tiny bit dull, but that&#x27;s fine for me as I do not need the sharpest blade ever (especially in areas of privacy).  I think they work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an old-fashioned type blade (of the type of old barbershops and the kind used to &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; people)  that will slice a strand of hair that is thrown over it, then I suggest you look elsewhere. That super sharp kind is scary to me I do not want to be cut as soon as I put the blade next to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Aveeno shave gel, which is thick and moisturizing and still get a close shave.</li>
            <li> After leaving the beard grow for 2-3 days, I can get 2-3 shaves out of the each blade. Good product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for some blades for a Dovo Shavette (a straight-razor styled device that holds these as replaceable blades) that my sister gave me for Christmas a while back.  The Dovo blades that came with the Shavette were great and would last me about five to seven solid shaves before they started getting noticeably dull.  The great reviews (and relatively low price) here for the Shark blades prompted me to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shark blades are good, but I was a bit disappointed overall.  In comparison with the Dovo blades, the Shark blades are thinner and go dull much quicker.  I was, at best, able to get two good shaves out of a blade.  After that, I started noticing significantly more hair tugging, and I would wind up with razor burn or other red splotchy skin irritation.  (In all fairness, I have pretty sensitive skin.)  The overall performance of the Shark blades during those shaves, while satisfactory, was still noticeably a step down from that of the Dovo blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When considering whether or not to get this, bulk value is really the main selling point.  The Shark blades are listed here as \\&quot;for Professional Barber Razors,\\&quot; and I think they would be fine inexpensive purchase for professional barbers who only need single-use blades.  But when I finally run out of these Shark blades (in about three months or so), I will definitely be trying out something else.</li>
            <li> Sharp blades, want more could you want</li>
            <li> good blades great shave</li>
            <li> Not realizing this only half of the Double-Edge, I was surprised this type ever existed. They are ok for saloon use where it is disposed after one time use. Again you could use it over a few times if it is personal razor. Maybe this half blade not too bad because you are forced to use until not good any more. With a double-edge you do not know if you have overused side side and not the other.</li>
            <li> Sharp.  This is my first time using a straight edge so had a couple of nicks initially.  Recommend you try using on an apple or orange before you use on your face.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Shark razors to go along with the Parker SR1 Stainless Steel Straight Edge Razor. In terms of these razors working in combination with this injectable straight razor, I think they present a very good value. As other reviews have mentioned, these Shark injectables will dull pretty quickly. I have a medium think beard and I have been using them for two shaves before switching out, but I could see getting 3 or 4 shaves out of them if want to push it. But since the razors or so affordable, why not switch them out? For the last 10 years I have been using the FROMM injectable &amp;#34;hair shaper&amp;#34; which is intended really more for Salon use rather than a straight razor shave. The FROMM razors definitely last much longer and are another great option, but because they cost quite a bit more, I think the Shark razors are a better value and I&#x27;m ultimately glad I made the switch. If you&#x27;re a safety razor guy and you&#x27;re considering this injectable straight razor combo, go for it! But read up on it first. If you invest in a good badger hair brush, mug and mug shave soap (High quality, high glycerin soap - NOT Williams - eBay has tons of home made shave soaps that are excellent) and learn the proper way to straight shave, you&#x27;ll be glad you switched. Always heat the beard with lots of hot water (showering first is best), learn how to make a proper mug and brush lather, wet the beard, apply lather, pull the skin tight and shave in the direction AWAY from your hand (in the direction your beard grows) using minimal pressure in short strokes. Apply a PH neutral aftershave. Then look in the mirror at your baby&#x27;s butt smooth face and congratulate yourself for not flushing 5 bucks down the drain on a single stupid, vibrating, 8-bladed Gillette POS.</li>
            <li> These blades work well for the money. I never try to use one of them for more than a single shaving session, but they work just fine in my razor and get the job done.</li>
            <li> I have both these and the derby half blades.  These are sharper and do a great job.  My shavette has a couple of nubs on it to help align these blades and I had to work these for a bit to get them to seat properly whereas the derby blades slipped right in.  Even with that little glitch these still provide a better shave.</li>
            <li> Most people say they get 7 shaves out of each blade but I only get 2 or 3 before it becomes dull or nicked. Though at 9 cents a blade that is still much cheaper than the typical multi-blade cartridges for disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;Very sharp, when new out of the box. Gives a good close shave.</li>
            <li> Keep these away from your chilluns cause&#x27; they could carve your Thanksgiving turkey! Welcome to a brand of blades that does the job without adding the luxury to your waistline! These blades are the cats butt!</li>
            <li> I use with my straight edge razor and they last. Can not beat the price Will order some more if I am still alive when I run out.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;ll get an extremely sharp blade that will make shaving a snap, other times it feels like I&#x27;m pulling the hair out myself. It&#x27;s about half and half, but I overall I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> almost a lifetime supply</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these razors. They are extremely sharp and my wife immediately noticed the difference in closeness. I will never go back to my previous brand. Razor shark:)</li>
            <li> I tried a cheap straight razor from Sally&#x27;s before trying this and it tore my face up. Tried this and it&#x27;s a night and day difference it light smooth and feels great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great shave now all I need is a nice case and brush set. Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Darby, Darco + Shark blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shark is without a doubt the sharper of the three. I don&#x27;t use them to shave my entire face, more to outline and edge the lines on my beard/goatee/mustache, and these really do an impeccable job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine on Ebay as they were better priced; try them you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> First off I didn&#x27;t know these were half blades when I ordered them. I used them for the first time this morning and they were a huge disappointment.  I have a thick beard and it took several passes to get the close shave I&#x27;m used to.  I will probably not use these unless I run out of my other blades.</li>
            <li> Not really sure about the blades because I got these with a Dreadnought Shavette .&lt;br /&gt;The blades may work better in a different razor or with a different shaving soap and or cream .</li>
            <li> Fit the Parker well, the only negative I observed was, I thought they would stay sharper a little longer.  But, in the old days I used a DE safety razor and there were two blades as opposed to one................so, they may be the same if you double my uses.</li>
            <li> Awesome blades, Super sharp and a great value! Work great in my shavette. I&#x27;m Sticking with these from now on.</li>
            <li> great price for plenty blades.  You can throw the used ones away in the same wax paper it comes in to prevent trash bag tear, etc.  Quite sharp.</li>
            <li> Yep...These are sharp</li>
            <li> not bad, they tug a little bit if you ask me.  ive been using unbranded double edge razors prior to this and have yet to find better.  i might buy these again</li>
            <li> my go to blade i use these and derby</li>
            <li> As others have said, the quality is very hit or miss. I tried these with a Dovo shavette and the shave is quite a bit worse than Dovo blade, even when it&#x27;s good. I also shave with a traditional 5/8&amp;#34; (I bought the Shavette for those mornings where you just don&#x27;t want to strop) and using that as a reference point, the Dovo blades were about 80% as pleasant as a real straight and these blades vary from 40-70%. Unfortunately the variation kind of makes me dread seeing if I am going to get a good shave or a blowtorched face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure I&#x27;d get these again, a little more $$ for more consistent quality is probably worth it.</li>
            <li> They are a lot for the money and very sharp..however I have some others that are actually sharper and hold an edgwe a little longer..These will last me a long time</li>
            <li> cant beat 100 blades for $5 I bought a dovo razor for the red insert, the black insert if for full size razors, but I haven&#x27;t used these, I&#x27;ve read good things! the half blades that some with the dovo are a little less par then the full size ones they came with.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my new straight edge that I got recently. I was expecting something thicker but these are paper thin. So far the three I&#x27;ve opened (mostly to check them out) have been incredibly sharp though. All in all despite the flimsy feel they do their job very well. 5/5</li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery I highly recommend vender. Got tired of 30 dollars from replacement blades from my other shaver. Went back to old school.  Sometimes simpler the better.</li>
            <li> Love using these they leave me with a very close shave and so far I haven&#x27;t found any issues with it.</li>
            <li> Only single use, depending on your beard might need to use two per shave. Either way you got a deal</li>
            <li> The product works great but I was shipped the 100 pack, not the 120 pack as pictured. It is deceiving so beware of what you will be getting when you order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these blades for the last year and I love them.  They&#x27;re great for up to two shaves but I usually throw them away after one.  I bought them because all the two and three blade disposables caused me ingrown hair and razor bumps; not to mention expensive for one time use.  After getting use to a straight razor, no more ingrown hairs or razor bumps.</li>
            <li> As described As described by the manufacturer. reviewing an object is a waste of time when there is a required amount of words.</li>
            <li> These shark blades are very sharp and don&#x27;t have any kinks in them. Works great 5***** every time. I would definitely purchase these again.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp. Box is small so you can lose it. The wrapper from the new blades works great to dispose of the old</li>
            <li> Cuts the hair.  Cuts it good.  Clean and fine.  No problems.  Cuts it.  It&#x27;s a blade.  Lasts long.  Lasts longer than long.  (Filled up my two more words).</li>
            <li> These are super sharp, and I can use them for a couple weeks before I need to change them. They are also good for other uses as long as you&#x27;re careful.</li>
            <li> Great price for so many blades. Ideal for barbers, very sharp (not Winston blades but up to par). Big plus these bad boys come pre split and individually wrapped. Cheaper than buying disposal razors if your personal use, comes out to about 12cents a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One blade can be used for two (personal) shaves before dulling down. Be careful, like I said they are sharp</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
            <li> Great product. It&#x27;s sharp and cuts great. I luv it.</li>
            <li> Wow super fast shipping, and was exactly as described. No issues with anything, smoothest experience I have had.</li>
            <li> Product is as described and a great price. Great product top of the line.  I would reccomend this item to others. Product is as described and a great price. Great product top of the line.  I would reccomend this item to others.</li>
            <li> Nice blades at a nice price, a heack of a lot cheaper then those yuppie 4 bladed razors that cost $20 plus bucks for 4 or so blades. With a little pratice (take your time and watch youtube videos) you will be happy you gave it a try. Just be patient at first. When the blades dull you&#x27;ll know during the first pull, some beard oil helps also and a good shaving soap ( dont go cheap nere) I now get the best shave I ever had.</li>
            <li> These blades are NOT sharp. They are great starter blades for anyone trying to learn wet shaving, but very quickly you should move on. I used these in my Parker Shavette when I first started to learn wet shaving. I have a really thick beard and these were so dull that I would have to use more force to shave and this resulted in more nicks and cuts (ouch!). When I switched over to much sharper and higher quality blades I quickly noticed the difference and since I needed less pressure to shave I had less irritation, cuts and a closer shave over all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reason I give them 2 stars instead of 1 is because they give you SOOO many in comparison to other blades at the same price level, so if you’re looking for quantity over quality these are the way to go. However, for noobs to wet shaving and veterans alike I urge you to look elsewhere as most of these will just end up not being used and sit in your medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> good price for beginners razors</li>
            <li> These things sliced up my face like it&#x27;s a Thanksgiving turkey.  Not just from lack of experience - for some reason these seems to be really aggressive and slice into bumps on my face.  Not using these anymore.</li>
            <li> poor quality blade would not give me a close shave .</li>
            <li> The razor blades were what was required for my razor.  They were delivered in a very timelymanner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my DE razor since the middle of December and it came with 5 Shark blades. I just opened the 5th today and probably could have kept the first two a little longer and stretched this to June. These blades might start to rust before I use them all.</li>
            <li> These razors are amazing. You get a very close shave with these. While I&#x27;ll admit there&#x27;s a learning curve that comes with it once you get the hang of it you will enjoy the closeness of the shave without having to go to the barber.</li>
            <li> Already have some shark blades, so , have not opened the packages..No more comments</li>
            <li> Owe.  Will not use these again...  unless I am preparing someone for waterboarding afterwards.  I am not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> Small enough package that it went right into my shower kit without having to remove all the excess packaging and waste.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize these were the short, half-sized ones when I ordered, but that&#x27;s my fault. They are exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to be and do a great job at shaving. nice individually wrapped and ready to be used. They do seem to be very sharp as I would expect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades for over 3 months now and I still have more than half the box. I shave every 4 days and it is important for me to have a razor sharp blade when I shave. Besides, it makes shaving very interesting with the classic straight razor style.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for about 2-3 months shaving 2-3 times per week.I ususally use one blade per shave. once I got used to shaving with a straight edge I stopped nicking myself. The only thing is i wish the ends of the blades were rounded a bit more.</li>
            <li> I get one shave out of each razor.  Not worth it.  The 10 for a dollar BiC knock off razors last me for at least 3-4 shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just picked up a Parker  SR1 stainless steel straight edge razor. The razor came with five blades. For what little extra it cost I picked up a box of a hundred. With that I also picked up a Van Der Hagen premium shave set &amp;#34;soap, bowl,and brush&amp;#34; I would recommend all to anyone looking for a very close shave.</li>
            <li> To me, this is a way better solution than honing / stropping a straight edge razor.  They come much sharper than I could ever get my &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; straight, they go in quick (I use a Parker SR1) and hold their edge fine for 3 passes across my thick stubble.  I will order again when I run out</li>
            <li> I bought these to use in my shavette, and they get my face nice and smooth. Just practice your blade technique, because they&#x27;ll cut right through your skin as well if you&#x27;re not careful! I used one to cut off some troublesome callouses, and it just whizzed right through them like butter.</li>
            <li> It is sharp and nice, I recommend it but I still need to practice shaving more and more to avoid cuts.</li>
            <li> Good quality blades, about 8 cents a piece. This will last me at least 6 months. If  I bought 2 packs of 240, then I could change my blade every-day for the entire year, and still be saving over $100 a year (VS Gillette replacement blades). I decided to start shaving with a straight razor because I heard it was more cost-effective, and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed. CAUTION!!!! these little guys are incredibly sharp; it is extremely easy to badly cut yourself if you don&#x27;t pay attention to what you are doing. There is a learning curve to the shaving, but as long as you lather up well, even if you have sensitive skin like me, you can shave just as close as any other razor, with minimal scarring.</li>
            <li> Bought this brand because I heard it was the best and it came with my straight razor. I was not disappointed because it is so nice and sharp, gives a super smooth cut.</li>
            <li> Ok I have to be honest , idk if its my hair type but these blades leave me with cuts all over my face it looks like I was attacked by a cat. They are sharp as heck though, one time the blade went through the folded towel and cut my finger on the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work well if you have short face hair, if you haven&#x27;t shaved for a day (like me) they never quite get the hair short, leaves you with stubble all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving takes about 30 minutes, unlike its 5 minute super razors they sell today.</li>
            <li> The box is the size of a box of matches.  It has 100 of the sharpest razors you&#x27;ll ever find in it.  I use the parker straight razor. These are so sharp that I have never cut myself shaving with them.  Just like with knives, people get cut using dull edges.  No problem here though. :-)</li>
            <li> good blades and packed nicely </li>
            <li> These blades are sharp and last a long time.  I keep them in my bath room and they have not rusted or gone dull when I pull out a new one it is ready to go.</li>
            <li> Do not buy it&#x27;s the worst razor I&#x27;ve ever tried to use</li>
            <li> Its hard to get used to new things but after learning how to shave with a straight  edge i will never go back to new fancy razors&lt;br /&gt;Shark makes a product that last multiple shaves at a very economical price haven&#x27;t bought a new pack since late 2011 and now its early 2013</li>
            <li> THE SAME RATING OF THE ABOVE GOES WITH THIS TOO.  GOOD JOB&lt;br /&gt;mY HUSBAND WAS SO GLAD THAT ORDERED THIS FOR HIM.  CAME ON TIME AND WELL PACKED</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s it, just OK.  I&#x27;ll stick with my Wilkinson blades next time.  I can get at least about two good shaves with my Wilkinson blades.</li>
            <li> They sent me full razor blades instead of half razor blades.  No returns allowed?  Send me the right product next time!</li>
            <li> Can use the same blade for over 2 months. The blades are extremely sharp and get cut easily.</li>
            <li> economical and close shave. i&#x27;d recommend it. $.06 per blade for 2-3 shaves.</li>
            <li> Great blades for the price.</li>
            <li> Works well with the Parker SR1 Stainless Steel Straight Edge Razor I purchased here on Amazon as well!!&lt;br /&gt;I have VERY sensitive skin so I change the blades after EVERY shave even though I&#x27;m the only one that uses this razor. No bumps or irritation whatsoever!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!!</li>
            <li> If you use a compatible straight razor, these blades are perfect.  Easy to change and they hold securely in my razor for a very close shave.</li>
            <li> These are really cheap and nice and sharp.  I have a pretty strong beard and haven&#x27;t had any issues while using these.  Even if you have to go through a lot of beard, you can always switch it out because they are so cheap.</li>
            <li> A great product,  I&#x27;m a happy barber in Pa. I have been buying these blades on the regular for about 3 months now &amp; love the product.</li>
            <li> Bought these blades because I got tired of paying way too much at the local grocery for 8 \\&quot;halves\\&quot;. Turns out these are much better than the ones I was using! Great deal and gives a close shave. Definitely sticking with Shark</li>
            <li> Great amount of spares. Nice and sharp. Helps with the cleanup of ones face.Definitely economical as well. Worth your time.</li>
            <li> Shark razor blades are an exceptional value and will last you a long time because you don&#x27;t have to change them out every other shave.</li>
            <li> Good Deal. Good Product. Good Store.</li>
            <li> I like these blades a lot, especially for the amount you get for the price. I&#x27;m not sure if I just occasionally have a bad day while shaving, or if some of the blades are just a bit off; but there occasionally seems to be some problems. Definitely worth the buy, though. They come nicely individually packaged and hold up well.</li>
            <li> My second time buying these, these are excellent razors. I use them on a one-time use basis and trash each blade. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using these blades more than twice per blade as it tends to get dull after the first use. These cut very nicely and better than any razor I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ve used electrics razors, both the foil and regular razors and I find that none of them shave better and more closer than these blades. Highly recommend and I will most likely be purchasing more next year.</li>
            <li> Good for a close shave, blades are pretty standard, none were bent or chipped so far, which is nice. They should fit most straight razors that use disposable blades and are WAY cheaper than standard razors.</li>
            <li> as advertised, just what i expected.  sharp, smooth, and eliminates nicks and cuts.  great price too for 100 blades, can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> These are sharp but not super sharp. I have taken up double-edged safety razor shaving instead so I haven&#x27;t used these much. They are nice though and a good price.</li>
            <li> only problem is that some are not sharp.</li>
            <li> Decent shave, but I have relatively thick hair so it feels like I&#x27;m peeling the skin from my face.</li>
            <li> Great disposable straight razor blades</li>
            <li> Fast delivery  no problems  at all ty</li>
            <li> Nowadays, when you buy razors they are very expensive and do not last very long. Since I started using a straight razor I no longer have to spend a lot of money to get that clean shaven look.The blades are very sharp where 2 passes can get you a barber like finish. This is a great purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the quality and sharpness of the shark brand of blades.  They are sharp and last for multiple shaves.  Great for anyone with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> Saved a ton by using these</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp. What else is required of them that I should have to comment more? Well, they&#x27;re securely packaged as well.</li>
            <li> Really sharp shaving blades. They are each individually wrapped, don&#x27;t rust, and work just like they are supposed to. They work well, what else can I say?</li>
            <li> I have very coarse facial hair so i use these as a single use blade and they work amazing. With 120 blades per box, a box cost at just over $7 and me only shaving every other day it doesn&#x27;t bother me to use them once per shave. I also use them to shave my head. When paired with any Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream i have never gotten even a bit of irritation, even having very sensitive skin. I would highly recommend these blades as a single use blade.</li>
            <li> These are great. I&#x27;ve used about 15 blades so far and I&#x27;ve only had one blade that was dull out of the wrapper. I have to switch them out every couple of days since the blades dull after a couple of full shaves. It&#x27;s a wonderful product. Amazing for the price and the packaging is tight and well made.</li>
            <li> 5 stars on these blades</li>
            <li> A few cuts here but it was worth it thanks</li>
            <li> Awesome blades, can&#x27;t beat the price and shipping.</li>
            <li> Great value, great blades, im not even halfway thru done with them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a barber for a living and used these blades to shave customers with and I think they&#x27;re pretty horrible. They are inconsistent in quality and they seem dull right out of the box. I would never buy these again.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product should speak for itself, but since it&#x27;s not alive I&#x27;ll type the review for it, lol.  The Diamond Edge Professional Straight Razor works great with these blades of great price and durability. Sorry I can&#x27;t give more of a review but give me a break it&#x27;s a box of straight edge razors how much is there to review about it honestly other than the price is right, no pun intended :) .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  plenty &#x27;o&#x27; shaves,&lt;br /&gt;  a fan of Amazon ◴_◶</li>
            <li> These blades come packed very neat, wrapped individually. The price is very reasonable.  Though my biggest complaint is  inconsistent sharpness. I&#x27;ve put a new blade in that&#x27; felt more dull than the one I just took out.  I only use the same blade two shaves also. Never nicks or cuts my  face for me. I would not recommend do to the inconsistent sharpness.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! No complaints here!!!</li>
            <li> Very good razors, very, very sharp, and they last for a couple shaves on my really tough beard. I will buy more of these when I run out.</li>
            <li> Great deal. Sharp blades.</li>
            <li> These came with my razor that I bought on here, now for sensitive skin have the aftershave ready, I was getting cut quite a bit, these suckers are SHARP!!! But at that if your thicker skinned there great, I&#x27;ve shaved a couple friends with these and they did amazing, so to each his own, but like I said if you have sensitive skin get the derby, your face will thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a moustache since my 1969 arrival in Vietnam as a young infantry officer.  The problem that I&#x27;ve always had in keeping my &#x27;stache neat was shaving the 1/4&amp;#34; above my upper lip, every third day.  Regular dual-edged blades are unwieldy and dangerous --  I&#x27;ve sliced my fingers as well as my upper lip numerous times over the years.  But the problem is now solved with the slimmer more deftly manageable Shark blades, which I have recently discovered.  Thank you Shark!</li>
