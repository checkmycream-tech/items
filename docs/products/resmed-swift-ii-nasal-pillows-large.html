            <li>This is a good item and does what it is advertised to do.  </li>
            <li>Perfect fit for my cpap.</li>
            <li>This was a very good nasal pillow at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Good fit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m breathing better already.  </li>
            <li>excellent price compared to other on-line outlets</li>
            <li>comfortable fit, works well</li>
            <li>Provides comfort while delivering a secure fit.  </li>
            <li>This is a great replacement part for something you want to have renewed regularly.  </li>
            <li>, the replacement fit and does what it was designed to do.</li>
            <li>Given the volume of these that are, or should, used in the captive market of CPAP users, a lower price and volume packaging would be appropriate for this item.  </li>
            <li>They were an equal replacement for the existing ones...at a reasonable price....certainly better than buying from a local outfit that charges Medicare much more for it.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you have the Swift II if buying this one, or else you will need to get the Swift II holder as it does not fit in the original Swift.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to find usually at reasonable prices</li>
            <li>Keep them clean, but they seem to leak sooner rather than later requiring replacement again.</li>
            <li>I can tell you it is very comfortable and less confining.</li>
            <li>Valuable savings over DME company prices for those of us with high deductibles or- in my case-</li>
            <li>This part seems to be the only real wear item on the mask.</li>
            <li>Just right; At first I had medium which was too small</li>
            <li>The only reason I give it three stars instead of five is that the price per unit is high.  </li>

            <li> comfortable fit, works well</li>
            <li> Keep them clean, but they seem to leak sooner rather than later requiring replacement again.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong item and the shipper noticed that the items were not all for the same type of machine, so they contacted within 24 hours of my order, sent pictures of what they thought I might need and what I actually ordered, and I was able to correct my order and still receive it in very short time frame.  Excellent service.</li>
            <li> This was a very good nasal pillow at a very reasonable price.  I&#x27;m breathing better already.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product !</li>
            <li> This part is usually found in a kit and Amazon was the only place I found where you could purchase just a single pillow instead of the whole kit.</li>
            <li> They were an equal replacement for the existing ones...at a reasonable price....certainly better than buying from a local outfit that charges Medicare much more for it.</li>
            <li> Wrong part and cannot return. Cannot tell if part is correct without opening it. If it is opened it cannot be returned....Catch 22</li>
            <li> Hubby loves this and also loves the price!</li>
            <li> This is a good item and does what it is advertised to do.  The only reason I give it three stars instead of five is that the price per unit is high.  Given the volume of these that are, or should, used in the captive market of CPAP users, a lower price and volume packaging would be appropriate for this item.  It is probable that the bulk of the seller&#x27;s cost in this item is the packaging and handling; volume packaging would help both the seller and the purchaser.</li>
            <li> Just like the ones I get from my CPAP supplier - but cheaper</li>
            <li> Just right; At first I had medium which was too small</li>
            <li> It is everything that it should be.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Provides comfort while delivering a secure fit.  Have used the device for 4-5 years and would not change to another. Can wear glasses and change the sleeping positions without trouble.</li>
            <li> Have not yet died in sleep.</li>
            <li> Good fit. Quality material. I would give it five stars if not for the price.</li>
            <li> excellent price compared to other on-line outlets&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to find usually at reasonable prices&lt;br /&gt;required product for ResMed Swift 11 CPAC</li>
            <li> Great. Received in a very short time, too.</li>
            <li> This part seems to be the only real wear item on the mask. I replace these every 6 months and have had no issues with air leakage. This item worked great and no issues.</li>
            <li> Fully compatible, affordable replacement.</li>
            <li> The rubber is too soft and thin, this replacement pillow is completely useless as it bends too much and there is considerable air leakage.  Do not buy, beware, I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This is a great replacement part for something you want to have renewed regularly.  Make sure that you have the Swift II if buying this one, or else you will need to get the Swift II holder as it does not fit in the original Swift.  This was my mistake so I can&#x27;t fault the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking of switching from face mask to nasal pillows I can tell you it is very comfortable and less confining.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my cpap. Arrived earlier than expected. Valuable savings over DME company prices for those of us with high deductibles or- in my case- no DME coverage at all on our insurance.</li>
            <li> What can I say?, the replacement fit and does what it was designed to do.</li>
