            <li>Afterwards, I use the Amlactin lotion and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li>I never thought I needed to use it on my face because I use the Clarisonic as well as weekly at-home glycolic acid peels, which I thought did a great job of exfoliating my skin.</li>

            <li>Very interesting</li>
            <li>Wanted to really love it, but it just wasn&#x27;t very effective.</li>
            <li>Way better than anything the dermatologists can do for you (and cheaper)!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this exfoliator!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it for my feet!  </li>
            <li>Best exfoliator every my skin is so smooth and soft after using this on my arms best investment</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE my Le Edge!</li>
            <li>but I must confess I love it!</li>
            <li>I brought it in the shower to use when my legs are hot and my skin is softened(the best time to exfoliate)</li>
            <li>Works great, easy to use, love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited to have found this!</li>
            <li>I use this exclusively on callouses and it works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>The oil makes a huge difference, they should sell it paired together, lol.</li>
            <li>It is amazing</li>
            <li>OMG this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>It feels amazing.</li>
            <li>This is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I am someone who has plenty of skin to exfoliate and was expecting a nice cleaning tool.  </li>
            <li>you can visibly see how effective this is.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice exfoliator.</li>
            <li>Find a good lotion or cream to apply afterwards for better effect.</li>
            <li>but here&#x27;s what I did!&lt;br /&gt;I started off by making my own lactic acid lotion.</li>
            <li>This kind of hurts.  </li>
            <li>Then I get in the shower and let the steam/hot water warm up the oil for a minute.</li>
            <li>It does make my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li>One thing, when used on my lower legs/shins, I do seem to get a nice shine after shaving/lotioning.</li>
            <li>Now I have to buy my husband his own</li>
            <li>product is cheap, easy to use, and incredibly efficient.  </li>
            <li>This product is cheap, easy to use, and incredibly efficient.  </li>
            <li>With this my face gets super smooth and my foundation is flawless.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it everywhere including face and neck and it has worked beautifully from the first time I used it.    </li>
            <li>I like this product a lot, although I&#x27;ve had to spend a bit of time figuring out how to use it most effectively.  </li>
            <li>This is okay, but won&#x27;t be effective tbh.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work great the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;s a very  cheaply made window scraper for the Barbi corvette.  </li>
            <li>My face feels and looks very smooth.  </li>
            <li>keep finding new places to use it and the thing is freakin&#x27; incredible.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I have pretty good skin</li>
            <li>This one was okay.</li>
            <li>okay, i was hoping it would work better</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s even more amazing is how smooth it makes your skin.</li>
            <li>As a huge nerd, I remembered hearing about Strigils (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strigil), or metal tools which were popular during Roman times for skin cleaning.  </li>
            <li>for most of my life and have tried many things to combat this issue.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li>Time consuming Go through a lot more soap  </li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>and I really love using it.    </li>
            <li>My foot is smoother now and I can&#x27;t wait to use it more and more.</li>
            <li>This exfoliates better than any scrub, most of which have oils, or the exfoliating gloves.  </li>
            <li>I love using it all over my feet in the shower - tops, sides, bottoms, backs, and watching the skin slough</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t stop touching my skin -</li>
            <li>Basically, most of my life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m most concerned about.</li>
            <li>I put that on my skin to soften it more, just for the laughs at that point.</li>
            <li>and it acted more like a squeegee.</li>
            <li>I continue along dragging and dragging, getting more and more skin.</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>10 minutes after that, EVEN BETTER.</li>
            <li>All of this on top of the fact that it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>and I think I might even have more keratosis.</li>
            <li>:) hope this helps someone out.</li>
            <li>This keeps them smooth between pedicures, &amp; is way more effective than those cheese-grater types of exfoliators.</li>
            <li>If you know what I&#x27;m talking about, you&#x27;ll love this thing and wonder how you lived without it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think my skin felt smoother or looked better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been getting nearly as many as I used to</li>
            <li>and it makes me feel so much more confident.</li>
            <li>It actually works and works great!!!!!</li>
            <li>and my forhead is nice and smooth</li>
            <li>My treatment products work so much better with a now cleaner and de-clogged skin.  </li>
            <li>I love Le Edge.</li>
            <li>short, I think this is a great exfoliation tool to supplement any skincare routine and prevent ingrown hairs from shaving!</li>
            <li>This is better for my face than my clarisonic brush.</li>
            <li>Was hoping for better results.</li>
            <li>Will update, after use more</li>
            <li>I cannot stop touching my face.</li>
            <li>Must be shared :)</li>
            <li>For best results, you have to use it the second you get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>Love it for our face in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Love it for my daughter&#x27;s KP.  </li>
            <li>Works fantastic in almost any area!</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>I received it before the estimated date...which I love..</li>
            <li>I love love love it.</li>
            <li>IT DOES ANY MORE THAN MY LOOFA GLOVE?</li>
            <li>Used correctly it should never be able to cut you.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with Le Edge.</li>
            <li>Better than a pumice stone.</li>
            <li>My KP looked so much better</li>
            <li>I used the exfoliator on my legs (takes 1 or 2 mins) before shaving, and my legs are FINALLY smooth!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes I will put massage oil on before a shower, to better lift out dirt, then wash it off with soap in the shower.</li>
            <li>It is a very useful tool that I honestly can&#x27;t do without!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I will this time because I think this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>For those who did not have a good result, I suggest that you soak in the tub with oil first.  </li>
            <li>For those who did not have a good result, I suggest that you soak in the tub with oil first.  </li>
            <li>Also use it for blackheads on my face and it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin or wear lotion/creams, this is perfect for you.</li>
            <li>Took layers of makeup off my neck that I thought had been clean when I washed my face!</li>
            <li>Best used in shower when body is wet or use oil as lubricant.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it can be used over and over and takes minimal time.  </li>
            <li>Its not the most magical thing ever, but its not bad</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone because chances are, you&#x27;re going to notice a difference and for the price, it&#x27;s sooo worth it! :)</li>
            <li>Easy once you get the hang of it</li>
            <li>Works well if you have skin that builds up easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to get over zealous once you start seeing some skin come off.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best item I have ever had for exfoliation.</li>
            <li>As another reviewer mentioned on her excellent review, I think that OIL makes this work better as I definitely notice it works much more effectively on naturally oilier areas of my skin.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to use a shaving cream because the blade glides on so easily and precisely after I use this.</li>
            <li>and I love that its so easy to use and its fast!!  </li>
            <li>Even when you don&#x27;t have much to exfoliate your skin still becomes soooooo smooth!!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful easy to use product that peeled off my dead skin cells with ease.  </li>
            <li>This little tool is amazing!!!</li>
            <li>This little scraper works great!</li>
            <li>This little gadget exfoliates excellently.</li>
            <li>I cannot stress how awesome this little gadget it.  </li>
            <li>If you buy it only for callouses, you&#x27;ll be extremely happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>But if I start by taking a warm/hot bath for 15 minutes and then use it -- it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I recommend everyone to use LeEdge if you want smooth skin.</li>
            <li>and my arms feel perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li>Eh, kind of a bother to scrape the whole body.  </li>
            <li>and I use it lightly to help my cream penetrate deeper to my skin.</li>
            <li>This has been great to use on my face and upper arms.  </li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job getting rid of excess skin, dirt, lotions, etc.</li>
            <li>I paid $10.04 for this in December 2014 and that was about $5 more than it was worth.  </li>
            <li>Those are free and will work just as well.  </li>
            <li>Also noticed the skin on my arms are SO smooth</li>
            <li>Now, I know I&#x27;ll never have perfectly smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I found it most useful around my knees and the backs of my arms.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just wash/exfoilate more than most, but this product really did nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li>But it does great things on the soles of my feet, I love it for that, just not much else.</li>
            <li>and my arms were just so surprisingly soft and haven&#x27;t looked this good in years.</li>
            <li>Love using this with the Prolinc heel eliminator it makes callus heels scrap right off.</li>
            <li>Suddenly this thing was VERY effective....</li>
            <li>Awesome little gadget!</li>
            <li>According to other positive reviewers it works, but from my experience it wasn&#x27;t as good as a good scrub with a loofah or washcloth.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t expect it to do such an amazing job!</li>
            <li>and I am excited to add this to my skin care</li>
            <li>/&gt;***I bought this one on Amazon as a replacement for my original that I lost.</li>
            <li>I think this originally sold for about $30</li>
            <li>I am excited to see how my skin looks as I incorporate this into my skincare/KP treatment routine.</li>
            <li>helps clear the skin more quickly!!</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s kind of gross to see, I love that I can see the stuff that&#x27;s being removed.</li>
            <li>I used it after being in a warm shower for about 8 minutes and sure enough, there was a lot of build up on the blade.</li>
            <li>I like to keep a clean shower</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did cut my finger one time when I was attempting to clean it after using it.</li>
            <li>Gets the pores clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel clean anymore unless I use this product.</li>
            <li>At such a great price, I figured it was worth a shot to use on my legs before I shave.  </li>
            <li>I am certain others will love this product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see this as doing anything special at all.  </li>
            <li>I bought this through a special on Groupon.  </li>
            <li>I must be a wimp or not using it right!</li>
            <li>It is super easy to clean, it just rinses right off.</li>
            <li>Works best if you take bath/shower first (for dead skin to soften up) and use this at the end of your bathing time.</li>
            <li>This works best for people with thick, oily skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, and it felt good.  </li>
            <li>It might be good for in-grown hair on hands and legs (not thicker hairs) only.</li>
            <li>This is an interesting tool I am using in my whole body exfoliation routine.</li>
            <li>I thought I was going to love this item from all the reviews I saw, but really it&#x27;s just so-so.</li>
            <li>I did this after using my beloved facial scrub.</li>
            <li>my Winter skin will be the true test, but I think it&#x27;s a winner</li>
            <li>I showered for about 10 minutes and got nice and soft and started scraping.</li>
            <li>As long as you hold it at the right angle and wait until your skin has softened in the shower/bath, it works great.</li>
            <li>This is my first ever review on Amazon, and I did this just because I feel so strongly about this product.  </li>
            <li>This is my first ever review on Amazon, and I did this just because I feel so strongly about this product.  </li>
            <li>use this primarily on my arms, to help with KP, and I&#x27;m happy with the results I&#x27;m seeing when I use it after steaming my skin for a little while.  </li>
            <li>the exfoliator arrived, and I went about my usual bathing routine (which mirrors how the Romans used it, and I think this is KEY to getting the best results): soaking for 10 minutes in a warm bath with a couple tablespoons of coconut oil, then exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>In looking at other reviews, it looks like it may not work for everyone, but I&#x27;ve been happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that I don&#x27;t have to purchase any other body scrubs ever again.</li>
            <li>This tool is great for preparing bikini line  and all other areas for shaving.</li>
            <li>I purchased it after reading all the other great reviews on how it helped kp</li>
            <li>This is great sometimes and so-so other times.</li>
            <li>The metal part appeared to be as fresh and clean as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick to use in the shower.</li>
            <li>Well, then lucky you, you probably don&#x27;t need this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for the next which is a much forgotten place for exfoliation.</li>
            <li>However, this helps tremendously.</li>
            <li>I agree with the comments about using a light oil on your skin first.</li>
            <li>Also, the design is sturdy and seems like it&#x27;ll be good for a long time.</li>
            <li>Great product to clean dead cells off.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve always had mild keratosis pilaris (KP), but had pretty much given up on it getting better.  </li>
            <li>Have tried managing my feet with many products, this by far is the best and keeps it simple enough that I use it every time I bathe.  </li>
            <li>I love trying new skincare products, so I couldn&#x27;t resist this one.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these on a whim, and just came back to order two more as backups!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d had the original one for years, &amp; it continued to work just as well as the day I first received it in the mail.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I was so excited.</li>
            <li>And my feet are pretty now!</li>
            <li>What a great little tool.</li>
            <li>My skin definitely feels nice after I use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t looking for it, but it cropped up as a suggestion, and I thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>For skin exfoliating its not that useful.</li>
            <li>Works great but its kind of gross seeing all the dead skin you can get.</li>
            <li>I need you guys to understand that I have the most sensitive, itchy skin in the world</li>
            <li>This thing is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>After having this for over a year, I just didn&#x27;t consider it that useful and threw it out.</li>
            <li>The exfoliator is smaller than I expected but seems to be the perfect size for arms and legs.</li>
            <li>I would also think it would be useful as part of the treatment for keratosis pilaris.  </li>
            <li>It has a distinct smell of mildew though there&#x27;s no sign of mold anywhere.</li>
            <li>Im sensitive to most.</li>
            <li>Scraped off more skin than I expected this tool would be able to remove.</li>
            <li>&quot; so I&#x27;ve never been able to get a smooth shave in virtually my entire life.  </li>
            <li>left me feeling very clean and exfoliated!</li>
            <li>As another reviewer suggested, this tool is super effective if you first use an exfoliating cream such as Amlactin or Glytone and let the cream sit on your skin overnight.</li>
            <li>Goodbye to dry skin hello to soft beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>It works better than most other foot scrapers.</li>
            <li>(UPDATE: discovered a butter knife isn&#x27;t curved right...</li>
            <li>I stopped using it on my face, and my skin improved again right away.</li>
            <li>I did find using it right after the shower (</li>
            <li>slough right off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the VERY first use, my skin was incredibly soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>After the VERY first use, my skin was incredibly soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The first day I used this on that area it never re-scabbed and healed right up.  </li>
            <li>For now I&#x27;m satisfied with the convenience of using it in the shower and think the results are worth the extra time and soap.</li>
            <li>(so if you want a quick shower before work, this won&#x27;t make that happen), and doesn&#x27;t always seem to do that much.</li>
            <li>It effectively yet gently exfoliates my entire body.</li>
            <li>Not the amazing results I expected.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>In fact, that is exactly how this product is supposed to work.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Maybe if I soaked in a hot bath for 20 minutes and then used it, it would work.</li>
            <li>The only redeeming factor is that it seems to be well manufactured and the steel blade looks like it&#x27;s made of quality steel.</li>
            <li>I first used this on my arms and legs (remember to wash yourself with hot water and apply soap first btw)</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work very well for me!</li>
            <li>Def works better if you use oil awhile prior to a hot shower.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember where I first read about Le Edge</li>
            <li>Reviews were so-so, but I&#x27;m willing to try anything.</li>
            <li>get in a hot bath and let my skin soak for a while to see if that improves things.</li>
            <li>10 minutes later, even better.</li>
            <li>used it the first time on my face and arms</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>It does not work unless your skin is really saturated with water, but if you are patient you will find that it does remove quite a bit !</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and does just what it is supposed to do!  </li>
            <li>And Exfoliation is the key to healthy skin.</li>
            <li>A pouf does better work with exfoliating without leaving possible scars.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well, not as well as I&#x27;d hoped on the face and legs, but helps a lot with the KP on my arms.</li>
            <li>I lost my first one in a move and had to buy another one.</li>
            <li>With routine use, I&#x27;m finding that my skin is looking much smoother and better able to absorb moisturizer after a shower since the dead skin is removed.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this nothing happened.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>I have KP and use it pretty vigorously on arms and legs.  </li>
            <li>For anyone experiencing a similar issue with smooth legs, I urge you to give this a try!  </li>
            <li>what I first thought was a prank.  </li>
            <li>I like it, but you have to be in the water for a while first</li>
            <li>and I did exactly what the directions told me to do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprising when you see how much dead skin comes off</li>
            <li>After a week, both legs havve improved, but the right leg is so much smoother.</li>
            <li>Easy to grip, no slipping.</li>
            <li>I always am quick to try out a new product.</li>
            <li>This tool works wonders and leaves you feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>My skin felt clean and soft.</li>
            <li>It gets all of the icky stuff off leaving my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works well on the rest of your body too, but takes a lot more soaking (at least 15 minutes) as well as more effort and pressure.</li>
            <li>It also does what it intends to do--remove dead skin--but the alternative use for me is the most important.  </li>
            <li>It was Ok, but I have extremely sensitive skin and find it a little bit more then my skin likes.  </li>
            <li>On the positive, I owned this for over a year, I kept it in the bottom of my shower and it never rusted.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a positive as it&#x27;s a tool that one drags against one&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done this in the shower, with coconut oil but without soaking, and my results were nowhere near as satisfying (more oil scraped off, not a lot of dead skin).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done this in the shower, with coconut oil but without soaking, and my results were nowhere near as satisfying (more oil scraped off, not a lot of dead skin).  </li>
            <li>Although I didn&#x27;t care for Le Edge when I tried it on my arms and legs in the shower, I think it may work better after soaking a long time.</li>
            <li>It pretty much looks like a razor, but again, it&#x27;s NOT a razor.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t get over the fact, that such a simple product does such an incredible job.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it takes off a surprising amount of dead skin!</li>
            <li>It was pretty cheap so no big deal.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping it would help slough off some of the dry skin on my legs(sounds lovely, doesn&#x27;t it?).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always struggled with large pores on my nose.</li>
            <li>I was recommended this item for exfoliating my face, and the first time I used it, it left my skin feeling very well exfoliated and smooth, but a bit irritated.</li>
            <li>Le Edge really helps scraping off the dead skin, way better than any pumice stone I&#x27;ve tried using for that purpose!</li>
            <li>Handy little tool.  </li>
            <li>This is a handy little tool to have in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I have KP and this made such a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I already use an exfoliating body wash and this did absolutely nothing but redden my skin.</li>
            <li>did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>I cannot stress how much of a difference this product has made.  </li>
            <li>I cannot stress how much of a difference this product has made.  </li>
            <li>it helps SOOO much.</li>
            <li>I hold it like a razor and pull it across my heels and it removes SOOO much skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t notice a whole lot of improvement.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it did much on my face</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really hurt for me.</li>
            <li>Works very well to get all the dirt off - just takes a while to get used to this method.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t help as much as a loofah or exfoliator does.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a stainless steel edge.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel very fancy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel very fancy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This does absolutely NOTHING.</li>
            <li>I recommend it whole heartedly</li>
            <li>so my skin is really softened up before I use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much smoother.</li>
            <li>Much smoother.</li>
            <li>My skin is finally getting smooth again.</li>
            <li>This does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>, I feel my skin products and sunscreen really penetrate in there now.</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t lose much money if id didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>It did more than I expected it to do</li>
            <li>I guess if you&#x27;re really into exfoliation, this gadget does the trick well.  </li>
            <li>With now getting that off after washing my face with this exfoliator, my skin is much clearer and fewer break outs.  </li>
            <li>I also use Le Edge on areas where I&#x27;m prone to ingrown hairs from shaving and I have had much fewer</li>
            <li>Couldnt tell much difference.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice much improvement in my skin than when I use exfoliating gloves.</li>
            <li>This thing really works.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really seem to exfoliate much.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face and body--nothing really comes off of my face</li>
            <li>Really works if you use it twice week.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you use it wet otherwise it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does really work well to help prevent ingrowns though</li>
            <li>This really does work.</li>
            <li>Cant say I noticed that this gadget did much if anything for me.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get as much skin off as everyone said, didn&#x27;t notice much at all.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to exfoliate much on most of my skin and does seem rough on it, irritates.</li>
            <li>It is caused by the body producing too much keratin.</li>
            <li>The only product that ever worked was a \\&quot;buffing pad\\&quot; made by Sally Hansen which was intended to buff away hair, but instead just made mine smooth after I shaved.  </li>
            <li>This works really well</li>
            <li>, you just have to make sure your skin is wet and softened.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic as a facial exfoliator.</li>
            <li>I tried this, but did not see any real improvement.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really feel as if this product really helped me.</li>
            <li>; I&#x27;m not even sure if they&#x27;re still in production, so I&#x27;m ordering several in case the supply completely dries up.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and would never use the Le Edge on my face, but if you can tolerate it, I am sure it would help with facial  KP as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My feet are sooo soft!!!</li>
            <li>It is the most successful tool I&#x27;ve found to remove the thick, dead skin from the bottoms of my feet.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this after struggling with KP for years and thinking this was my big solution.  </li>
            <li>I also tried the Exfoliator after using my Olay brush to see how well the brush cleans--- not a single dead skin cell on it--- good to know the brush really works.  </li>
            <li>They were the reason why I bought this piece of garbage in the first place, and I&#x27;ve just wasted more $$ based on lies.</li>
            <li>Gave it a second chance in the shower after making sure my skin became soft from the steam &amp; added a little more pressure &amp; it worked.</li>
            <li>So I think if you suffer from dark pits this will be a huge help!  </li>
            <li>Not sure why someone would give this 1 star or leave a review when they don&#x27;t even own the product.  </li>
            <li>I suggest you purchase Amlactin lotion to work with the  Le Edge Full Body Exfoliator because together you will see lasting results</li>
            <li>It is a small tool but an effective tool.</li>
            <li>At first all that will come up is loose and liquidy oil, but with every subsequent pull, the residue will become thicker and grayer, and THAT&#x27;S the magical skin debris everyone talks about.</li>
            <li>Scraping the edge of a dinner plate along your skin would be as effective as this item, its a complete waste of money</li>
            <li>I know many women who use actual razors to achieve similar results, but I would never recommend doing that.</li>
            <li>Plus, all of those things only gave me mediocre results at best.</li>
            <li>Seemed to really get rid of the top layer of dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly on my arms to help with my KP (along with Amlactin) and am seeing visible results.</li>
            <li>However, 2 weeks later, my skin is starting to look much better</li>
            <li>OH, I also use it on the bottom of my feet, which feels weird but keeps them nice and smooth as well.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely amazing how much gunk is left on my face after washing it--Le Edge gets rid of everything my other face products miss!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel as many little bumps (i.e. clogged pores).</li>
            <li>It has greatly reduced the KP on my legs, and smoothed out some weird bumps on my arms.</li>
            <li>was skeptical as to how great this product would be.  </li>
            <li>This will in no way cure your flaky skin completely, but the difference is absolutely visible after just one use.</li>
            <li>but it has made my rough bumpy arms silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest being really careful using it on fragile skin like the bikini area until you know for sure how much pressure to use.</li>
            <li>So far, I really like it....</li>
            <li>As reviewer Kim mentioned, you need oil for this to really do its job while protecting sensitive skin from damage.</li>
            <li>This really does work, I was surprised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I purchased this in hopes it will help with keratosis pilaris, haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know for sure</li>
            <li>It does work, however, I feel I am better off with just an everyday loofa, sponge, or washcloth.</li>
            <li>though, more like a butter knife) dragged along the skin to remove dead skin and debris.</li>
            <li>It does scrape off dead skin to some degree so the jury is still out on how I&#x27;ll feel about it if I use it a couple more times.</li>
            <li>I used it exactly per the instructions, I adjusted the pressure, direction, and tried different areas of my body, and absolutely NOTHING came off.  </li>
            <li>Then the Le Edge is able to squeeze out the trapped keratin from the pore/follicle.</li>
            <li>I love sloughing off dead skin cells in the shower.</li>
            <li>But all I did was take my normal 5 minute shower</li>
            <li>I also use this on the soles of my feet and it scrapes up all of the dead skin cells and dirt like a magic eraser.</li>
            <li>I gave myself props for being better at exfoliating than I thought and figured I was out a few bucks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now for those pesky red spots (which I will admit, do look a little better!</li>
            <li>I used the lotion on both legs, but only used the &amp;#34;le edge&amp;#34; on my right leg.</li>
            <li>Anyway it&#x27;s a great price for a little tool that seems like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>It works well enough on tougher places like your feet or elbows, but the edge is kind of difficult to use effectively on ankles and elbows especially.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without it now that we&#x27;ve found it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s amazing (and gross) to see the dead skin that comes off with this tool.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a combination of gentle, non-comedogenic oils; a light spritz and rub on skin that&#x27;s soaked or been under the shower spray for a while, and dead skin, KP bumps, even calluses</li>
            <li>I do a quick pass on my heels while in the shower, and also run it over the tops of my feet to exfoliate any dry bumps I have there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know from reading reviews that your skin has to be wet for this to work (more on that in a second)</li>
            <li>But my skin was very soft after using it.</li>
            <li>There are parts of my body that I didn&#x27;t even realize could EVER be so soft!  </li>
            <li>I can see why some had problems with this, when I used with just water at the end of a hot shower it was entirely ineffective.</li>
            <li>The only time I have witnessed any build-up was the first use</li>
            <li>/&gt;Today I used it on my face for the first time, and it was the same story.</li>
            <li>I keep mine in the shower and use it after being under hot water for several minutes</li>
            <li>I even used it on my boyfriend&#x27;s back and soo much grime came off!</li>
            <li>After the first use I did not get the same results. ?</li>
            <li>Just received this and WOW!</li>
            <li>It worked wonders for my arms but after reading the reviews I tried this on my face and all I can say is wow!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive so not a big deal if it doesn&#x27;t work, but if it does then</li>
            <li>I find the most dead skin it takes off is on my neck, which wasn&#x27;t really what I was going for with purchasing this but am now totally paying attention to.</li>
            <li>In trying to clean the skin out from this edge with my finger once, the tool actually sliced open my fingertip and made me bled.</li>
            <li>But it did hurt in my arms and legs, I used very little pressure, maybe my skin is sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;Worked great for removing dead skin off my heels on my feet.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin, and using this once in awhile was ok, but using even two days in a row was extremely irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li>After a couple of swipes I saw the dry skin and oil come right off.</li>
            <li>I have chicken skin (Keratosis Pilaris) and this did a great job at exfoliating my skin.</li>
            <li>I ordered one of these a couple of months back, and I have to say it has really improved my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so soft.</li>
            <li>What I&#x27;ve found is that the amount of exfoliation I achieve really depends on how much I open my pores.  </li>
            <li>I saw so many reviews where people complained it did nothing</li>
            <li>My fingers were soft and tender from the water</li>
            <li>An old Roman method that still works today.</li>
            <li>You will be surprised all the junk that comes off your face</li>
            <li>Completely won me over.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my face and neck and was surprised at the gunk that it removed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 65 years old and have used everything under the sun to improve my complexion.</li>
            <li>Use Amlactin as a moisturizing lotion everywhere not fave though skin will be really soft.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say, no ingrown hairs so far.</li>
            <li>This did seem to help, at least with the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I also use an epilator on my legs, and this does a much better job of exfoliating before use than just using a scrub.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to work quite as well, but it&#x27;s easier and still leaves my skin soft and exfoliated.</li>
            <li>Who knew that much crud could be left on your skin after washing!</li>
            <li>According to this...I&#x27;m as soft as a infant.  </li>
            <li>What seems to happen is that the Korean Italy Cloth removes a layer of dead skin and possibly takes off the top of the &amp;#34;KP bump&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It even feels nice while you are using it - not at all irritating.</li>
            <li>The device is not meant to be sharp, but, when looking at the edge of the appliance with a magnifying glass, I found that, rather than having a smooth, honed edge, it had lots of tiny ridges and distressed-looking areas that could hold debris and bacteria.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother, more evenly toned and less dry because some of the oil remains to moisturize any bits I might miss post-shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>think the only downside is that it gets a bit gross if I don&#x27;t make sure to wipe it down with a washcloth each time.</li>
            <li>Scrubbing with an exfoliating cloth made a profound difference where this tool made none.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that using a body oil first (like jojoba or olive oil) and then using this really helps get all the dead skin and dirt off.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product, really improved the surface  of my bumpy upper arms due to those little white bumps whatever they are called.</li>
            <li>The only glow I received on my skin from this product was from high blood presdure.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not a cutting edge, there&#x27;s no worry about how long it will last, and because it&#x27;s stainless and has a thin sheen of oil from its most recent use, it will remain pristine for years.</li>
            <li>This is one of those things that&#x27;s an absolute saving grace for a certain skin type, and will do little to nothing for everyone else.  </li>
            <li>Feels pretty rough on my skin too...</li>
            <li>And yes, that&#x27;s exactly what happened to me when my skin was just wet.</li>
            <li>I looked at the exfoliator, and saw that it was full of dead</li>
            <li>Mild KP is a LOT less apparent...</li>
            <li>So far, the bumps on my arms are almost gone (I‚Äôve only had the Le Edge Full Body Exfoliator for less than a month.</li>
            <li>the pads only lasted once or twice before I had to buy new ones and C)</li>
            <li>Use twice a day with several gentle scrapes on each side of the arm, covering the entire area.</li>
            <li>It is smaller than I imagined but it really doesn&#x27;t need to be any bigger.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing every single time.</li>
            <li>The amount of dead skin differs from one body part to another, &amp; if you usually scrub you won&#x27;t be able to exfoliate much with this tool.</li>
            <li>but then, I&#x27;ve come to believe keratosis pilaris needs to be treated from the inside-out--in other words, with nutrition first.</li>
            <li>at least  Cons: Expensive for what it is - a butter knife will do but isn&#x27;t as nice or easy to hold in the shower</li>
            <li>, I had these small clusters of small bumps near the top of my hairline which are now gone!  </li>
            <li>My legs are so smooth days after actually shaving, prevents gross little grown in hairs.</li>
            <li>Lots of cuts and just generally unsmooth feeling.</li>
            <li>My skin should have been pretty damned clear of dead cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never, ever, been so pleasantly surprised by a beauty related product.  </li>
            <li>But in that case any old loofah would do the same thing as this so-called exfoliator.</li>
            <li>Definitely noticed the scum that came from scraping my face, but after using on my body I found it to be a bit softer, but I can get better results from a regular exfoliating brush.</li>
            <li>It BARELY works at that point.</li>
            <li>I am a 26 year old, who has suffered from KP her entire life.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s is when it finally kicked into action.</li>
            <li>After using it several times along with my normal skincare routine (which already included an exfoliator), I have noticed clearer, softer skin and smaller pores.  </li>
            <li>But it worked crazy good, tons of gunk came off the blade and left my skin incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>I looked at the exfoliator, and saw that it was full of dead skin!  </li>
            <li>The Le Edge Full Body Exfoliator - Pink is not at all what I expected: no visible/noticable deadskin removal ...</li>
            <li>I used it a couple of times a week for a few weeks, and found that it was far to harsh for my face - my skin began to get rougher and get more breakouts.</li>
            <li>It essentially &amp;#34;shaves&amp;#34; the dead skin off (not a blade, or sharp, though, it&#x27;s safe).</li>
            <li>I use AmLactin 12% lotion right out of shower everyday and follow up with a mixture of coconut oil + tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>I wet them down and then pull the tool across my lips to remove that gross skin that accumulates, and it leaves them PERFECTLY smooth for lipstick</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I mainly use it for scraping the rough skin off of my feet in the shower.</li>
            <li>A terrific little product for the right consumer.</li>
            <li>I have recently switched to using pure coconut oil as a body moisturizer, as it is the only thing that does not sting, and keeps my very dry skin under control.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who deals with KP or bumpy, rough skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the other reviewers suggestion of going Old Roman and using oil, which might be fun down the road.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much smoother, surprised at the amount of dead skin cells left on my face after washing it by hand.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try and get at the rough areas on my feet, but it didn&#x27;t remove any dead skin.</li>
            <li>in the end, I would recommend using this as an exfoliator as long as your skin isn&#x27;t too sensitive.</li>
            <li>but since I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin, harsh chemicals really bother me and make me itchy and/or red.</li>
            <li>Since having the ingrown hair issues, I had tried all kinds of solutions: expensive natural scrubs, expensive chemical scrubs, home-made scrubs of sugar and coconut oil (which is still an awesome home-made product, FYI), dry-brushing, etc. etc.  </li>
            <li>The first time I got some heavy duty gunk off.</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado where it is very dry.</li>
            <li>It worked well enough, though, and I was willing to overpay a little.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product to help with my KP, the first couple tries I wasn&#x27;t lucky in removing any dead/excess skin, it was frustrating</li>
            <li>My arms are smoother and less bumpy and it works really well on my legs too.</li>
            <li>I used for the first few weeks on my triceps and upper arms</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive, atopic skin, so I have to be careful about how aggressively I exfoliate.</li>
            <li>so maybe that&#x27;s a good or bad sign.</li>
            <li>My KP isn&#x27;t gone, but it&#x27;s decreased by about 60%, which is huge for me.  </li>

            <li> Wanted to really love it, but it just wasn&#x27;t very effective.</li>

            <li> I love this product!</li>

            <li> I absolutely LOVE my Le Edge!</li>
            <li> but I must confess I love it!</li>
            <li> I brought it in the shower to use when my legs are hot and my skin is softened(the best time to exfoliate)</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to use, love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited to have found this!</li>
            <li> I use this exclusively on callouses and it works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> The oil makes a huge difference, they should sell it paired together, lol.</li>
            <li> It is amazing</li>
            <li> OMG this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> It feels amazing.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I am someone who has plenty of skin to exfoliate and was expecting a nice cleaning tool.  </li>
            <li> you can visibly see how effective this is.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Find a good lotion or cream to apply afterwards for better effect.</li>
            <li> but here&#x27;s what I did!&lt;br /&gt;I started off by making my own lactic acid lotion.</li>
            <li> This kind of hurts.  </li>
            <li> Then I get in the shower and let the steam/hot water warm up the oil for a minute.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li> One thing, when used on my lower legs/shins, I do seem to get a nice shine after shaving/lotioning.</li>
            <li> Now I have to buy my husband his own</li>
            <li> product is cheap, easy to use, and incredibly efficient.  </li>
            <li> This product is cheap, easy to use, and incredibly efficient.  </li>
            <li> With this my face gets super smooth and my foundation is flawless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it everywhere including face and neck and it has worked beautifully from the first time I used it.    </li>
            <li> I like this product a lot, although I&#x27;ve had to spend a bit of time figuring out how to use it most effectively.  </li>
            <li> This is okay, but won&#x27;t be effective tbh.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work great the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s a very  cheaply made window scraper for the Barbi corvette.  </li>
            <li> My face feels and looks very smooth.  </li>
            <li> keep finding new places to use it and the thing is freakin&#x27; incredible.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I have pretty good skin</li>
            <li> This one was okay.</li>
            <li> okay, i was hoping it would work better</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s even more amazing is how smooth it makes your skin.</li>
            <li> As a huge nerd, I remembered hearing about Strigils (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strigil), or metal tools which were popular during Roman times for skin cleaning.  </li>
            <li> for most of my life and have tried many things to combat this issue.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li> Time consuming Go through a lot more soap  </li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> and I really love using it.    </li>
            <li> My foot is smoother now and I can&#x27;t wait to use it more and more.</li>
            <li> This exfoliates better than any scrub, most of which have oils, or the exfoliating gloves.  </li>
            <li> I love using it all over my feet in the shower - tops, sides, bottoms, backs, and watching the skin slough</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t stop touching my skin -</li>
            <li> Basically, most of my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m most concerned about.</li>
            <li> I put that on my skin to soften it more, just for the laughs at that point.</li>
            <li> and it acted more like a squeegee.</li>
            <li> I continue along dragging and dragging, getting more and more skin.</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> 10 minutes after that, EVEN BETTER.</li>
            <li> All of this on top of the fact that it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> and I think I might even have more keratosis.</li>
            <li> :) hope this helps someone out.</li>
            <li> This keeps them smooth between pedicures, &amp; is way more effective than those cheese-grater types of exfoliators.</li>
            <li> If you know what I&#x27;m talking about, you&#x27;ll love this thing and wonder how you lived without it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think my skin felt smoother or looked better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been getting nearly as many as I used to</li>
            <li> and it makes me feel so much more confident.</li>
            <li> It actually works and works great!!!!!</li>
            <li> and my forhead is nice and smooth</li>
            <li> My treatment products work so much better with a now cleaner and de-clogged skin.  </li>
            <li> I love Le Edge.</li>
            <li> short, I think this is a great exfoliation tool to supplement any skincare routine and prevent ingrown hairs from shaving!</li>
            <li> This is better for my face than my clarisonic brush.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for better results.</li>
            <li> Will update, after use more</li>
            <li> I cannot stop touching my face.</li>
            <li> Must be shared :)</li>
            <li> For best results, you have to use it the second you get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> Love it for our face in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Love it for my daughter&#x27;s KP.  </li>
            <li> Works fantastic in almost any area!</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> I received it before the estimated date...which I love..</li>
            <li> I love love love it.</li>
            <li> IT DOES ANY MORE THAN MY LOOFA GLOVE?</li>
            <li> Used correctly it should never be able to cut you.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with Le Edge.</li>
            <li> Better than a pumice stone.</li>
            <li> My KP looked so much better</li>
            <li> I used the exfoliator on my legs (takes 1 or 2 mins) before shaving, and my legs are FINALLY smooth!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes I will put massage oil on before a shower, to better lift out dirt, then wash it off with soap in the shower.</li>
            <li> It is a very useful tool that I honestly can&#x27;t do without!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I will this time because I think this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> For those who did not have a good result, I suggest that you soak in the tub with oil first.  </li>
            <li> For those who did not have a good result, I suggest that you soak in the tub with oil first.  </li>
            <li> Also use it for blackheads on my face and it works pretty good.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin or wear lotion/creams, this is perfect for you.</li>
            <li> Took layers of makeup off my neck that I thought had been clean when I washed my face!</li>
            <li> Best used in shower when body is wet or use oil as lubricant.</li>
            <li> Best of all, it can be used over and over and takes minimal time.  </li>
            <li> Its not the most magical thing ever, but its not bad</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone because chances are, you&#x27;re going to notice a difference and for the price, it&#x27;s sooo worth it! :)</li>
            <li> Easy once you get the hang of it</li>
            <li> Works well if you have skin that builds up easily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to get over zealous once you start seeing some skin come off.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best item I have ever had for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer mentioned on her excellent review, I think that OIL makes this work better as I definitely notice it works much more effectively on naturally oilier areas of my skin.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to use a shaving cream because the blade glides on so easily and precisely after I use this.</li>
            <li> and I love that its so easy to use and its fast!!  </li>
            <li> Even when you don&#x27;t have much to exfoliate your skin still becomes soooooo smooth!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful easy to use product that peeled off my dead skin cells with ease.  </li>
            <li> This little tool is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> This little scraper works great!</li>
            <li> This little gadget exfoliates excellently.</li>
            <li> I cannot stress how awesome this little gadget it.  </li>
            <li> If you buy it only for callouses, you&#x27;ll be extremely happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> But if I start by taking a warm/hot bath for 15 minutes and then use it -- it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I recommend everyone to use LeEdge if you want smooth skin.</li>
            <li> and my arms feel perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li> Eh, kind of a bother to scrape the whole body.  </li>
            <li> and I use it lightly to help my cream penetrate deeper to my skin.</li>
            <li> This has been great to use on my face and upper arms.  </li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job getting rid of excess skin, dirt, lotions, etc.</li>
            <li> I paid $10.04 for this in December 2014 and that was about $5 more than it was worth.  </li>
            <li> Those are free and will work just as well.  </li>
            <li> Also noticed the skin on my arms are SO smooth</li>
            <li> Now, I know I&#x27;ll never have perfectly smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I found it most useful around my knees and the backs of my arms.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just wash/exfoilate more than most, but this product really did nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> But it does great things on the soles of my feet, I love it for that, just not much else.</li>
            <li> and my arms were just so surprisingly soft and haven&#x27;t looked this good in years.</li>
            <li> Love using this with the Prolinc heel eliminator it makes callus heels scrap right off.</li>
            <li> Suddenly this thing was VERY effective....</li>
            <li> Awesome little gadget!</li>
            <li> According to other positive reviewers it works, but from my experience it wasn&#x27;t as good as a good scrub with a loofah or washcloth.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t expect it to do such an amazing job!</li>
            <li> and I am excited to add this to my skin care</li>
            <li> /&gt;***I bought this one on Amazon as a replacement for my original that I lost.</li>
            <li> I think this originally sold for about $30</li>
            <li> I am excited to see how my skin looks as I incorporate this into my skincare/KP treatment routine.</li>
            <li> helps clear the skin more quickly!!</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s kind of gross to see, I love that I can see the stuff that&#x27;s being removed.</li>
            <li> I used it after being in a warm shower for about 8 minutes and sure enough, there was a lot of build up on the blade.</li>
            <li> I like to keep a clean shower</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did cut my finger one time when I was attempting to clean it after using it.</li>
            <li> Gets the pores clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel clean anymore unless I use this product.</li>
            <li> At such a great price, I figured it was worth a shot to use on my legs before I shave.  </li>
            <li> I am certain others will love this product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see this as doing anything special at all.  </li>
            <li> I bought this through a special on Groupon.  </li>
            <li> I must be a wimp or not using it right!</li>
            <li> It is super easy to clean, it just rinses right off.</li>
            <li> Works best if you take bath/shower first (for dead skin to soften up) and use this at the end of your bathing time.</li>
            <li> This works best for people with thick, oily skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, and it felt good.  </li>
            <li> It might be good for in-grown hair on hands and legs (not thicker hairs) only.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting tool I am using in my whole body exfoliation routine.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to love this item from all the reviews I saw, but really it&#x27;s just so-so.</li>
            <li> I did this after using my beloved facial scrub.</li>
            <li> my Winter skin will be the true test, but I think it&#x27;s a winner</li>
            <li> I showered for about 10 minutes and got nice and soft and started scraping.</li>
            <li> As long as you hold it at the right angle and wait until your skin has softened in the shower/bath, it works great.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever review on Amazon, and I did this just because I feel so strongly about this product.  </li>
            <li> This is my first ever review on Amazon, and I did this just because I feel so strongly about this product.  </li>
            <li> use this primarily on my arms, to help with KP, and I&#x27;m happy with the results I&#x27;m seeing when I use it after steaming my skin for a little while.  </li>
            <li> the exfoliator arrived, and I went about my usual bathing routine (which mirrors how the Romans used it, and I think this is KEY to getting the best results): soaking for 10 minutes in a warm bath with a couple tablespoons of coconut oil, then exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> In looking at other reviews, it looks like it may not work for everyone, but I&#x27;ve been happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that I don&#x27;t have to purchase any other body scrubs ever again.</li>
            <li> This tool is great for preparing bikini line  and all other areas for shaving.</li>
            <li> I purchased it after reading all the other great reviews on how it helped kp</li>
            <li> This is great sometimes and so-so other times.</li>
            <li> The metal part appeared to be as fresh and clean as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> Well, then lucky you, you probably don&#x27;t need this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for the next which is a much forgotten place for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> However, this helps tremendously.</li>
            <li> I agree with the comments about using a light oil on your skin first.</li>
            <li> Also, the design is sturdy and seems like it&#x27;ll be good for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great product to clean dead cells off.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve always had mild keratosis pilaris (KP), but had pretty much given up on it getting better.  </li>
            <li> Have tried managing my feet with many products, this by far is the best and keeps it simple enough that I use it every time I bathe.  </li>
            <li> I love trying new skincare products, so I couldn&#x27;t resist this one.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these on a whim, and just came back to order two more as backups!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had the original one for years, &amp; it continued to work just as well as the day I first received it in the mail.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I was so excited.</li>
            <li> And my feet are pretty now!</li>
            <li> What a great little tool.</li>
            <li> My skin definitely feels nice after I use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for it, but it cropped up as a suggestion, and I thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> For skin exfoliating its not that useful.</li>
            <li> Works great but its kind of gross seeing all the dead skin you can get.</li>
            <li> I need you guys to understand that I have the most sensitive, itchy skin in the world</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> After having this for over a year, I just didn&#x27;t consider it that useful and threw it out.</li>
            <li> The exfoliator is smaller than I expected but seems to be the perfect size for arms and legs.</li>
            <li> I would also think it would be useful as part of the treatment for keratosis pilaris.  </li>
            <li> It has a distinct smell of mildew though there&#x27;s no sign of mold anywhere.</li>
            <li> Im sensitive to most.</li>
            <li> Scraped off more skin than I expected this tool would be able to remove.</li>
            <li> &quot; so I&#x27;ve never been able to get a smooth shave in virtually my entire life.  </li>
            <li> left me feeling very clean and exfoliated!</li>
            <li> As another reviewer suggested, this tool is super effective if you first use an exfoliating cream such as Amlactin or Glytone and let the cream sit on your skin overnight.</li>
            <li> Goodbye to dry skin hello to soft beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> It works better than most other foot scrapers.</li>
            <li> (UPDATE: discovered a butter knife isn&#x27;t curved right...</li>
            <li> I stopped using it on my face, and my skin improved again right away.</li>
            <li> I did find using it right after the shower (</li>
            <li> slough right off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the VERY first use, my skin was incredibly soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> After the VERY first use, my skin was incredibly soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The first day I used this on that area it never re-scabbed and healed right up.  </li>
            <li> For now I&#x27;m satisfied with the convenience of using it in the shower and think the results are worth the extra time and soap.</li>
            <li> (so if you want a quick shower before work, this won&#x27;t make that happen), and doesn&#x27;t always seem to do that much.</li>
            <li> It effectively yet gently exfoliates my entire body.</li>
            <li> Not the amazing results I expected.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> In fact, that is exactly how this product is supposed to work.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Maybe if I soaked in a hot bath for 20 minutes and then used it, it would work.</li>
            <li> The only redeeming factor is that it seems to be well manufactured and the steel blade looks like it&#x27;s made of quality steel.</li>
            <li> I first used this on my arms and legs (remember to wash yourself with hot water and apply soap first btw)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well for me!</li>
            <li> Def works better if you use oil awhile prior to a hot shower.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember where I first read about Le Edge</li>
            <li> Reviews were so-so, but I&#x27;m willing to try anything.</li>
            <li> get in a hot bath and let my skin soak for a while to see if that improves things.</li>
            <li> 10 minutes later, even better.</li>
            <li> used it the first time on my face and arms</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> It does not work unless your skin is really saturated with water, but if you are patient you will find that it does remove quite a bit !</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and does just what it is supposed to do!  </li>
            <li> And Exfoliation is the key to healthy skin.</li>
            <li> A pouf does better work with exfoliating without leaving possible scars.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, not as well as I&#x27;d hoped on the face and legs, but helps a lot with the KP on my arms.</li>
            <li> I lost my first one in a move and had to buy another one.</li>
            <li> With routine use, I&#x27;m finding that my skin is looking much smoother and better able to absorb moisturizer after a shower since the dead skin is removed.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this nothing happened.</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> I have KP and use it pretty vigorously on arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> For anyone experiencing a similar issue with smooth legs, I urge you to give this a try!  </li>
            <li> what I first thought was a prank.  </li>
            <li> I like it, but you have to be in the water for a while first</li>
            <li> and I did exactly what the directions told me to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprising when you see how much dead skin comes off</li>
            <li> After a week, both legs havve improved, but the right leg is so much smoother.</li>
            <li> Easy to grip, no slipping.</li>
            <li> I always am quick to try out a new product.</li>
            <li> This tool works wonders and leaves you feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> My skin felt clean and soft.</li>
            <li> It gets all of the icky stuff off leaving my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works well on the rest of your body too, but takes a lot more soaking (at least 15 minutes) as well as more effort and pressure.</li>
            <li> It also does what it intends to do--remove dead skin--but the alternative use for me is the most important.  </li>
            <li> It was Ok, but I have extremely sensitive skin and find it a little bit more then my skin likes.  </li>
            <li> On the positive, I owned this for over a year, I kept it in the bottom of my shower and it never rusted.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a positive as it&#x27;s a tool that one drags against one&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done this in the shower, with coconut oil but without soaking, and my results were nowhere near as satisfying (more oil scraped off, not a lot of dead skin).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done this in the shower, with coconut oil but without soaking, and my results were nowhere near as satisfying (more oil scraped off, not a lot of dead skin).  </li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t care for Le Edge when I tried it on my arms and legs in the shower, I think it may work better after soaking a long time.</li>
            <li> It pretty much looks like a razor, but again, it&#x27;s NOT a razor.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t get over the fact, that such a simple product does such an incredible job.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it takes off a surprising amount of dead skin!</li>
            <li> It was pretty cheap so no big deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would help slough off some of the dry skin on my legs(sounds lovely, doesn&#x27;t it?).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with large pores on my nose.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this item for exfoliating my face, and the first time I used it, it left my skin feeling very well exfoliated and smooth, but a bit irritated.</li>
            <li> Le Edge really helps scraping off the dead skin, way better than any pumice stone I&#x27;ve tried using for that purpose!</li>
            <li> Handy little tool.  </li>
            <li> This is a handy little tool to have in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I have KP and this made such a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I already use an exfoliating body wash and this did absolutely nothing but redden my skin.</li>
            <li> did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> I cannot stress how much of a difference this product has made.  </li>
            <li> I cannot stress how much of a difference this product has made.  </li>
            <li> it helps SOOO much.</li>
            <li> I hold it like a razor and pull it across my heels and it removes SOOO much skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t notice a whole lot of improvement.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it did much on my face</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really hurt for me.</li>
            <li> Works very well to get all the dirt off - just takes a while to get used to this method.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t help as much as a loofah or exfoliator does.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a stainless steel edge.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel very fancy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel very fancy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This does absolutely NOTHING.</li>
            <li> I recommend it whole heartedly</li>
            <li> so my skin is really softened up before I use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much smoother.</li>
            <li> Much smoother.</li>
            <li> My skin is finally getting smooth again.</li>
            <li> This does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> , I feel my skin products and sunscreen really penetrate in there now.</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t lose much money if id didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> It did more than I expected it to do</li>
            <li> I guess if you&#x27;re really into exfoliation, this gadget does the trick well.  </li>
            <li> With now getting that off after washing my face with this exfoliator, my skin is much clearer and fewer break outs.  </li>
            <li> I also use Le Edge on areas where I&#x27;m prone to ingrown hairs from shaving and I have had much fewer</li>
            <li> Couldnt tell much difference.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much improvement in my skin than when I use exfoliating gloves.</li>
            <li> This thing really works.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really seem to exfoliate much.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and body--nothing really comes off of my face</li>
            <li> Really works if you use it twice week.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you use it wet otherwise it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does really work well to help prevent ingrowns though</li>
            <li> This really does work.</li>
            <li> Cant say I noticed that this gadget did much if anything for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get as much skin off as everyone said, didn&#x27;t notice much at all.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to exfoliate much on most of my skin and does seem rough on it, irritates.</li>
            <li> It is caused by the body producing too much keratin.</li>
            <li> The only product that ever worked was a \\&quot;buffing pad\\&quot; made by Sally Hansen which was intended to buff away hair, but instead just made mine smooth after I shaved.  </li>
            <li> This works really well</li>
            <li> , you just have to make sure your skin is wet and softened.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic as a facial exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I tried this, but did not see any real improvement.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really feel as if this product really helped me.</li>
            <li> ; I&#x27;m not even sure if they&#x27;re still in production, so I&#x27;m ordering several in case the supply completely dries up.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and would never use the Le Edge on my face, but if you can tolerate it, I am sure it would help with facial  KP as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My feet are sooo soft!!!</li>
            <li> It is the most successful tool I&#x27;ve found to remove the thick, dead skin from the bottoms of my feet.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this after struggling with KP for years and thinking this was my big solution.  </li>
            <li> I also tried the Exfoliator after using my Olay brush to see how well the brush cleans--- not a single dead skin cell on it--- good to know the brush really works.  </li>
            <li> They were the reason why I bought this piece of garbage in the first place, and I&#x27;ve just wasted more $$ based on lies.</li>
            <li> Gave it a second chance in the shower after making sure my skin became soft from the steam &amp; added a little more pressure &amp; it worked.</li>
            <li> So I think if you suffer from dark pits this will be a huge help!  </li>
            <li> Not sure why someone would give this 1 star or leave a review when they don&#x27;t even own the product.  </li>
            <li> I suggest you purchase Amlactin lotion to work with the  Le Edge Full Body Exfoliator because together you will see lasting results</li>
            <li> It is a small tool but an effective tool.</li>
            <li> At first all that will come up is loose and liquidy oil, but with every subsequent pull, the residue will become thicker and grayer, and THAT&#x27;S the magical skin debris everyone talks about.</li>
            <li> Scraping the edge of a dinner plate along your skin would be as effective as this item, its a complete waste of money</li>
            <li> I know many women who use actual razors to achieve similar results, but I would never recommend doing that.</li>
            <li> Plus, all of those things only gave me mediocre results at best.</li>
            <li> Seemed to really get rid of the top layer of dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly on my arms to help with my KP (along with Amlactin) and am seeing visible results.</li>
            <li> However, 2 weeks later, my skin is starting to look much better</li>
            <li> OH, I also use it on the bottom of my feet, which feels weird but keeps them nice and smooth as well.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely amazing how much gunk is left on my face after washing it--Le Edge gets rid of everything my other face products miss!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel as many little bumps (i.e. clogged pores).</li>
            <li> It has greatly reduced the KP on my legs, and smoothed out some weird bumps on my arms.</li>
            <li> was skeptical as to how great this product would be.  </li>
            <li> This will in no way cure your flaky skin completely, but the difference is absolutely visible after just one use.</li>
            <li> but it has made my rough bumpy arms silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest being really careful using it on fragile skin like the bikini area until you know for sure how much pressure to use.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like it....</li>
            <li> As reviewer Kim mentioned, you need oil for this to really do its job while protecting sensitive skin from damage.</li>
            <li> This really does work, I was surprised.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I purchased this in hopes it will help with keratosis pilaris, haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know for sure</li>
            <li> It does work, however, I feel I am better off with just an everyday loofa, sponge, or washcloth.</li>
            <li> though, more like a butter knife) dragged along the skin to remove dead skin and debris.</li>
            <li> It does scrape off dead skin to some degree so the jury is still out on how I&#x27;ll feel about it if I use it a couple more times.</li>
            <li> I used it exactly per the instructions, I adjusted the pressure, direction, and tried different areas of my body, and absolutely NOTHING came off.  </li>
            <li> Then the Le Edge is able to squeeze out the trapped keratin from the pore/follicle.</li>
            <li> I love sloughing off dead skin cells in the shower.</li>
            <li> But all I did was take my normal 5 minute shower</li>
            <li> I also use this on the soles of my feet and it scrapes up all of the dead skin cells and dirt like a magic eraser.</li>
            <li> I gave myself props for being better at exfoliating than I thought and figured I was out a few bucks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now for those pesky red spots (which I will admit, do look a little better!</li>
            <li> I used the lotion on both legs, but only used the &amp;#34;le edge&amp;#34; on my right leg.</li>
            <li> Anyway it&#x27;s a great price for a little tool that seems like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It works well enough on tougher places like your feet or elbows, but the edge is kind of difficult to use effectively on ankles and elbows especially.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without it now that we&#x27;ve found it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing (and gross) to see the dead skin that comes off with this tool.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a combination of gentle, non-comedogenic oils; a light spritz and rub on skin that&#x27;s soaked or been under the shower spray for a while, and dead skin, KP bumps, even calluses</li>
            <li> I do a quick pass on my heels while in the shower, and also run it over the tops of my feet to exfoliate any dry bumps I have there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know from reading reviews that your skin has to be wet for this to work (more on that in a second)</li>
            <li> But my skin was very soft after using it.</li>
            <li> There are parts of my body that I didn&#x27;t even realize could EVER be so soft!  </li>
            <li> I can see why some had problems with this, when I used with just water at the end of a hot shower it was entirely ineffective.</li>
            <li> The only time I have witnessed any build-up was the first use</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today I used it on my face for the first time, and it was the same story.</li>
            <li> I keep mine in the shower and use it after being under hot water for several minutes</li>
            <li> I even used it on my boyfriend&#x27;s back and soo much grime came off!</li>
            <li> After the first use I did not get the same results. ?</li>
            <li> Just received this and WOW!</li>
            <li> It worked wonders for my arms but after reading the reviews I tried this on my face and all I can say is wow!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not expensive so not a big deal if it doesn&#x27;t work, but if it does then</li>
            <li> I find the most dead skin it takes off is on my neck, which wasn&#x27;t really what I was going for with purchasing this but am now totally paying attention to.</li>
            <li> In trying to clean the skin out from this edge with my finger once, the tool actually sliced open my fingertip and made me bled.</li>
            <li> But it did hurt in my arms and legs, I used very little pressure, maybe my skin is sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;Worked great for removing dead skin off my heels on my feet.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin, and using this once in awhile was ok, but using even two days in a row was extremely irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> After a couple of swipes I saw the dry skin and oil come right off.</li>
            <li> I have chicken skin (Keratosis Pilaris) and this did a great job at exfoliating my skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered one of these a couple of months back, and I have to say it has really improved my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so soft.</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;ve found is that the amount of exfoliation I achieve really depends on how much I open my pores.  </li>
            <li> I saw so many reviews where people complained it did nothing</li>
            <li> My fingers were soft and tender from the water</li>
            <li> An old Roman method that still works today.</li>
            <li> You will be surprised all the junk that comes off your face</li>
            <li> Completely won me over.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my face and neck and was surprised at the gunk that it removed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65 years old and have used everything under the sun to improve my complexion.</li>
            <li> Use Amlactin as a moisturizing lotion everywhere not fave though skin will be really soft.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say, no ingrown hairs so far.</li>
            <li> This did seem to help, at least with the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I also use an epilator on my legs, and this does a much better job of exfoliating before use than just using a scrub.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work quite as well, but it&#x27;s easier and still leaves my skin soft and exfoliated.</li>
            <li> Who knew that much crud could be left on your skin after washing!</li>
            <li> According to this...I&#x27;m as soft as a infant.  </li>
            <li> What seems to happen is that the Korean Italy Cloth removes a layer of dead skin and possibly takes off the top of the &amp;#34;KP bump&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It even feels nice while you are using it - not at all irritating.</li>
            <li> The device is not meant to be sharp, but, when looking at the edge of the appliance with a magnifying glass, I found that, rather than having a smooth, honed edge, it had lots of tiny ridges and distressed-looking areas that could hold debris and bacteria.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, more evenly toned and less dry because some of the oil remains to moisturize any bits I might miss post-shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> think the only downside is that it gets a bit gross if I don&#x27;t make sure to wipe it down with a washcloth each time.</li>
            <li> Scrubbing with an exfoliating cloth made a profound difference where this tool made none.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that using a body oil first (like jojoba or olive oil) and then using this really helps get all the dead skin and dirt off.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product, really improved the surface  of my bumpy upper arms due to those little white bumps whatever they are called.</li>
            <li> The only glow I received on my skin from this product was from high blood presdure.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a cutting edge, there&#x27;s no worry about how long it will last, and because it&#x27;s stainless and has a thin sheen of oil from its most recent use, it will remain pristine for years.</li>
            <li> This is one of those things that&#x27;s an absolute saving grace for a certain skin type, and will do little to nothing for everyone else.  </li>
            <li> Feels pretty rough on my skin too...</li>
            <li> And yes, that&#x27;s exactly what happened to me when my skin was just wet.</li>
            <li> I looked at the exfoliator, and saw that it was full of dead</li>
            <li> Mild KP is a LOT less apparent...</li>
            <li> So far, the bumps on my arms are almost gone (I‚Äôve only had the Le Edge Full Body Exfoliator for less than a month.</li>
            <li> the pads only lasted once or twice before I had to buy new ones and C)</li>
            <li> Use twice a day with several gentle scrapes on each side of the arm, covering the entire area.</li>
            <li> It is smaller than I imagined but it really doesn&#x27;t need to be any bigger.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing every single time.</li>
            <li> The amount of dead skin differs from one body part to another, &amp; if you usually scrub you won&#x27;t be able to exfoliate much with this tool.</li>
            <li> but then, I&#x27;ve come to believe keratosis pilaris needs to be treated from the inside-out--in other words, with nutrition first.</li>
            <li> at least  Cons: Expensive for what it is - a butter knife will do but isn&#x27;t as nice or easy to hold in the shower</li>
            <li> , I had these small clusters of small bumps near the top of my hairline which are now gone!  </li>
            <li> My legs are so smooth days after actually shaving, prevents gross little grown in hairs.</li>
            <li> Lots of cuts and just generally unsmooth feeling.</li>
            <li> My skin should have been pretty damned clear of dead cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never, ever, been so pleasantly surprised by a beauty related product.  </li>
            <li> But in that case any old loofah would do the same thing as this so-called exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Definitely noticed the scum that came from scraping my face, but after using on my body I found it to be a bit softer, but I can get better results from a regular exfoliating brush.</li>
            <li> It BARELY works at that point.</li>
            <li> I am a 26 year old, who has suffered from KP her entire life.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s is when it finally kicked into action.</li>
            <li> After using it several times along with my normal skincare routine (which already included an exfoliator), I have noticed clearer, softer skin and smaller pores.  </li>
            <li> But it worked crazy good, tons of gunk came off the blade and left my skin incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> I looked at the exfoliator, and saw that it was full of dead skin!  </li>
            <li> The Le Edge Full Body Exfoliator - Pink is not at all what I expected: no visible/noticable deadskin removal ...</li>
            <li> I used it a couple of times a week for a few weeks, and found that it was far to harsh for my face - my skin began to get rougher and get more breakouts.</li>
            <li> It essentially &amp;#34;shaves&amp;#34; the dead skin off (not a blade, or sharp, though, it&#x27;s safe).</li>
            <li> I use AmLactin 12% lotion right out of shower everyday and follow up with a mixture of coconut oil + tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I wet them down and then pull the tool across my lips to remove that gross skin that accumulates, and it leaves them PERFECTLY smooth for lipstick</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I mainly use it for scraping the rough skin off of my feet in the shower.</li>
            <li> A terrific little product for the right consumer.</li>
            <li> I have recently switched to using pure coconut oil as a body moisturizer, as it is the only thing that does not sting, and keeps my very dry skin under control.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who deals with KP or bumpy, rough skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the other reviewers suggestion of going Old Roman and using oil, which might be fun down the road.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much smoother, surprised at the amount of dead skin cells left on my face after washing it by hand.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try and get at the rough areas on my feet, but it didn&#x27;t remove any dead skin.</li>
            <li> in the end, I would recommend using this as an exfoliator as long as your skin isn&#x27;t too sensitive.</li>
            <li> but since I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin, harsh chemicals really bother me and make me itchy and/or red.</li>
            <li> Since having the ingrown hair issues, I had tried all kinds of solutions: expensive natural scrubs, expensive chemical scrubs, home-made scrubs of sugar and coconut oil (which is still an awesome home-made product, FYI), dry-brushing, etc. etc.  </li>
            <li> The first time I got some heavy duty gunk off.</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado where it is very dry.</li>
            <li> It worked well enough, though, and I was willing to overpay a little.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help with my KP, the first couple tries I wasn&#x27;t lucky in removing any dead/excess skin, it was frustrating</li>
            <li> My arms are smoother and less bumpy and it works really well on my legs too.</li>
            <li> I used for the first few weeks on my triceps and upper arms</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive, atopic skin, so I have to be careful about how aggressively I exfoliate.</li>
            <li> so maybe that&#x27;s a good or bad sign.</li>
            <li> My KP isn&#x27;t gone, but it&#x27;s decreased by about 60%, which is huge for me.  </li>
            <li> It also made my skin turn really red after use and took about a half hour to come back to normal.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face every other day and I am always surprised.</li>
            <li> The first week was a little rough - my skin seemed to break out, but I think it just needed to adjust.</li>
            <li> I then tried it on my whole body and found that it again removed the gunk that my normal system left behind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a common skin condition that caused small, raised, white and sometimes reddish bumps on the skin, mostly on the backs of arms or thighs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say be careful when using it because it can cut you, but it&#x27;s definitely not as sharp as a razor blade.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it if you&#x27;re into heavy exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different exfoliates and still dead skin was left behind</li>
            <li> This really gets dead skin off!</li>
            <li> Using it once a week on face gently and no more facials for me.  </li>
            <li> Barely works and seems to be too rough at times.</li>
            <li> I wonder how long this blade will last.</li>
            <li> i was exited to try this product when it arrived, and for the first week it did remove dead skin but about three weeks in the meal bit became sharp, almost like a razor.</li>
            <li> Wow this little thing does a number on the back of my neck and armpits!</li>
            <li> every few months I get on a new kick to find something that works and since spring and t-shirts and shorts were coming around, of course I was on the hunt.</li>
            <li> With my really dry skin (especially on my face and neck)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for people who do not have dry skin or dandruff issues, but as someone that has to constantly wipe off their shoulders every 20 minutes or so, this is the scraper to get.</li>
            <li> You have to have a specific type of dry skin for this to work I think.</li>
            <li> I also suffer from extremely dry skin, causing my bumps to become even rougher, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter uses this to keep her KP (keratosis pilaris) under control, in combination with Gold Bond&#x27;s Rough and Bumpy Skin Daily Therapy Cream http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MMKAM5E/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1.</li>
            <li> Not really doing much removal of dead skin.  </li>
            <li> Even the areas where I couldn&#x27;t see anything come off on the blade and thought it wasn&#x27;t working was very soft after I dried</li>
            <li> I scraped hard, soft, tried different angles, scraping in different directions and NOTHING.</li>
            <li> You can see the gross stuff being scraped off of your skin if you use it in the same place enough times, but I don&#x27;t notice a difference at all after drying off or using it after a few days.</li>
            <li> I bought the pink one because it was a couple of dollars cheaper than the blue one, who knows why.</li>
            <li> It only works when your skin is wet</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been using it combines with coconut oil and gold bond rough and bumpy for only 3 days</li>
            <li> What I do is get my skin wet, put a tiny bit of oil on, and then pull the strigil across my skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s taken me this long to find something that works.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll wonder why you&#x27;ve walked around suffering from KP for so long.  </li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used AmLactin, Gold Bond Rough and Bumpy lotion, exfoliating gloves, and several others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had KP as long as I can remember and have relentlessly tried to keep it under control.  </li>
            <li> The backs of my arms are much less bumpy and red,  and I&#x27;ve only been using  Le Edge  for about a month.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would purchase it again if I would have known that the results are about the same, or less noticeable vs using a daily exfoliating scrub.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s based off of an ancient Greek and Roman beauty tool called a strigil which was basically a sharp edge (NOT a razor</li>
            <li> Occasionally I have my fianc√© use it on my back, which seems to help a little.</li>
            <li> my KP is very minimal, I don&#x27;t have a lot of white raised bumps for this tool to remove.</li>
            <li> I still have all the black spots but not a single non-smooth spot.</li>
            <li> This has not worked very well for me and even created some serious skin chafing which I am still struggling to correct.</li>
            <li> I use it every time I shower to help remove the layers of makeup and dry skin that accumulate.</li>
            <li> I tried it out dry on my foot around my toes.</li>
            <li> completely dry to see what it does.</li>
            <li> I bought and used for the fall, winter dry skin season.</li>
            <li> but it works for the dry skin bumps I get.</li>
            <li> I use every time I take a bath and sometimes even on dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use a VO5 spray dry oil (one made for both skin and hair)</li>
            <li> then...after I was completely dry I looked at my arms and felt them</li>
            <li> So what to do with stubborn dry skin?</li>
            <li> of those expensive, chemical-laden KP lotions are necessary, but following up with pure coconut oil helps.</li>
            <li> If you hate dead skin you&#x27;ll love this!!</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m scraping with my foot in the air, and all of a sudden something dark falls on my chest.  </li>
            <li> Complete waste of money, do not buy!</li>
            <li> Wait and see if the price goes back down.</li>
            <li> The bottom line is you can buy an ice scraper for a lot less and probably get about the same results!</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about buying this based on the mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> By the way, this thing is pretty small, about the size of your hand (mine&#x27;s is small though)</li>
            <li> If you have used this product wet or dry and seen zero results, you NEED to introduce oil to the mix.</li>
            <li> Less inflammation overall</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of lotions and moisturizers for my arms, which get really rough, dry, and bumpy around my triceps area.</li>
            <li> Skin might be slightly red for a few minutes but rinsing with cold water and applying coconut oil/aloe vera gel will vanish it all and reveal smooth clear skin in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very dry</li>
            <li> Works a little, but not enough to warrant buying this.</li>
            <li> So at the very least this is capable of removing surface dirt if it doesn&#x27;t always exfoliate the way I&#x27;d like it to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i just have to scrub a little bit harder on areas such as legs and arms, but it still works a lot &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> On top of all that, shaving my legs was extremely painful for me because of the bumpies.</li>
            <li> I got this product hoping to smooth out some of those bumps, and was shocked to find IT ACTUALLY works!</li>
            <li> Obviously, you need to be careful on more delicate skin, and it&#x27;s a bit awkward on the bonier joints (elbows and knees).  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no skin was exfoliated with this counter to my expectations.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt, although it does leave my neck a bit red for a few minutes after.</li>
            <li> While this did seem to remove some dead skin, I was left still peeling.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;ll have to be careful of slipping and dropping it.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue using this a few times a week, in conjunction with a steamy bath.</li>
            <li> In my quest to rid myself of the bumps, I&#x27;ve used AmLactin, Glytone, Gold Bond Rough and Bumpy lotion, the Salux cloth, exfoliating gloves, AHA lotions, vitamins, you name it.</li>
            <li> but I drag it along my arm (where I have some KP)</li>
            <li> I think I spent something like 10 bucks,</li>
            <li> I think I spent something like 10 bucks,</li>
            <li> It definitely removes dead skin, makeup and etc...</li>
            <li> Always had rough bumpy legs.</li>
            <li> I found I have to push it into my skin a lot harder than I expected to get the desired result</li>
            <li> I purchased this exfoliator a few days ago, and the effects are nothing short of miraculous.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> It also got rid of all my dead skin in the sole of my feet.</li>
            <li> For me, it did not work as well as expected alone but paired with a strict moisturizer regimen I&#x27;ve noticed a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it to exfoliate my feet since they&#x27;ve been going through a rough time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times but already it has helped my keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li> I do use this on my face also ... carefully.  </li>
            <li> Such a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t scratch me like those all can sometimes, and it probably takes off about the same amount of dead skin.</li>
            <li> looks like a big razor with a big, thick blade.</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m responsible for what I choose to spend my money on, but something has to be done about the rampant false reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I rubbed the dull blade against my skin pretty hard</li>
            <li> I use this about every other day in the shower after soaping up and rinsing, and an alarming amount of gunk comes off of my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not that sharp.</li>
            <li> It was a glob of dark gray/brown dead skin mixed with oil.  </li>
            <li> It was a glob of dark gray/brown dead skin mixed with oil.  </li>
            <li> As for my arms and legs, the reason I bought this is because I always had these weird red dots which I don&#x27;t normally see on other people.</li>
            <li> The technology behind it is remarkably simple; it&#x27;s just a stainless steel, dull blade on a razor-like handle.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get all the skin off like other products do.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make any difference one way or the other.</li>
            <li> Omg, this way too rough for the skin!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how other viewers didnt get any results.</li>
            <li> It takes some time to actually see effects from le edge, you definitely need to have been in the shower for at least 10 minutes of soaking time  to see it removing dead skin from your body.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> After searching six decades for help with my KP, I find Le Edge to be extremely helpful.</li>
            <li> It is similar to a small ice scraper with a metal edge.  </li>
            <li> No gunk like other reviewers said they saw.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this at all(which is sad because I really wanted this to work!).</li>
            <li> I received the Le Edge today and tried it on what I thought was my clean face...was I ever wrong!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try it on my very rough calluses on my feet after a foot soak.</li>
            <li> I only use this about 3 times a week on my body and daily on my feet (as a nurse the poor things get worked to death)</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m helping or hurting when I use it, my skin looks a little red afterwards.</li>
            <li> Use a dull butter knife to scrape your skin and you will get the same result.</li>
            <li> I saw this exfoliator, I thought it might help to \\&quot;raise\\&quot; both layers of hair on my legs so that the razor could reach it all at once (hard to explain unless your hair grows the same way), and it did!  </li>
            <li> Was a little skeptical at first</li>
            <li> All of the products geared for KP are expensive and while they may help a little, nothing seems to completely alleviate the symptoms (from what i understand, there is no cure, only symptom control).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re someone who suffers from KP.  </li>
            <li> Well, this product got rid of it when no powerful astringent or loofah could.</li>
            <li> Not worth</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I can also use this on my face, and it very obviously scrapes off excess makeup (I just avoid my eyes - too delicate for this thing)</li>
            <li> It was absolutely disgusting, but incredibly surprising too.  </li>
            <li> It was absolutely disgusting, but incredibly surprising too.  </li>
            <li> This is probably the most worthless piece of plastic I could have paid money for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, if you have KP like I do, or just generally rough and uneven skin, try this little guy, but REMEMBER THE OIL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, if you have KP like I do, or just generally rough and uneven skin, try this little guy, but REMEMBER THE OIL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to see all the dead skin like some other reviewers said.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll save you the trouble of endless buying and product searches.</li>
            <li> Skin feels smoother, softer, and less congested Fewer ingrown hairs after epilating legs</li>
            <li> Before getting rid of it tried it on my freshly washed nose &amp; I couldn&#x27;t believe how much oil/impurities it pushed out those horrible pores I had for years!</li>
            <li> When I look at them now, I think they&#x27;re less concentrated than before.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s already less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It did help my KP and takes less effort than the Baiden Mitten.</li>
            <li> I have noticed improvement and less irritation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 30 year old female and I suffer from something called keratosis pilaris or chicken skin.</li>
            <li> I know my skin has at least one flake of dry skin.  </li>
            <li> day, I soaked in a bath with dead sea salt (Minera) for like an half hour.</li>
            <li> I get either nothing or very little from any other part of my body.</li>
            <li> Im a pole fitness instructor and we use very little lotion to avoid slipping however ashy skin can be as slippery as lotion on your skin!</li>
            <li> Rosy glow, for a little while afterwards</li>
            <li> I can see it doing a little something on my feet, but that&#x27;s not the area</li>
            <li> After I get out of the bath, I notice my skin is a little smoother.</li>
            <li> then use this little tool.  </li>
            <li> This little device has done wonders for both my mom and</li>
            <li> Not really worth buying!</li>
            <li> This little gadget does wonders.</li>
            <li> and I felt like this didn&#x27;t do anything for me that a little exfoliating soap couldn&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> Then I happened to look at my armpits and was amazed they weren&#x27;t as dark!</li>
            <li> THIS DOES DO A LITTLE EXFOLIATING</li>
            <li> As a serious downside, the handle is not nearly as sanitary as the metal scraping bit.</li>
            <li> Also my underarms have lightened up a bit due to no more deodorant residue and lack of dead skin.</li>
            <li> It was a little too harsh to use on my face with just water, so I bought almond oil and castor oil.</li>
            <li> but this sloughed off so much dead skin with so little effort.</li>
            <li> Well, it did work on the back of my arm (tiny chicken bumps) and my legs and feet.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Nothing came of this - a waste of money and time.  </li>
            <li> Prepare to be grossed out by the amount of dead skin</li>
            <li> after all of the obsessive exfoliation, I was still scraping off tons of dead skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t find much dead skin on it after showering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been u.sing it a few times a week for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> It gets the dead skin off.</li>
            <li> Tried it twice as directed and it doesn&#x27;t remove any dead skin.</li>
            <li> Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Suncreen, creams, oils, cleansers, dead skin - they all leave residue that gets caked into our skin, and this tool dislodges it and removes it.</li>
            <li> The dead skin and residue will be gone, and my skin will be moisturized, killing two birds with one stone.</li>
            <li> It seems to have gotten worse in recent years, probably since about 2009.</li>
            <li> I bought this for KP (ketosis pilaris) on my arms, so I was hoping to scrape off some dead skin from that area, but I got nothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not comfortable on the skin</li>
            <li> You have to let something sit on ur skin to loosen the dead cells.  </li>
            <li> I glided this thing over my foot and still can&#x27;t believe how much dead skin came off.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This does the same thing a pair of scissors does and worse.  </li>
            <li> The trapped keratin is removed, and your body no longer has to be irritated by it.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> and with a bit of baby oil) it removes all the dead skin, including my KP.  </li>
            <li> waste of money for me just scratches my legs</li>
            <li> I use mine everyday.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had so few zits.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any sort of soap or lotion on my face since I&#x27;ve only ever found those to make things worse.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money</li>
            <li> works to remove dead skin but it did nothing for my K.P.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> but I think it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> this(I tried it a few times just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t crazy or somehow doing it wrong)</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;goo\\&quot; (dirt and oil and dead skin) that scraped off in the warm water was truly disgusting.</li>
            <li> I found this item to be too extreme for my delicate skin, I am terrified to use it.</li>
            <li> Pretty much useless on feet, maybe mine are just so tough they need a foot file.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the bad reviews on Amazon I lowered my expectation from when I first saw it on QVC.</li>
            <li> I was totally shocked to see how much gunk came off of my face!</li>
            <li> So, when I just use it in the shower, it&#x27;s not very effective.  </li>
            <li> But hey I seen a very little amount .</li>
            <li> oh and don&#x27;t press too hard, it will distress ur skin for a few days and  can be tender.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my husband who doesn&#x27;t use any exfoliating products and had no better luck on him</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it makes a difference in the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li> Even after all of the obsessive exfoliation, I was still scraping off tons of dead skin!  </li>
            <li> Not sure why some say it doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not exactly sure</li>
            <li> This does not work, don&#x27;t waste your time or money !</li>
            <li> Not sure at this point if it will get rid of my KP</li>
            <li> usually use it with soap on my body, and today with nothing but water on my face, but I&#x27;m going to start rubbing coconut oil into my skin and using it at the end of my shower.</li>
            <li> Even if you do not see a lot of dead skin coming off (after repeated uses you might not!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from keratosis pilaris (KP) for the past, oh, 15-20 years or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to feel like I bought yet another useless product.</li>
            <li> I actually call this thing my strigil instead of Le Edge, which I think is a silly name.</li>
            <li> I actually call this thing my strigil instead of Le Edge, which I think is a silly name.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the combination I used put this thing into motion</li>
            <li> Not really sure about this device yet.</li>
            <li> It is less time consuming than the serious sugar/salt scrubs I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> BUT, NOT SURE</li>
            <li> Fighting Keratosis Pilaris for the past 6 years and have tried a lot of stuff.</li>
            <li> Kinda sharp even for tough skin.</li>
            <li> I had a little bump on my back that kept scabbing over (sorry!)</li>
            <li> just rub a little on wet skin in the shower and scrape the dead, dirty skin away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I probably use it in weird ways (I run it across every inch of my body), but it is so helpful for my really dry skin.</li>
            <li> Don‚Äôt push too hard when using.</li>
            <li> Removes very thick oil and dead skin esp.</li>
            <li> This was not effective for me.  </li>
            <li> Chemical exfoliants seemed to plateau after using them 3-4 times, and the physical exfoliants just weren&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> Total disappointment, and I threw away the packaging, so no return.</li>
            <li> No more bumps in 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> Everyday use!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small.</li>
            <li> Dont have to worry about cutting myself, but it&#x27;s been a long time since that has happened.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> and I was a little skeptical about the Le Edge Body Exfliator.  </li>
            <li> There are a few reviews on here complaining, and I think those people are the wrong skin type for this.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not a good start.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it hurts, you&#x27;re pressing too hard!</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower under my arms and NO MORE bumps!!  </li>
            <li> this tool is not only painful but also useless.</li>
            <li> As a result, the dead skin buildup is crazy.</li>
            <li> a pencil eraser leaves behind?  </li>
            <li> I was completely aghast at how much thick, caked-up gunk came off under the blade of the scraper.</li>
            <li> What I ended up with was that both of my legs had bad red streak marks resembling a bad day with a razor after shaving.  </li>
            <li> useless altogether, what a racket to sell this item</li>
            <li> It was shocking to me how much actually came off!</li>
            <li> (eww sorry) from shaving.</li>
            <li> I even used it behind my ears!</li>
            <li> the wrong way along the blade</li>
            <li> Either they were holding it in the wrong angle or trying to use it somewhere</li>
            <li> I was amazed and appalled by the accumulation of dead skin cells this tool sweeps away.</li>
            <li> Completely useless product.</li>
            <li> Maybe i&#x27;m using it wrong.</li>
            <li> I know that sounds weird, but I don&#x27;t have any breakouts in that area or anywhere on my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually angry about being duped on this, and I cannot get over these fake reviews.</li>
            <li> This tool is useless without it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive for a modified ice scraper.</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> Sorry that I couldn&#x27;t say nicer things about this thing, but if it doesn&#x27;t work, it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, for the past couple of weeks, I had been rigorously (and, at times, painfully!)</li>
            <li> My pores have continued to shrink and it removes the buildup that led to nasty little blackheads.</li>
            <li> Does not do anything for someone who suffers from KP.  </li>
            <li> Totally disappointing.</li>
            <li> Have to use it for 1-2 weeks on chicken bumps.</li>
            <li> Now into day three, it&#x27;s not so dirty, but I have satisfaction that I don&#x27;t have buildup.</li>
            <li> The results were always disappointing.</li>
            <li> It makes for an embarrassing, uncomfortable, itchy, and sometimes even painful situation.</li>
            <li> If you use this product you will not believe how much dead skin it removes!!!!!</li>
            <li> So of course I started gliding it over my legs which I have a bad case of keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> but once I got used to using it, it wasn&#x27;t painful.</li>
            <li> Can be kinda painful while scraping but doesn&#x27;t cut or otherwise damage.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m disappointed with it, but I&#x27;m not ecstatic about it either.</li>
            <li> &amp; I felt disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> For now I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> This thing is so stupid.</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> Holy crap.</li>
            <li> Holy crap.</li>
            <li> I hate they are going to stop making them.</li>
            <li> What a monumental piece of crap...</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I am now 41 and going through menopause and my KP is the worst it has ever been.  </li>
            <li> After every swipe I scrape off the nasty stuff that came off my fave with a thumbnail.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I already use an exfoliating body wash and this did absolutely nothing but redden my skin. I tried it on my husband who doesn&#x27;t use any exfoliating products and had no better luck on him</li>
            <li> Scraping the edge of a dinner plate along your skin would be as effective as this item, its a complete waste of money</li>
            <li> This thing works! Great buy!</li>
            <li> I need to exfoliate my skin almost daily. I always am quick to try out a new product. This one was okay. It didn&#x27;t get all the skin off like other products do. I use it on my legs before shaving and it does help with getting a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I suffer from KP bumps on my arms and figured why not give this a try? It really works! My arms are smoother and less bumpy and it works really well on my legs too. Just don&#x27;t overdo it... It can leave red marks if you are too aggressive.</li>
            <li> Does not do anything for someone who suffers from KP.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It works okay, i was hoping it would work better</li>
            <li> This was not effective for me.  I bought it to help with KP on my arms, no impact.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these on a whim, and just came back to order two more as backups! I never want to be without this exfoliator again! I have KP on my arms and thighs, as well as stucco keratosis on the tops of my feet. I also have very sensitive, atopic skin, so I have to be careful about how aggressively I exfoliate. As another reviewer suggested, this tool is super effective if you first use an exfoliating cream such as Amlactin or Glytone and let the cream sit on your skin overnight. The next day in the shower, just use your regular cleanser and run this tool over anywhere you wish to exfoliate. If it hurts, you&#x27;re pressing too hard! This is also excellent for callouses on the heels of your feet. I do a quick pass on my heels while in the shower, and also run it over the tops of my feet to exfoliate any dry bumps I have there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing (and gross) to see the dead skin that comes off with this tool. What&#x27;s even more amazing is how smooth it makes your skin. It has greatly reduced the KP on my legs, and smoothed out some weird bumps on my arms. I would highly recommend this to anyone who deals with KP or bumpy, rough skin.</li>
            <li> I used this on my face and OH MY GOD. The \\&quot;goo\\&quot; (dirt and oil and dead skin) that scraped off in the warm water was truly disgusting. I ran it over my face multiple times until nastiness was no longer coming off my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am 22 and have acne-prone skin and I am excited to add this to my skin care routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my body, and no goo scraped off, but I believe that it is doing something simply because of what an impact it makes on my face. My skin definitely feels nice after I use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As well, I use it for an unintended purpose. I have hyperhydrosis with my hands. As a result, the dead skin buildup is crazy. Le Edge really helps scraping off the dead skin, way better than any pumice stone I&#x27;ve tried using for that purpose!</li>
            <li> This has not worked very well for me and even created some serious skin chafing which I am still struggling to correct. YMMV.</li>
            <li> useless altogether, what a racket to sell this item</li>
            <li> Nothing came of this - a waste of money and time.  I am someone who has plenty of skin to exfoliate and was expecting a nice cleaning tool.  Absolutely no skin was exfoliated with this counter to my expectations.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful easy to use product that peeled off my dead skin cells with ease.  My feet are sooo soft!!!</li>
            <li> No big deal. Not really sure if it makes a difference in the way my skin feels. I guess it is cheaper than a clarisonic tho</li>
            <li> Used as directed with no results.  There was plenty of flaky skin and such to remove, but using this did absolutely nothing.  Scrubbing with an exfoliating cloth made a profound difference where this tool made none.</li>
            <li> There are a few reviews on here complaining, and I think those people are the wrong skin type for this. This works best for people with thick, oily skin. If you get ring-around-the-collar when wearing white shirts, or you can rub skin off in the shower, you are the skin type for this. It essentially &amp;#34;shaves&amp;#34; the dead skin off (not a blade, or sharp, though, it&#x27;s safe). Prepare to be grossed out by the amount of dead skin this will remove- you can visibly see how effective this is.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this in hopes it will help with keratosis pilaris, haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know for sure but I imagine it will reduce them somewhat.</li>
            <li> SUMMARY: This product has changed my life.  No exaggeration.  I have never, ever, been so pleasantly surprised by a beauty related product.  Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE NITTY GRITTY:&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical as to how great this product would be.  I had recently purchased an epilator, but was having a lot of issues with ingrown hairs.  Also, I&#x27;ve always had mild keratosis pilaris (KP), but had pretty much given up on it getting better.  Since having the ingrown hair issues, I had tried all kinds of solutions: expensive natural scrubs, expensive chemical scrubs, home-made scrubs of sugar and coconut oil (which is still an awesome home-made product, FYI), dry-brushing, etc. etc.  I was not seeing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched far and wide to find a solution, and came across this.  As a huge nerd, I remembered hearing about Strigils (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strigil), or metal tools which were popular during Roman times for skin cleaning.  I was intrigued.  So I went to Amazon and read reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews, which you may have noticed, are mixed.  There are lots of folks who, like me, have claimed that this product has changed their lives.  There are also folks who are not at all impressed.  Ultimately, I figured, &amp;#34;For $12 bucks, I&#x27;ll take a chance.  I&#x27;ve tried everything else!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the exfoliator arrived, and I went about my usual bathing routine (which mirrors how the Romans used it, and I think this is KEY to getting the best results): soaking for 10 minutes in a warm bath with a couple tablespoons of coconut oil, then exfoliation.  Keep in mind, for the past couple of weeks, I had been rigorously (and, at times, painfully!) exfoliating EVERY DAY.  My skin should have been pretty damned clear of dead cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I started the process.  It&#x27;s simple, and it felt good.  Obviously, you need to be careful on more delicate skin, and it&#x27;s a bit awkward on the bonier joints (elbows and knees).  So, I&#x27;m scraping with my foot in the air, and all of a sudden something dark falls on my chest.  I figured it must have been something that somehow got stuck to my foot.  But that&#x27;s not what it was at all.  It was a glob of dark gray/brown dead skin mixed with oil.  It was absolutely disgusting, but incredibly surprising too.  I looked at the exfoliator, and saw that it was full of dead skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after all of the obsessive exfoliation, I was still scraping off tons of dead skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the VERY first use, my skin was incredibly soft and smooth.  Quickest results I&#x27;ve ever seen from any beauty product I&#x27;ve ever had.  By the third use, the KP was almost invisible...and I hadn&#x27;t even purchased this item for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is cheap, easy to use, and incredibly efficient.  For those who did not have a good result, I suggest that you soak in the tub with oil first.  I&#x27;ve done this in the shower, with coconut oil but without soaking, and my results were nowhere near as satisfying (more oil scraped off, not a lot of dead skin).  I cannot stress how much of a difference this product has made.  There are parts of my body that I didn&#x27;t even realize could EVER be so soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this, and buy it now.  This is my first ever review on Amazon, and I did this just because I feel so strongly about this product.  You will not be disappointed!!!ed it must have been something that somehow got stuck to my foot.  But that&#x27;s not what it was at all.  It was a glob of dark gray/brown dead skin mixed with oil.

            <li> This does work- I find it best after soaking in a bath and applying oil to my skin. I have found a mit I prefer to this bit I still use this to help on my back or legs.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Use as directed. Works best if you take bath/shower first (for dead skin to soften up) and use this at the end of your bathing time.</li>
            <li> If you have access to a steam room, it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> I use this exclusively on callouses and it works amazingly well.  My feet feel like they are 16 again!  If you buy it only for callouses, you&#x27;ll be extremely happy with the results.  I just added four to my shopping cart for Christmas presents.</li>
            <li> I received the Le Edge today and tried it on what I thought was my clean face...was I ever wrong! After a couple of swipes I saw the dry skin and oil come right off. The price is also great, thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> I did not feel as if my skin became smoother but I didn&#x27;t find much dead skin on it after showering. But hey I seen a very little amount .</li>
            <li> I was not at all impressed with this product. Its blunt, squeegee like \\&quot;exfoliating\\&quot; mechanism could be compared to an ice scraper. In fact, that is exactly how this product is supposed to work. When I used it, however, the scraper removed nothing from my body. The proof of this is in the fact that there was no debris at all on the tool, not even when I used it on rougher areas like my feet. I believe for this product to work, one would have to apply pressure to the point of pain in order to get any exfoliating effect whatsoever.  The bottom line is you can buy an ice scraper for a lot less and probably get about the same results!</li>
            <li> I bought this product in desperation. I have battled keratosis pilaris (it&#x27;s on my upper arms, forearms, it&#x27;s even starting to show up on my neck!) for most of my life and have tried many things to combat this issue. I&#x27;ve been u.sing it a few times a week for a few weeks now. I use it in the shower on my arms, face, and neck. Although it&#x27;s kind of gross to see, I love that I can see the stuff that&#x27;s being removed. It doesn&#x27;t hurt, although it does leave my neck a bit red for a few minutes after.</li>
            <li> This little tool is amazing!!! I agree with prior posters a big key too it is coconut oil. The oil makes a huge difference, they should sell it paired together, lol. Even when you don&#x27;t have much to exfoliate your skin still becomes soooooo smooth!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this. I wasn&#x27;t looking for it, but it cropped up as a suggestion, and I thought it was worth a try. With my really dry skin (especially on my face and neck) it helps SOOO much. I use it every time I shower to help remove the layers of makeup and dry skin that accumulate. It was shocking to me how much actually came off! It is also great for my lips. I wet them down and then pull the tool across my lips to remove that gross skin that accumulates, and it leaves them PERFECTLY smooth for lipstick application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I probably use it in weird ways (I run it across every inch of my body), but it is so helpful for my really dry skin. It also is AWESOME on my calloused feet! I hold it like a razor and pull it across my heels and it removes SOOO much skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the only downside is that it gets a bit gross if I don&#x27;t make sure to wipe it down with a washcloth each time. But it was definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> I found this item to be too extreme for my delicate skin, I am terrified to use it.</li>
            <li> You can see the gross stuff being scraped off of your skin if you use it in the same place enough times, but I don&#x27;t notice a difference at all after drying off or using it after a few days. It&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter uses this to keep her KP (keratosis pilaris) under control, in combination with Gold Bond&#x27;s Rough and Bumpy Skin Daily Therapy Cream http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MMKAM5E/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1. Although I didn&#x27;t care for Le Edge when I tried it on my arms and legs in the shower, I think it may work better after soaking a long time. I&#x27;m going to try it on my very rough calluses on my feet after a foot soak. I bought the pink one because it was a couple of dollars cheaper than the blue one, who knows why.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t do what it promises</li>
            <li> I can see why some had problems with this, when I used with just water at the end of a hot shower it was entirely ineffective. Gave it another shot the next day and scraped while I was lathered up with a glycerin based soap (Dr. Woods). Suddenly this thing was VERY effective....&#x27;nuff said.  Pros: Easy once you get the hang of it Skin feels smoother, softer, and less congested Fewer ingrown hairs after epilating legs Mild KP is a LOT less apparent...dare I say vanishing? I dare not just yet. Rosy glow, for a little while afterwards at least  Cons: Expensive for what it is - a butter knife will do but isn&#x27;t as nice or easy to hold in the shower (UPDATE: discovered a butter knife isn&#x27;t curved right...gave myself stripes) Time consuming Go through a lot more soap  I haven&#x27;t tried the other reviewers suggestion of going Old Roman and using oil, which might be fun down the road. For now I&#x27;m satisfied with the convenience of using it in the shower and think the results are worth the extra time and soap.</li>
            <li> While this did seem to remove some dead skin, I was left still peeling. I tried the Salux towel based on several recommendations from friends and WOAH. That is what you want to be using! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had a flake since!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been scraping my skin to exfoliate for years now. But I never knew there was a tool for it! ;) (or that it was a technique used by the Egyptians) - This little scraper works great! I would highly recommend it if you&#x27;re into heavy exfoliation. I use it everywhere - body and (parts of) face. I know many women who use actual razors to achieve similar results, but I would never recommend doing that. This tool works wonders and leaves you feeling clean and soft. *LOVE IT*</li>
            <li> I ordered one of these a couple of months back, and I have to say it has really improved my skin. I can&#x27;t speak for people who do not have dry skin or dandruff issues, but as someone that has to constantly wipe off their shoulders every 20 minutes or so, this is the scraper to get. This will in no way cure your flaky skin completely, but the difference is absolutely visible after just one use.</li>
            <li> Totally disappointing. Does not work unless you have  elephant hide. Use a metal edged ruler in the bath instead.  Can&#x27;t hold a candle to a good salt/olive oil scrub.it&#x27;s a very  cheaply made window scraper for the Barbi corvette.  Waste of money</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make any difference one way or the other.</li>
            <li> Have used this three times now and I really love using it.    I&#x27;m using it everywhere including face and neck and it has worked beautifully from the first time I used it.    I had a little bump on my back that kept scabbing over (sorry!) and it just would not heal!  It had been there for about a month.  The first day I used this on that area it never re-scabbed and healed right up.  My face feels and looks very smooth.  My skin just feels great all over.  It even feels nice while you are using it - not at all irritating.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will. Removes very thick oil and dead skin esp. from face and back. Not sure why some say it doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about buying this based on the mixed reviews. A lot of people like and don&#x27;t like it. I used it after being in a warm shower for about 8 minutes and sure enough, there was a lot of build up on the blade. My skin did feel softer afterwards but with continued use, I didn&#x27;t notice a whole lot of improvement. The only time I have witnessed any build-up was the first use so maybe that&#x27;s a good or bad sign. Who knows. It was pretty cheap so no big deal.</li>
            <li> I ordered La Edge hoping that it will help me to cure KP. But it has no effect on KP what so ever. For skin exfoliating its not that useful.</li>
            <li> Omg, this way too rough for the skin! I hate it. Never purchasing again!</li>
            <li> It gets the dead skin off. I like using it for my feet. Nice exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I love trying new skincare products, so I couldn&#x27;t resist this one. It does work, however, I feel I am better off with just an everyday loofa, sponge, or washcloth. It only works when your skin is wet (so if you want a quick shower before work, this won&#x27;t make that happen), and doesn&#x27;t always seem to do that much. Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m disappointed with it, but I&#x27;m not ecstatic about it either.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and in good condition. It works well to remove what it is supposed to once the skin is properly saturated in the shower. As a serious downside, the handle is not nearly as sanitary as the metal scraping bit. It occasionally needs to be bleached and needs to be scrubbed almost every day itself since mold tends to grow in the handle. I like to keep a clean shower and this does interfere a bit.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing ever. My skin has never felt so soft. I&#x27;ve found that using a body oil first (like jojoba or olive oil) and then using this really helps get all the dead skin and dirt off. Afterwards, I use the Amlactin lotion and my skin feels great. It&#x27;s also helped with my Kertosis pilaris. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small. I tried it out dry on my foot around my toes. I could see the dirt being scrapped off and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. My foot is smoother now and I can&#x27;t wait to use it more and more.</li>
            <li> It works... Kinda, but it&#x27;s a pain in the butt to use. Feels pretty rough on my skin too... Not sure if I&#x27;m helping or hurting when I use it, my skin looks a little red afterwards. But it definitely exfoliates I can tell you that.</li>
            <li> So it does get some of that body dirt off but not always and it&#x27;s done nothing for my bumps</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help with my KP, the first couple tries I wasn&#x27;t lucky in removing any dead/excess skin, it was frustrating &amp; I felt disappointed. Before getting rid of it tried it on my freshly washed nose &amp; I couldn&#x27;t believe how much oil/impurities it pushed out those horrible pores I had for years! Gave it a second chance in the shower after making sure my skin became soft from the steam &amp; added a little more pressure &amp; it worked. The amount of dead skin differs from one body part to another, &amp; if you usually scrub you won&#x27;t be able to exfoliate much with this tool.</li>
            <li> It works! Use it each bath I take</li>
            <li> This is probably the most worthless piece of plastic I could have paid money for. It doesn&#x27;t do anything. I have used it while showering, after showering, and even after soaking for 10 minutes. Nope, it doesn&#x27;t do anything except make my skin red. Maybe if I soaked in a hot bath for 20 minutes and then used it, it would work. But in that case any old loofah would do the same thing as this so-called exfoliator. The only redeeming factor is that it seems to be well manufactured and the steel blade looks like it&#x27;s made of quality steel. Now if only I could find some use for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not exactly sure if this works but I have been using it for almost 2 months so I should say my piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used this on my arms and legs (remember to wash yourself with hot water and apply soap first btw), there was definitely some gunk there that I scrapped off. Works on my face as well. I don&#x27;t think it did much on my face but I feel like oily I guess. As for my arms and legs, the reason I bought this is because I always had these weird red dots which I don&#x27;t normally see on other people. When I look at them now, I think they&#x27;re less concentrated than before. Still there though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in the end, I would recommend using this as an exfoliator as long as your skin isn&#x27;t too sensitive. I rubbed the dull blade against my skin pretty hard but it doesn&#x27;t really hurt for me. Find a good lotion or cream to apply afterwards for better effect. By the way, this thing is pretty small, about the size of your hand (mine&#x27;s is small though) so you&#x27;ll have to be careful of slipping and dropping it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well for me!</li>
            <li> good for keratosis and ingrown hairs (eww sorry) from shaving. Also use it for blackheads on my face and it works pretty good. Its not the most magical thing ever, but its not bad</li>
            <li> Tried it twice as directed and it doesn&#x27;t remove any dead skin. I thought it is like a body scrub (as described), but it is not. It might be good for in-grown hair on hands and legs (not thicker hairs) only. Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Works well. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This does not work, don&#x27;t waste your time or money !</li>
            <li> Works great but its kind of gross seeing all the dead skin you can get.</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to use, love it!</li>
            <li> Not sure at this point if it will get rid of my KP but I&#x27;ve been using it combines with coconut oil and gold bond rough and bumpy for only 3 days and it&#x27;s already less noticeable. Def works better if you use oil awhile prior to a hot shower. Considering using both all over my body during next shower just to exfoliate everything.</li>
            <li> Great item to use for KP!</li>
            <li> Not the amazing results I expected. Definitely noticed the scum that came from scraping my face, but after using on my body I found it to be a bit softer, but I can get better results from a regular exfoliating brush. I do recommend for using along with hair removal creams.</li>
            <li> Works very well to get all the dirt off - just takes a while to get used to this method.</li>
            <li> Fabulous, works great!</li>
            <li> Love this!!!  I use it in the shower under my arms and NO MORE bumps!!  Same thing with my bikini line and anywhere on my body I get bumps or pimples... helps clear the skin more quickly!!</li>
            <li> The Le Edge Full Body Exfoliator - Pink is not at all what I expected: no visible/noticable deadskin removal ...</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot, although I&#x27;ve had to spend a bit of time figuring out how to use it most effectively.  What I&#x27;ve found is that the amount of exfoliation I achieve really depends on how much I open my pores.  So, when I just use it in the shower, it&#x27;s not very effective.  But if I start by taking a warm/hot bath for 15 minutes and then use it -- it is fantastic.  Also, I&#x27;ve had to practice getting the angle correct.  Going around my elbows, for example, is a skill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this primarily on my arms, to help with KP, and I&#x27;m happy with the results I&#x27;m seeing when I use it after steaming my skin for a little while.  My KP isn&#x27;t gone, but it&#x27;s decreased by about 60%, which is huge for me.  I will definitely continue using this a few times a week, in conjunction with a steamy bath.</li>
            <li> i was exited to try this product when it arrived, and for the first week it did remove dead skin but about three weeks in the meal bit became sharp, almost like a razor. i did cut my finger(Twice) while using this product and discontinued use.</li>
            <li> This exfoliates better than any scrub, most of which have oils, or the exfoliating gloves.  It&#x27;s quick to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this tool for almost a year now, and am thoroughly impressed with it. It is the most successful tool I&#x27;ve found to remove the thick, dead skin from the bottoms of my feet. I love using it all over my feet in the shower - tops, sides, bottoms, backs, and watching the skin slough away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to Central America over winter break and used tons of sunscreen on my back and shoulders, and used shower puff exfoliators with soap to wash and exfoliate my back. A week ago - three weeks after returning from my trip, mind you - I asked my husband to scrape my back with the Le Edge. I was completely aghast at how much thick, caked-up gunk came off under the blade of the scraper. Yuck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I used it on my face for the first time, and it was the same story. I never thought I needed to use it on my face because I use the Clarisonic as well as weekly at-home glycolic acid peels, which I thought did a great job of exfoliating my skin. I was totally shocked to see how much gunk came off of my face! Suncreen, creams, oils, cleansers, dead skin - they all leave residue that gets caked into our skin, and this tool dislodges it and removes it. I even used it behind my ears! My face looks so dewey after scraping it, and I can&#x27;t stop touching my skin - so soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use it with soap on my body, and today with nothing but water on my face, but I&#x27;m going to start rubbing coconut oil into my skin and using it at the end of my shower. The dead skin and residue will be gone, and my skin will be moisturized, killing two birds with one stone.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as promised. Disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is an interesting tool I am using in my whole body exfoliation routine. Even if you do not see a lot of dead skin coming off (after repeated uses you might not!) it helps give the closest, smoothest shave when used BEFORE shaving.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t help as much as a loofah or exfoliator does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from keratosis pilaris (KP) for the past, oh, 15-20 years or so. Basically, most of my life. It seems to have gotten worse in recent years, probably since about 2009. In my quest to rid myself of the bumps, I&#x27;ve used AmLactin, Glytone, Gold Bond Rough and Bumpy lotion, the Salux cloth, exfoliating gloves, AHA lotions, vitamins, you name it. I&#x27;ve tried chemical and physical exfoliants but since I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin, harsh chemicals really bother me and make me itchy and/or red. Plus, all of those things only gave me mediocre results at best. Chemical exfoliants seemed to plateau after using them 3-4 times, and the physical exfoliants just weren&#x27;t cutting it. On top of all that, shaving my legs was extremely painful for me because of the bumpies. Lots of cuts and just generally unsmooth feeling. Blah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So every few months I get on a new kick to find something that works and since spring and t-shirts and shorts were coming around, of course I was on the hunt. I can&#x27;t remember where I first read about Le Edge but I was intrigued. It&#x27;s based off of an ancient Greek and Roman beauty tool called a strigil which was basically a sharp edge (NOT a razor though, more like a butter knife) dragged along the skin to remove dead skin and debris. Sounds legit. What the heck, let&#x27;s give it a shot. Reviews were so-so, but I&#x27;m willing to try anything. Ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get this thing a couple days later and inspect it. It pretty much looks like a razor, but again, it&#x27;s NOT a razor. You can&#x27;t cut yourself with this thing unless you&#x27;re a total klutz. It&#x27;s just a stainless steel edge. I know from reading reviews that your skin has to be wet for this to work (more on that in a second) but I drag it along my arm (where I have some KP) completely dry to see what it does. It does nothing. That&#x27;s not a good start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get in a hot bath and let my skin soak for a while to see if that improves things. Eh. It BARELY works at that point. I can see it doing a little something on my feet, but that&#x27;s not the area I&#x27;m most concerned about. I&#x27;m starting to feel like I bought yet another useless product. Then I remember that I have a tub of coconut oil sitting nearby, yet ANOTHER thing I&#x27;ve used to try and treat my KP. I put that on my skin to soften it more, just for the laughs at that point. I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GUYS. OIL DOES SOMETHING. If you have used this product wet or dry and seen zero results, you NEED to introduce oil to the mix. That&#x27;s how the Romans and Greeks did it too, they used an oil bath! What I do is get my skin wet, put a tiny bit of oil on, and then pull the strigil across my skin. At first all that will come up is loose and liquidy oil, but with every subsequent pull, the residue will become thicker and grayer, and THAT&#x27;S the magical skin debris everyone talks about. I almost can&#x27;t believe Le Edge doesn&#x27;t mention that you NEED OIL to make this work. I saw so many reviews where people complained it did nothing and it acted more like a squeegee. And yes, that&#x27;s exactly what happened to me when my skin was just wet. It was just a squeegee. Not with oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I continue along dragging and dragging, getting more and more skin. It doesn&#x27;t hurt but it does leave my skin red just from the pressure. After I get out of the bath, I notice my skin is a little smoother. Okay. That&#x27;s fine I guess. 10 minutes later, even better. 10 minutes after that, EVEN BETTER. I was actually amazed. All of this on top of the fact that it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I need you guys to understand that I have the most sensitive, itchy skin in the world and this didn&#x27;t bother me at all! The next day, my skin was the smoothest it&#x27;s ever been. Unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep finding new places to use it and the thing is freakin&#x27; incredible. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s taken me this long to find something that works. Now for those pesky red spots (which I will admit, do look a little better! Less inflammation overall I guess).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, if you have KP like I do, or just generally rough and uneven skin, try this little guy, but REMEMBER THE OIL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I actually call this thing my strigil instead of Le Edge, which I think is a silly name. I feel very fancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 1/13/17: Nothing else to add to my review, except WHOA the price of this thing went up from when I bought it! Holy crap. I think I spent something like 10 bucks, and now it&#x27;s 60?! That&#x27;s ridiculous. DO NOT spend 60 bucks on this thing. Wait and see if the price goes back down.s inflammation overall I guess).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, if you have KP like I do, or just generally rough and uneven skin, try this little guy, but REMEMBER THE OIL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.

            <li> This does absolutely NOTHING. Use a dull butter knife to scrape your skin and you will get the same result.</li>
            <li> I have used this on various parts of my body. I use it about once or twice a week. I get lots of &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; from my face and neck. I get either nothing or very little from any other part of my body. I don&#x27;t know if that is Le Edge&#x27;s fault or simply because only my face and neck need exfoliation. I think it&#x27;s the latter.  I bought this for KP (ketosis pilaris) on my arms, so I was hoping to scrape off some dead skin from that area, but I got nothing. It works great on the face, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did cut my finger one time when I was attempting to clean it after using it. My fingers were soft and tender from the water and I moved my finger the wrong way along the blade and it sliced the tip of my finger. I&#x27;d say be careful when using it because it can cut you, but it&#x27;s definitely not as sharp as a razor blade.</li>
            <li> The best for KP. I have KP on my arms with inflammation. Use twice a day with several gentle scrapes on each side of the arm, covering the entire area. Best used in shower when body is wet or use oil as lubricant. Way better than anything the dermatologists can do for you (and cheaper)!</li>
            <li> Some people like it, some don&#x27;t. An old Roman method that still works today. My husband loves it, my daughter... not so much.&lt;br /&gt;You can see the amount of dirt scraped off AFTER you&#x27;ve washed. Gets the pores clean.</li>
            <li> I bought and used for the fall, winter dry skin season. It&#x27;s not comfortable on the skin but it works for the dry skin bumps I get. I used for the first few weeks on my triceps and upper arms then I didn&#x27;t need anymore. I just use as needed. Good product.</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty cool. I use it in the shower but at the end after I&#x27;ve scrubbed myself and rinsed.  Sometimes I put on some coconut oil  or related my body with soap,  then use this little tool.  You have to let something sit on ur skin to loosen the dead cells.  I will say that the oil works best..oh and don&#x27;t press too hard, it will distress ur skin for a few days and  can be tender. I only use this about 3 times a week on my body and daily on my feet (as a nurse the poor things get worked to death)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. It&#x27;s been months and I think I might even have more keratosis.</li>
            <li> This little device has done wonders for both my mom and I. I hate they are going to stop making them. I just discovered them.</li>
            <li> Not sure why someone would give this 1 star or leave a review when they don&#x27;t even own the product.  I definitely don&#x27;t work for the company and I give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it the first time on my face and arms and I was amazed ( if not grossed out). It definitely removes dead skin, makeup and etc... From your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how other viewers didnt get any results. Either they were holding it in the wrong angle or trying to use it somewhere it wasn&#x27;t designed ( like the heel of your foot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or maybe those people have immaculate skin without any oil buildup or residue. As for me I&#x27;m not that blessed so I&#x27;ll keep using this :) hope this helps someone out.</li>
            <li> If you hate dead skin you&#x27;ll love this!!</li>
            <li> Actually life changing. I have KP and this made such a huge difference. I recommend it whole heartedly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the combination I used put this thing into motion but here&#x27;s what I did!&lt;br /&gt;I started off by making my own lactic acid lotion. 90% lactic acid from LotionCrafters, mixed it with my Jergen&#x27;s ultra healing lotion. Applied it overnight.&lt;br /&gt;Next day, I soaked in a bath with dead sea salt (Minera) for like an half hour. I glided this thing over my foot and still can&#x27;t believe how much dead skin came off. feet feel spa treated and refreshed. So of course I started gliding it over my legs which I have a bad case of keratosis pilaris. Always had rough bumpy legs. Not anymore! I still have all the black spots but not a single non-smooth spot. Now I can just buy a fading cream and I think I&#x27;ll have treated my skin condition</li>
            <li> This really gets dead skin off! It is amazing</li>
            <li> On the positive, I owned this for over a year, I kept it in the bottom of my shower and it never rusted. The metal part appeared to be as fresh and clean as the day I bought it. This is definitely a positive as it&#x27;s a tool that one drags against one&#x27;s skin. It does exfoliate well. Think of that skin that you can slough off with your fingernails after you&#x27;ve been in the shower for awhile, that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s removing. Not as well as fingernails though, you can still get some off afterwards. I have pretty sensitive skin, and using this once in awhile was ok, but using even two days in a row was extremely irritating to my skin. It would sometimes leave me red. The skin also builds up under the metal edge. In trying to clean the skin out from this edge with my finger once, the tool actually sliced open my fingertip and made me bled. After having this for over a year, I just didn&#x27;t consider it that useful and threw it out.</li>
            <li> Love using this with the Prolinc heel eliminator it makes callus heels scrap right off.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this exfoliator! It does exactly what it claims to do. I&#x27;ve read some of the reviews on here claiming that it doesn&#x27;t work, &amp; my only guess is they MUST be using it wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I mainly use it for scraping the rough skin off of my feet in the shower. This keeps them smooth between pedicures, &amp; is way more effective than those cheese-grater types of exfoliators. I also use it to remove the stubborn hair on my arms &amp; legs that won&#x27;t rinse off after using Nair. It is a very useful tool that I honestly can&#x27;t do without!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I bought this one on Amazon as a replacement for my original that I lost. I&#x27;d had the original one for years, &amp; it continued to work just as well as the day I first received it in the mail.</li>
            <li> It takes some time to actually see effects from le edge, you definitely need to have been in the shower for at least 10 minutes of soaking time  to see it removing dead skin from your body. It does not work unless your skin is really saturated with water, but if you are patient you will find that it does remove quite a bit !</li>
            <li> OMG this thing is amazing. You will be surprised all the junk that comes off your face I know I was. I recommend everyone to use LeEdge if you want smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I am SO HAPPY I found this. I was skeptical at first but it has made my rough bumpy arms silky smooth. I have tried tons of lotions and moisturizers for my arms, which get really rough, dry, and bumpy around my triceps area. Now I just use this exfoliator about once a week in the shower and I don&#x27;t have to use any lotions anymore and my arms feel perfectly smooth. The exfoliator is smaller than I expected but seems to be the perfect size for arms and legs. It is too big for my face. I found I have to push it into my skin a lot harder than I expected to get the desired result but once I got used to using it, it wasn&#x27;t painful. I&#x27;d suggest being really careful using it on fragile skin like the bikini area until you know for sure how much pressure to use. It is super easy to clean, it just rinses right off. I keep mine in the shower and use it after being under hot water for several minutes so my skin is really softened up before I use it. It has been great in the summer for getting all my sunscreen off as it doesn&#x27;t always all wash away with soap.</li>
            <li> This is one of those things that&#x27;s an absolute saving grace for a certain skin type, and will do little to nothing for everyone else.  When you&#x27;re rubbing your skin in the shower, ever notice tiny clumps of skin balling up under your fingertips, almost like the residue a pencil eraser leaves behind?  No? Well, then lucky you, you probably don&#x27;t need this.  If you know what I&#x27;m talking about, you&#x27;ll love this thing and wonder how you lived without it.  I was amazed and appalled by the accumulation of dead skin cells this tool sweeps away. It&#x27;s... well, a gray sludge of cellular debris that comes off. Completely won me over.  As another reviewer mentioned on her excellent review, I think that OIL makes this work better as I definitely notice it works much more effectively on naturally oilier areas of my skin. I would also think it would be useful as part of the treatment for keratosis pilaris.  I think this originally sold for about $30+; I&#x27;m not even sure if they&#x27;re still in production, so I&#x27;m ordering several in case the supply completely dries up.  A terrific little product for the right consumer.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and does just what it is supposed to do!  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for and exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Maybe a 5 % difference in my KP... Not really worth buying! Barely works and seems to be too rough at times.</li>
            <li> Just alright.  I didn&#x27;t think my skin felt smoother or looked better.</li>
            <li> I have chicken skin (Keratosis Pilaris) and this did a great job at exfoliating my skin. It&#x27;s much smoother. Much smoother.</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado where it is very dry. And Exfoliation is the key to healthy skin. This does a great job.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell a difference with this product.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I have had Keratosis Pilaris  for my entire life.  I have used every lotion, cream and exfoliator on the market.  I am now 41 and going through menopause and my KP is the worst it has ever been.  It is now not just on my upper arms; it is on my lower arms, my abdomen my chest, my legs, just everywhere.  I have recently switched to using pure coconut oil as a body moisturizer, as it is the only thing that does not sting, and keeps my very dry skin under control. I purchased this exfoliator a few days ago, and the effects are nothing short of miraculous. My skin is finally getting smooth again. If you have KP, you must give this a try.</li>
            <li> This does absolutely nothing. Literally a motel edge. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Buy a metal ruler. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to love this item from all the reviews I saw, but really it&#x27;s just so-so. The first time I used it, I was so excited. I thought I was going to see all the dead skin like some other reviewers said. Nope. Not a bit of it. Not until I got to my feet anyway. In that sense, it&#x27;s really great. It works better than most other foot scrapers. Occasionally I have my fianc√© use it on my back, which seems to help a little. But I&#x27;m not blown away by this product.</li>
            <li> I use it quite a lot on both my arms and legs</li>
            <li> Wanted it to work for my KP, but it didn&#x27;t !&lt;br /&gt;But my KP is very minimal, I don&#x27;t have a lot of white raised bumps for this tool to remove. But it did hurt in my arms and legs, I used very little pressure, maybe my skin is sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;Worked great for removing dead skin off my heels on my feet. It did not hurt working on my feet! I hope it&#x27;s works somewhere on you, but only worked for me on my feet, where I actually saw something on the blade.</li>
            <li> just get a korean italy towel. Its 2.99 on ebay. This is okay, but won&#x27;t be effective tbh. If you have eczema, cracked skin or ichthyosis, that is what you should be looking for. I&#x27;ll save you the trouble of endless buying and product searches.</li>
            <li> I had great hopes for this exfoliator.  What I ended up with was that both of my legs had bad red streak marks resembling a bad day with a razor after shaving.  A pouf does better work with exfoliating without leaving possible scars.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, not as well as I&#x27;d hoped on the face and legs, but helps a lot with the KP on my arms.</li>
            <li> Maybe I will learn to like this but I doubt it. It has a distinct smell of mildew though there&#x27;s no sign of mold anywhere. I believe a simple non-serrated butter knife would do the same job as this steel edge does. It does scrape off dead skin to some degree so the jury is still out on how I&#x27;ll feel about it if I use it a couple more times. For now I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> You have to have a specific type of dry skin for this to work I think. Doesn&#x27;t do anything for me, but I have a friend who loves it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. I have tried so many different exfoliates and still dead skin was left behind and you could tell from my foundation. With this my face gets super smooth and my foundation is flawless. It has also helped with my blackhead problem. I haven&#x27;t been getting nearly as many as I used to and it makes me feel so much more confident.</li>
            <li> I actually felt a difference after just one use.  It works especially well for exfoliating before applying a sunless tanning product.</li>
            <li> If you use this product you will not believe how much dead skin it removes!!!!! I use every time I take a bath and sometimes even on dry skin. It actually works and works great!!!!! Everyone needs one of these!!!!!</li>
            <li> This does the same thing a pair of scissors does and worse.  Dont have to worry about cutting myself, but it&#x27;s been a long time since that has happened. Do yourself a favor and save your money. Works a little, but not enough to warrant buying this.</li>
            <li> Completely useless product. Doesn&#x27;t do a thing, even after following directions. Save your money!</li>
            <li> Got this for the reviews on it for people with KP..Not really sure about this device yet. It just feels like it&#x27;s scratching my skin when I use it. Maybe i&#x27;m using it wrong.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  My skin is so much smoother, surprised at the amount of dead skin cells left on my face after washing it by hand.  I also tried the Exfoliator after using my Olay brush to see how well the brush cleans--- not a single dead skin cell on it--- good to know the brush really works.  I continue to use both and my forhead is nice and smooth, I had these small clusters of small bumps near the top of my hairline which are now gone!  My treatment products work so much better with a now cleaner and de-clogged skin.  I notice it really worked as I got a breakout on my aforementioned forhead area as all the dead skin cells were removed allowing it to come out--- I know that sounds weird, but I don&#x27;t have any breakouts in that area or anywhere on my face.  Its also great on the neck and decolletage area, I feel my skin products and sunscreen really penetrate in there now.</li>
            <li> Great product to clean dead cells off.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this item for exfoliating my face, and the first time I used it, it left my skin feeling very well exfoliated and smooth, but a bit irritated. I used it a couple of times a week for a few weeks, and found that it was far to harsh for my face - my skin began to get rougher and get more breakouts. I stopped using it on my face, and my skin improved again right away. It works well enough on tougher places like your feet or elbows, but the edge is kind of difficult to use effectively on ankles and elbows especially.</li>
            <li> I guess I scrub too well nothing came off it might work for people with oilier skin I&#x27;m very dry</li>
            <li> Where are all of these \\&quot;glowing reviews\\&quot; coming from?  This tool is the most useless exfoliator that I&#x27;ve ever used.  I used it exactly per the instructions, I adjusted the pressure, direction, and tried different areas of my body, and absolutely NOTHING came off.  I also bought this for my KP, but it&#x27;s going in the trash. I&#x27;m actually angry about being duped on this, and I cannot get over these fake reviews. They were the reason why I bought this piece of garbage in the first place, and I&#x27;ve just wasted more $$ based on lies. Yes, I&#x27;m responsible for what I choose to spend my money on, but something has to be done about the rampant false reviews on Amazon. Until then, I&#x27;m done with this website.</li>
            <li> I have severe KP. I use my Le Edge after using my Korean Italy Cloth mitt (get one of these if you have KP). What seems to happen is that the Korean Italy Cloth removes a layer of dead skin and possibly takes off the top of the &amp;#34;KP bump&amp;#34;. Then the Le Edge is able to squeeze out the trapped keratin from the pore/follicle. That is what makes the difference. The trapped keratin is removed, and your body no longer has to be irritated by it. I have extremely sensitive skin and would never use the Le Edge on my face, but if you can tolerate it, I am sure it would help with facial  KP as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of those expensive, chemical-laden KP lotions are necessary, but following up with pure coconut oil helps. After searching six decades for help with my KP, I find Le Edge to be extremely helpful.</li>
            <li> I have KP and I was a little skeptical about the Le Edge Body Exfliator.  I decided to try it because it was inexpensive and I wouldn&#x27;t lose much money if id didn&#x27;t work.  Well, it did work on the back of my arm (tiny chicken bumps) and my legs and feet.  It did more than I expected it to do so I was extremely happy.  I saw results immediately.  I suggest you purchase Amlactin lotion to work with the  Le Edge Full Body Exfoliator because together you will see lasting results and you&#x27;ll wonder why you&#x27;ve walked around suffering from KP for so long.  I am more than happy with my purchase.  This little gadget does wonders.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product, really improved the surface  of my bumpy upper arms due to those little white bumps whatever they are called. Would definetley recommend.</li>
            <li> It doent&#x27; work as good as I thought it would</li>
            <li> I love Le Edge. I lost my first one in a move and had to buy another one. I love sloughing off dead skin cells in the shower. I get a closer shave and my skin feels smoother but lotion after is a must.</li>
            <li> I dont think this actually works. Waste of money</li>
            <li> You can see the grime on it after you use it on your face. I use it twice a week before shaving and it has been a miracle for my ingrowth hairs and gives me a softer cleaner skin.</li>
            <li> Eh, kind of a bother to scrape the whole body.  Can be kinda painful while scraping but doesn&#x27;t cut or otherwise damage.  I guess if you&#x27;re really into exfoliation, this gadget does the trick well.  Despite the&amp;#34;rubberized&amp;#34; handle, it&#x27;s slippery in the water and I&#x27;m forever dropping it in the shower.  I end up using this when I think about it, and that isn&#x27;t often.</li>
            <li> I am a 26 year old, who has suffered from KP her entire life. I&#x27;ve tried it all, creams lotions and even trips to the dermatologist. Nothing has helped, or made the tiny red bumps go away.  I looked on Google hoping for an answer to my problem, &amp; I believe I have found it.  The backs of my arms are much less bumpy and red,  and I&#x27;ve only been using  Le Edge  for about a month.  I did find using it right after the shower (and with a bit of baby oil) it removes all the dead skin, including my KP.  Even my boyfriend of two years notice the difference while we were away on vacation. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re someone who suffers from KP.  However the baby oil is the trick!  This tool is useless without it</li>
            <li> Works great..  I  would buy again,and I have recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> Wow this little thing does a number on the back of my neck and armpits! I got it because pregnancy made those areas darker and I am definitely lightening up. I also have kp on my arms and I use it lightly to help my cream penetrate deeper to my skin. I don&#x27;t feel clean anymore unless I use this product. I even used it on my boyfriend&#x27;s back and soo much grime came off!</li>
            <li> Handy little tool.  This has been great to use on my face and upper arms.  With routine use, I&#x27;m finding that my skin is looking much smoother and better able to absorb moisturizer after a shower since the dead skin is removed.  Another observation with using this routinely, is that many of my expensive facial cleaners were leaving a film on my skin. With now getting that off after washing my face with this exfoliator, my skin is much clearer and fewer break outs.  In looking at other reviews, it looks like it may not work for everyone, but I&#x27;ve been happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I will this time because I think this is a great product.  The technology behind it is remarkably simple; it&#x27;s just a stainless steel, dull blade on a razor-like handle.  After using it several times along with my normal skincare routine (which already included an exfoliator), I have noticed clearer, softer skin and smaller pores.  It is absolutely amazing how much gunk is left on my face after washing it--Le Edge gets rid of everything my other face products miss!  I also use Le Edge on areas where I&#x27;m prone to ingrown hairs from shaving and I have had much fewer breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I think this is a great exfoliation tool to supplement any skincare routine and prevent ingrown hairs from shaving!</li>
            <li> I used it. Couldnt tell much difference. Kinda sharp even for tough skin. Does the job but not as great as it may look</li>
            <li> works great.  Have to use it for 1-2 weeks on chicken bumps.</li>
            <li> This is a handy little tool to have in the bathroom. I have tried many exfoliates and have found this one to be wonderful. I used it on my face and neck and was surprised at the gunk that it removed. I did this after using my beloved facial scrub. I then tried it on my whole body and found that it again removed the gunk that my normal system left behind. It is a small tool but an effective tool. Goodbye to dry skin hello to soft beautiful skin. My skin felt clean and soft. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> What a monumental piece of crap... I can&#x27;t believe I fell for this üò°</li>
            <li> This is better for my face than my clarisonic brush. It gets all of the icky stuff off leaving my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> This kind of hurts.  I must be a wimp or not using it right! Was hoping for better results. Didn&#x27;t notice much improvement in my skin than when I use exfoliating gloves.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like it....my Winter skin will be the true test, but I think it&#x27;s a winner</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how well it worked. After reading some of the bad reviews on Amazon I lowered my expectation from when I first saw it on QVC. But it worked crazy good, tons of gunk came off the blade and left my skin incredibly soft. Even the areas where I couldn&#x27;t see anything come off on the blade and thought it wasn&#x27;t working was very soft after I dried off.&lt;br /&gt;I had initially thought that I would have to soak it a tub or something for it to work well. But all I did was take my normal 5 minute shower and it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> waste of money for me just scratches my legs</li>
            <li> This thing really works. And, I didn&#x27;t get cut at all. It didn&#x27;t make any marks on my skin. But my skin was very soft after using it. Seemed to really get rid of the top layer of dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> As reviewer Kim mentioned, you need oil for this to really do its job while protecting sensitive skin from damage. I use a VO5 spray dry oil (one made for both skin and hair) that&#x27;s a combination of gentle, non-comedogenic oils; a light spritz and rub on skin that&#x27;s soaked or been under the shower spray for a while, and dead skin, KP bumps, even calluses slough right off. My skin is smoother, more evenly toned and less dry because some of the oil remains to moisturize any bits I might miss post-shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s not a cutting edge, there&#x27;s no worry about how long it will last, and because it&#x27;s stainless and has a thin sheen of oil from its most recent use, it will remain pristine for years. What a great little tool.</li>
            <li> Used in shower, but just w moisture wash, not oils, like some suggest. Im sensitive to most. Im on the fence..Think it works,but may be the switch to amlactin moisturiser.Will update, after use more</li>
            <li> As expected. Works well if you have skin that builds up easily.  It is less time consuming than the serious sugar/salt scrubs I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It feels amazing. I use it mainly on my arms to help with my KP (along with Amlactin) and am seeing visible results. I agree with another reviewer that you need to use oil in the shower to get the best results. I use Neutrogena body oil. just rub a little on wet skin in the shower and scrape the dead, dirty skin away.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work at all! I was excited to try and get at the rough areas on my feet, but it didn&#x27;t remove any dead skin. Total disappointment, and I threw away the packaging, so no return. Complete waste of money, do not buy!</li>
            <li> I bought this tool after reading about oil cleansing in this blog: http://www.celluliteinvestigation.com/ I&#x27;ve been using it on my face and body. It was a little too harsh to use on my face with just water, so I bought almond oil and castor oil. Before I shower, I mix the oils in my palm (60-70% almond oil, 30-40% castor oil) and then massage the oil combo into my face for 1-2 minutes. Then I get in the shower and let the steam/hot water warm up the oil for a minute. Then I use le edge to scrape off the oil, along with the pore clogging dirt. The first week was a little rough - my skin seemed to break out, but I think it just needed to adjust. I think le edge brought up a bunch of grime deep in my pores, which caused an initial, temporary breakout. However, 2 weeks later, my skin is starting to look much better and I don&#x27;t feel as many little bumps (i.e. clogged pores). I&#x27;ve also been using it on my arms, armpits, and legs too. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a cure for cellulite, but I do think my skin looks brighter. It definitely helps with ingrown hairs if you use it before you shave.</li>
            <li> This really does work, I was surprised. I used this with my regular body-wash. I&#x27;m happy that I don&#x27;t have to purchase any other body scrubs ever again.</li>
            <li> Even though the blade is not sharpened, don&#x27;t be to vigorous because it can hurt you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a month. I use Retin A and use the LeEdge on my face. I&#x27;m 65 years old and have used everything under the sun to improve my complexion. This product is great. I use Cetaphil with a wash cloth and then just shave it off like a man would do his face. I&#x27;m amazed at the results. I wonder how long this blade will last. I use mine everyday.</li>
            <li> Not really doing much removal of dead skin.  According to other positive reviewers it works, but from my experience it wasn&#x27;t as good as a good scrub with a loofah or washcloth.  I recommend a loofah instead.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work great the first time I used it.  My skin felt like silk.  After the first use I did not get the same results. ?</li>
            <li> Just received this and WOW! I cannot stop touching my face. It is so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t get over the fact, that such a simple product does such an incredible job. I have used it all over my body and this is one of those miracle beauty products that for my skin (sensitive, allergy prone and dermitis) works where not much else will. Thank you! I will buy all my good friends this. Must be shared :)</li>
            <li> use it all the time (y) thumbs up</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really seem to exfoliate much. I don&#x27;t use anymore.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT BODY TOOL!!!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I have pretty good skin and I felt like this didn&#x27;t do anything for me that a little exfoliating soap couldn&#x27;t handle. It also made my skin turn really red after use and took about a half hour to come back to normal.</li>
            <li> You know how kids sometimes have &amp;#34;blackened necks&amp;#34; ? Well, this product got rid of it when no powerful astringent or loofah could. It also got rid of all my dead skin in the sole of my feet. For best results, you have to use it the second you get out of the shower.  For the price, this is a great bargain. This is one of the best products I bought for 2014!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this nothing happened. I used it in the shower and I thought it was a waste of money. The next time I used it in the bath tub after a 20 minute soak with some essential oils to soften my skin. That&#x27;s is when it finally kicked into action. It did help my KP and takes less effort than the Baiden Mitten. Again, like with the Baiden Mitten, you need to temper your pressure so you don&#x27;t scratch or burn yourself. It&#x27;s easy to get over zealous once you start seeing some skin come off. It&#x27;s also great for the next which is a much forgotten place for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help at all--but then, I&#x27;ve come to believe keratosis pilaris needs to be treated from the inside-out--in other words, with nutrition first.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!  Recommend to everyone!  My daughter has KP so I bought Gold bond and this was a recommended purchase by Amazon to go with it.  Now my daughter uses it, I use it and my husband uses it.  It is an amazing exfoliator!  Couldn&#x27;t live without it now that we&#x27;ve found it.  Love it for our face in the shower.  Our faces almost feel like we&#x27;ve had our microdermabrasions done, which we do from time to time.  Love it for my daughter&#x27;s KP.  Love it for my feet!  Have tried managing my feet with many products, this by far is the best and keeps it simple enough that I use it every time I bathe.  I am buying another for my baths so I don&#x27;t have to move it back and forth from shower to tub.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> It was Ok, but I have extremely sensitive skin and find it a little bit more then my skin likes.  I am certain others will love this product.  But this is a great idea!</li>
            <li> Scraped off more skin than I expected this tool would be able to remove. Skin is smoother than it ever was! Moisturize skin afterwards and be amazed!</li>
            <li> Hands down the best item I have ever had for exfoliation. I highly recommend this one. I have one for the body and one for the feet.</li>
            <li> I use this about every other day in the shower after soaping up and rinsing, and an alarming amount of gunk comes off of my skin. I use it on my face and body--nothing really comes off of my face but I suppose the rest of my skin makes up for that...Anyway it&#x27;s a great price for a little tool that seems like it will last a long time. OH, I also use it on the bottom of my feet, which feels weird but keeps them nice and smooth as well.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just wash/exfoilate more than most, but this product really did nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> This product really works! If you have dry skin or wear lotion/creams, this is perfect for you. I use it a couple times a week in the shower after the water has softened my skin enough. It&#x27;s surprising when you see how much dead skin comes off (sounds gross I know, lol) so you can SEE it working. After I use this, my skin is noticeably softer and smoother. It gives it a silky feel. I use it on my feet, legs, arms, you can basically use it anywhere you want softer skin. It does a fantastic job getting rid of excess skin, dirt, lotions, etc. I would recommend this product to anyone because chances are, you&#x27;re going to notice a difference and for the price, it&#x27;s sooo worth it! :)</li>
            <li> Works fantastic in almost any area!</li>
            <li> Best exfoliator ever.</li>
            <li> Love. It. That&#x27;s all I have to say! For feet, arms, face... wait. Not in that order. Face. Arms. Feet. LOL This little gadget exfoliates excellently.</li>
            <li> I use it head to toe!  Its awesome I have KP and use it pretty vigorously on arms and legs.  Really works if you use it twice week.  Using it once a week on face gently and no more facials for me.  Use Amlactin as a moisturizing lotion everywhere not fave though skin will be really soft.  No more bumps in 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> I paid $10.04 for this in December 2014 and that was about $5 more than it was worth.  It worked well enough, though, and I was willing to overpay a little.  The present price of $59.99 is a joke!  Are you kidding?  It is a piece of plastic with a strip of metal.  The Romans used seashells. Those are free and will work just as well.  Amazon should be ashamed letting these con artists rip people off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see this as doing anything special at all.  I have KP - no change.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> i bought this for the bumps on the backs of my arms that suddenly started appearing after age 40. It worked wonders for my arms but after reading the reviews I tried this on my face and all I can say is wow! I exfoliate regularly but this took off a ton of gook from my chin, forehead and nose. I wish I had a smaller one to guide around my face.</li>
            <li> Best exfoliator every my skin is so smooth and soft after using this on my arms best investment</li>
            <li> Good to use on feet after soaking in a tub. Removes a lot.</li>
            <li> As long as you hold it at the right angle and wait until your skin has softened in the shower/bath, it works great.</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money.  I don&#x27;t even see the purpose of it.  I have used it over and over and have seen no different results.</li>
            <li> Just received this item, looking forward to using it.  I received it before the estimated date...which I love..it seems to be as explained in description. It doesn&#x27;t appear to be flimsy. Time and usage will tell..&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I love love love it. Removes leftover make up, swear and oil. Gives me clearer skin. Prevents ingrown hairs. Makes my skin softer. Easy to grip, no slipping. And my feet are pretty now! It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Works well at helping to achieve a closer shave. Would reccomend. Make sure you use it wet otherwise it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this after struggling with KP for years and thinking this was my big solution.  For me, it did not work as well as expected alone but paired with a strict moisturizer regimen I&#x27;ve noticed a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does really work well to help prevent ingrowns though so that makes me happy!</li>
            <li> Im a pole fitness instructor and we use very little lotion to avoid slipping however ashy skin can be as slippery as lotion on your skin! I am so happy with the LeEdge and how it helps the condition of my skin !!</li>
            <li> Very good for tightening pelvic muscles.  Women should try this before taking drastic or intrusive measures</li>
            <li> All this does is scratch you and give you red marks/bumps. I can do the same with my fingernails. Returned this item.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE my Le Edge! Highly recommend it. Thinking to buy a 2nd one (one for body, one for face). Everyone should have one. I use it in the shower. After I lather up, I use the Edge as if I&#x27;m &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s it. The first time I got some heavy duty gunk off. Now into day three, it&#x27;s not so dirty, but I have satisfaction that I don&#x27;t have buildup. I will never go without this again, this is a life changer.  UPDATE: I received my 2nd order. I cannot stress how awesome this little gadget it.  FACE. I put Albolene make up remover on my face and then use the Le Edge to remove the makeup/albolene. I&#x27;ve always struggled with large pores on my nose. In between grossed out and fascinated, I use this on my nose twice a day. My pores have continued to shrink and it removes the buildup that led to nasty little blackheads. TMI - it&#x27;s also great for my chiny chin chin and has helped prevent ingrown hairs from shaving.  ARMPITS. I used it prior to shaving, no biggie. Then I happened to look at my armpits and was amazed they weren&#x27;t as dark! So I think if you suffer from dark pits this will be a huge help!  LEGS.KNEES. Same for knees. I noticed that it getting the gunk off my knees. Swoon. As I mentioned, I lather up and go through the shaving motions. My legs are so smooth days after actually shaving, prevents gross little grown in hairs. Also noticed the skin on my arms are SO smooth....swoon.   Its a keeper~</li>
            <li> HMM...THIS DOES DO A LITTLE EXFOLIATING AND IF YOU HAVE SUN SCREEN ON IT WILL SCRAPE IT OFF; BUT, NOT SURE IT DOES ANY MORE THAN MY LOOFA GLOVE?</li>
            <li> this thing is great.  exfoliates face like besides your nostrils where oil can build up and great for getting sebum off your scalp in the shower.</li>
            <li> I use it to exfoliate my feet since they&#x27;ve been going through a rough time and I didn&#x27;t expect it to do such an amazing job! After exfoliation I applied vaseline on them and covered them with socks. I&#x27;ve never had smoother and softer feet! Great tool!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the bumps on my arms. I&#x27;ve used AmLactin, Gold Bond Rough and Bumpy lotion, exfoliating gloves, and several others. The results were always disappointing. So far, the bumps on my arms are almost gone (I‚Äôve only had the Le Edge Full Body Exfoliator for less than a month. It does make my skin feel nice. Don‚Äôt push too hard when using. It also helps the pores on my nose. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This really does work. I use this on my face every other day and I am always surprised. I also use this for my underarms before I shave and after and I have to say, no ingrown hairs so far. Also my underarms have lightened up a bit due to no more deodorant residue and lack of dead skin. I don&#x27;t even have to use a shaving cream because the blade glides on so easily and precisely after I use this. I also use this on the soles of my feet and it scrapes up all of the dead skin cells and dirt like a magic eraser. This is a really good buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had KP as long as I can remember and have relentlessly tried to keep it under control.  All of the products geared for KP are expensive and while they may help a little, nothing seems to completely alleviate the symptoms (from what i understand, there is no cure, only symptom control).  This did seem to help, at least with the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I also use an epilator on my legs, and this does a much better job of exfoliating before use than just using a scrub.  It is smaller than I imagined but it really doesn&#x27;t need to be any bigger.  It is similar to a small ice scraper with a metal edge.  It doesn&#x27;t feel particularly pleasant, but by no means does it hurt.  For $8 (although I see some external sellers have it priced over $25) it can&#x27;t hurt to try it. I gave it a 4 star because while It did meet my expectations, it did not exceed them.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Helps with my keratosis pillars</li>
            <li> I use this on my face 3-4 times a week and I&#x27;ve never had so few zits. It just squeezes all the dirt and oil out of your pores. I don&#x27;t use any sort of soap or lotion on my face since I&#x27;ve only ever found those to make things worse. I just let the shower steam soften my skin for about 5 minutes while I wash and then use this. It takes some pressure, just don&#x27;t overdo it. And don&#x27;t slide it sideways, because I did cut my knuckle once doing that. Used correctly it should never be able to cut you.  It&#x27;s really not that sharp. After every swipe I scrape off the nasty stuff that came off my fave with a thumbnail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well on the rest of your body too, but takes a lot more soaking (at least 15 minutes) as well as more effort and pressure. And I don&#x27;t want to use the same Edge on my face and body so I switched to a Korean Italy Mit for my body. It doesn&#x27;t seem to work quite as well, but it&#x27;s easier and still leaves my skin soft and exfoliated.</li>
            <li> Cant say I noticed that this gadget did much if anything for me. I didn&#x27;t get as much skin off as everyone said, didn&#x27;t notice much at all. One thing, when used on my lower legs/shins, I do seem to get a nice shine after shaving/lotioning. Did not help with the bumps on the backs of my arms like I was hoping.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  I read about it on xojane and it does really get the dead skin off.  Also, the design is sturdy and seems like it&#x27;ll be good for a long time.</li>
            <li> It was as described. Doesn&#x27;t seem to exfoliate much on most of my skin and does seem rough on it, irritates. But it does great things on the soles of my feet, I love it for that, just not much else.</li>
            <li> Worst product...I might throw it. Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Wanted to really love it, but it just wasn&#x27;t very effective.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with Le Edge. This tool is great for preparing bikini line  and all other areas for shaving. It removes deodorant residue under the arms. It effectively yet gently exfoliates my entire body.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use on my keratosis pilaris on my upper arms.  I have noticed improvement and less irritation.  This also works well on my heels.  The exfoliation is just enough without damaging the skin.</li>
            <li> Zero stars!! This thing is so stupid. Get a turkish mitt instead. How can anybody like this? It&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 30 year old female and I suffer from something called keratosis pilaris or chicken skin. It&#x27;s a common skin condition that caused small, raised, white and sometimes reddish bumps on the skin, mostly on the backs of arms or thighs. It is caused by the body producing too much keratin. I also suffer from extremely dry skin, causing my bumps to become even rougher, especially in the winter. It makes for an embarrassing, uncomfortable, itchy, and sometimes even painful situation. I got this product hoping to smooth out some of those bumps, and was shocked to find IT ACTUALLY works! Now, I know I&#x27;ll never have perfectly smooth skin. I&#x27;ve searched the world over for lotions, creams, supplements, you name it...I&#x27;ve tried it. However, this helps tremendously. Use a good body wash, then scrape your body with this and after your shower put on some quality lotion! I&#x27;m very excited to have found this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times but already it has helped my keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li> It did nothing for me except on my heels.</li>
            <li> Is product just has a metal edge that runs along your skin, I did not see or feel any difference.</li>
            <li> I dont know if this is working to exfloliate but it has made my arms softer so one would assume it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> This item works as advertised, especially on actinic keratoses &amp; stucco keratoses.  Better than a pumice stone.</li>
            <li> This works so good and I love that its so easy to use and its fast!!  Saves me lots of time!!</li>
            <li> this tool is not only painful but also useless.</li>
            <li> As with any beauty product, I bought this with an open mind. Maybe it will work, maybe it won&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not expensive so not a big deal if it doesn&#x27;t work, but if it does then what a find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like a big razor with a big, thick blade. I showered for about 10 minutes and got nice and soft and started scraping. It doesn&#x27;t hurt or sting. I scraped here and there and everywhere. Arms, legs...and nothing. No gunk like other reviewers said they saw. I gave myself props for being better at exfoliating than I thought and figured I was out a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then...after I was completely dry I looked at my arms and felt them and they were the softest they have been in a looooong  time. My KP looked so much better and my arms were just so surprisingly soft and haven&#x27;t looked this good in years. I am excited to see how my skin looks as I incorporate this into my skincare/KP treatment routine.</li>
            <li> Love this exfoliator!!! not only does it scrape off dirt but works wonders on pimples!! Everyday use!! Now I have to buy my husband his own so he won&#x27;t take mine!</li>
            <li> Awesome little gadget! I agree with the comments about using a light oil on your skin first. It doesn&#x27;t do anything for me with just water. Who knew that much crud could be left on your skin after washing! I do use this on my face also ... carefully.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this through a special on Groupon.  At such a great price, I figured it was worth a shot to use on my legs before I shave.  The hair on my legs is coarse and tends to grow in \\&quot;layers\\&quot; so I&#x27;ve never been able to get a smooth shave in virtually my entire life.  The only product that ever worked was a \\&quot;buffing pad\\&quot; made by Sally Hansen which was intended to buff away hair, but instead just made mine smooth after I shaved.  The problems were that A) it took 15+ minutes to do this before even showering, B) the pads only lasted once or twice before I had to buy new ones and C) they were finally discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this exfoliator, I thought it might help to \\&quot;raise\\&quot; both layers of hair on my legs so that the razor could reach it all at once (hard to explain unless your hair grows the same way), and it did!  I used the exfoliator on my legs (takes 1 or 2 mins) before shaving, and my legs are FINALLY smooth!  It also does what it intends to do--remove dead skin--but the alternative use for me is the most important.  I&#x27;m SO HAPPY I gave this a shot.  For anyone experiencing a similar issue with smooth legs, I urge you to give this a try!  Best of all, it can be used over and over and takes minimal time.  Thank you Le Edge!!</li>
            <li> Very interesting but I must confess I love it!</li>
            <li> It worked as advertised. Even after exfoliating, using this on my skin made it feel even softer.</li>
            <li> This works really well, you just have to make sure your skin is wet and softened. I found out the edge was sharper than I realized when I sliced my thumb. Works fantastic as a facial exfoliator.</li>
            <li> This works so-so.  I don&#x27;t think I would purchase it again if I would have known that the results are about the same, or less noticeable vs using a daily exfoliating scrub.  I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money</li>
            <li> Save your money!  Didn&#x27;t come w.instructions.  I can only assume that this was meant to be a toy.  No...I didn&#x27;t return.  I&#x27;m holding it to show my family and friends what I first thought was a prank.  I&#x27;m 62 y.o.  I know my skin has at least one flake of dry skin.  According to this...I&#x27;m as soft as a infant.  The only glow I received on my skin from this product was from high blood presdure.  Not worth Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s copper silouette!</li>
            <li> Fighting Keratosis Pilaris for the past 6 years and have tried a lot of stuff. But nothing helped like this tool. I use it once a week in shower and this removes upto 80% of the bulbs and releases the ingrown hair bulbs. Skin might be slightly red for a few minutes but rinsing with cold water and applying coconut oil/aloe vera gel will vanish it all and reveal smooth clear skin in a few minutes. I will definitely recommend this to all fellow KP-sufferers. Try it, you will not regret.  P.S - Using this tool alone will not help reduce KP. I use AmLactin 12% lotion right out of shower everyday and follow up with a mixture of coconut oil + tea tree oil. Tea tree oil is a must... Hope this helps...</li>
            <li> Excellent item! Was a little skeptical at first but this sloughed off so much dead skin with so little effort. Definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> looooooove this! i just have to scrub a little bit harder on areas such as legs and arms, but it still works a lot &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I tried this, but did not see any real improvement. The device is not meant to be sharp, but, when looking at the edge of the appliance with a magnifying glass, I found that, rather than having a smooth, honed edge, it had lots of tiny ridges and distressed-looking areas that could hold debris and bacteria. The manufacturer does recommend cleaning between uses, but does not specify a method. Would definitely recommend cleaning with rubbing alcohol after each use, and not sharing with anyone.</li>
            <li> I like it, but you have to be in the water for a while first</li>
            <li> Does what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> Excellent exfoliation but coconut oil is a must!</li>
            <li> works to remove dead skin but it did nothing for my K.P.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive for a modified ice scraper. I can see some debris from skin when I use it. Since I have the type of skin that can use every type of exfoliation it can get, I am keeping it. I found it most useful around my knees and the backs of my arms. Pretty much useless on feet, maybe mine are just so tough they need a foot file. For those I recommend Flowery Swedish Clover Foot File, which you can find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  You could probably use an auto ice scraper and get the same results.  Doesn&#x27;t help with bumps and, if anything, irritates them.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really feel as if this product really helped me. I purchased it after reading all the other great reviews on how it helped kp but I think it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Useless. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would help slough off some of the dry skin on my legs(sounds lovely, doesn&#x27;t it?). I brought it in the shower to use when my legs are hot and my skin is softened(the best time to exfoliate) and I did exactly what the directions told me to do. I scraped hard, soft, tried different angles, scraping in different directions and NOTHING. Every time I tried this(I tried it a few times just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t crazy or somehow doing it wrong) I would look at the end of the scraper to see if it &#x27;exfoliated&#x27; anything. Absolutely nothing every single time. Ridiculous. Such a waste of money and time. I don&#x27;t recommend this at all(which is sad because I really wanted this to work!). So what to do with stubborn dry skin? I suggest a gritty salt or sugar exfoliating scrub on a textured washcloth. That&#x27;s what works for me. Sorry that I couldn&#x27;t say nicer things about this thing, but if it doesn&#x27;t work, it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and happy shopping ‚ù§</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in conjunction with Amlactin lotion for keratosis pilaris on the back of my legs. I decided to do a test. I used the lotion on both legs, but only used the &amp;#34;le edge&amp;#34; on my right leg. After a week, both legs havve improved, but the right leg is so much smoother. Also, I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in ingrown hairs from shaving since using this. IT WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> Worked wonderfully! Took layers of makeup off my neck that I thought had been clean when I washed my face! Also works really well on feet, legs, back of arms and back for removing dead skin- left me feeling very clean and exfoliated!</li>
            <li> This is great sometimes and so-so other times. I find the most dead skin it takes off is on my neck, which wasn&#x27;t really what I was going for with purchasing this but am now totally paying attention to. Sometimes it takes off a surprising amount of dead skin! But it doesn&#x27;t always look like it&#x27;s taking off anything; though I tend to run it over the same spots regardless.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t scratched myself with this but sometimes it will leave a mark for 15 minutes or so if I use it too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I will put massage oil on before a shower, to better lift out dirt, then wash it off with soap in the shower. I know this exfoliator works because it will scrape off oil (and dirt) after I wash with soap and a scrub sponge. So at the very least this is capable of removing surface dirt if it doesn&#x27;t always exfoliate the way I&#x27;d like it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this because it&#x27;s WAY easier to store/disinfect/exfoliate with than my loofah, scrub sponges, or pumice stone. It doesn&#x27;t scratch me like those all can sometimes, and it probably takes off about the same amount of dead skin. I can also use this on my face, and it very obviously scrapes off excess makeup (I just avoid my eyes - too delicate for this thing)</li>
