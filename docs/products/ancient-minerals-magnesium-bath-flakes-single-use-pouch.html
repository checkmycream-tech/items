            <li>One of these will create the right amount of magnesium for a good bath.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what I can say about this wonderful mineral bath product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great in the bath for feet or the whole body and also if ur making magnesium oil these work pretty well for that too.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>

            <li>They have many fine products.</li>
            <li>Ancient minerals seem to be a good clean product, I&#x27;ve used their magnesium oil for several years and feel these flakes will make a good healthy magnesium lotion.</li>
            <li>and you will find more detailed information on her website.  </li>
            <li>Good product highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The cream is nice, I just put in on my feet at bedtime and soak up those great minerals all night long.</li>
            <li>Really helps with having a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li>; I use it to make a magnesium spray (mix about 1 part flakes with 2 parts warm water until they dissolve and pour into a spray bottle) which is supposed to be absorbed through your skin.</li>
            <li>enjoying sharing great products with people and I am a social worker who is always stressed out.</li>
            <li>Very nice natural product....</li>
            <li>lotion and oil recipes are easily found if you just google it.</li>
            <li>This powdered/flake form is easy to use in a convenient, strong plastic package.</li>
            <li>Easy to make.  </li>
            <li>Easy peasy to make magnesium oil.</li>
            <li>Dissolves easily.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to work  with.</li>
            <li>Since starting to use magnesium more, my blood pressure  great.</li>
            <li>RO remove all minerals from the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;flakes&amp;#34; are chunky, but dissolve very quickly in water.  </li>
            <li>They shipped it very quickly, I had</li>
            <li>The magnesium arrived very quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li>The spray is really easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t have any scent.</li>
            <li>Ouch, it hurts when you first apply it, kind of like hydrogen peroxide on a wound.  </li>
            <li>I have not noticed a difference in what I use it for (magnesium deficiency), but this product itself is just fine</li>
            <li>Super great product, and it shipped super fast.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s very grateful &amp; asking for more!</li>
            <li>I have read so much about the benefits of magnesium and how most people are lacking in magnesium and don&#x27;t even know it!  </li>
            <li>Nice large flakes.</li>
            <li>This is really amazing because I don&#x27;t like using aluminum-based deodorant and many natural deodorants</li>
            <li>I ordered the magnesium flakes to make my own magnesium oil at a much lower cost than buying it by the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I kid you not, the very next day the discomfort was GREATLY minimized.</li>
            <li>I have a deep tub that is great for soaking.  </li>
            <li>I feel much more relaxed and calm before bed (sprayed on the bottom of my feet).</li>
            <li>It feels lightly &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; on the hands after application, but rinses with just water.</li>
            <li>now you have some fantastic &#x27;magnesium oil&#x27;.</li>
            <li>And very cost effective.</li>
            <li>Just the product I need and at such great savings over the health food stores</li>
            <li>I ended up sleeping soundly that night and did not have to deal with burning or itching that the magnesium oil caused me.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for not only detoxing but helping with skin irritations.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more powerful, I don&#x27;t have to mix</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of these, but you have to put the whole bag in the bath at once according to the instructions</li>
            <li>It absorbs instantly from the skin and seems to work great.</li>
            <li>For SENIORS to  get sound.</li>
            <li>After reading some reviews I thought it would be a smaller bag, I was happy when it arrived.</li>
            <li>It is a great hair tamer for the slicked back look too.</li>
            <li>very cost effective and it works.  </li>
            <li>Great for making magoil, and getting your daily magnesium.</li>
            <li>It describes how relevant magnesium is in the body,  and explains how to use the Magnesium flakes.  </li>
            <li>My doctor told me magnesium is important to health.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product that has helped me in my journey towards being healthier and try to get rid of as much stress and possible, it has also helped me with migraine headaches.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would be great to soak in as well, but I just had other uses for it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to make on your own, and this is a very affordable way to do so.</li>
            <li>And it really moisturizes!!!</li>
            <li>I have found this very useful for helping to alleviate lyme symptoms (sore joints / feet) when used in a foot bath.</li>
            <li>I bought it to make mineral oil with and its super easy.</li>
            <li>It was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Super easy</li>
            <li>I bought this to make my own magnesium oil as an alternative to Epsom Salts and paying for magnesium oil at a high price.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to a friend, however I would say there is more than a single use in the package, which is good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it will work for everyone, but it works for me, which I&#x27;m very happy about.  </li>
            <li>I also love that the bag is resealable, seeing as how I didn&#x27;t use the whole bag at once!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff - Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have been better off taking magnesium orally and using regular bath salts in a warm tub or foot soak.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been buying Barbara Handel&#x27;s premixed Mag Oil for the last year and I can tell you that hands-down this is formula (Ancient Mineerals) is 10x more effective as a Deodorant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product, I am very pleased &amp; actually just reordered earlier today.</li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t use it right after shaving!</li>
            <li>I find that I am sleeping better and feeling better in general.</li>
            <li>Just add 1 cup of water and 1 cup of flakes, boil, and let cool.</li>
            <li>, let cool</li>
            <li>I was able to put the whole bag in a gallon glass jar.</li>
            <li>They feel good when mixed with water as a spray for arms legs tummy...</li>
            <li>I hoped this stuff would be better, and it absolutely is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let cool and put in a spray bottle.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a good sized bag that was larger than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li>It really helps me feel better</li>
            <li>I have physically felt really good since using this product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it so far.    </li>
            <li>I made &amp;#34;magnesium oil&amp;#34; from it to apply transdermally as a good source of daily mg.</li>
            <li>I found amazon to have the most reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Let it dissolve and cool and then pour into a spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>How glad i am that i bought it thanks to all reviews.</li>
            <li>I apply it all over my skin, even on my face,  apply pure shea butter by perfect body harmony after wiping off the wetness after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a spray bottle that I filled months ago, and it is as clear and effective as when I first made it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This solution has made a radical difference in how quickly these bites/sores are healing.  </li>
            <li>It deliver quickly but the bag was torn.  </li>
            <li>They melt quick, also.</li>
            <li>It is an excellent aid for easing into restful sleep (especially when you put a drop of essential oil in the mix!).</li>
            <li>Melted quickly to make magnesium oil spray.</li>
            <li>I now swear by them and recommend them to every pregnant mama I can.  </li>
            <li>Received quickly.</li>
            <li>The flakes dissolve quickly.</li>
            <li>The magnesium oil itself is super oily and drying.</li>
            <li>I really love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>We started from 15 min soak in very warm, not hot water.</li>
            <li>It worked the first day!</li>
            <li>Relieved pain in my feet with the first soak!</li>
            <li>I had restless legs syndrome, but after the first use it&#x27;s gone!</li>
            <li>It is working very well!!  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a pretty pricey soak!</li>
            <li>Previous attempts to use Espson Salts have never been very effective -</li>
            <li>Very effective, I sleep like a baby and have less muscle pain when I use this.  </li>
            <li>This is a soothing way to calm your restless leg syndrome before heading off to bed.</li>
            <li>It makes my bath feel silky smooth while I&#x27;m absorbing magnesium thru my skin.</li>
            <li>After trying multiple times to take magnesium orally, I decided to purchase these to make my own magnesium oil.</li>
            <li>The Shea butter should help moisturize while the magnesium is being absorbed.</li>
            <li>I also use them to make my own magnesium oil for topical use.</li>
            <li>Most americans are deficient in Magnesium, so this is a great product to have on hand and use.</li>
            <li>I always feel rejuvenated after a nice soak, especially after walking 5 miles.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t find it worth the money.</li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t have to worry about dripping water drying (being absorbed) into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s likely an acute deficiency of magnesium, potassium, or both.</li>
            <li>Resealable bag keeps it fresh.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin so soft with coconut oil on top of it.</li>
            <li>After all the flakes are in the jar, top it off with water, and periodically shake it up until completely dissolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Made my own magnesium topical cream!</li>
            <li>This is a really excellent quality product based on my research, especially for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for about a week, I can honestly say that I do notice a subtle sense of better overall energy and well being through out the day after I spray twice each on my arms, legs and stomach.</li>
            <li>I compete in obstacle course races and  noticed after my latest race that my muscles recovered much more quickly than in previous events before I started using this.</li>
            <li>boiled it down to make magnesium oil, works fine in a spray bottle a lot cheaper to make your own</li>
            <li>but I took a shower right after the bath since I detest taking baths.</li>
            <li>I had years that I never slept right away.</li>
            <li>Disolving l cup of these pure Magnesium flakes in a cup of boiling water, cool, put in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But if you&#x27;re like me and have tried EVERY deodorant under the sun (inclduing the dreaded Certain Dri) then you will withstand the pain like a true</li>
            <li>The product seems good, the bag is smaller than I expected but overall, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>Got to get used to the feeling it leaves on skin, but worth it to know that I&#x27;m supporting my health in this way.</li>
            <li>Ultimately, if I planned to use the flakes in a bath every few days, I managed to keep away most of the discomfort and felt great up until birth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For some reason, I felt like I absorbed this much, much better than regular Epsom salts.</li>
            <li>Please refer to Dr. Carolyn Dean&#x27;s The Magnesium Miracle or her website for &amp;#34;outside the box&amp;#34; info on supplementation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have experienced two years of debilitating radicular spasm pain (similar to sciatic pain) which did not respond to numerous Rx trials, prolotherapy, accupuncture, epidural injections, facet injections, a radiofrequency nerve ablation.</li>
            <li>Much more natural way for the body to absorb magnesium, as the body can decide how much it wants to intake.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the ingredients in the cream, or anything technical or medical about the products - but you are welcome to email me if you have questions  </li>
            <li>Doing my own magnesium oil with those flakes.&lt;br /&gt;Sting a little bit but the sensation disappears fast, provide your body with magnesium and easy to apply on skin after a shower.</li>
            <li>I do like this product very much and will continue to order it.  </li>
            <li>it, it might sting a little when you start using it, but once your skin is healed from the dryness by the magnesium, the magnesium solution is actually very easy to apply and comfortable on your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a bit pricey considering they want you to use the whole bag in one bath!</li>
            <li>Mix with your favorite essential oil and put in a spray bottle and you will have deodorant.</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Used this for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to use up my first bag though.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>Read on a holistic website about using a hot washcloth soaked in either water and Epsom salt or Magnesium flakes to pull infection out of a wound.</li>
            <li>I also spray it on my body at night to have a peaceful and relaxing sleep.</li>
            <li>I still have plenty of flakes left over for more uses</li>
            <li>I will be using it in my bath pretty soon.</li>
            <li>I really like the energy it gives me!  </li>
            <li>maybe that&#x27;s because I apply it first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li>They dissolve well and seem to be exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I find this solution helps my back aches, helps my face complexion, and makes me fee much better.</li>
            <li>Again, only a cup or so in a bath - and they seem calmer and sleep better.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m in a Rocky Mountain Hot Spring.</li>
            <li>I was going to purchase an 8 oz spray bottle of magnesium oil for the SAME price as this whole bag at Whole Foods, but I decided to look into making my own with these flakes.</li>
            <li>I still sweat when it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li>- It can sting your skin within the first 20 minutes of spraying</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>I first tried the Ancient Minerals Magnesium Bath Flakes in a foot soak.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the foot soak, I couldn&#x27;t believe that after just 20 mins my pain went away.  </li>
            <li>you want to spray it onto your skin, you&#x27;ll need a spray bottle that can handle a higher viscosity liquid.</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>The flakes are large and much more flakey than Epsom salts, and the &amp;#34;relaxant&amp;#34; results lasts much longer - weeks longer - than soaking in regular Epsom salts.</li>
            <li>A long soak with magnesium flakes makes me feel better all over.</li>
            <li>so the first time I made Mg oil and sprayed my skin was very itchy.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I was not nauseated during a pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Good price on Amazon as usual.</li>
            <li>The feet felt warmer and more alive instantly and all the next day, and the quality of sleep after feet soak was way better.</li>
            <li>For the first time in years he can enjoy an entire day without muscle pain.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, hope to see results on my next Bone scan!</li>
            <li>I took a previous Reviewer&#x27;s advice and made my own Magnesium Oil by boiling a cup of water and then adding a cup of the flakes.</li>
            <li>I made up a batch to use as a spray before going to bed at night, and it certainly helps with leg cramps and pain in the ankles.  </li>
            <li>Large flakes</li>
            <li>I made magnesium oil out of these flakes and they seem very high quality.</li>
            <li>But it seems to be effective if I rinse after a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my neck felt very relax.</li>
            <li>So I decided to give my whole team a sample.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this to bathe in, because you dont get that much product</li>
            <li>/&gt;And, for some reason it says to use the whole bag for one bath . .</li>
            <li>I guess I expected more of a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Usually very reactive (often require Rx meds to treat).  </li>
            <li>Leaves a very metallic smell on skin afterwards.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>it really worked for me.  </li>
            <li>I believe I may have to try quite a few more to give a better account and the package directions say to use an entire bag for one bath.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really justify that so just know that is the recommendation.</li>
            <li>Now (after 2 weeks of daily magnesium baths) he is waking up pain free.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still a fantastic source of magnesium and vastly cheaper.</li>
            <li>You do not need to use the whole bag as it says on the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The suggestion that you use a whole bag is why I refuse to give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Taking a bath with these magnesium flakes is very relaxing.  </li>
            <li>oil really works as a magnesium supplement.</li>
            <li>It also really helps when your muscles are tensed up.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t used it that much yet.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference between epsom salts and these flakes.</li>
            <li>It really helps.</li>
            <li>Magnesium flakes can be used to make \\&quot;magnesium oil\\&quot; much cheaper than you can buy it already in liquid form.  </li>
            <li>This really aids in relaxing those sore muscles.</li>
            <li>I give my children massages with the magnesium oil created from the flakes before bed, and it is very relaxing for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bag literally says.. pour in the whole bag for an eczema soak..</li>
            <li>REALLY?</li>
            <li>8 pound bag is not as much as one would think.</li>
            <li>.. straight magnesium chloride.. do a google search for NIGARI Solution &amp; save yourself a lot of cash..</li>
            <li>I had been waking up with very sore hips in the morning</li>
            <li>Just wish it did not cost so much</li>
            <li>would not use this as per its instructions, which recommends using the whole bag in 1 bath.  </li>
            <li>very relaxing fast shipping</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast as always with Amazon.</li>
            <li>Very calming to the nervous system also.  </li>
            <li>it or buy some ready made magnesium oil and see if you like it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>On nights when I&#x27;m having a lot of pain, I&#x27;ll rub in on from my hip to my feet, and it really does help.</li>
            <li>We absorb so much through the bottom of our feet.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a real person with a neurological condition.</li>
            <li>&quot; I take a quart jar and pour as much of this bag of flakes into it that it will take -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really hoping this helps with the twitchy legs and insomnia.  </li>
            <li>I do not feel that one needs to use a whole package to benefit from the product.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I really like these magnesium bath flakes.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping - as described.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Magnesium Chloride, even if it&#x27;s an inorganic salt, is very well&lt;</li>
            <li>The bag is smaller than epson salt bags you can purchase at the grocery store, but my understanding is that this is a different kind of magnesium.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m sitting in my own dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be using it to make my own essential oil spray, so it will last me...</li>
            <li>I put it on the back of my legs and it absorbs pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I spray it on after my workouts 30 min before a shower as I&#x27;m on a keto diet and read that most people need potassium and magnesium due to deficiency in the diet itself.</li>
            <li>1/2 cup mag flakes in 1/2 cup boiling distilled water, boil until dissolved, cool down, put into clean spray bottle.</li>
            <li>His and my dry cracked heels have been getting much better and its really soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It stings a little bit when you first put it on - not a painful sting, but you can feel it tingle kind of sharply.  </li>
            <li>I just filled 50% in a bottle and the other with hot water in a bowl.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well as deodorant too (spray under arms), though for hotter, sweatier days I also use a natural stick along with the mag.</li>
            <li>Dr. Raul Vergini says, that \\&quot;this is true only for severe renal&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I guess this is more $, but you need less to see the benefits?</li>
            <li>You can make it 1/4th or 1/3rd ratio and add more water to have less skin irritation.</li>
            <li>After a shower I spray on my back and it quickly absorbs.</li>
            <li>I definitely noticed a boost in my mood (and, um, &amp;#34;regularity&amp;#34;) after I started consistently using this.</li>
            <li>They also help relax me if I am unable to sleep and all-around great product.</li>
            <li>I found a &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; online for how to make your own magnesium oil (it&#x27;s not really an oil, this product is just mixed with water and dissolved) and then we put it into a spray bottle to spray on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I discovered these when pregnant with my third child - and they made all the difference in my level of discomfort.  </li>
            <li>Boil the MgCl in water for a safe saline solution, add it to drinks; a few drops really mellows out coffee.  </li>
            <li>The ancient minerals brand works a million times better to keep my muscles not so tight.</li>
            <li>The product was highly recommended by a blogger I follow</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend making up a batch and spraying on generously before bed.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Ancient minerals carries high quality products continually.</li>
            <li>This was a high end brand</li>
            <li>I had a nice, slightly drowsy feeling that I only get if I use twice as much epsom salt.</li>
            <li>My body feels more lose, I am slightly more flexible, and my symptoms would always get worse around the time I would PMS; however my achy muscles, headache, and tight muscles have been much more manageable this month, then they were last month.  </li>
            <li>I feel physically relaxed as well as mentally calm.  </li>
            <li>Do not use as much as is stated,  I use about half of what they say is needed and it works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>(Or at least more aware of the dreams.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the most part it soaks in to your skin, but I have had a few times where I could see a film when it</li>
            <li>I used this product a few times this winter when i was training for my latest Boston Marathon.</li>
            <li>We rub some \\&quot;oil\\&quot; on our temples or forehead when we have a headache, and it normally solves the problem.</li>
            <li>I even put it in my son&#x27;s yogurts when he is not looking, he never complained about the taste.</li>
            <li>It works well and lasting (much longer than if I dumped the whole thing into the tub to soak for a bit and then drain!)</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;this is also true for all minerals, that cannot be easily eliminated by&lt;br /&gt;a seriously impaired kidney.</li>
            <li>I bought it to make Magnesium oil which I heard is really good to apply on skin when you feel tired or have headache.</li>
            <li>Before buying this product, I tried making my own &amp;#34;magnesium oil&amp;#34; out of epsom salts, to relieve my chronic pain, and was not very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>however they break down easily in food processor to use in bath bombs.</li>
            <li>Then my daughter found &amp;#34;Transdermal Magnesium Therapy: A New Modality for the Maintenance of Health&amp;#34; by Mark Sircus online.</li>
            <li>My old sleep cycle is back - it&#x27;s easy to fall asleep or fall back to asleep.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, I did break out around my chest and back when I first used it.</li>
            <li>Since then the bumps are clearing up, and I’ve only been spraying it on my arms, legs, and stomach, with no ill side effects.</li>
            <li>I dissolved some in hot water and mixed it into coconut oil and bee&#x27;s wax to make a lotion that I put on my calves before going to sleep at night.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the same bag for over a year, too, so it lasts pretty well.</li>
            <li>You can buy the exact same size on the companies</li>
            <li>I found the instructions on how to make it as easy as to heat distilled water and mix it with the flakes equal parts let it cool and use a small blue water pump bottle to apply.</li>
            <li>But too huge, but big enough to last me quite a while.</li>
            <li>Made this into a natural deodorant, but DON&#x27;T use immediately after shaving -</li>
            <li>I’m a 27 year old Administrative assistant.</li>
            <li>No my discomfort has not been fixed 100%, but I would take this Level 2 level of discomfort</li>
            <li>sleep - WOW -</li>
            <li>Since creating the solution, I had multiple chigger bites and, thanks to my cat, poison ivy exposure to my arms.  </li>
            <li>Last much longer than ANY poison ivy treatment found at drug stores.  </li>
            <li>extra fast delivery and as promised.</li>
            <li>This whole bag should last me hopefully a year.</li>
            <li>Stopped traveling up after I applied the washcloth and then took about 7 hours for the line to recede and then disappear completely.</li>
            <li>I would add a handful to my hot bath after my long runs.</li>
            <li>He sprays the oil directly on his skin, whereas I used the oil to make a body butter/lotion that also included shea butter, avocado oil, beeswax, and lavender/tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>- It also relieves the pain on my feet when I spray the oil directly on them when they get sore and cramps.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Adults and children over 5 years old ............ 125cc&lt;br /&gt;4 year old children ........................................</li>
            <li>/&gt;3 year old children ........................................ 80cc</li>
            <li>/&gt;1-2 year old children ....................................</li>
            <li>/&gt;over 6 months old children ...........................</li>
            <li>6 months old children .........................</li>
            <li>I, personally, cannot attest to any perceived difference from the Ancient Minerals oil spray and continue to use both--reasoning that I might possibly compromise my success by using this one alone.</li>
            <li>I did the cycle a few times - and every 3rd or 4th day, the discomfort would return; I&#x27;d soak and they&#x27;d be alleviated.  </li>
            <li>With our modern diets, most of us are deficient in magnesium.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m fairly scientific and skeptical of products that heal, soothe, etc</li>
            <li>person told me that her 10 day long menstral was cut to 5 days, some reported better sleep, and some report that they feel less stress.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and relaxing bath, but a big bag like this seemed a bit much for just one bath when I only use 2 cups of Epsom Salts in a bath, so I only used half the bag and it seemed to be fine.</li>
            <li>They are small and easy to scoop.  </li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t take magnesium orally, I&#x27;d highly recommend these flakes for topical application.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend regular magnesium baths.</li>
            <li>When you take high doses of Vitamin D and if you are already low in magnesium, the increased amount of metabolic work drains magnesium from its muscle storage sites.</li>
            <li>It is to high priced for such nonsense!</li>
            <li>I would recommend starting off using only a little, and working your way up to more as it seems to lessen the itchiness as you go.</li>
            <li>This has been a very cost-effective replacement for several other forms of magnesium tablets and capsules for me, positive results are just as noticeable.  </li>
            <li>3-4 years ago the muscles in my arms, particularly on the right side of my body began to get very tight.</li>
            <li>I have recently been trying to get as much magnesium topically as possible, and these bath flakes ROCK!</li>
            <li>Transdermal magnesium  (sprayed onto your skin) is the only way to really get enough of this king of minerals.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the slight burning feeling on my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that a couple of spritzes will make me very itchy, especially just starting out.</li>
            <li>both products I experience mild burning for a few minutes after application.</li>
            <li>They tell you this product can&#x27;t be used for making DIY magnesium oil because they want to sell you their own bottle of very expensive magnesium oil that is exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was due to my lost of baby fat on the forehead</li>
            <li>Strangely, some of my muscle tightness went away and I had some decent nights sleep.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a deceptively large bag and will last a long time in our home.  </li>
            <li>This is great for a foot soak &amp; not too bad for shipping time.</li>
            <li>so I will not speak to perceived benefits from this product, specifically, but rather to magnesium supplementation in general.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t completely gone, but again its only been 3 days.</li>
            <li>when I had a blister on my toe that had become infected and had also developed a red line running up my leg.</li>
            <li>Since then I have developed arthritis throughout my mid and lower spine.</li>
            <li>A lot of people believe that most of us are deficient in magnesium, and I have headaches</li>
            <li>It does say empty entire bag into bath but that would be too much IMHO.</li>
            <li>It felt great, a little minor stinging sensation but nothing dramatic.</li>
            <li>boil one half cup of spring and/or distilled water, take it of the burner and immediately add one half cup of flakes, stir until it completely dissolves and then let it cool before pouring into a plastic spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t count on it to get your 100% RDA, but if you put it over a large amount of your body you will definitely feel a mental &amp; physical calming effect.</li>
            <li>I used to be a light sleeper, I can be wake up by very small noise, but not anymore after I start to use the lotion daily before bed time.  </li>
            <li>I did physical therapy for months, got massages, took off work for a few months to see if the break would help, stretched frequently, took hot baths, tried acupuncture, went to a chiropractor...</li>
            <li>I never use the whole bag or even half.</li>
            <li>but maybe I made it too strong because it stings my skin if there is any broken skin.</li>
            <li>I have used this product only a few times, but notice a positive difference in my sleep and overall rest.</li>
            <li>I got a small spray bottle and mixed half flakes and half water to make my own magnesium oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> - I did my own experimenting.  </li>
            <li> So, I would soak in the bath (not too warm, of course) for about 20-30 minutes, using 1-2 cups of the flakes.  </li>

            <li> Makes him very calm and happy.  </li>
            <li> Not as great if you&#x27;re mixing it in the bathtub because you will run out of it quickly.</li>

            <li> They have many fine products.</li>
            <li> Ancient minerals seem to be a good clean product, I&#x27;ve used their magnesium oil for several years and feel these flakes will make a good healthy magnesium lotion.</li>

            <li> Really helps with having a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> ; I use it to make a magnesium spray (mix about 1 part flakes with 2 parts warm water until they dissolve and pour into a spray bottle) which is supposed to be absorbed through your skin.</li>
            <li> enjoying sharing great products with people and I am a social worker who is always stressed out.</li>
            <li> Very nice natural product....</li>
            <li> lotion and oil recipes are easily found if you just google it.</li>

            <li> RO remove all minerals from the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;flakes&amp;#34; are chunky, but dissolve very quickly in water.  </li>
            <li> They shipped it very quickly, I had</li>
            <li> The magnesium arrived very quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li> The spray is really easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t have any scent.</li>
            <li> Ouch, it hurts when you first apply it, kind of like hydrogen peroxide on a wound.  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed a difference in what I use it for (magnesium deficiency), but this product itself is just fine</li>
            <li> Super great product, and it shipped super fast.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s very grateful &amp; asking for more!</li>
            <li> I have read so much about the benefits of magnesium and how most people are lacking in magnesium and don&#x27;t even know it!  </li>
            <li> Nice large flakes.</li>
            <li> This is really amazing because I don&#x27;t like using aluminum-based deodorant and many natural deodorants</li>
            <li> I ordered the magnesium flakes to make my own magnesium oil at a much lower cost than buying it by the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I kid you not, the very next day the discomfort was GREATLY minimized.</li>
            <li> I have a deep tub that is great for soaking.  </li>
            <li> I feel much more relaxed and calm before bed (sprayed on the bottom of my feet).</li>
            <li> It feels lightly &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; on the hands after application, but rinses with just water.</li>
            <li> now you have some fantastic &#x27;magnesium oil&#x27;.</li>
            <li> And very cost effective.</li>
            <li> Just the product I need and at such great savings over the health food stores</li>
            <li> I ended up sleeping soundly that night and did not have to deal with burning or itching that the magnesium oil caused me.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product for not only detoxing but helping with skin irritations.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more powerful, I don&#x27;t have to mix</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of these, but you have to put the whole bag in the bath at once according to the instructions</li>
            <li> It absorbs instantly from the skin and seems to work great.</li>
            <li> For SENIORS to  get sound.</li>
            <li> After reading some reviews I thought it would be a smaller bag, I was happy when it arrived.</li>
            <li> It is a great hair tamer for the slicked back look too.</li>
            <li> very cost effective and it works.  </li>
            <li> Great for making magoil, and getting your daily magnesium.</li>
            <li> It describes how relevant magnesium is in the body,  and explains how to use the Magnesium flakes.  </li>
            <li> My doctor told me magnesium is important to health.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that has helped me in my journey towards being healthier and try to get rid of as much stress and possible, it has also helped me with migraine headaches.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would be great to soak in as well, but I just had other uses for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to make on your own, and this is a very affordable way to do so.</li>
            <li> And it really moisturizes!!!</li>
            <li> I have found this very useful for helping to alleviate lyme symptoms (sore joints / feet) when used in a foot bath.</li>
            <li> I bought it to make mineral oil with and its super easy.</li>
            <li> It was quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Super easy</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my own magnesium oil as an alternative to Epsom Salts and paying for magnesium oil at a high price.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to a friend, however I would say there is more than a single use in the package, which is good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it will work for everyone, but it works for me, which I&#x27;m very happy about.  </li>
            <li> I also love that the bag is resealable, seeing as how I didn&#x27;t use the whole bag at once!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been better off taking magnesium orally and using regular bath salts in a warm tub or foot soak.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been buying Barbara Handel&#x27;s premixed Mag Oil for the last year and I can tell you that hands-down this is formula (Ancient Mineerals) is 10x more effective as a Deodorant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product, I am very pleased &amp; actually just reordered earlier today.</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t use it right after shaving!</li>
            <li> I find that I am sleeping better and feeling better in general.</li>
            <li> Just add 1 cup of water and 1 cup of flakes, boil, and let cool.</li>
            <li> , let cool</li>
            <li> I was able to put the whole bag in a gallon glass jar.</li>
            <li> They feel good when mixed with water as a spray for arms legs tummy...</li>
            <li> I hoped this stuff would be better, and it absolutely is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let cool and put in a spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a good sized bag that was larger than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li> It really helps me feel better</li>
            <li> I have physically felt really good since using this product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving it so far.    </li>
            <li> I made &amp;#34;magnesium oil&amp;#34; from it to apply transdermally as a good source of daily mg.</li>
            <li> I found amazon to have the most reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Let it dissolve and cool and then pour into a spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> How glad i am that i bought it thanks to all reviews.</li>
            <li> I apply it all over my skin, even on my face,  apply pure shea butter by perfect body harmony after wiping off the wetness after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a spray bottle that I filled months ago, and it is as clear and effective as when I first made it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This solution has made a radical difference in how quickly these bites/sores are healing.  </li>
            <li> It deliver quickly but the bag was torn.  </li>
            <li> They melt quick, also.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent aid for easing into restful sleep (especially when you put a drop of essential oil in the mix!).</li>
            <li> Melted quickly to make magnesium oil spray.</li>
            <li> I now swear by them and recommend them to every pregnant mama I can.  </li>
            <li> Received quickly.</li>
            <li> The flakes dissolve quickly.</li>
            <li> The magnesium oil itself is super oily and drying.</li>
            <li> I really love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> We started from 15 min soak in very warm, not hot water.</li>
            <li> It worked the first day!</li>
            <li> Relieved pain in my feet with the first soak!</li>
            <li> I had restless legs syndrome, but after the first use it&#x27;s gone!</li>
            <li> It is working very well!!  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a pretty pricey soak!</li>
            <li> Previous attempts to use Espson Salts have never been very effective -</li>
            <li> Very effective, I sleep like a baby and have less muscle pain when I use this.  </li>
            <li> This is a soothing way to calm your restless leg syndrome before heading off to bed.</li>
            <li> It makes my bath feel silky smooth while I&#x27;m absorbing magnesium thru my skin.</li>
            <li> After trying multiple times to take magnesium orally, I decided to purchase these to make my own magnesium oil.</li>
            <li> The Shea butter should help moisturize while the magnesium is being absorbed.</li>
            <li> I also use them to make my own magnesium oil for topical use.</li>
            <li> Most americans are deficient in Magnesium, so this is a great product to have on hand and use.</li>
            <li> I always feel rejuvenated after a nice soak, especially after walking 5 miles.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t find it worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t have to worry about dripping water drying (being absorbed) into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s likely an acute deficiency of magnesium, potassium, or both.</li>
            <li> Resealable bag keeps it fresh.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin so soft with coconut oil on top of it.</li>
            <li> After all the flakes are in the jar, top it off with water, and periodically shake it up until completely dissolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Made my own magnesium topical cream!</li>
            <li> This is a really excellent quality product based on my research, especially for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for about a week, I can honestly say that I do notice a subtle sense of better overall energy and well being through out the day after I spray twice each on my arms, legs and stomach.</li>
            <li> I compete in obstacle course races and  noticed after my latest race that my muscles recovered much more quickly than in previous events before I started using this.</li>
            <li> boiled it down to make magnesium oil, works fine in a spray bottle a lot cheaper to make your own</li>
            <li> but I took a shower right after the bath since I detest taking baths.</li>
            <li> I had years that I never slept right away.</li>
            <li> Disolving l cup of these pure Magnesium flakes in a cup of boiling water, cool, put in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But if you&#x27;re like me and have tried EVERY deodorant under the sun (inclduing the dreaded Certain Dri) then you will withstand the pain like a true</li>
            <li> The product seems good, the bag is smaller than I expected but overall, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Got to get used to the feeling it leaves on skin, but worth it to know that I&#x27;m supporting my health in this way.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, if I planned to use the flakes in a bath every few days, I managed to keep away most of the discomfort and felt great up until birth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For some reason, I felt like I absorbed this much, much better than regular Epsom salts.</li>
            <li> Please refer to Dr. Carolyn Dean&#x27;s The Magnesium Miracle or her website for &amp;#34;outside the box&amp;#34; info on supplementation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have experienced two years of debilitating radicular spasm pain (similar to sciatic pain) which did not respond to numerous Rx trials, prolotherapy, accupuncture, epidural injections, facet injections, a radiofrequency nerve ablation.</li>
            <li> Much more natural way for the body to absorb magnesium, as the body can decide how much it wants to intake.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the ingredients in the cream, or anything technical or medical about the products - but you are welcome to email me if you have questions  </li>
            <li> Doing my own magnesium oil with those flakes.&lt;br /&gt;Sting a little bit but the sensation disappears fast, provide your body with magnesium and easy to apply on skin after a shower.</li>
            <li> I do like this product very much and will continue to order it.  </li>
            <li> it, it might sting a little when you start using it, but once your skin is healed from the dryness by the magnesium, the magnesium solution is actually very easy to apply and comfortable on your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a bit pricey considering they want you to use the whole bag in one bath!</li>
            <li> Mix with your favorite essential oil and put in a spray bottle and you will have deodorant.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to use up my first bag though.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> Read on a holistic website about using a hot washcloth soaked in either water and Epsom salt or Magnesium flakes to pull infection out of a wound.</li>
            <li> I also spray it on my body at night to have a peaceful and relaxing sleep.</li>
            <li> I still have plenty of flakes left over for more uses</li>
            <li> I will be using it in my bath pretty soon.</li>
            <li> I really like the energy it gives me!  </li>
            <li> maybe that&#x27;s because I apply it first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li> They dissolve well and seem to be exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I find this solution helps my back aches, helps my face complexion, and makes me fee much better.</li>
            <li> Again, only a cup or so in a bath - and they seem calmer and sleep better.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m in a Rocky Mountain Hot Spring.</li>
            <li> I was going to purchase an 8 oz spray bottle of magnesium oil for the SAME price as this whole bag at Whole Foods, but I decided to look into making my own with these flakes.</li>
            <li> I still sweat when it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li> - It can sting your skin within the first 20 minutes of spraying</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I first tried the Ancient Minerals Magnesium Bath Flakes in a foot soak.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the foot soak, I couldn&#x27;t believe that after just 20 mins my pain went away.  </li>
            <li> you want to spray it onto your skin, you&#x27;ll need a spray bottle that can handle a higher viscosity liquid.</li>
            <li> Thanks!  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> The flakes are large and much more flakey than Epsom salts, and the &amp;#34;relaxant&amp;#34; results lasts much longer - weeks longer - than soaking in regular Epsom salts.</li>
            <li> A long soak with magnesium flakes makes me feel better all over.</li>
            <li> so the first time I made Mg oil and sprayed my skin was very itchy.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I was not nauseated during a pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Good price on Amazon as usual.</li>
            <li> The feet felt warmer and more alive instantly and all the next day, and the quality of sleep after feet soak was way better.</li>
            <li> For the first time in years he can enjoy an entire day without muscle pain.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, hope to see results on my next Bone scan!</li>
            <li> I took a previous Reviewer&#x27;s advice and made my own Magnesium Oil by boiling a cup of water and then adding a cup of the flakes.</li>
            <li> I made up a batch to use as a spray before going to bed at night, and it certainly helps with leg cramps and pain in the ankles.  </li>
            <li> Large flakes</li>
            <li> I made magnesium oil out of these flakes and they seem very high quality.</li>
            <li> But it seems to be effective if I rinse after a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my neck felt very relax.</li>
            <li> So I decided to give my whole team a sample.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this to bathe in, because you dont get that much product</li>
            <li> /&gt;And, for some reason it says to use the whole bag for one bath . .</li>
            <li> I guess I expected more of a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Usually very reactive (often require Rx meds to treat).  </li>
            <li> Leaves a very metallic smell on skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> it really worked for me.  </li>
            <li> I believe I may have to try quite a few more to give a better account and the package directions say to use an entire bag for one bath.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really justify that so just know that is the recommendation.</li>
            <li> Now (after 2 weeks of daily magnesium baths) he is waking up pain free.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still a fantastic source of magnesium and vastly cheaper.</li>
            <li> You do not need to use the whole bag as it says on the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The suggestion that you use a whole bag is why I refuse to give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Taking a bath with these magnesium flakes is very relaxing.  </li>
            <li> oil really works as a magnesium supplement.</li>
            <li> It also really helps when your muscles are tensed up.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t used it that much yet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference between epsom salts and these flakes.</li>
            <li> It really helps.</li>
            <li> Magnesium flakes can be used to make \\&quot;magnesium oil\\&quot; much cheaper than you can buy it already in liquid form.  </li>
            <li> This really aids in relaxing those sore muscles.</li>
            <li> I give my children massages with the magnesium oil created from the flakes before bed, and it is very relaxing for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bag literally says.. pour in the whole bag for an eczema soak..</li>
            <li> REALLY?</li>
            <li> 8 pound bag is not as much as one would think.</li>
            <li> .. straight magnesium chloride.. do a google search for NIGARI Solution &amp; save yourself a lot of cash..</li>
            <li> I had been waking up with very sore hips in the morning</li>
            <li> Just wish it did not cost so much</li>
            <li> would not use this as per its instructions, which recommends using the whole bag in 1 bath.  </li>
            <li> very relaxing fast shipping</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast as always with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very calming to the nervous system also.  </li>
            <li> it or buy some ready made magnesium oil and see if you like it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> On nights when I&#x27;m having a lot of pain, I&#x27;ll rub in on from my hip to my feet, and it really does help.</li>
            <li> We absorb so much through the bottom of our feet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a real person with a neurological condition.</li>
            <li> &quot; I take a quart jar and pour as much of this bag of flakes into it that it will take -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really hoping this helps with the twitchy legs and insomnia.  </li>
            <li> I do not feel that one needs to use a whole package to benefit from the product.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I really like these magnesium bath flakes.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping - as described.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Magnesium Chloride, even if it&#x27;s an inorganic salt, is very well&lt;</li>
            <li> The bag is smaller than epson salt bags you can purchase at the grocery store, but my understanding is that this is a different kind of magnesium.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m sitting in my own dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using it to make my own essential oil spray, so it will last me...</li>
            <li> I put it on the back of my legs and it absorbs pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I spray it on after my workouts 30 min before a shower as I&#x27;m on a keto diet and read that most people need potassium and magnesium due to deficiency in the diet itself.</li>
            <li> 1/2 cup mag flakes in 1/2 cup boiling distilled water, boil until dissolved, cool down, put into clean spray bottle.</li>
            <li> His and my dry cracked heels have been getting much better and its really soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It stings a little bit when you first put it on - not a painful sting, but you can feel it tingle kind of sharply.  </li>
            <li> I just filled 50% in a bottle and the other with hot water in a bowl.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well as deodorant too (spray under arms), though for hotter, sweatier days I also use a natural stick along with the mag.</li>
            <li> Dr. Raul Vergini says, that \\&quot;this is true only for severe renal&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I guess this is more $, but you need less to see the benefits?</li>
            <li> You can make it 1/4th or 1/3rd ratio and add more water to have less skin irritation.</li>
            <li> After a shower I spray on my back and it quickly absorbs.</li>
            <li> I definitely noticed a boost in my mood (and, um, &amp;#34;regularity&amp;#34;) after I started consistently using this.</li>
            <li> They also help relax me if I am unable to sleep and all-around great product.</li>
            <li> I found a &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; online for how to make your own magnesium oil (it&#x27;s not really an oil, this product is just mixed with water and dissolved) and then we put it into a spray bottle to spray on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I discovered these when pregnant with my third child - and they made all the difference in my level of discomfort.  </li>
            <li> Boil the MgCl in water for a safe saline solution, add it to drinks; a few drops really mellows out coffee.  </li>
            <li> The ancient minerals brand works a million times better to keep my muscles not so tight.</li>
            <li> The product was highly recommended by a blogger I follow</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend making up a batch and spraying on generously before bed.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Ancient minerals carries high quality products continually.</li>
            <li> This was a high end brand</li>
            <li> I had a nice, slightly drowsy feeling that I only get if I use twice as much epsom salt.</li>
            <li> My body feels more lose, I am slightly more flexible, and my symptoms would always get worse around the time I would PMS; however my achy muscles, headache, and tight muscles have been much more manageable this month, then they were last month.  </li>
            <li> I feel physically relaxed as well as mentally calm.  </li>
            <li> Do not use as much as is stated,  I use about half of what they say is needed and it works just fine for me.</li>
            <li> (Or at least more aware of the dreams.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the most part it soaks in to your skin, but I have had a few times where I could see a film when it</li>
            <li> I used this product a few times this winter when i was training for my latest Boston Marathon.</li>
            <li> We rub some \\&quot;oil\\&quot; on our temples or forehead when we have a headache, and it normally solves the problem.</li>
            <li> I even put it in my son&#x27;s yogurts when he is not looking, he never complained about the taste.</li>
            <li> It works well and lasting (much longer than if I dumped the whole thing into the tub to soak for a bit and then drain!)</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;this is also true for all minerals, that cannot be easily eliminated by&lt;br /&gt;a seriously impaired kidney.</li>
            <li> I bought it to make Magnesium oil which I heard is really good to apply on skin when you feel tired or have headache.</li>
            <li> Before buying this product, I tried making my own &amp;#34;magnesium oil&amp;#34; out of epsom salts, to relieve my chronic pain, and was not very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> however they break down easily in food processor to use in bath bombs.</li>
            <li> Then my daughter found &amp;#34;Transdermal Magnesium Therapy: A New Modality for the Maintenance of Health&amp;#34; by Mark Sircus online.</li>
            <li> My old sleep cycle is back - it&#x27;s easy to fall asleep or fall back to asleep.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, I did break out around my chest and back when I first used it.</li>
            <li> Since then the bumps are clearing up, and I’ve only been spraying it on my arms, legs, and stomach, with no ill side effects.</li>
            <li> I dissolved some in hot water and mixed it into coconut oil and bee&#x27;s wax to make a lotion that I put on my calves before going to sleep at night.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same bag for over a year, too, so it lasts pretty well.</li>
            <li> You can buy the exact same size on the companies</li>
            <li> I found the instructions on how to make it as easy as to heat distilled water and mix it with the flakes equal parts let it cool and use a small blue water pump bottle to apply.</li>
            <li> But too huge, but big enough to last me quite a while.</li>
            <li> Made this into a natural deodorant, but DON&#x27;T use immediately after shaving -</li>
            <li> I’m a 27 year old Administrative assistant.</li>
            <li> No my discomfort has not been fixed 100%, but I would take this Level 2 level of discomfort</li>
            <li> sleep - WOW -</li>
            <li> Since creating the solution, I had multiple chigger bites and, thanks to my cat, poison ivy exposure to my arms.  </li>
            <li> Last much longer than ANY poison ivy treatment found at drug stores.  </li>
            <li> extra fast delivery and as promised.</li>
            <li> This whole bag should last me hopefully a year.</li>
            <li> Stopped traveling up after I applied the washcloth and then took about 7 hours for the line to recede and then disappear completely.</li>
            <li> I would add a handful to my hot bath after my long runs.</li>
            <li> He sprays the oil directly on his skin, whereas I used the oil to make a body butter/lotion that also included shea butter, avocado oil, beeswax, and lavender/tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> - It also relieves the pain on my feet when I spray the oil directly on them when they get sore and cramps.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Adults and children over 5 years old ............ 125cc&lt;br /&gt;4 year old children ........................................</li>
            <li> /&gt;3 year old children ........................................ 80cc</li>

            <li> 6 months old children .........................</li>
            <li> I, personally, cannot attest to any perceived difference from the Ancient Minerals oil spray and continue to use both--reasoning that I might possibly compromise my success by using this one alone.</li>
            <li> I did the cycle a few times - and every 3rd or 4th day, the discomfort would return; I&#x27;d soak and they&#x27;d be alleviated.  </li>
            <li> With our modern diets, most of us are deficient in magnesium.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m fairly scientific and skeptical of products that heal, soothe, etc</li>
            <li> person told me that her 10 day long menstral was cut to 5 days, some reported better sleep, and some report that they feel less stress.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and relaxing bath, but a big bag like this seemed a bit much for just one bath when I only use 2 cups of Epsom Salts in a bath, so I only used half the bag and it seemed to be fine.</li>
            <li> They are small and easy to scoop.  </li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t take magnesium orally, I&#x27;d highly recommend these flakes for topical application.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend regular magnesium baths.</li>
            <li> When you take high doses of Vitamin D and if you are already low in magnesium, the increased amount of metabolic work drains magnesium from its muscle storage sites.</li>
            <li> It is to high priced for such nonsense!</li>
            <li> I would recommend starting off using only a little, and working your way up to more as it seems to lessen the itchiness as you go.</li>
            <li> This has been a very cost-effective replacement for several other forms of magnesium tablets and capsules for me, positive results are just as noticeable.  </li>
            <li> 3-4 years ago the muscles in my arms, particularly on the right side of my body began to get very tight.</li>
            <li> I have recently been trying to get as much magnesium topically as possible, and these bath flakes ROCK!</li>
            <li> Transdermal magnesium  (sprayed onto your skin) is the only way to really get enough of this king of minerals.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the slight burning feeling on my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that a couple of spritzes will make me very itchy, especially just starting out.</li>
            <li> both products I experience mild burning for a few minutes after application.</li>
            <li> They tell you this product can&#x27;t be used for making DIY magnesium oil because they want to sell you their own bottle of very expensive magnesium oil that is exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was due to my lost of baby fat on the forehead</li>
            <li> Strangely, some of my muscle tightness went away and I had some decent nights sleep.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a deceptively large bag and will last a long time in our home.  </li>
            <li> This is great for a foot soak &amp; not too bad for shipping time.</li>
            <li> so I will not speak to perceived benefits from this product, specifically, but rather to magnesium supplementation in general.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t completely gone, but again its only been 3 days.</li>
            <li> when I had a blister on my toe that had become infected and had also developed a red line running up my leg.</li>
            <li> Since then I have developed arthritis throughout my mid and lower spine.</li>
            <li> A lot of people believe that most of us are deficient in magnesium, and I have headaches</li>
            <li> It does say empty entire bag into bath but that would be too much IMHO.</li>
            <li> It felt great, a little minor stinging sensation but nothing dramatic.</li>
            <li> boil one half cup of spring and/or distilled water, take it of the burner and immediately add one half cup of flakes, stir until it completely dissolves and then let it cool before pouring into a plastic spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t count on it to get your 100% RDA, but if you put it over a large amount of your body you will definitely feel a mental &amp; physical calming effect.</li>
            <li> I used to be a light sleeper, I can be wake up by very small noise, but not anymore after I start to use the lotion daily before bed time.  </li>
            <li> I did physical therapy for months, got massages, took off work for a few months to see if the break would help, stretched frequently, took hot baths, tried acupuncture, went to a chiropractor...</li>
            <li> I never use the whole bag or even half.</li>
            <li> but maybe I made it too strong because it stings my skin if there is any broken skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product only a few times, but notice a positive difference in my sleep and overall rest.</li>
            <li> I got a small spray bottle and mixed half flakes and half water to make my own magnesium oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use just a fourth of a cup of this mixed with a cup of water in a spray bottle for my hair, my skin , minor cuts and scratches.</li>
            <li> , my only complaint is that the bag isn&#x27;t large enough for detoxing soaks.</li>
            <li> (I have very little) then puts me to sleep to fast.</li>
            <li> Not sure really if this is getting the magnesium into my bloodstream.</li>
            <li> Will last you  a long time.</li>
            <li> moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have chronic pain from other medical conditions, but have avoided acute spasm for 3 months by increasing my magnesium supplementation 3-4x and cutting back on calcium.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll eventually get all the flakes into the jar, but you have to add a little water to get the flakes to break down first.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> pain relief is quite noticeable, especially in my feet and hands, and the spray bottles make the bag go a very long way.  </li>
            <li> I recommend you experiment with different forms of magnesium to avoid loose stools.</li>
            <li> hours the first two doses if the case is serious)</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t evaporate as fast as plain water, and the mineral will leave an odd powdery feel, especially if you try to put lotion on before or after it.  </li>
            <li> I am highly allergic to nickel (razors, fake jewelry etc), I tend to get breakouts after shaving - applying this after my shaves, really puts the breakouts at bay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Magnesium is an important mineral for the body, and one that is difficult to obtain through oral supplementation.</li>
            <li> and it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I can make different things with it and maybe even use it in my wellness center</li>
            <li> I use this for long foot soaks</li>
            <li> and evening for a long period.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t wait to see what the long term benefits are to using magnesium oil!</li>
            <li> Helps relaxes me ,do it after my dry brushing &amp; bath ,also at night ,helps keep my body in balance...</li>
            <li> This product is labeled for SINGLE USE in tub of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rechecked the instructions given on the description here and saw that while the title did say single use pouch</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was a single use.</li>
            <li> Single Use pouch&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> I use my spray every single day, and this bag has lasted me over a year.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> As I cannot take magnesium by mouth it causes loose stool and lowers my stomach acid.</li>
            <li> A little more expensive than the other brands out there.</li>
            <li> A little bit actually goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This may be exactly as described, but when mixed with oil there&#x27;s a weird texture.  </li>
            <li> still only getting 6 hours a night or less but</li>
            <li> but, I will have to evaluate this a little further.</li>
            <li> And, it works, just as I expected it to.  </li>
            <li> basically I tried everything with minimal results.</li>
            <li> Really no way to know if this works as claims.</li>
            <li> This bag contains enough flakes for quite a few cups of oil.</li>
            <li> FYI - Magnesium oil is not really an oil and will not stay slippery on skin.</li>
            <li> I also add a few drops of lavender essential oil to help with sleep.  </li>
            <li> regular  epsom salts, the pain relief is marginal, and when I put it in a spray bottle, the nozzle gets clogged within a few days, and the solution gets contaminated by bacteria.  </li>
            <li> Will reorder when empty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those who have kidney problems should be carefully monitored&lt;br /&gt;by</li>
            <li> their family physician, according to the Center for Disease&lt;br /&gt;Control.</li>
            <li> Half cup of minerals to half cup boiling water put in a spray bottle and use it daily.</li>
            <li> After a long hard day, this is a product that helps to relax, even if only soaking my feet.  </li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t get the flake volume down enough to get all the flakes in, put a lid on your jar, and shake it up a little.</li>
            <li> Oral magnesium supplements made me incredibly sick to my stomach, usually ending in me vomiting them up...which kind of defeated the purpose.</li>
            <li> so I actually think it caused my magnesium levels to go down!!  </li>
            <li> I would use other forms of magnesium therapy or buy epsom salts.</li>
            <li> Other than that, no negatives.</li>
            <li> First I was skeptical about how well it might work to help me sleep,</li>
            <li> I hope they change their packaging to reflect other dosage options because no way is 12.50 a bath going to happen.</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy this as a bath/foot soak, it&#x27;s extremely overpriced for that...</li>
            <li> I thought this was due to the magnesium.  </li>
            <li> mix equal parts of water and flakes in a small sauce pan, and heat until dissolved.  </li>
            <li> if I would get it again due to price.</li>
            <li> You will find other ways to add this to your diet</li>
            <li> I can no longer use this product as an oil due to drying out my skin as well as the burning and itching.</li>
            <li> In all other cases, there are no risks.</li>
            <li> It will sting the first few times, which i have read means your are deficient, but still way less than the</li>
            <li> Necessary for about 250 bodily functions and virtually everyone is deficient.</li>
            <li> That is not a large dose!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say if this truly changed my magnesium levels without a medical test</li>
            <li> I made the water/magnesium combination making an oil and have been using for a few months - a little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Melted down for Magnesium oil.</li>
            <li> For big cuts and scratches it BURNS bad but heals so much quicker with this sprayed on it dailyl.</li>
            <li> Just use about a cup or less.</li>
            <li> Mix half and half with water for a spritz to use on muscle cramps and aches.</li>
            <li> i feel noticeably less stressed after i use these.</li>
            <li> For the lotion, I used a half cup of flakes and added about 3 tbsps of boiling water to it.</li>
            <li> I mix mine with half water and half flakes and use the included bottle to spray this on my skin.</li>
            <li> : When dissolved in water, the solution is slightly oily.</li>
            <li> With the body butter you still are increasing your magnesium transdermally, but it stings a lot less.</li>
            <li> it stings way less than the oil.</li>
            <li> I fill half of my spray bottle up with the flakes, and then fill the rest with water.</li>
            <li> site for half the price.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes there is a slight tingling sensation that passes after about 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using it in this way, this small bag will end up lasting at least a year, making it an inexpensive option.</li>
            <li> Words could never do this little miracle justice.</li>
            <li> but oh boy.. Just rub a little bit of the lotion on my feet before bed and cover with socks, and i fall asleep in no time.  </li>
            <li> I even add a little to my aftershave.</li>
            <li> The package says use it all at one time, but a little each night helps.</li>
            <li> After spending a ton of money with little results, I stopped.</li>
            <li> Not very pleased w/ that.</li>
            <li> I have been buying and using for a few years now.</li>
            <li> As I dried off with a terry cloth towel I noticed dead skin cells wiping away.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses, my skin is a bit healthier feeling too.</li>
            <li> try just applying to the tops of your feet a few times a day.  </li>
            <li> I can tell if I miss a few days, the pain comes back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used them to make mineral oil, and the mineral oil burned and dried out my skin</li>
            <li> Please please don&#x27;t waste your money on a fancy $12 bath, they&#x27;re trying to scam you...</li>
            <li> I used magnesium baths for a few months and found out that after testing my magnesium levels did not change at all.  </li>
            <li> I made a magnesium spray and started using it a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> After a few days, some of the discomfort would return, so I would soak in the magnesium bath again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a few bottles around the house, wherever I might hang out and need some pain relief.  </li>
            <li> so I can spritz myself a few minutes before my</li>
            <li> out there are either messy or don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Although it still feels a bit &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; on the skin - it is not as messy as the oil.</li>
            <li> so stiff it was heartbreaking to watch.</li>
            <li> Even at night time, magnesium capsules are not good for my slow digestion with low stomach acid.</li>
            <li> did not fair well with me for other problems.  </li>
            <li> Well I was shocked to find that it did absolutely nothing to my Mag RBC test results.  </li>
            <li> I have purchase this order in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it it cleared up my skin any faster than without</li>
            <li> /&gt;Epsom Salts in the past and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure</li>
            <li> I usually just put on lotion afterward.  </li>
            <li> It is too expensive to use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I have seen any benefits yet</li>
            <li> and then I rinse it off and use my usual Mag deodorant.</li>
            <li> My feet and hands always get so dry after spraying on this stuff and it can feel quite uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Can be hard to work with this product.</li>
            <li> I work hard.</li>
            <li> I use them at least once a week for eczema/dry skin relief along with some epsom salts.</li>
            <li> My 28 year old niece has suffered for years with PMS, swollen painful breasts, &amp; cramps.</li>
            <li> , my legs would be sore and achy, and I was generally tired and uncomfortable, especially toward the end of pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> My son suffers with them daily.</li>
            <li> No more pain!</li>
            <li> When your muscles get tense</li>
            <li> One last thing, don&#x27;t taste it because it has an awful soapy bitter taste that&#x27;s hard to rinse out.</li>
            <li> To bad they post such a statement, but I do like the stuff and use it as a mist spray with distilled water.</li>
            <li> probably used to weak of a magnesium solution.</li>
            <li> Also, another site recommended drinking a weak solution of the Magnesium flakes and water every 6 hours as well.</li>
            <li> 80% of us humans are deficient in Magnesium.</li>
            <li> Also, if my legs are tired after hiking or shopping, I sprinkle Magnesium oil on them and it helps almost immediately.</li>
            <li> product to soak sore , tired body.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> These flakes were expensive and</li>
            <li> Expensive product though.</li>
            <li> At that rate, this is too expensive and If you&#x27;re looking for detox material, I would recommend Epsom salts b/c</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t need to me skeptical.</li>
            <li> That is one expensive soak....</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has not worked for him.</li>
            <li> A bit silly that this is considered &amp;#34;single use.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> but why is it so expensive here?  </li>
            <li> It has worked well for me, except in the winter months when it is cold.  </li>
            <li> YES it may itch like crazy..</li>
            <li> Too expensive!  </li>
            <li> Has unpleasant taste, so you have to mix it in some ice tea or coffee, or anything you want.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be a bad thing if it wasn&#x27;t so pricey.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about this.  </li>
            <li> When I got the bag I flipped it over to read the directions on amount and was shocked at what it said.  </li>
            <li> I used these flakes to make magnesium oil, and my painful leg cramps went away.</li>
            <li> This and his gel help to relieve painful areas along with detoxing.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> For tub baths though it&#x27;s crazy!</li>
            <li> I was shocked!  </li>
            <li> I also keep the flakes on hand and do a foot soak if I&#x27;m having very bad pain.  </li>
            <li> Used both the wash cloth soak and drink (tasted horrible!)</li>

            <li> After trying multiple times to take magnesium orally, I decided to purchase these to make my own magnesium oil. Oral magnesium supplements made me incredibly sick to my stomach, usually ending in me vomiting them up...which kind of defeated the purpose. If you can&#x27;t take magnesium orally, I&#x27;d highly recommend these flakes for topical application.</li>
            <li> Good product highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have purchase this order in the past. It is a life saver. So before my purchase I stumbled on magnesium oil through YouTube. I did hours of research and I decided to make my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;To tell you the truth it changed my life. I have more energy. I used to get severe tension in my neck I spray the magnesium and my neck felt very relax. My husband walks around the house spraying the magnesium. When my 4 year is out of control I would spray it on the bottom of his feet and inseconds he is calmer.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoying sharing great products with people and I am a social worker who is always stressed out. So I decided to give my whole team a sample. There views about this product was remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;One person told me that her 10 day long menstral was cut to 5 days, some reported better sleep, and some report that they feel less stress.</li>
            <li> I used these flakes to make homemade magnesium spray. Regular magnesium sprays burn my skin, thats because of a deficiency in the mineral though. Until I build up my minerals I will keep using my homemade spray. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this to bathe in, because you dont get that much product and it wouldnt last but maybe 2 baths. Instead I would make a tincture or spray to put on your skin with these flakes.</li>
            <li> Perfect size bag. But too huge, but big enough to last me quite a while. I got a small spray bottle and mixed half flakes and half water to make my own magnesium oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, for some reason it says to use the whole bag for one bath . . . That&#x27;s probably way more magnesium then your body needs. Just use about a cup or less.</li>
            <li> My Bowen practitioner has made me a believer in supplying magnesium to my cells.  I feel so much better when my muscles don&#x27;t ache.  A long soak with magnesium flakes makes me feel better all over.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as a foot soak lately, especially at night (for insomnia) and also anxiety. I find it helps to relax my entire body and mind. It&#x27;s such a relaxing experience that I look forward to every night. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I like that they have no scent and dissolve well.</li>
            <li> Makes great magnesium oil, also great for baths!</li>
            <li> A great product. I use it to make a lotion.</li>
            <li> I use epsom salts for pain and I thought this would be even better.  I was wrong.  The only thing Ancient Minerals Magnesium Bath Flakes did was burn my skin.  Still had the pain, but now I have red irritated skin too.  I tried diluting it and got no results.</li>
            <li> a bit pricey considering they want you to use the whole bag in one bath!</li>
            <li> I have been buying and using for a few years now. I make my own mineral oil and I love this product and brand. Mix with your favorite essential oil and put in a spray bottle and you will have deodorant. Great for skin irritants and sore muscles also. .</li>
            <li> I got this to make magnesium lotion. Works great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. With our modern diets, most of us are deficient in magnesium.  I made magnesium oil with this product (equal parts water to equal parts magnesium flakes 1:1) and put in an atomizer spray bottle.  After a shower I spray on my back and it quickly absorbs. This also acts as a pain reliever. Will last you  a long time.</li>
            <li> Product came on time. I used it to make magnesium oil, that I use to treat Restless Leg syndrome(RLS). It worked the first day! Now I have used it for 3 days and no RLS! What a relief..I can sleep! 80% of us humans are deficient in Magnesium. You can take it orally, but on your skin, you absorb more of the Magnesium! I will always order this product as it has cured my RLS and it lets me sleep and not panic while having an episode. I no longer have episodes! Love, Love, Love!</li>
            <li> Half cup of minerals to half cup boiling water put in a spray bottle and use it daily. Great way to get magnesium in me and it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I love these as great way to get my children the magnesium they need!</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> The best magnesium chloride ive every used, I make my own mag oil and use it in my bath and under my arms as a deodorant, i rub it on my legs and feet at night to help with my pain and on the bottom of my feet to help with sleep..........</li>
            <li> These flakes were expensive and just okay. I guess I expected more of a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; work on my feet and leg cramps. I have been better off taking magnesium orally and using regular bath salts in a warm tub or foot soak.</li>
            <li> Great product to use to make Magnesuim Oil.  Also works great for foot soaks. Relieved pain in my feet with the first soak!</li>
            <li> I ordered the magnesium flakes to make my own magnesium oil at a much lower cost than buying it by the bottle.  And, it works, just as I expected it to.  Very pleased, and would recommend to anyone wanting to make their own oil.</li>
            <li> Very nice natural product....Disolves nicely in the bath and feels great on my skin!</li>
            <li> Beat Expectations - Great product for muscle spasm or neuropathy-type pain.  You can use this in the tub - about 1 cup of product will suffice.  Or, you can also make a magnesium oil by placing the salts in a glass jar and covering the salts with water - becomes an oil in about one day.  The flakes are large and much more flakey than Epsom salts, and the &amp;#34;relaxant&amp;#34; results lasts much longer - weeks longer - than soaking in regular Epsom salts.</li>
            <li> i bought this to make my own mag oil and absolutely love this product! has helped my health in so many ways!</li>
            <li> Just received this today. Going to make homemade Shea butter/magnesium lotion. As I cannot take magnesium by mouth it causes loose stool and lowers my stomach acid. (I have very little) then puts me to sleep to fast. Even at night time, magnesium capsules are not good for my slow digestion with low stomach acid. My doctor diagnosed me low magnesium and told me to pronto get it up! She told me I should use it topically if I cannot tolerate internally. I tried the magnesium oil and although I hear once you&#x27;ve been acclimated to it, it will no longer burn, but I need it NOW and cannot tolerate that burning sensation. The Shea butter should help moisturize while the magnesium is being absorbed. Ancient Minerals is a good trusted brand. I am sure this will do the trick.</li>
            <li> This may be exactly as described, but when mixed with oil there&#x27;s a weird texture.  I&#x27;m going to try this my batch with some essential oils to see if that helps.  Made this into a natural deodorant, but DON&#x27;T use immediately after shaving - it HURTS!  Otherwise, it works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have recently been trying to get as much magnesium topically as possible, and these bath flakes ROCK! I use them at least once a week for eczema/dry skin relief along with some epsom salts. I also use them to make my own magnesium oil for topical use. Great product, I am very pleased &amp; actually just reordered earlier today.</li>
            <li> Bathtime. One of these will create the right amount of magnesium for a good bath. We need magnesium in our bodies, and through the skin is the best way of obtaining it. Taking the supplement orally causes diarrhea. We don&#x27;t tend to get enough magnesium in our diets and it is a critical mineral. (Google it!).  Besides, a magnesium bath before bedtime will SO relax you! If you have pain in your muscles, this will help with that. I highly recommend regular magnesium baths. (Magnesium flakes come in larger sizes, this is like a sample bath!)</li>
            <li> Like it for the price and the amount. I can make different things with it and maybe even use it in my wellness center</li>
            <li> love it I make my own oil</li>
            <li> i could not tell if it made any difference for me, maybe i need to use it for one month or more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using Ancient Minerals every day.  I spot treat specific areas such as elbow, knee and low back as necessary.  At night I spray it on abdomen, legs, and arms.  If definitely notice the relaxant effect.  I feel physically relaxed as well as mentally calm.  I&#x27;ve shared this product with my clients and friends.</li>
            <li> I’m a 27 year old Administrative assistant. So basically I sit at my computer and type ALL day. 3-4 years ago the muscles in my arms, particularly on the right side of my body began to get very tight. It felt as if I had a taut rubber band from my neck to my foot which was restricting my movements and causing me a great deal of discomfort. I did physical therapy for months, got massages, took off work for a few months to see if the break would help, stretched frequently, took hot baths, tried acupuncture, went to a chiropractor... basically I tried everything with minimal results. Last week I received my mineral flakes and immediately dissolved them into distilled water, then sprayed it liberally all over my body. I kid you not, the very next day the discomfort was GREATLY minimized. I could not believe it. No my discomfort has not been fixed 100%, but I would take this Level 2 level of discomfort I feel over the level 8 I was feeling. My body feels more lose, I am slightly more flexible, and my symptoms would always get worse around the time I would PMS; however my achy muscles, headache, and tight muscles have been much more manageable this month, then they were last month.  I love this stuff; I never want to be without it, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I did break out around my chest and back when I first used it. As I said, I applied it liberally all over my body, so maybe my body needed to get used to the oil. Since then the bumps are clearing up, and I’ve only been spraying it on my arms, legs, and stomach, with no ill side effects. So just keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> Used this product to create a magnesium solution - aka magnesium oil.  Amazing response with just 20 sprays per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Improved sleep - WOW - that&#x27;s an understatement. Once menopause hit my sleep deteriorated.  Now am back to sleeping deeply. My old sleep cycle is back - it&#x27;s easy to fall asleep or fall back to asleep.  Dreaming much more. (Or at least more aware of the dreams.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effective bug bite / poison ivy treatment.  Since creating the solution, I had multiple chigger bites and, thanks to my cat, poison ivy exposure to my arms.  Usually very reactive (often require Rx meds to treat).  Thought what the heck and sprayed the bites and open sores.  Very effective at decreasing the itchiness.  Last much longer than ANY poison ivy treatment found at drug stores.  This solution has made a radical difference in how quickly these bites/sores are healing.  Previous attempts to use Espson Salts have never been very effective - probably used to weak of a magnesium solution.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I felt like I absorbed this much, much better than regular Epsom salts. I had a nice, slightly drowsy feeling that I only get if I use twice as much epsom salt. So I guess this is more $, but you need less to see the benefits? Anyway, it works! Most americans are deficient in Magnesium, so this is a great product to have on hand and use.</li>
            <li> Words could never do this little miracle justice. Take the $13.00 plus gamble- trust me, you will be hooked! Make this your at home \\&quot;mini-spa ritual\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It deliver quickly but the bag was torn.  It does not relieves aches and pains and improves mood and relieves stress as describe.  Never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I made up a batch to use as a spray before going to bed at night, and it certainly helps with leg cramps and pain in the ankles.  I&#x27;m sure it would be great to soak in as well, but I just had other uses for it.</li>
            <li> Cannot be without this item. I make my own magnesium oil from it, and it is quite cost-effective. The magnesium oil spray keeps me feeling so much better, and helps me sleep.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make magnesium oil.  It&#x27;s a deceptively large bag and will last a long time in our home.  The product was highly recommended by a blogger I follow and we&#x27;ve been happy with it.</li>
            <li> Really no way to know if this works as claims. Leaves a very metallic smell on skin afterwards. Not very pleased w/ that.</li>
            <li> After a long hard day, this is a product that helps to relax, even if only soaking my feet.  I do recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I use this to make mineral oil. It&#x27;s the purest on the market, so I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say if this truly changed my magnesium levels without a medical test but, it does make for a relaxing soak.</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time.  I have a deep tub that is great for soaking.  It felt great, a little minor stinging sensation but nothing dramatic. After thirty minutes I rinsed off with a warm shower.  As I dried off with a terry cloth towel I noticed dead skin cells wiping away.  Skin felt great afterward.  Having read about the benefits of transdermal absorption of magnesium I look forward to the benefits of continued use of magnesium flakes combined with the use of magnesium oil.</li>
            <li> I never use the whole bag or even half. I just use about a cup to 2 cups. I always feel rejuvenated after a nice soak, especially after walking 5 miles. After a few uses, my skin is a bit healthier feeling too. I can&#x27;t put my finger on it, but my skin does feel better.</li>
            <li> extra fast delivery and as promised.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what I can say about this wonderful mineral bath product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great in the bath for feet or the whole body and also if ur making magnesium oil these work pretty well for that too.</li>
            <li> This is better than buying Epson Salt.  You can use this to make your own magnesium oil, which works a lot better than Epson Salt.  If you spray it on you and it&#x27;s too itch, try just applying to the tops of your feet a few times a day.  My son has sensory issues and would cry because the magnesium oil would make his body so itchy, but spraying it on the tops of his feet didn&#x27;t bother him at all.  You can also use the magnesium oil that you make to make a really good &amp;#34;calming lotion&amp;#34; for the bottoms of feet.</li>
            <li> I bought these magnesium flakes to make a homemade magnesium cream. I made the cream, and am liking it. Haven&#x27;t taken a bath with the flakes, as I can&#x27;t afford to use them all up at one time! The cream is nice, I just put in on my feet at bedtime and soak up those great minerals all night long.</li>
            <li> I read about this ancient minerals Magnesium Bath flakes on the Mommypatamous blog and was eager to try it out.  The bag is smaller than epson salt bags you can purchase at the grocery store, but my understanding is that this is a different kind of magnesium.  I made the water/magnesium combination making an oil and have been using for a few months - a little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rub it on my arms and wrist (which have been sore) and it makes the pain go away in about twenty minutes.  I was shocked!  it really worked for me.  I&#x27;m not sure it will work for everyone, but it works for me, which I&#x27;m very happy about.  So I rub it on every day now and have no wrist pain.  I can tell if I miss a few days, the pain comes back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stings a little bit when you first put it on - not a painful sting, but you can feel it tingle kind of sharply.  For the most part it soaks in to your skin, but I have had a few times where I could see a film when it dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on acne.  Ouch, it hurts when you first apply it, kind of like hydrogen peroxide on a wound.  I&#x27;m not sure it it cleared up my skin any faster than without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom is now using as well.  I do like this product very much and will continue to order it.  I have yet to use up my first bag though.</li>
            <li> Mix half and half with water for a spritz to use on muscle cramps and aches. Good on my aching neck too.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this natural product. I plan to make Magnesium lotion and oil with it. Thank you very kindly! :)</li>
            <li> Not sure really if this is getting the magnesium into my bloodstream. I believe I may have to try quite a few more to give a better account and the package directions say to use an entire bag for one bath. I couldn&#x27;t really justify that so just know that is the recommendation.</li>
            <li> Perfect so far. Melted down for Magnesium oil. I really like it! Will buy again:) Bag was intact nothing spilled out during shipment.</li>
            <li> A neighbor recommended this product after reading about the benefits of magnesium.  He read Mark Sircus&#x27;s book to add the salts to distilled water over a stove til dissolved and to put in a spray bottle.  It does work.  I have neck arthritis and it feels much better.  My husband had meniscus surgery years ago and his knee gets sore from time to time and this makes it all better.  It works almost instantly.  Love it.</li>
            <li> read so many reviews about this! Turned some of the salts into an oil spray... I feel much more relaxed and calm before bed (sprayed on the bottom of my feet). It&#x27;s only been 3 days but I definitely feel a difference. I also suffer from eczema/skin psoriasis, instant relief! It did tingle a bit but that ended within seconds. I am highly allergic to nickel (razors, fake jewelry etc), I tend to get breakouts after shaving - applying this after my shaves, really puts the breakouts at bay. They aren&#x27;t completely gone, but again its only been 3 days.</li>
            <li> I would use other forms of magnesium therapy or buy epsom salts. This doesn&#x27;t last very long and I didn&#x27;t find it worth the money.</li>
            <li> Makes very relaxing bath and helps a great sleep. Recommended. Expensive product though. I used it for two baths not one as was stated on the package. Other than that, no negatives.</li>
            <li> It is what it is. The bag is about 4 maybe 5 cups of flakes. I just filled 50% in a bottle and the other with hot water in a bowl. Stirred and I have magnesium oil to spray! This whole bag should last me hopefully a year. I spray it on after my workouts 30 min before a shower as I&#x27;m on a keto diet and read that most people need potassium and magnesium due to deficiency in the diet itself. I use Morton Lite Salt for the potassium supplement. Magnesium also helps me sleep and great for sore muscles as I weight lift. 50/50 makes me itch here and there, but I heard your body gets used to it so I figured I&#x27;d just go for maximum strength. You can make it 1/4th or 1/3rd ratio and add more water to have less skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Read on a holistic website about using a hot washcloth soaked in either water and Epsom salt or Magnesium flakes to pull infection out of a wound. [...] Also, another site recommended drinking a weak solution of the Magnesium flakes and water every 6 hours as well. Used both the wash cloth soak and drink (tasted horrible!) when I had a blister on my toe that had become infected and had also developed a red line running up my leg. Stopped traveling up after I applied the washcloth and then took about 7 hours for the line to recede and then disappear completely. So glad I had this on hand! I am going to make some magnesium lotion with it as well for daily use.</li>
            <li> my research kept saying this was the best brand. Using it to make mag oil.&lt;br /&gt;seems like its working. like it.</li>
            <li> i feel noticeably less stressed after i use these.</li>
            <li> This product makes a wonderful magnesium oil which I use as a deodorant.  I also spray it on my body at night to have a peaceful and relaxing sleep.</li>
            <li> I use this for Mag-a-hol. works great.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this, my only complaint is that the bag isn&#x27;t large enough for detoxing soaks. It calls for the entire bag. At that rate, this is too expensive and If you&#x27;re looking for detox material, I would recommend Epsom salts b/c they&#x27;re cheaper. All of that being said, I am planning on using some of this for a body cream :-)</li>
            <li> I have used these flakes to make a magnesium lotion. I have not used it as a soak as of yet. For the lotion, I used a half cup of flakes and added about 3 tbsps of boiling water to it. This dissolved the flakes into an oil. I added the oil to a store-bought lotion and I use it nightly on my feet to promote magnesium absorption. I find that I am sleeping better and feeling better in general. I still have plenty of flakes left over for more uses and I thought it was a great buy.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using the Magnesium bath flakes in a foot scrub I retrieved from a popular mama website. His and my dry cracked heels have been getting much better and its really soft on the skin. I will be using it in my bath pretty soon.</li>
            <li> I use it to make magnesium lotion and magnesium oil. First I was skeptical about how well it might work to help me sleep, but oh boy.. Just rub a little bit of the lotion on my feet before bed and cover with socks, and i fall asleep in no time.  I used to be a light sleeper, I can be wake up by very small noise, but not anymore after I start to use the lotion daily before bed time.  It works better than valerian root tea imo. Give it a try, lotion and oil recipes are easily found if you just google it.</li>
            <li> Great salts. So relaxing.</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 weeks ago for my husband, who is in his 60s and is suffering from fibromyalgia. I have been dumping the entire bag in his bath every day and this is the ONE thing (not his prescription meds) that finally has gotten his muscles to loosen. For the first time in years he can enjoy an entire day without muscle pain. He used to wake up in the morning so stiff it was heartbreaking to watch. Now (after 2 weeks of daily magnesium baths) he is waking up pain free. YAY!</li>
            <li> I dissolved some in hot water and mixed it into coconut oil and bee&#x27;s wax to make a lotion that I put on my calves before going to sleep at night.  Put an end to my middle-of-the-night leg cramps!</li>
            <li> this is ok. Its not the results I was hoping but works ok</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s good stuff, I use it to make magnesium oil. Keeps me nice and un...anxious. And stuff. Yeah it&#x27;s A+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only one man but you don&#x27;t need to me skeptical.</li>
            <li> We used these flakes to make our own magnesium oil. Just add 1 cup of water and 1 cup of flakes, boil, and let cool. Voila! It&#x27;s not *quite* as high-quality as the magnesium oil you buy at stores, but it&#x27;s still a fantastic source of magnesium and vastly cheaper. This bag contains enough flakes for quite a few cups of oil.</li>
            <li> I used this product a few times this winter when i was training for my latest Boston Marathon. I would add a handful to my hot bath after my long runs. It did help to east the muscle soreness.  You do not need to use the whole bag as it says on the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Wodke&lt;br /&gt;Author: Running for My Life- Winning for CMT</li>
            <li> I used this to make my own mag spray. The ancient minerals brand works a million times better to keep my muscles not so tight. No more pain! Love it.</li>
            <li> I just would like to say if you read the directions form this product and mix it with water it will help with the ache and pains, I have had this product for two weeks now ,been having joint pain in my finger for a year or so  I started spraying mixed magnesium on it twice a day and rubbing it in  ive had more relief from it than my doctor&#x27;s prescription go figure Hu! I also take one 250 mg magnesium pill  twice a day morn and eve for the sleep and pain a blessing I am a heart patient also. God Bless</li>
            <li> I made magnesium oil out of these flakes and they seem very high quality. Sleep has improved since I&#x27;ve been using the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; (distilled water+flakes). I love getting the benefits of magnesium transdermal versus taking another supplement. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Bought to make lotions and salves with magnesium. I was impressed with the quality of the product immediately over what we can buy in the stores locally here.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and I am very happy with the minerals, they work great in a soak or I make my own magnesium oil spray out of it as well.</li>
            <li> Like the packaging.  I bought it to make mineral oil with and its super easy. Has good reviews from my research.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and packaging</li>
            <li> I plan to use it in making a lotion. Ancient minerals seem to be a good clean product, I&#x27;ve used their magnesium oil for several years and feel these flakes will make a good healthy magnesium lotion.</li>
            <li> This is great for a foot soak &amp; not too bad for shipping time. I like how you can make magnesium oil from it as well.</li>
            <li> This powdered/flake form is easy to use in a convenient, strong plastic package. I use it to create magnesium oil, which helps with joint pain and sleep. It could also be added to a bath. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Love this product, great service, great price. I will always buy this for my business and personal needs. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Used this to make magnesium oil spray, but found company disclaimer that this product is not recommended for that purpose as the magnesium is heated to crystallize into flakes. I, personally, cannot attest to any perceived difference from the Ancient Minerals oil spray and continue to use both--reasoning that I might possibly compromise my success by using this one alone. This product is labeled for SINGLE USE in tub of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With both products I experience mild burning for a few minutes after application. FYI - Magnesium oil is not really an oil and will not stay slippery on skin. It feels lightly &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; on the hands after application, but rinses with just water. It has not stained any fabrics in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also using Epsom salt lotion (magnesium sulfate) and oral supplements in magnesium taurate and citrate forms so I will not speak to perceived benefits from this product, specifically, but rather to magnesium supplementation in general. Please refer to Dr. Carolyn Dean&#x27;s The Magnesium Miracle or her website for &amp;#34;outside the box&amp;#34; info on supplementation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have experienced two years of debilitating radicular spasm pain (similar to sciatic pain) which did not respond to numerous Rx trials, prolotherapy, accupuncture, epidural injections, facet injections, a radiofrequency nerve ablation. Chiropractic adjustments, laser therapy &amp; massage flared the spasm pain, but I required chiropractic to keep moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have chronic pain from other medical conditions, but have avoided acute spasm for 3 months by increasing my magnesium supplementation 3-4x and cutting back on calcium. I recommend you experiment with different forms of magnesium to avoid loose stools. The Ancient Minerals products are good sources to that end! :)</li>
            <li> I use this as a foot soak and as a MAG (Brine spray) spray as a daily med and it is truly an excellent quality product and an excellent buy.I highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> Got this to make Wellness Mama&#x27;s magnesium oil and also her sea spray.  Easy to make.  Very happy with this purchase and would buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Have ordered more than once and will continue to order.  Use for magnesium lotion and baths.</li>
            <li> Used them to make mineral oil, and the mineral oil burned and dried out my skin</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. Easy peasy to make magnesium oil. Just boil some distilled water for a minute, let it set for a bit, add an equal amount of the flakes, let dissolve ... and there you have it ... now you have some fantastic &#x27;magnesium oil&#x27;. And very cost effective.</li>
            <li> Used in body butter and lotions and it is perfect! Put in deoderant tube and it works perfect!!! Love the product!</li>
            <li> Just the product I need and at such great savings over the health food stores</li>
            <li> I got these as a way to get magnesium through my skin without having to spray it on.  When I got the bag I flipped it over to read the directions on amount and was shocked at what it said.  It stated to dump the entire bag into one bath!  At 12.50 a bag there is no way I am doing that.  I rechecked the instructions given on the description here and saw that while the title did say single use pouch the instruction said 1-3 cups.  I put one cup in my bath and relaxed.  I ended up sleeping soundly that night and did not have to deal with burning or itching that the magnesium oil caused me.  I will continue to use this and hope to continue to reap the benefits while only using a cup or so.  The suggestion that you use a whole bag is why I refuse to give it 5 stars. I hope they change their packaging to reflect other dosage options because no way is 12.50 a bath going to happen.</li>
            <li> Great price for this bag of flakes. The seller even tossed in a sample spray bottle of liquid Magnesium. What a nice touch! I mix mine with half water and half flakes and use the included bottle to spray this on my skin. It lasts forever this way. Nice product, excellent value!</li>
            <li> My husband and I have recently been using these flakes to make magnesium oil. He sprays the oil directly on his skin, whereas I used the oil to make a body butter/lotion that also included shea butter, avocado oil, beeswax, and lavender/tea tree oil. We can&#x27;t wait to see what the long term benefits are to using magnesium oil! So far so good!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for not only detoxing but helping with skin irritations. Really helps with having a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> I dissolve equal parts of the magnesium flakes with water and spray topically. It stings my pits, but within a week my sweat was orderless! Next time however, I&#x27;ll get the oil. It&#x27;s more powerful, I don&#x27;t have to mix and I won&#x27;t have to worry about dripping water drying (being absorbed) into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Note: When dissolved in water, the solution is slightly oily. I have no problem with this, it&#x27;s a consideration.</li>
            <li> I use these flakes to make magnesium oil that I can spray on my skin as a supplement.  Very effective, I sleep like a baby and have less muscle pain when I use this.  I highly recommend making up a batch and spraying on generously before bed.</li>
            <li> I really like the energy it gives me!  Was it supposed to do that?  Also, I feel more focused during the day and therefore get more done.  I can&#x27;t say it makes me sleep better....still only getting 6 hours a night or less but maybe that&#x27;s because I apply it first thing in the morning.  I rub my belly with the spray liquid.</li>
            <li> Taking a bath with these magnesium flakes is very relaxing.  I&#x27;m going to make magnesium oil with them so they last longer.  A wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Great product! I look forward to buying more soon!</li>
            <li> I have a condition called RSD and my doctor recommended magnesium oil. I purchased the oil and it made me break out and SO itchy. So I tried this bath. I didn&#x27;t realize this was a single use. $11+ for one bath seems a bit crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it didn&#x27;t seem to help at all. I am glad it didn&#x27;t make me break out but I took a shower right after the bath since I detest taking baths. I feel like I&#x27;m sitting in my own dead skin cells. Gross. I don&#x27;t feel it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I made Magnesium butter with this after reading some valuable info on Magnesium deficiency. I gave some away as Christmas gifts &amp; they&#x27;re asking for more. My 28 year old niece has suffered for years with PMS, swollen painful breasts, &amp; cramps. This butter ended it all for her. She&#x27;s very grateful &amp; asking for more!</li>
            <li> I love this magnesium for making a spray and a body butter that contain the mineral of which most people are depleted.  Got to get used to the feeling it leaves on skin, but worth it to know that I&#x27;m supporting my health in this way.</li>
            <li> so the first time I made Mg oil and sprayed my skin was very itchy. Now it is alright and I do sleep better. :)</li>
            <li> Dissolves easily. Using for a supplement,  not a bath. No scent. Will last forever! Got our recipe from Food Renegade.</li>
            <li> I did not use this product as a bath soak, as directed. Instead I used it to create a liquid magnesium supplement that I apply to my body to absorb transdermally. It dissolved well in water, and as far as I can tell, I am receiving the benefits I expected.</li>
            <li> doing the job but too soon to comment on effectiveness</li>
            <li> I make my own magnesium oil by mixing 40 % of magnesium flakes and 60% of warm water in a glass jar. I apply it all over my skin, even on my face,  apply pure shea butter by perfect body harmony after wiping off the wetness after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;try it, it might sting a little when you start using it, but once your skin is healed from the dryness by the magnesium, the magnesium solution is actually very easy to apply and comfortable on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;besides skin getting tighter, hair getting shinier, the &#x27;side effect&#x27; I have noticed is that MY ANKLE PAIN IS GONE!!</li>
            <li> I put it in the bath, made spray-on oil.  I should be leaping tall buildings soon.</li>
            <li> Used these in my bath and really felt great, like going to a spa! I&#x27;m also planning on using some to make a cream for my daughter. Haven&#x27;t done it yet but I can&#x27;t wait to try!</li>
            <li> I use it for making magnesium oil that I apply after bath.  Works as it should.  Dilutes well, did not notice any residue after diluting.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to work  with. I made magnesium spray in glass bottles to use as as deodorant. It&#x27;s great and helps add a great mineral to my system, which I need.. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use 1/4 cup of this dissolved foot bath with enough water just to cover my toes nightly. This is the first time I was not nauseated during a pregnancy.</li>
            <li> bought it for a friend - she is happy w/it.</li>
            <li> arrived on time. Good product i use it to make magnesium oil. I work out a lot and spray it before bed and after workout to get the magnesium into the body.</li>
            <li> I use this magnesium flakes for a bath, or a footbath, to get more magnesium in my body. I also use it in pill form, and&lt;br /&gt;the magnesium oil, every day. Since starting to use magnesium more, my blood pressure  great. So I keep it up.</li>
            <li> I use these with clary sage or lavender oils in my bath. I have severe nerve damage and pain can get unbearable at times. After soaking in this for an hour, I get out and am ready for a great night of sleep. We get 10 bags at a time. Better than oral meds</li>
            <li> Great price and worked perfectly for making my own Magnesium oil at home! Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li> I used these flakes to make magnesium oil, and my painful leg cramps went away. Will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> Love this product and wish it was more affordable.  I use it after practicing martial arts - it&#x27;s relaxing and non-scented.</li>
            <li> This is great - I use it for daily foot soaks for my children and I.  I plan on getting the ready-made oil from this company as well.  If you haven&#x27;t read about our essential need for magnesium, I suggest you start researching!!!</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy this as a bath/foot soak, it&#x27;s extremely overpriced for that... Please please don&#x27;t waste your money on a fancy $12 bath, they&#x27;re trying to scam you... Epsom salt will do the same job, bought at your local drugstore for a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is for making magnesium oil. 1/2 cup mag flakes in 1/2 cup boiling distilled water, boil until dissolved, cool down, put into clean spray bottle. Done. Yo I don&#x27;t care what the company says! They tell you this product can&#x27;t be used for making DIY magnesium oil because they want to sell you their own bottle of very expensive magnesium oil that is exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil really works as a magnesium supplement. I wouldn&#x27;t count on it to get your 100% RDA, but if you put it over a large amount of your body you will definitely feel a mental &amp; physical calming effect. Great to do before bed, if you don&#x27;t mind the slippery feeling on the skin-- if you do just put it on 30 minutes before a shower. It also really helps when your muscles are tensed up. When your muscles get tense it&#x27;s likely an acute deficiency of magnesium, potassium, or both. So rub it on your calves and eat a banana.</li>
            <li> The magnesium did give me energy and feel better however the bath soak itself did not fair well with me for other problems.  All I can say is make sure you know the side effects of the bath.  We are going to try the spray bottle with this product as well and hope for better results.</li>
            <li> I use this to make magnesium BODY BUTTER, instead of the magnesium oil. With the body butter you still are increasing your magnesium transdermally, but it stings a lot less. The recipe is found on the wellnessmama website. I have been using it on my kids for about a month.. it stings way less than the oil. They wouldn&#x27;t let me put the oil on them, can&#x27;t help if I can&#x27;t put it on. It will sting the first few times, which i have read means your are deficient, but still way less than the oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recipe calls for these flakes, distilled water, beeswax pastilles, shea butter, and coconut oil. You can feel good about putting all of that on your skin! And it really moisturizes!!!</li>
            <li> I am still in the trial and error process of using these crystals. I have made the magnesium oil but maybe I made it too strong because it stings my skin if there is any broken skin. I believe I have had relief but I haven&#x27;t used it that much yet. I don&#x27;t see much difference between epsom salts and these flakes. I&#x27;m sure it is a good product so I will keep working with it.  Good price on Amazon as usual.</li>
            <li> I used to have dry/itchy legs and this stuff has gotten rid of it.... just don&#x27;t use it right after shaving! I just mixed this with water in a spray bottle, and I keep it next to the tub.</li>
            <li> Great bath soak.  Helps a lot with my fibromyalgia and skin infection.</li>
            <li> I use it for Magnesium oil (just mix one cup of Magnesium flakes with one cup of filtered water). It really helps. I had restless legs syndrome, but after the first use it&#x27;s gone! Also, if my legs are tired after hiking or shopping, I sprinkle Magnesium oil on them and it helps almost immediately. Also, it works as antidepressant. I definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> I even add a little to my aftershave. That way I get magnesium throught the cuts on my face every morning.&lt;br /&gt;What could be better than that.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my own magnesium oil as an alternative to Epsom Salts and paying for magnesium oil at a high price. It&#x27;s super easy to make on your own, and this is a very affordable way to do so.</li>
            <li> Worked great for making homemade magnesium oil spray. Haven&#x27;t used it for a bath yet, but I&#x27;m sure it will work great.</li>
            <li> Wow...I found an article that listed lack of Magnesium symptoms. It&#x27;s like being diagnosed with MS! then I found a recipe for a homemade hand lotion using this stuff, which you use prior to bedtime to help you sleep. WOW....knock me out! I LOVE this stuff and will always have it on hand. (Get it? LOL...ON HAND...Handcream? wink!)</li>
            <li> The Mg flakes were on time and are performing well! I would recommend them to anyone looking for relaxation.&lt;br /&gt;MD</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of these, but you have to put the whole bag in the bath at once according to the instructions</li>
            <li> I use this to make homemade magnesium oil to use as a skin spray, and it&#x27;s awesome. I&#x27;ve been using the same bag for over a year, too, so it lasts pretty well. I definitely noticed a boost in my mood (and, um, &amp;#34;regularity&amp;#34;) after I started consistently using this. Great product!</li>
            <li> I use this incombination with baking soda, and sea salt in baths.  It softens skin and the magnesium is calming.</li>
            <li> Using for magnesium absorption.  Found a recipe to mix with water and spray on feet each night.  I also add a few drops of lavender essential oil to help with sleep.  Much more natural way for the body to absorb magnesium, as the body can decide how much it wants to intake.</li>
            <li> I bought it to make Magnesium oil which I heard is really good to apply on skin when you feel tired or have headache. It absorbs instantly from the skin and seems to work great. You can also use it to add to your bath tub in water and soak in it.</li>
            <li> It was quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I actually prepared the magnesium oil myself. I found the instructions on how to make it as easy as to heat distilled water and mix it with the flakes equal parts let it cool and use a small blue water pump bottle to apply. It has been helping a lot with my muscle pains and with my stress. I will recommend it 100% now most of the members of my family are using it.</li>
            <li> I love this for making my own magnesium oil and adding to baths. Ancient minerals carries high quality products continually.</li>
            <li> Love this in my bath! So relaxing.</li>
            <li> I have been using RO water for decades. RO remove all minerals from the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;flakes&amp;#34; are chunky, but dissolve very quickly in water.  No floaters or sinkers.</li>
            <li> I use this to make Magnesium Oil. It&#x27;s a good quality.</li>
            <li> Magnesium flakes can be used to make \\&quot;magnesium oil\\&quot; much cheaper than you can buy it already in liquid form.  Just add about 1 part magnesium flakes to about 2 to 3 parts filtered water (boiled), let cool and you have \\&quot;magnesium oil\\&quot; that you can put in a spray bottle and treat your skin.  It can be sprayed on and rubbed in to help absorb magnesium into your body, or you can use some flakes in a foot soak, or in a bath if you like.  We rub some \\&quot;oil\\&quot; on our temples or forehead when we have a headache, and it normally solves the problem. There are lots of uses for this product...do some research and you will see.  This is a good price for these magnesium flakes.</li>
            <li> Ancient Minerals Magnesium Bath Flakes Single Use pouch&lt;br /&gt;Good product to soak sore , tired body. Just Pricy compared to some others.</li>
            <li> Great Product and Seller. This really aids in relaxing those sore muscles.</li>
            <li> I made magnesium oil out of the magnesium flakes. Easy to make and a great way get your magnesium. Yes!</li>
            <li> I used this to make magnesium oil.  It is working very well!!  I no longer need to use deoderant.</li>
            <li> Love soaking in the tub with this!  So relaxing</li>
            <li> Excellent  Supplement  For SENIORS to  get sound. Sleep</li>
            <li> I used this to make magnesium lotion to help my headaches. And I&#x27;ll say, it definitely helps!</li>
            <li> I used these to make magnesium oil. They dissolve well and seem to be exactly as advertised. Shipping and packaging was perfect with no issues.</li>
            <li> Doing my own magnesium oil with those flakes.&lt;br /&gt;Sting a little bit but the sensation disappears fast, provide your body with magnesium and easy to apply on skin after a shower.</li>
            <li> I have chronic pain and magnesium chloride has been the only thing that helps me without having to take a pill. Epsom salt does not even come close to working as good as these baths flakes. They also help relax me if I am unable to sleep and all-around great product. Do not use as much as is stated,  I use about half of what they say is needed and it works just fine for me.</li>
            <li> This is a soothing way to calm your restless leg syndrome before heading off to bed. The package says use it all at one time, but a little each night helps.</li>
            <li> I needed to make my own magnesium oil and this works perfectly and and was on time!!! Love these salts!</li>
            <li> I broke my back as a firefighter in 1969. Since then I have developed arthritis throughout my mid and lower spine. Disolving l cup of these pure Magnesium flakes in a cup of boiling water, cool, put in a spray bottle. I find this solution helps my back aches, helps my face complexion, and makes me fee much better.</li>
            <li> Love my magnesium spray, thank you!!</li>
            <li> good product good quallity</li>
            <li> Dissolved easily in warm water, the quality and strength is great. Used to make magnesium lotion for better sleep and relaxation.</li>
            <li> I have used these in baths and to make magnesium spray and lotion. A lot of people believe that most of us are deficient in magnesium, and I have headaches so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I don&#x27;t know if the lotion has helped with that, but it does make a nice lotion, and the baths are great for sore muscles. This is a great alternative to Epsom Salts, so I would recommend for anyone interest in those or who is planning to use these flakes for lotion or spray. They melt quick, also.</li>
            <li> I use this product to create my own magnesium oil. I fill half of my spray bottle up with the flakes, and then fill the rest with water. I use my spray every single day, and this bag has lasted me over a year. I&#x27;ve been incredibly satisfied with the value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been thrilled with the effects on my body. I spray it on sore muscles, and notice relief within 15 minutes. It is an excellent aid for easing into restful sleep (especially when you put a drop of essential oil in the mix!). I give my children massages with the magnesium oil created from the flakes before bed, and it is very relaxing for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magnesium is an important mineral for the body, and one that is difficult to obtain through oral supplementation. Transdermal magnesium application is the way to go - and making your own magnesium oil is the cheapest way to do it!</li>
            <li> I have been noticing that prices are sky rocketing on anything healthy. I used to be able to buy something like this for about $15. The bag literally says.. pour in the whole bag for an eczema soak.. REALLY? An 8lb  $40 SOAK? I have used epsom salts and this.. to be honest I cannot tell a difference. 8 pound bag is not as much as one would think. I was able to put the whole bag in a gallon glass jar. Personally, I think we are getting reamed by these prices and claims. I can remember 20 years ago the box on epsom salt said add 1/4 cup per tub.. now it says 2 cups, why? Same with minerals like these. I can remember when the gallon of bleach said one teaspoon per gallon of water.. now it says a cup... wake up folks. NIGARI is a magnesium chloride additive for tofu.. straight magnesium chloride.. do a google search for NIGARI Solution &amp; save yourself a lot of cash..</li>
            <li> Will use this to make magnesium oil.  Hoping to see results with muscle tensions and help with needed nutrients for joints, skin, etc.  Have not received yet....but using a bought preperation of the same ingredients to start.</li>
            <li> Great if you are making your own magnesium oil. Not as great if you&#x27;re mixing it in the bathtub because you will run out of it quickly. Wouldn&#x27;t be a bad thing if it wasn&#x27;t so pricey.</li>
            <li> After reading some reviews I thought it would be a smaller bag, I was happy when it arrived. It does say empty entire bag into bath but that would be too much IMHO. I use this to make a magnesium body butter/lotion and love it. I put some in my toddlers bath as well and it helps with magnesium absorption. This will last me a while but when I run out I will buy again!</li>
            <li> I used magnesium baths for a few months and found out that after testing my magnesium levels did not change at all.  I made sure the water was at the appropriate temperature.  I put in much more than 1.65lb in the tub.  Strangely, some of my muscle tightness went away and I had some decent nights sleep.  I thought this was due to the magnesium.  So I thought I was doing its job of getting magnesium into my body.  Well I was shocked to find that it did absolutely nothing to my Mag RBC test results.  I was taking mag orally so I actually think it caused my magnesium levels to go down!!  Please get tested before and after using this product to ensure it is doing what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> boiled it down to make magnesium oil, works fine in a spray bottle a lot cheaper to make your own</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my own magnesium oil, and it works great. Not to mention it came with a sample sized bottle of their product. Super great product, and it shipped super fast.</li>
            <li> As described.  They feel good when mixed with water as a spray for arms legs tummy...After a shower, it tingles just as I read.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the timeliness of this order, as well as the fact that a couple of sample bottles of magnesium oil were added to the order.</li>
            <li> I have read so much about the benefits of magnesium and how most people are lacking in magnesium and don&#x27;t even know it!  The best way for your body to absorb magnesium is through the skin, so this product opened up that option to me!  I found a &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; online for how to make your own magnesium oil (it&#x27;s not really an oil, this product is just mixed with water and dissolved) and then we put it into a spray bottle to spray on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any time you have trauma to your body (banged your leg or had a muscle cramp) you can spray this on it for relief.  You can also just use it daily on your forearms to get the magnesium that your body needs.</li>
            <li> A cup of this and a cup of water. Stir occasionally and it all dissolves in about 24 hours. I dont bother with the heat. Transdermal magnesium  (sprayed onto your skin) is the only way to really get enough of this king of minerals. Also a terrific deodorant. Necessary for about 250 bodily functions and virtually everyone is deficient.</li>
            <li> Large flakes however they break down easily in food processor to use in bath bombs.</li>
            <li> great for bathtime relaxation</li>
            <li> Great product with fast shipping</li>
            <li> I made a magnesium spray and started using it a few weeks ago. I feel like I have more energy and am well  rested. I actually woke up before my alarm today. Not crazy about the slight burning feeling on my skin but I guess I could dilute it more. The product seems good, the bag is smaller than I expected but overall, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Felt much better after bath.  Great, Great, Great Product!</li>
            <li> Probably the bang for the buck magnesium flakes you can get.</li>
            <li> Great. Works well for making magnesium spray</li>
            <li> Did what it was intended to do.  Bought it for a specific use. Can be hard to work with this product.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time. Have used it in the bath and as a spray on oil on bottom of feet at night. Has helped my family sleep at night.</li>
            <li> I have found this very useful for helping to alleviate lyme symptoms (sore joints / feet) when used in a foot bath.</li>
            <li> Everything I wanted and shipped timely.</li>
            <li> Nice large flakes. Melted quickly to make magnesium oil spray.</li>
            <li> This magnesium was recommended to me by someone who researched several brands.  I purchased it to make my own magnesium oil to apply to my skin.  I use it daily after the shower.  It tingles, but I don&#x27;t mind it, and makes me feel like its working!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend!</li>
            <li> I discovered these when pregnant with my third child - and they made all the difference in my level of discomfort.  I now swear by them and recommend them to every pregnant mama I can.  Since I&#x27;m fairly scientific and skeptical of products that heal, soothe, etc - I did my own experimenting.  I had been waking up with very sore hips in the morning, my legs would be sore and achy, and I was generally tired and uncomfortable, especially toward the end of pregnancy.  So, I would soak in the bath (not too warm, of course) for about 20-30 minutes, using 1-2 cups of the flakes.  And my aching hips, sore legs, and overall discomfort would lessen or disappear entirely.  (well, my legs and hips didn&#x27;t disappear - just the aching)  After a few days, some of the discomfort would return, so I would soak in the magnesium bath again.  The next morning, no aches.  I did the cycle a few times - and every 3rd or 4th day, the discomfort would return; I&#x27;d soak and they&#x27;d be alleviated.  Ultimately, if I planned to use the flakes in a bath every few days, I managed to keep away most of the discomfort and felt great up until birth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do use them now for the kids too.  Again, only a cup or so in a bath - and they seem calmer and sleep better.</li>
            <li> Love this to make magnesium oil.</li>
            <li> I have used this product only a few times, but notice a positive difference in my sleep and overall rest.</li>
            <li> Item came just as shown and in a timely manner. I&#x27;ve used this to make my own Magnesium oil (with distilled water and dissolving the flakes). I spray this on after a shower. I&#x27;ve also used it to make homemade &amp;#34;beach hair&amp;#34; which I used on my hair after every shower and it works great (you can find different recipes for &amp;#34;beach hair&amp;#34; if you look on Pinterest).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Before buying this product, I tried making my own &amp;#34;magnesium oil&amp;#34; out of epsom salts, to relieve my chronic pain, and was not very happy with the results.  I hoped this stuff would be better, and it absolutely is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regular  epsom salts, the pain relief is marginal, and when I put it in a spray bottle, the nozzle gets clogged within a few days, and the solution gets contaminated by bacteria.  None of this is an issue with these flakes.  I&#x27;ve got a spray bottle that I filled months ago, and it is as clear and effective as when I first made it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix equal parts of water and flakes in a small sauce pan, and heat until dissolved.  No need to boil.  I&#x27;ve got a few bottles around the house, wherever I might hang out and need some pain relief.  One bottle stays in the bathroom so I can spritz myself a few minutes before my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might find you prefer to rinse it off after it&#x27;s soaked in for a while.  It won&#x27;t evaporate as fast as plain water, and the mineral will leave an odd powdery feel, especially if you try to put lotion on before or after it.  But it seems to be effective if I rinse after a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain relief is quite noticeable, especially in my feet and hands, and the spray bottles make the bag go a very long way.  I&#x27;m quite happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this to make a magnesium and water spray to use in addition to taking an oral magnesium supplement.  Mix 1/2 cup of the flakes with 1/2 cup of boiled distilled water.  Let cool and put in a spray bottle.  I spray it four times on my legs, arms, and stomach once a day.  I got the recipe from wellnessmama.com, just Google wellnessmama + magnesium and you will find more detailed information on her website.  A little bit goes a long way and it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I wished the bag was bigger for the price so you could get more.The flakes dissolve easily in water, best thing to do is footbath</li>
            <li> Used to make magnesium oil.  Works well.</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference in my kid with ADD after a bath in this salts.  It is like he just melts.  Makes him very calm and happy.  Just wish it did not cost so much or I would never be without.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Good to add to bath or make mag oil with. A little bit actually goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Use this to make my deordant and use it in my baths makes me feel wonderful</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about this.  I have not noticed a difference in what I use it for (magnesium deficiency), but this product itself is just fine</li>
            <li> Received quickly. Use this as a body spray mixed with water. Love it.</li>
            <li> Impressed with the flakes instead of salts. I have used the old&lt;br /&gt;Epsom Salts in the past and this is a better way to soak and get the&lt;br /&gt;benefits of Magnesium.</li>
            <li> Helps relaxes me ,do it after my dry brushing &amp; bath ,also at night ,helps keep my body in balance...I make it into magnesium oil ,in a spray bottle...works well.</li>
            <li> Felt like jelly after a warm relaxing bath.  You will not be disappointed.  I just wish the manufacturer offered a big bag at a moe affordable price.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and relaxing bath, but a big bag like this seemed a bit much for just one bath when I only use 2 cups of Epsom Salts in a bath, so I only used half the bag and it seemed to be fine. I&#x27;m using this to see if it will help my trigeminal neuralgia pain, as part of my problem could be associated with low magnesium in my body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this to make organic lotion.  It comes in a good sized bag that was larger than I anticipated.  Using these flakes for the lotion is great.  They are small and easy to scoop.  Resealable bag keeps it fresh.</li>
            <li> I wanted these to make magnesium body butter with Shea butter, coconut oil and Beeswax pastilles.&lt;br /&gt;I got the recipe from WellnessMama blog.</li>
            <li> Just google &#x27;homemade magnesium oil&#x27; and you can find the proportions to use these flakes to make your own!  We use it after every bath or shower and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use this as per its instructions, which recommends using the whole bag in 1 bath.  ARE YOU NUTS!  That is one expensive soak....</li>
            <li> After reading up on magnesium deficiency I learned the best way to supplement was thru the skin. So I decided to try the salts to make magnesium oil. We&#x27;ll before I could make the oil I took a bath in it to help with muscle soreness after working out. Well it took a lot of the tension out of my body and made the pain bearable. I&#x27;ve never felt this using Epsom salts. I recently learned they are to different forms of magnesium. I find that it helps to use after a workout to help promote a more restful sleep. There a great many benefits to this product.</li>
            <li> very relaxing fast shipping</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff. I use just a fourth of a cup of this mixed with a cup of water in a spray bottle for my hair, my skin , minor cuts and scratches. It makes your skin so soft with coconut oil on top of it. It is a great hair tamer for the slicked back look too. For big cuts and scratches it BURNS bad but heals so much quicker with this sprayed on it dailyl.</li>
            <li> The quality was great and the bag is re-sealable to you can use just as much as you want and save the rest.</li>
            <li> I work hard. One bag of these salts in the tub and it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m in a Rocky Mountain Hot Spring. They relax muscles like a $60 massage.</li>
            <li> I never thought that such a product will make me sleep like a baby! I had years that I never slept right away. I am the type of person that rolls on the bed like a hundred times before I sleep. I have used the product for a week and the last couple of days I finally have a deep relaxing sleep. RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
            <li> Use minerals almost every day. I have magnesium deficiency, like most of us. Has unpleasant taste, so you have to mix it in some ice tea or coffee, or anything you want. I cannot use more than 10 drops, becomes too strong for me. I add to my drink and cannot taste it. I even put it in my son&#x27;s yogurts when he is not looking, he never complained about the taste.</li>
            <li> Made a relaxing bath. I&#x27;m just not sure if I would get it again due to price.</li>
            <li> A little more expensive than the other brands out there. No difference in the flakes.</li>
            <li> Purchased this because I read it was good to mix with water and use as a spray (applied to skin) for headaches. My son suffers with them daily. Unfortunately, it has not worked for him. I did not like that it left his skin rubbery feeling but if it would have worked for his headaches it would have been a plus. Maybe he needs to use it for a longer period of time to see results.</li>
            <li> This is a great product I use it to make my own magnesium spray out of it. Delivery was fast as always with Amazon. Will reorder when empty.</li>
            <li> A trusted source told me about this product. I make magnesium oil with it and have found it to very effective. I would recommend it to anyone looking for high-quality sourced magnesium.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and wonderful product. Made magnesium oil from this and an spraying on feet before bedtime and on achey joints, etc. and it is helping. Very calming to the nervous system also.  Love this and will order again. Will share this info. with family and friends.</li>
            <li> I used it to make lotion. It worked great. I will be ordering more as My brother suffer headaches and this helps.</li>
            <li> This has been a very cost-effective replacement for several other forms of magnesium tablets and capsules for me, positive results are just as noticeable.  Boil the MgCl in water for a safe saline solution, add it to drinks; a few drops really mellows out coffee.  You will find other ways to add this to your diet I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> I read Dr. Sircus&#x27;s work and was very impressed.  This and his gel help to relieve painful areas along with detoxing.</li>
            <li> Great product, nice resealable packaging. The flakes dissolve quickly. I would recommend this product to a friend, however I would say there is more than a single use in the package, which is good.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that has helped me in my journey towards being healthier and try to get rid of as much stress and possible, it has also helped me with migraine headaches. They shipped it very quickly, I had my product days before I thought I would</li>
            <li> Great stuff, used it to make magnesium oil and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> this is a great product. i use it to make my own magnesium oil. very cost effective and it works.  i will order this again.</li>
            <li> WORKS FOR NAUSEA DURING PREGNANCY!!!</li>
            <li> Happy with product - make your own spray solution and save big bucks.</li>
            <li> I make my own Magnesium oil and the Ancient Minerals Magnesium Bath Flakes fits the bill.  Just add equal amounts water and let it combine and you have a spray of magnesium to apply to the body.  It really helps me feel better (happier) when I do this. The pills don&#x27;t give me the same up.&lt;br /&gt;Try it or buy some ready made magnesium oil and see if you like it. After you see it is just flakes and water get this and make your own.</li>
            <li> I was going to purchase an 8 oz spray bottle of magnesium oil for the SAME price as this whole bag at Whole Foods, but I decided to look into making my own with these flakes. Super easy and it&#x27;ll be the equivalent to perhaps 4 bottles. Best part - I can control the concentration level.</li>
            <li> It makes my bath feel silky smooth while I&#x27;m absorbing magnesium thru my skin. Would def purchase again and again</li>
            <li> Great item. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I wasn&#x27;t sure how this would work but its amazing.  I put it on the back of my legs and it absorbs pretty quickly.  I have physically felt really good since using this product.  I would recommend everyone try this product.  Many health benefits.</li>
            <li> I mix this with equal amounts of water, heat to desolve, put in spray bottle and use on my body for pain. Works well.</li>
            <li> Seems like good quality and I think it helps me sleep better when I use it. I bought it to make magnesium oil and it worked!</li>
            <li> Love the magnesium bath!  Happy to have found Ancient Minerals. They have many fine products.</li>
            <li> Use them for detox baths and magnesium spray</li>
            <li> A bit silly that this is considered &amp;#34;single use.&amp;#34; I use it to make a magnesium spray (mix about 1 part flakes with 2 parts warm water until they dissolve and pour into a spray bottle) which is supposed to be absorbed through your skin. It works well and lasting (much longer than if I dumped the whole thing into the tub to soak for a bit and then drain!) It works pretty well as deodorant too (spray under arms), though for hotter, sweatier days I also use a natural stick along with the mag. spray.</li>
            <li> Very glad I bought this product. It has many uses.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to make a magnesium oil, my levels have been low during pregnancy. When I spray this on my skin shortly after it burned and I was itchy all over! I can no longer use this product as an oil due to drying out my skin as well as the burning and itching.</li>
            <li> Bought this to make bath soaks. Awesome product. Great in the bath.</li>
            <li> I am looking at buying this but why is it so expensive here?  You can buy the exact same size on the companies site for half the price.  Makes no sense why it&#x27;s so inflated on here.  Also my rating is neutral since I have yet to try it.</li>
            <li> Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> I made magnesium oil out of these flakes and I&#x27;m loving it so far.    PROS  - I had a vein in the middle of my forehead running from my hairline to one of my eyebrows. Within 3 or 4 days spraying on magnesium oil, it&#x27;s gone. At first, I thought it was due to my lost of baby fat on the forehead and thus I have to gain weight for it to go away, but nope. I know magnesium is beneficial to your body in many ways but I didn&#x27;t expect it can make that vein go away too.  - Also, my armpits do not stink anymore after a week of spraying. I still sweat when it&#x27;s hot but there&#x27;s no smell at all. This is really amazing because I don&#x27;t like using aluminum-based deodorant and many natural deodorants out there are either messy or don&#x27;t work.  - It also relieves the pain on my feet when I spray the oil directly on them when they get sore and cramps.  - Part of the vitamin D deficiency epidemic is an underlying magnesium deficiency. all the enzymes metabolizing vitamin D require magnesium as a necessary co-factor. When you take high doses of Vitamin D and if you are already low in magnesium, the increased amount of metabolic work drains magnesium from its muscle storage sites. So this stuff helps me processes the vitamin D I need.    CONS  - The magnesium oil itself is super oily and drying. My feet and hands always get so dry after spraying on this stuff and it can feel quite uncomfortable. I usually just put on lotion afterward.  - It can sting your skin within the first 20 minutes of spraying</li>
            <li> Great transaction and I am pleased with product</li>
            <li> I was suprised to find that the amount in the bag is listed as only enough for one bath! That&#x27;s a pretty pricey soak! I&#x27;ll be using it to make my own essential oil spray, so it will last me... For tub baths though it&#x27;s crazy!</li>
            <li> Great for making magoil, and getting your daily magnesium. I really love this product and highly recommend it. Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I have severe neuralgia in my leg and foot. I used to buy a lot of holistic products. After spending a ton of money with little results, I stopped. Then my daughter found &amp;#34;Transdermal Magnesium Therapy: A New Modality for the Maintenance of Health&amp;#34; by Mark Sircus online. It describes how relevant magnesium is in the body,  and explains how to use the Magnesium flakes.  It even tells how to make your own Magnesium oil from the flakes.  I did that once and it worked.  I first tried the Ancient Minerals Magnesium Bath Flakes in a foot soak. After just a one foot soak, I could feel immediate lessening of my neuralgia pain. Later I saw this version of the product in cream form, I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the flakes, the magnesium oil, and the lotion. They all work, but I like the lotion version best of all. Although it still feels a bit &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; on the skin - it is not as messy as the oil. On nights when I&#x27;m having a lot of pain, I&#x27;ll rub in on from my hip to my feet, and it really does help. This is one product that actually works. I also keep the flakes on hand and do a foot soak if I&#x27;m having very bad pain.  We absorb so much through the bottom of our feet.  The first time I used the foot soak, I couldn&#x27;t believe that after just 20 mins my pain went away.  I was finally able to sleep at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way - I am not a doctor or medical personnel. I&#x27;m not associated with this product or Dr. Sircus at all. I don&#x27;t know him, and don&#x27;t even know where he is located. I&#x27;m a real person with a neurological condition. I go to a pain management doctor and physical therapy to help control my pain, but these soaks and cream works as well as anything they can do for me. I don&#x27;t know about the ingredients in the cream, or anything technical or medical about the products - but you are welcome to email me if you have questions  and I&#x27;ll answer as best I can from my own experience.</li>
            <li> I  am very satisfied with the magnesium.  It is a great product.  The magnesium arrived very quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li> The flakes were perfect for making my Magnesium oil! I also love that the bag is resealable, seeing as how I didn&#x27;t use the whole bag at once!</li>
            <li> I bought this to make magnesium oil at home, and it works well. It is the type of magnesium which is better absorbed into your skin and is best sprayed on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make the \\&quot;oil\\&quot; I take a quart jar and pour as much of this bag of flakes into it that it will take - you&#x27;ll eventually get all the flakes into the jar, but you have to add a little water to get the flakes to break down first. If you can&#x27;t get the flake volume down enough to get all the flakes in, put a lid on your jar, and shake it up a little. After all the flakes are in the jar, top it off with water, and periodically shake it up until completely dissolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to spray it onto your skin, you&#x27;ll need a spray bottle that can handle a higher viscosity liquid. I reuse a Crystal Deodorant for my spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I used this product to make magnesium oil and then convert it into a magnesium lotion and it works great!</li>
            <li> I made &amp;#34;magnesium oil&amp;#34; from it to apply transdermally as a good source of daily mg. I compete in obstacle course races and  noticed after my latest race that my muscles recovered much more quickly than in previous events before I started using this.</li>
            <li> Too expensive!  One entire bag for one bath?!  I tried it for calming anxiety and saw no anxiety-reducing effect from just one use.  It is too expensive to use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product for making your own Magnesium oil spray or for soaking in the bath. I found amazon to have the most reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really hoping this helps with the twitchy legs and insomnia.  Loved the samples, too.  Thanks!  I can test out the oil idea before diving into the making of my own.</li>
            <li> I use this as a magnesium supplement, rather than for a soak in the tub.  I mix equal parts of the flakes with water in a spray bottle and spray it all over my body each morning (as recommended on the Stop the Thyroid Madness website).  It has worked well for me, except in the winter months when it is cold.  Using it in this way, this small bag will end up lasting at least a year, making it an inexpensive option.</li>
            <li> I like to soak my feet in this</li>
            <li> My doctor told me magnesium is important to health.  I use this for long foot soaks and I want to relax and give myself a pedicure at home.  I sprinkle some essential oils in the water to add to the experience.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, hope to see results on my next Bone scan!</li>
            <li> I do not feel that one needs to use a whole package to benefit from the product. It is to high priced for such nonsense! To bad they post such a statement, but I do like the stuff and use it as a mist spray with distilled water. Great and fast service</li>
            <li> Got this because some people were raving about the health benefits. It is sticky, oily feeling on the skin. Not sure if I have seen any benefits yet but it won &#x27;t harm.</li>
            <li> Great quality.  I used this to make my homemade magnesium oil spray.  This was a high end brand so you know you are getting the good stuff and not some inferior product.</li>
            <li> Made my own magnesium topical cream!</li>
            <li> I took a previous Reviewer&#x27;s advice and made my own Magnesium Oil by boiling a cup of water and then adding a cup of the flakes. Let it dissolve and cool and then pour into a spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been buying Barbara Handel&#x27;s premixed Mag Oil for the last year and I can tell you that hands-down this is formula (Ancient Mineerals) is 10x more effective as a Deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a shower I spray it generously under my arms and allow it to penetrate (20 mins) and then I rinse it off and use my usual Mag deodorant. Yes it will BURN like hell..YES it may itch like crazy..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you&#x27;re like me and have tried EVERY deodorant under the sun (inclduing the dreaded Certain Dri) then you will withstand the pain like a true Champ!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday I used the AM spray AS my deodorant (by itself)  and was funk-free for about 12 hours. (Note I didn&#x27;t rinse it off). GREAT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also started spraying the AM all over my body and soles of feet especially before bed time. Ahh..feels nice and relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;EFFECTIVE FUNK ELIMINATOR</li>
            <li> I make my own magnesium spray!</li>
            <li> How glad i am that i bought it thanks to all reviews. We tried it for foot soak, dissolving approx 1 cup in a rather tall plastic japanese foot bath. It really works. It worked for me and for my husband. We started from 15 min soak in very warm, not hot water. The feet felt warmer and more alive instantly and all the next day, and the quality of sleep after feet soak was way better. What a nice and healthy treatment!&lt;br /&gt;I already ordered 2 more packages :)</li>
            <li> I really like these magnesium bath flakes.  I will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping - as described. Love this stuff - Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love the product! I can tell I difference in my sleep and overall relaxation</li>
            <li> Nice product!  I ordered this to make my own magnesium spray &amp; it&#x27;s worked nicely.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  I use this to make magnesium oil.</li>
            <li> I made magnesium oil with this product.  It worked just as it was supposed to.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> It worked wonders. I am very happy I got it</li>
            <li> We made a spray using these bath flakes and water for getting magnesium through the skin. The spray is really easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t have any scent. I&#x27;ve found that a couple of spritzes will make me very itchy, especially just starting out. I would recommend starting off using only a little, and working your way up to more as it seems to lessen the itchiness as you go. I have noticed that it helps with relaxation and regularity. I haven&#x27;t tried them in a bath, but it would dissolve very easily. One last thing, don&#x27;t taste it because it has an awful soapy bitter taste that&#x27;s hard to rinse out. Not that I tasted it or anything...</li>
            <li> you can make your own magnesium supplement, here is how:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution to be used is a 2.5% Magnesium Chloride&lt;br /&gt;hexahydrate (MgCl2.6H2O) solution (i.e.: 25 grams/liter of DISTILLED OR DOUBLE DISTILLED water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who have kidney problems should be carefully monitored&lt;br /&gt;by their family physician, according to the Center for Disease&lt;br /&gt;Control. Dr. Raul Vergini says, that \\&quot;this is true only for severe renal&lt;br /&gt;insufficiency,\\&quot; where an obvious contraindication may exist; but&lt;br /&gt;this is also true for all minerals, that cannot be easily eliminated by&lt;br /&gt;a seriously impaired kidney. In all other cases, there are no risks. I&lt;br /&gt;never heard or read of any problem. The quantity of elemental&lt;br /&gt;magnesium contained in a 125 cc dose of the 2.5% solution is&lt;br /&gt;around 500 mg. That is not a large dose! Anyway, I think that it is&lt;br /&gt;a good precaution to advise people with renal problems to consult&lt;br /&gt;their physician.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Raul Vergini, M.D. also advises that \\&quot;the problem is that&lt;br /&gt;very probably their physicians and pediatricians don&#x27;t know anything&lt;br /&gt;about this therapy, so how can they give good advice?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Children under 5, he says, nonetheless must consult their pediatrician.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dosages are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adults and children over 5 years old ............ 125cc&lt;br /&gt;4 year old children ........................................ 100cc&lt;br /&gt;3 year old children ........................................ 80cc&lt;br /&gt;1-2 year old children .................................... 60cc&lt;br /&gt;over 6 months old children ........................... 30cc&lt;br /&gt;under 6 months old children ......................... 15cc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These doses must be adminstered by mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For chronic diseases, the standard treatment is one dose&lt;br /&gt;morning and evening for a long period.&lt;br /&gt;In acute diseases the dose is administered every 6 hours (every&lt;br /&gt;3 hours the first two doses if the case is serious); then space every&lt;br /&gt;8 hours and then 12 hours as improvement goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After recovery it&#x27;s better going on with a dose every 12 hours&lt;br /&gt;for some days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a preventive measure, and as a magnesium supplement, one&lt;br /&gt;dose a day can be taken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magnesium Chloride, even if it&#x27;s an inorganic salt, is very well&lt;br /&gt;absorbed and it&#x27;s a very good supplemental magnesium source.</li>
            <li> This is a really excellent quality product based on my research, especially for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for about a week, I can honestly say that I do notice a subtle sense of better overall energy and well being through out the day after I spray twice each on my arms, legs and stomach. Sometimes there is a slight tingling sensation that passes after about 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I boil one half cup of spring and/or distilled water, take it of the burner and immediately add one half cup of flakes, stir until it completely dissolves and then let it cool before pouring into a plastic spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also SEEM to be able to get to sleep easier with a deeper degree of sleep quality....but, I will have to evaluate this a little further.</li>
            <li> Excellant Product !!! Will purchase again !!</li>
