            <li>Well for the price this was good.  </li>
            <li>Unit fits well in frame and provides a good seal through out the night.</li>
            <li>Great product that works well as the replacement for my original mask and at a great price.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase in todays economy you have to save anywhere</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d bought more!</li>
            <li>This is an exact replacement for my mask, and works flawless.</li>
            <li>However, I wish it did fit!!</li>
            <li>Easy to install, good price good quality.</li>
            <li>The gel cushion makes this very comfortable and provides a good seal around my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Iâ€™m completely happy with this cushion, extremely comfortable, no complaints.</li>
            <li>so I purchased my own.</li>
            <li>I was also impressed with the fast shipping and delivery.</li>
            <li>I guess it works ok but not as good as the originals do.</li>
            <li>perfect fit, exactly what I needed when I needed.</li>
            <li>Fit perfectly inside the mark shell and at this price this is a real bargain.</li>
            <li>I guess more exposition is required by the review program.</li>
            <li>You will just pay more in the end.</li>
            <li>This fits the mask perfectly, and is a low priced product.</li>
            <li>I am no longer looking for something better.</li>
            <li>and I need to replace the mask more often than my insurance will pay.  </li>
            <li>I have used this cushion/flap for years and still love it.  </li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased with the replacement cushion for my CPAP mask.</li>
            <li>As described&lt;br /&gt;The requirement for 18 or more words will make me stop doing the reviews.</li>
            <li>Have purchased these many times.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the product itself is fine.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;rebuilds&amp;#34; the mask as good as a new one and at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>It fit fine and came in on time.</li>
            <li>Well it was cheap...</li>
            <li>The fit is important to your spouse since without it</li>
            <li>you will keep her awake with the sound produced from air pressure leaks.</li>
            <li>This looks like it should fit a Phillips mask</li>
            <li>When you are looking at petite zest masks on amazon.com, it tells you that consumer who buy the mask often buy this; however, it doesn&#x27;t fit in the mask, so the &amp;#34;cross-sell&amp;#34; is incorrect.  </li>
            <li>Easy to wash and clean.</li>
            <li>Works and looks just like factory original.</li>
            <li>My original purchase was a medium because I am 6&#x27; and 220 Lbs.</li>
            <li>identical to original</li>
            <li>I received a new, perfectly good item at 1/3 price my insurance company is willing to pay my doctor.  </li>
            <li>I have tried 4 variations to face masks, fabric nose, in nose, gel full face and this nose gel.</li>
            <li>good to have a backup, you dont want to need it in the middle of the night and not have it....</li>
            <li>I have tried several CPAP masks and have found The Comfort gel Blue Nasal Mask to give me the best cushioning.  </li>
            <li>Quality product and an exact fit for my Respironics CPAP.</li>
            <li>Anyways, the small fits perfect, the medium was to large.</li>
            <li>I had to buy a new set of straps &amp; mask so that this cushion would fit, even though mine looked like it would fit.</li>
            <li>Easy to install, lasts a long time, and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I was really leery about ordering this because I figured it would be a cheap knock-off.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable and the price is very affordable.  </li>
            <li>was the right shape for my mask online and couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>price is right.</li>
            <li>The clear part seals better than the first one.  </li>
            <li>They fit nicely and cost a lot less than when I use my insurance.</li>
            <li>Been using this mask for years, and this replacement part was as good but half</li>
            <li>This cushion was not nearly as thick as the original one that came with my unit.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>Solid fit and is just like the original.</li>
            <li>This fit my current face mask well and will order it again, great price, and probably less than I pay from my insurance.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I needed for my CPAP machine.</li>
            <li>exact replacement for what have been using</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no problem at all with them and the price certainly was RIGHT.  </li>
            <li>Cushions were exactly as described and were shipped promptly.</li>
            <li>Fits well and is a direct replacement for my original cushion.</li>
            <li>The price is good, the materials are OK, but it&#x27;s useless for me.</li>
            <li>The product was reasonable,shipped fast and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I know that they fit a sensitive part of my face remaining comfortable throughout the night, while maintaining a tight fit.  </li>
            <li>and it was too large for my mask.</li>
            <li>It fits fine and works, but is quite obviously not at substantial.  </li>
            <li>The pressures I need are very high</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the alternative to having to go running to our doctor every time he needs replacement parts.</li>
            <li>Spoke to them very helpful in answering my questions and concerns.</li>
            <li>as advertized, thanks</li>
            <li>This is the real deal Comfort Gel Cushion.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This original is in fact the proper product for my Respironics CPAP.</li>
            <li>This one is different from the first one to come out in that the blue part is firmer and holds up better.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you order the other two with this one.</li>
            <li>You can stock up for all year at the same price as you&#x27;d pay for one insert at many of the major CPAP stores online.</li>
            <li>This did not have the clip part to attach to the main mask.</li>
            <li>Fits extremelly well with high confort.</li>
            <li>I normally pay $40+ for one of these through my health supplies store.</li>
            <li>I like the new firmer gel although I did need to use a little more pressure to prevent leaking.</li>
            <li>OH well live and learn.</li>
            <li>It is exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li>Not only is it the exact same unit, it cost a fraction of my co-pay.  </li>
            <li>I have sleep apnea and purchased these to help keep the cost down from buying a whole new mask.</li>
            <li>On top of having to pay shipping, this is a rip-off.  </li>

            <li> On top of having to pay shipping, this is a rip-off.  </li>
            <li> They last about 2-3 months of nightly use and then get a little too soft and needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> The usual high quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s probably not going to hold up as long as the one it replaced.</li>
            <li> The down side it that I have to shave more offten because the product gets uncomfortable on a scruffy face.</li>
            <li> Same as OEM at half the price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly the same as the expensive one I&#x27;m using now.</li>
            <li> They usually last at least two weeks before needing to be replaced.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a few years, therefore I can&#x27;t compare it to others.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> but it did not fit ANY of them.</li>
            <li> This is sold as a small, but the markings on it are S/M</li>
            <li> Fits small or med.</li>
            <li> i usually purchase these items through my insurance and I have to pay a hefty co-pay.  </li>
            <li> I only get that talkative when something goes wrong.</li>
            <li> Was just what I needed and it was less expensive than goingg through my insurance carrier.  </li>
            <li> Its base is flat and my mask in contoured.</li>
            <li> This product is just like the expensive ones through your insurance company, but cheaper here with no Rx hassles.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say anything bad...</li>

            <li> A good price and it fits perfectly</li>
            <li> Easy to install, good price good quality. I guess more exposition is required by the review program. Is this enough words for you all.</li>
            <li> This did not have the clip part to attach to the main mask. I couldn&#x27;t use it, and since there are no returns, I had to just throw it away. I&#x27;m rating it a 1 just because it was unusable to me. I&#x27;m sure the product itself is fine.</li>
            <li> great replacement part</li>
            <li> a perfect replacement</li>
            <li> This is sold as a small, but the markings on it are S/M and it was too large for my mask.</li>
            <li> Just what we were looking for. Fits small or med. Great deal!</li>
            <li> The usual high quality. I like the new firmer gel although I did need to use a little more pressure to prevent leaking.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say anything bad...it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li> I normally pay $40+ for one of these through my health supplies store. Save your money and buy these suckers..exactly the same item I was buying and at a quarter of the price.</li>
            <li> Same as OEM at half the price.  It is exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li> product as described.  good price as don&#x27;t need the framework and head gear.  frame and head gear last longer than the gel.  will order again.</li>
            <li> I was really leery about ordering this because I figured it would be a cheap knock-off. Well it was cheap...as in inexpensive. It&#x27;s exactly the same as the expensive one I&#x27;m using now. I wish I&#x27;d bought more!</li>
            <li> Anyone who uses a CPAP machine knows that the insurance company only replaces the head gear twice a year but it wears out in a couple of months so I purchased my own.</li>
            <li> This product is just like the expensive ones through your insurance company, but cheaper here with no Rx hassles. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Great piece. Great shipping time. We will keep ordering from here. Thanks for the alternative to having to go running to our doctor every time he needs replacement parts. This makes it cheaper than paying for the doctor all the time.</li>
            <li> best mask on the market feels great eveybody needs to use this mask. tryed all kinds none as good as this one</li>
            <li> Spoke to them very helpful in answering my questions and concerns. Look forward to continue to do future business needs with them.</li>
            <li> I tried to get an idea of it was the right shape for my mask online and couldn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s actually clearer here in the photo with this review. Its base is flat and my mask in contoured. The price is good, the materials are OK, but it&#x27;s useless for me.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I needed for my CPAP machine. It fits and it is comforable to wear on my face.</li>
            <li> The size, shape and feel are perfect for me.  They usually last at least two weeks before needing to be replaced.</li>
            <li> Works and looks just like factory original.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable and the price is very affordable.  They fit nicely and cost a lot less than when I use my insurance. I recommend them.</li>
            <li> I have sleep apnea and purchased these to help keep the cost down from buying a whole new mask. The product was reasonable,shipped fast and was exactly what I wanted.Unlike Metrodeal who does not honor their warrenties and strung me along until even Amazon would not help. So this dealer was good but stay away from metrodeal for any reason or product.You will just pay more in the end.</li>
            <li> Perfect, thank you. This is an exact replacement for my mask, and works flawless. If you have this type of mask this is the replacement you need.</li>
            <li> I have tried several CPAP masks and have found The Comfort gel Blue Nasal Mask to give me the best cushioning.  They last about 2-3 months of nightly use and then get a little too soft and needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product....</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> as advertized, thanks</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a few years, therefore I can&#x27;t compare it to others.  I know that they fit a sensitive part of my face remaining comfortable throughout the night, while maintaining a tight fit.  The fit is important to your spouse since without it you will keep her awake with the sound produced from air pressure leaks.</li>
            <li> great replacement product</li>
            <li> I purchased the cushion and the headgear for my CPAP mask. This &amp;#34;rebuilds&amp;#34; the mask as good as a new one and at a fraction of the cost. I was also impressed with the fast shipping and delivery. Very satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement gel mask cushion because they always wear out before I am eligible for another one to be covered by my insurance. This fits the mask perfectly, and is a low priced product.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit. Cheaper than using medical supplier.</li>
            <li> My original purchase was a medium because I am 6&#x27; and 220 Lbs. and no I donâ€™t have a midget head. Anyways, the small fits perfect, the medium was to large. The down side it that I have to shave more offten because the product gets uncomfortable on a scruffy face. I have tried 4 variations to face masks, fabric nose, in nose, gel full face and this nose gel. I am no longer looking for something better.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Delivered on time and no problems</li>
            <li> Well for the price this was good.  What can you say about a C-pap mask.  Wish I didn&#x27;t need it but since I do this one was great.</li>
            <li> This cushion was not nearly as thick as the original one that came with my unit.  It fits fine and works, but is quite obviously not at substantial.  I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s probably not going to hold up as long as the one it replaced.</li>
            <li> Solid fit and is just like the original.</li>
            <li> This original is in fact the proper product for my Respironics CPAP. Fits extremelly well with high confort. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Beware. Don&#x27;t waste your money.  This looks like it should fit a Phillips mask but it doesn&#x27;t.  I tried three different Phillips masks that have the blue nasal part but it did not fit ANY of them. On top of having to pay shipping, this is a rip-off.  Buy your supplies elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Been using this mask for years, and this replacement part was as good but half the price I was used to paying.</li>
            <li> Was just what I needed and it was less expensive than goingg through my insurance carrier.  Thank you very much</li>
            <li> This is the real deal Comfort Gel Cushion.  I received a new, perfectly good item at 1/3 price my insurance company is willing to pay my doctor.  No wonder healthcare costs are skyrocketing.</li>
            <li> exact replacement for what have been using</li>
            <li> I have used this mask for over 5 years.  This one is different from the first one to come out in that the blue part is firmer and holds up better.  The clear part seals better than the first one.  I found this one and it costs 1/3 of what I pay my home health company.  The pressures I need are very high and I need to replace the mask more often than my insurance will pay.  I bought 2 of these and they are the same as the ones I get from my home health company but for 1/3 the cost.  I will buy these again.</li>
            <li> When you are looking at petite zest masks on amazon.com, it tells you that consumer who buy the mask often buy this; however, it doesn&#x27;t fit in the mask, so the &amp;#34;cross-sell&amp;#34; is incorrect.  However, I wish it did fit!!</li>
            <li> Just like description says.. no bells and whistles</li>
            <li> i usually purchase these items through my insurance and I have to pay a hefty co-pay.  Thjis time I decided to take a chance and buy this one.  Not only is it the exact same unit, it cost a fraction of my co-pay.  i&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase in todays economy you have to save anywhere you can.</li>
            <li> The gel cushion makes this very comfortable and provides a good seal around my face. Easy to wash and clean.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> These work just perfectly.  I&#x27;ve had no problem at all with them and the price certainly was RIGHT.  I stocked-up but will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Fits well and is a direct replacement for my original cushion. Buy it now. No need to worry about getting it!</li>
            <li> I have used this cushion/flap for years and still love it.  Easy to install, lasts a long time, and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Cushions were exactly as described and were shipped promptly. No different than ones I get from my CPAP vendor but cheaper.</li>
            <li> good to have a backup, you dont want to need it in the middle of the night and not have it.... ya know....</li>
            <li> I had to buy a new set of straps &amp; mask so that this cushion would fit, even though mine looked like it would fit. It was off by a millimeter or two at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iâ€™m completely happy with this cushion, extremely comfortable, no complaints. Just make sure you order the other two with this one.</li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased with the replacement cushion for my CPAP mask. Unit fits well in frame and provides a good seal through out the night. I definitely will buy these again as needed.</li>
            <li> Great product that works well as the replacement for my original mask and at a great price. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> identical to original</li>
            <li> As described&lt;br /&gt;The requirement for 18 or more words will make me stop doing the reviews. I only get that talkative when something goes wrong.</li>
            <li> Have purchased these many times.  Very happy with their performance.</li>
            <li> This fit my current face mask well and will order it again, great price, and probably less than I pay from my insurance.</li>
            <li> The blue nasal cushion does just what it is supposed to. It fit fine and came in on time.</li>
            <li> Quality product and an exact fit for my Respironics CPAP. No hassle ordering and prompt delivery</li>
            <li> This product fits only M/L mask. Best price I have found. Will buy future purchases from this company. Thank you for making it affordable.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly inside the mark shell and at this price this is a real bargain. You can stock up for all year at the same price as you&#x27;d pay for one insert at many of the major CPAP stores online.</li>
            <li> perfect fit, exactly what I needed when I needed. Fast delivery. price is right. I ordered a couple of them, should last me a while, as I use one I will order another, so that I always have a spare.</li>
            <li> Generic not OEM. OH well live and learn. I guess it works ok but not as good as the originals do.</li>
