            <li>Samuri is yet another beautiful colour from Gelish.</li>

            <li>You can use this for 1 coat over another color; a friend did one coat (2 coats is better to get more even coverage) and then did a glitter coat on top (Vegas Nights) and was very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I love Gelish polish.  </li>
            <li>but I am not in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I may pair it with others and see if I like it more when it&#x27;s layered.</li>
            <li>Like many of the Gelish colors, it all depends on how many coats you put on.  </li>
            <li>love color.</li>
            <li>so I did a coat of Ambiance over the top.</li>
            <li>With 2 coats this is a nice light lavender.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This color is more neutral than striking.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a pinky purple and the color is more of a brownish mauve.</li>
            <li>Samuri is my favorite gelish nail color.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more muted, not an obnoxious pre-teen color.  </li>
            <li>I love gelish Polish-  </li>
            <li>it is a mauve- way more subdued than I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>It is shimmery as well, which I love.</li>
            <li>This color looks so elegant on.</li>
            <li>Aside from others noticing my polish it would still be my favorite -</li>
            <li>I choose my colors by what I like, and even if I hadn&#x27;t ever gotten compliments I&#x27;d still be wearing it the most.</li>
            <li>The color is darker than the picture on most monitors.  </li>
            <li>color is much more neutral than it looks....almost brown.</li>
            <li>My wife likes the more sparkling Gelish colors and she would wear this with a top coat on it like Water</li>
            <li>Turns out it is a lot more purple.  </li>
            <li>I love putting a coat of</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re looking for more of a purple, then you may not like this color.  </li>
            <li>I love my Gelish kit, and there are hundreds of colors to pick from.</li>
            <li>I love purple</li>
            <li>(Most of my makeups come in ivory/creams).</li>
            <li>used seller Payless Nail, and was completely pleased.</li>
            <li>Really love this color.</li>
            <li>I love this Gelish color, it is my favorite.</li>
            <li>This color is very appropriate for an office setting or anyone who wants to make sure their nails don&#x27;t look like they should be on a tween.  </li>
            <li>Glamour Queen and Good Gossip both tend to peel but Samuri wears until you&#x27;re ready to take it off.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to start with anything to powerful when I began doing my own nails.</li>
            <li>A good everyday color but also great for dress up.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely a 2 coat polish to get good coverage and nice nail coverage</li>
            <li>I bought this particular shade because I&#x27;d had it applied at a nail salon and really loved it.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s a lovely color by itself, it also works great on top of other colors because it isn&#x27;t opaque.</li>
            <li>So very pretty!</li>
            <li>Polish lasts 2-3 weeks if I let it cure for 2-3 minutes each step with LED light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost a light purple.</li>
            <li>color has just enough sparkle in it to be attractive</li>
            <li>It also looks good on top of brighter pinks just for something different.</li>
            <li>The people who say this looks more mauve are also right.</li>
            <li>My bottle arrived in tact/good condition and the shipping was fast!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually very light you have to apply about 3 coats and even then it&#x27;s still not that exact color</li>
            <li>light plum with a shimmer of gold; not sparkles, but pretty   2 coats is more a lilac   3 is the plum</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast becoming one of my favorite nail polish colors.</li>
            <li>Samuri over the top makes it a really pretty magenta.  </li>
            <li>I get the most compliments of &amp;#34;that&#x27;s a pretty color!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This is a really nice color, not as pink color as it looks more of a mauve color but still really lovely.</li>
            <li>It took me by surprise, and ended up by pooling along my cuticles- resulting in having to clean them before curing.  </li>
            <li>It looks good on a full nail as well as a French manicure.  </li>
            <li>I have over 30 different Gelish colors and this one is my favorite and the one I wear the most.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice purple, mauve color with a bit of shine (not matte); For those who are more subtle in their nail color choices, this is a good fit, it can be light or dark.  </li>
            <li>This particular color is very unique</li>
            <li>Very very pretty for an every day look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this over Gossip Girl which is a super bright bubblegum pink.</li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;ve been knows to go 3 or 4 with the clear and very light ones since they blend with the skin tones.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product at a local beauty supply store, thinking it would be a nice sparkly purple.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this colour to anyone who is looking for a nice mid-tone purple to add to their collection.</li>
            <li>Definitely my favorite Gelish color by far.  </li>
            <li>She needs to wear a more mature color while at work</li>
            <li>Depending what kind of light you&#x27;re seeing this in, it can look anywhere from a muted lavendery pink, to a mauvey-berry neutral.</li>
            <li>By far, my favorite Gelish color.</li>
            <li>The polish itself is fine, decent quality gel.  </li>
            <li>this isn&#x27;t going to be my cup of tea, but I already have plans to wear this as a top coat on top of some other colors.</li>
            <li>The people who say this is purple are right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost a purple color, with just the right amount of glitter.  </li>
            <li>The picture of this color makes it look like a bright, pretty pink.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to any one who uses the uv light and gel polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really great basic color...not too light and not too dark.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Love the Gelish system and won&#x27;t go back!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty color</li>
            <li>This is definitely purple, but more on the berry side of purple.  </li>
            <li>More of a mauve than an actual purple, but still pretty.  </li>
            <li>The colour is pretty close to the swatch in the picture with two coats, maybe just a tad darker.</li>
            <li>it becomes more obvious as it grows out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pink kind of Girl.  </li>
            <li>So pretty and durable.</li>
            <li>It does require more than one coat, and for me two coats is enough.</li>
            <li>Actually it&#x27;s more like sheer....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care much for the color, not quite as bright pink as I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>If you add a layer of glitter polish it really sparkles!</li>
            <li>One coat covered pretty well and two coats was plenty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Super fast shipping from the store!</li>
            <li>Still pretty but not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>is a sheer color, for sure.</li>
            <li>It was full size product (no size was on the listing), shipped lightning fast, and wrapped very well.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty pinkish color with hints of gold and bit of redish tinge.</li>
            <li>:  Half the fun is mixing and matching and coming up with our own \\&quot;signature\\&quot; colors.  </li>
            <li>It appears that this will be a nice modifier for some other colors in my collection.</li>
            <li>1 coat Red Roses, 1 coat Samurai; and then 1 coat of High Voltage - very nice deep red/burgandy with mega sparkle!!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a nice, slightly shimmery color, that won&#x27;t clash with anything, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li>This particular color reminds me of a grape lifesaver, a pretty midrange plum color.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a pale rose tint that didn&#x27;t draw a lot of attention to my first few attempts at doing my own nails.</li>
            <li>My monitor display shows it as much pinker than it really is, and the bottle itself shows it as a much deeper shade than what I ended up with.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find the picture to be an accurate depiction of the actual polish.</li>
            <li>I really like this color.  </li>
            <li>A coat or two of Samuri over Exhale really makes it pop, but without being obnoxious.</li>
            <li>I found that 2 coats do really well, but 3 coats give it a deeper color that I prefer.</li>
            <li>This is a color we purchased for my wife&#x27;s sister who is an executive and she loves Gelish nail polish thanks to my wife.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>you really do need to use the acetone to remove it</li>
            <li>but it is subdued enough to look professional and stylish.  </li>
            <li>I barely use it because it just seems kind of washed out next to the other more vibrant Gelish choices.</li>
            <li>Layer with other colors for a more daring look.</li>
            <li>Just enough shimmer and color while not being dark or bright.</li>
            <li>Izzy Wizzy Lets Get Busy over it which gives it that pretty color shift.</li>
            <li>However, it is more pink and more sheer than it looks, and not nearly as sparkly.</li>
            <li>They all last tremendously well.</li>
            <li>This color is a little more mauve and muted and it appears in the photo.  </li>
            <li>It is a combination of a light mauve and pink.  </li>
            <li>My wife normally uses 2 coats of polish whenever she does her nails.  </li>
            <li>I am actually wearing Star Burst right now, and when I made a test nail of the \\&quot;Samuri\\&quot;, side by side you can see that Samuri is like a sheerer cousin to Star Burst.</li>
            <li>*If you are new to Gelish or gel nails, need some tips and tricks, see this review:&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is sheer &amp; light, need several coats for coverage &amp; color.  </li>
            <li>It is very soft and girly.  </li>
            <li>I will try 3 next time, since it IS a pretty color.</li>
            <li>Love this color, it has small glitter &amp; is classy not gaudy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a dull mauve.</li>
            <li>It was by far the runniest of all my gelish polishes.  </li>
            <li>The image looks almost magenta, but it is a soft purple/lavender color with just a touch of shine.</li>
            <li>But, for some reason, the shade is very different from the salon&#x27;s, and I don&#x27;t really care for it.</li>
            <li>but that drawback is far outweighed by the polish itself.</li>
            <li>Look up gelish swatches if you want to see what the colors will really look like on your nails because it is different from the color that it looks in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Also worn it over Exhale which is a dusty rose.  </li>
            <li>The color reminds me a little of grandma&#x27;s colors not bad if that is what you are going for though.</li>
            <li>This large bottle will last you a long time.  </li>
            <li>so I generally do 3 coats.</li>
            <li>Not pink at all.</li>
            <li>and she is always in front of the public and needs to put forward a professional image of herself as she represents the company she works for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda hard to judge when buying colors online...not true to pic at all</li>
            <li>it is hard to remove unless you keep it the full two weeks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also thick and easy to apply, long lasting.  </li>
            <li>and my nails are very healthy and growing like mad.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> My wife likes the more sparkling Gelish colors and she would wear this with a top coat on it like Water</li>
            <li> Turns out it is a lot more purple.  </li>
            <li> I love putting a coat of</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re looking for more of a purple, then you may not like this color.  </li>
            <li> I love my Gelish kit, and there are hundreds of colors to pick from.</li>
            <li> I love purple</li>
            <li> (Most of my makeups come in ivory/creams).</li>
            <li> used seller Payless Nail, and was completely pleased.</li>
            <li> Really love this color.</li>
            <li> I love this Gelish color, it is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This color is very appropriate for an office setting or anyone who wants to make sure their nails don&#x27;t look like they should be on a tween.  </li>
            <li> Glamour Queen and Good Gossip both tend to peel but Samuri wears until you&#x27;re ready to take it off.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to start with anything to powerful when I began doing my own nails.</li>
            <li> A good everyday color but also great for dress up.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely a 2 coat polish to get good coverage and nice nail coverage</li>
            <li> I bought this particular shade because I&#x27;d had it applied at a nail salon and really loved it.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a lovely color by itself, it also works great on top of other colors because it isn&#x27;t opaque.</li>
            <li> So very pretty!</li>
            <li> Polish lasts 2-3 weeks if I let it cure for 2-3 minutes each step with LED light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost a light purple.</li>
            <li> color has just enough sparkle in it to be attractive</li>
            <li> It also looks good on top of brighter pinks just for something different.</li>
            <li> The people who say this looks more mauve are also right.</li>
            <li> My bottle arrived in tact/good condition and the shipping was fast!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually very light you have to apply about 3 coats and even then it&#x27;s still not that exact color</li>
            <li> light plum with a shimmer of gold; not sparkles, but pretty   2 coats is more a lilac   3 is the plum</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast becoming one of my favorite nail polish colors.</li>
            <li> Samuri over the top makes it a really pretty magenta.  </li>
            <li> I get the most compliments of &amp;#34;that&#x27;s a pretty color!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> This is a really nice color, not as pink color as it looks more of a mauve color but still really lovely.</li>
            <li> It took me by surprise, and ended up by pooling along my cuticles- resulting in having to clean them before curing.  </li>
            <li> It looks good on a full nail as well as a French manicure.  </li>
            <li> I have over 30 different Gelish colors and this one is my favorite and the one I wear the most.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice purple, mauve color with a bit of shine (not matte); For those who are more subtle in their nail color choices, this is a good fit, it can be light or dark.  </li>
            <li> This particular color is very unique</li>
            <li> Very very pretty for an every day look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this over Gossip Girl which is a super bright bubblegum pink.</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;ve been knows to go 3 or 4 with the clear and very light ones since they blend with the skin tones.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a local beauty supply store, thinking it would be a nice sparkly purple.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this colour to anyone who is looking for a nice mid-tone purple to add to their collection.</li>
            <li> Definitely my favorite Gelish color by far.  </li>
            <li> She needs to wear a more mature color while at work</li>
            <li> Depending what kind of light you&#x27;re seeing this in, it can look anywhere from a muted lavendery pink, to a mauvey-berry neutral.</li>
            <li> By far, my favorite Gelish color.</li>
            <li> The polish itself is fine, decent quality gel.  </li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t going to be my cup of tea, but I already have plans to wear this as a top coat on top of some other colors.</li>
            <li> The people who say this is purple are right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost a purple color, with just the right amount of glitter.  </li>
            <li> The picture of this color makes it look like a bright, pretty pink.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to any one who uses the uv light and gel polish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really great basic color...not too light and not too dark.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Love the Gelish system and won&#x27;t go back!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty color</li>
            <li> This is definitely purple, but more on the berry side of purple.  </li>
            <li> More of a mauve than an actual purple, but still pretty.  </li>
            <li> The colour is pretty close to the swatch in the picture with two coats, maybe just a tad darker.</li>
            <li> it becomes more obvious as it grows out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pink kind of Girl.  </li>
            <li> So pretty and durable.</li>
            <li> It does require more than one coat, and for me two coats is enough.</li>
            <li> Actually it&#x27;s more like sheer....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care much for the color, not quite as bright pink as I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li> If you add a layer of glitter polish it really sparkles!</li>
            <li> One coat covered pretty well and two coats was plenty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Super fast shipping from the store!</li>
            <li> Still pretty but not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> is a sheer color, for sure.</li>
            <li> It was full size product (no size was on the listing), shipped lightning fast, and wrapped very well.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty pinkish color with hints of gold and bit of redish tinge.</li>
            <li> :  Half the fun is mixing and matching and coming up with our own \\&quot;signature\\&quot; colors.  </li>
            <li> It appears that this will be a nice modifier for some other colors in my collection.</li>
            <li> 1 coat Red Roses, 1 coat Samurai; and then 1 coat of High Voltage - very nice deep red/burgandy with mega sparkle!!  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a nice, slightly shimmery color, that won&#x27;t clash with anything, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> This particular color reminds me of a grape lifesaver, a pretty midrange plum color.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pale rose tint that didn&#x27;t draw a lot of attention to my first few attempts at doing my own nails.</li>
            <li> My monitor display shows it as much pinker than it really is, and the bottle itself shows it as a much deeper shade than what I ended up with.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the picture to be an accurate depiction of the actual polish.</li>
            <li> I really like this color.  </li>
            <li> A coat or two of Samuri over Exhale really makes it pop, but without being obnoxious.</li>
            <li> I found that 2 coats do really well, but 3 coats give it a deeper color that I prefer.</li>
            <li> This is a color we purchased for my wife&#x27;s sister who is an executive and she loves Gelish nail polish thanks to my wife.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> you really do need to use the acetone to remove it</li>
            <li> but it is subdued enough to look professional and stylish.  </li>
            <li> I barely use it because it just seems kind of washed out next to the other more vibrant Gelish choices.</li>
            <li> Layer with other colors for a more daring look.</li>
            <li> Just enough shimmer and color while not being dark or bright.</li>
            <li> Izzy Wizzy Lets Get Busy over it which gives it that pretty color shift.</li>
            <li> However, it is more pink and more sheer than it looks, and not nearly as sparkly.</li>
            <li> They all last tremendously well.</li>
            <li> This color is a little more mauve and muted and it appears in the photo.  </li>
            <li> It is a combination of a light mauve and pink.  </li>
            <li> My wife normally uses 2 coats of polish whenever she does her nails.  </li>
            <li> I am actually wearing Star Burst right now, and when I made a test nail of the \\&quot;Samuri\\&quot;, side by side you can see that Samuri is like a sheerer cousin to Star Burst.</li>
            <li> *If you are new to Gelish or gel nails, need some tips and tricks, see this review:&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is sheer &amp; light, need several coats for coverage &amp; color.  </li>
            <li> It is very soft and girly.  </li>
            <li> I will try 3 next time, since it IS a pretty color.</li>
            <li> Love this color, it has small glitter &amp; is classy not gaudy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a dull mauve.</li>
            <li> It was by far the runniest of all my gelish polishes.  </li>
            <li> The image looks almost magenta, but it is a soft purple/lavender color with just a touch of shine.</li>
            <li> But, for some reason, the shade is very different from the salon&#x27;s, and I don&#x27;t really care for it.</li>
            <li> but that drawback is far outweighed by the polish itself.</li>
            <li> Look up gelish swatches if you want to see what the colors will really look like on your nails because it is different from the color that it looks in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Also worn it over Exhale which is a dusty rose.  </li>
            <li> The color reminds me a little of grandma&#x27;s colors not bad if that is what you are going for though.</li>
            <li> This large bottle will last you a long time.  </li>
            <li> so I generally do 3 coats.</li>
            <li> Not pink at all.</li>
            <li> and she is always in front of the public and needs to put forward a professional image of herself as she represents the company she works for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda hard to judge when buying colors online...not true to pic at all</li>
            <li> it is hard to remove unless you keep it the full two weeks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also thick and easy to apply, long lasting.  </li>
            <li> and my nails are very healthy and growing like mad.  </li>
            <li> Wondering if I got a strange mix?</li>
            <li> The color on this site is a little darker than the polish is in reality but the same color concept overall.  </li>
            <li> Just so you know and are not surprised!</li>
            <li> it looks like what I expected it to.</li>
            <li> WAY lighter than I expected.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered this polish I thought it was a darker pink.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is it&#x27;s a little thinner than some of the other colors.</li>
            <li> This color is NOT very well represented by the photo of the color, but the pictures provided by other customers shows it well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hot pink, it&#x27;s purple.</li>
            <li> it is a hard finish that is dry immediately after you give it the last wipe off after the finish coat.  </li>
            <li> It peeled faster than my other Gelish colors...</li>
            <li> Also, this color does not seem to fade and change color over time on my nails like some other colors do.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t as dark as it shows on the picture.</li>
            <li> This color is dark.</li>
            <li> I still like it but was looking  for something less transparent.</li>
            <li> but there are a few quirks to this color preventing me from giving it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> otherwise it is a little too thin in its coverage.  </li>
            <li> so you&#x27;ll need at least three coats.  </li>
            <li> I received my polish today and was disappointed to learn that the color on the website was not what the actual color of the polish was.</li>
            <li> Wrong color.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I bought 2 bottles!</li>
            <li> Very frustrating!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love Gelish polish.  This color is a little more mauve and muted and it appears in the photo.  I like the color but I am not in love with it.  I may pair it with others and see if I like it more when it&#x27;s layered.</li>
            <li> I love this color!! The only thing is it&#x27;s a little thinner than some of the other colors. I had to use 3 coats, and I can still kind of see through it. Regardless, I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I really like this color.  I did two coats and it is a nice medium shade berry.  My monitor display shows it as much pinker than it really is, and the bottle itself shows it as a much deeper shade than what I ended up with.  Like many of the Gelish colors, it all depends on how many coats you put on.  This color is very appropriate for an office setting or anyone who wants to make sure their nails don&#x27;t look like they should be on a tween.  ;-)</li>
            <li> love color. it looks like what I expected it to. Polish lasts 2-3 weeks if I let it cure for 2-3 minutes each step with LED light.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a local beauty supply store, thinking it would be a nice sparkly purple. However, it is more pink and more sheer than it looks, and not nearly as sparkly. I did 3 coats and still wasn&#x27;t super happy with the color by itself so I did a coat of Ambiance over the top. If you want a sheer purply-pink, this is the color for you.</li>
            <li> With 2 coats this is a nice light lavender.  I haven&#x27;t tried 3 coats.  Like always Gelish stays on.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice purple, mauve color with a bit of shine (not matte); For those who are more subtle in their nail color choices, this is a good fit, it can be light or dark.  You can use this for 1 coat over another color; a friend did one coat (2 coats is better to get more even coverage) and then did a glitter coat on top (Vegas Nights) and was very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m bolder in my choices, but I&#x27;ve used Samurai in my current mix to add a bit of purple to deepen my color:  1 coat Red Roses, 1 coat Samurai; and then 1 coat of High Voltage - very nice deep red/burgandy with mega sparkle!!  So, this is a good color that plays well with others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  Half the fun is mixing and matching and coming up with our own \\&quot;signature\\&quot; colors.  Love the Gelish system and won&#x27;t go back!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty color but it is sheer &amp; light, need several coats for coverage &amp; color.  It also glittery.  This color is more neutral than striking.</li>
            <li> Love this color for the Harmony, very pleased with the purchase, and the speed of delivery. would order again from this seller.  I went on you-tube to find out how to properly apply this product. Works great. Now I just have to improve applying it myself.</li>
            <li> I received my polish today and was disappointed to learn that the color on the website was not what the actual color of the polish was. I was looking for a pinky purple and the color is more of a brownish mauve.</li>
            <li> this color is nice but darker than it appears online. It peeled faster than my other Gelish colors... I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> Samuri is my favorite gelish nail color.  A good everyday color but also great for dress up.  It goes good with lavender shades and also pinks.  But, it is just a good girlie color !</li>
            <li> This is definitely purple, but more on the berry side of purple.  It&#x27;s more muted, not an obnoxious pre-teen color.  It&#x27;s sort of sheer so you&#x27;ll need at least three coats.  It has a nice sparkle too.  Although it&#x27;s a lovely color by itself, it also works great on top of other colors because it isn&#x27;t opaque. I&#x27;ve worn this over Gossip Girl which is a super bright bubblegum pink. Samuri over the top makes it a really pretty magenta.  Also worn it over Exhale which is a dusty rose.  A coat or two of Samuri over Exhale really makes it pop, but without being obnoxious.</li>
            <li> I love gelish Polish-  but there are a few quirks to this color preventing me from giving it 5 stars.  It was by far the runniest of all my gelish polishes.  It took me by surprise, and ended up by pooling along my cuticles- resulting in having to clean them before curing.  The second point is the color is not the perky berry I wanted- it is a mauve- way more subdued than I had hoped.  Wondering if I got a strange mix?</li>
            <li> More of a mauve than an actual purple, but still pretty.  I was hoping for a lavender color, which it is not,</li>
            <li> The image looks almost magenta, but it is a soft purple/lavender color with just a touch of shine. Very very pretty for an every day look. Layer with other colors for a more daring look.</li>
            <li> Samuri is yet another beautiful colour from Gelish. The colour is pretty close to the swatch in the picture with two coats, maybe just a tad darker. It is shimmery as well, which I love. I love bling! I would definitely recommend this colour to anyone who is looking for a nice mid-tone purple to add to their collection.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t as dark as it shows on the picture. I still like it but was looking  for something less transparent.</li>
            <li> This is one of my very favorite colors of polish!  It is a beautiful mauve that looks best with three coats.  I will purchase another bottle when this one is gone!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually very light you have to apply about 3 coats and even then it&#x27;s still not that exact color</li>
            <li> This is a very nice plum color. It lasted for about 2 weeks and since it is a darker color it becomes more obvious as it grows out. Great product!</li>
            <li> Definitely my favorite Gelish color by far.  It is very soft and girly.  It looks good on a full nail as well as a French manicure.  I&#x27;m a pink kind of Girl.  The color on this site is a little darker than the polish is in reality but the same color concept overall.  It is a combination of a light mauve and pink.  If you are on the fence, I say take the leap.  My bottle arrived in tact/good condition and the shipping was fast!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t look as bright as in photos but still a nice color.</li>
            <li> This is a great color and I&#x27;m sold on gels.  Don&#x27;t know how I did it before.  Lasts 2 weeks plus,&lt;br /&gt;looks great and my nails are very healthy and growing like mad.  Freedom!!!</li>
            <li> light plum with a shimmer of gold; not sparkles, but pretty   2 coats is more a lilac   3 is the plum</li>
            <li> So pretty and durable. I highly recommend this product to any one who uses the uv light and gel polish.</li>
            <li> This color looks so elegant on. It gets noticed without being overbearing. The only downside is that it goes on somewhat sheer so I generally do 3 coats. I have never had issues with this color bubbling up.</li>
            <li> I have over 30 different Gelish colors and this one is my favorite and the one I wear the most.  It&#x27;s also the one color I get the most compliments of &amp;#34;that&#x27;s a pretty color!&amp;#34;  It happens just about every time I change my color to this. Aside from others noticing my polish it would still be my favorite - I choose my colors by what I like, and even if I hadn&#x27;t ever gotten compliments I&#x27;d still be wearing it the most. It does require more than one coat, and for me two coats is enough. Also, this color does not seem to fade and change color over time on my nails like some other colors do. It also looks good on top of brighter pinks just for something different. I love Samurai!</li>
            <li> I have a number of the Gelish polishes. They all last tremendously well. This particular color reminds me of a grape lifesaver, a pretty midrange plum color. My gripe with it is that it goes on sheer but inconsistent... I put on 2 coats, and it still looks blotchy. I will try 3 next time, since it IS a pretty color.</li>
            <li> WAY lighter than I expected.  Actually it&#x27;s more like sheer....DISLIKE the color, but I guess that the nature of buying nail polish online?</li>
            <li> The color is darker than the picture on most monitors.  It&#x27;s actually plum</li>
            <li> The polish itself is fine, decent quality gel.  I don&#x27;t really care much for the color, not quite as bright pink as I was hoping for.  The color reminds me a little of grandma&#x27;s colors not bad if that is what you are going for though.</li>
            <li> I love my gelish polish! This is the hot color of the season and goes great with my fall wardrobe. I found that 2 coats do really well, but 3 coats give it a deeper color that I prefer. If you add a layer of glitter polish it really sparkles!</li>
            <li> Wrong color. Very frustrating!</li>
            <li> Wonderful shade with mini flecks...great for work.</li>
            <li> Great quality, holds up well!</li>
            <li> This polish has a shimmer to it which helps hide the flaws in my polishing at home!  I wear it constantly! Doing shellac at home and itâ€˜s going great!</li>
            <li> This color is dark. It&#x27;s almost a light purple.</li>
            <li> color is much more neutral than it looks....almost brown. Not pink at all. It&#x27;s kinda hard to judge when buying colors online...not true to pic at all</li>
            <li> This is a really nice color, not as pink color as it looks more of a mauve color but still really lovely.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2AKO050Q1LOY5]]This is a very attractive purple color with very light sparkle accents in it.  This is a color we purchased for my wife&#x27;s sister who is an executive and she loves Gelish nail polish thanks to my wife.  She needs to wear a more mature color while at work and she is always in front of the public and needs to put forward a professional image of herself as she represents the company she works for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color has just enough sparkle in it to be attractive but it is subdued enough to look professional and stylish.  It is definitely a 2 coat polish to get good coverage and nice nail coverage otherwise it is a little too thin in its coverage.  My wife normally uses 2 coats of polish whenever she does her nails.  My wife likes the more sparkling Gelish colors and she would wear this with a top coat on it like Water Field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We buy all of my wife&#x27;s Gelish products off of Amazon as the prices are good and you can get the larger Â½ ounce bottles.  This large bottle will last you a long time.  This is a nice color and I rated it as a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> The people who say this is purple are right. The people who say this looks more mauve are also right. Depending what kind of light you&#x27;re seeing this in, it can look anywhere from a muted lavendery pink, to a mauvey-berry neutral. It&#x27;s a really great basic color...not too light and not too dark. Personally, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s sheer at all. One coat covered pretty well and two coats was plenty. If you&#x27;re looking for a nice, slightly shimmery color, that won&#x27;t clash with anything, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this polish I thought it was a darker pink.  Turns out it is a lot more purple.  Probably will not be using this color again.</li>
            <li> Love this color, it has small glitter &amp; is classy not gaudy.  It&#x27;s also thick and easy to apply, long lasting.  I love putting a coat of Izzy Wizzy Lets Get Busy over it which gives it that pretty color shift.</li>
            <li> The color is not represented well online, it&#x27;s actually a beautiful shade of purple if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.  I wanted the wine color shown.</li>
            <li> This color is purplish with some sparkle in it.  I really like it.  I do two coats and it goes on really nice.  It is a bit pinky so if you&#x27;re looking for more of a purple, then you may not like this color.  I think it goes well on any skin tone.  Again, another gelish polish that I like a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping from the store!</li>
            <li> The picture of this color makes it look like a bright, pretty pink. It&#x27;s more of a dull mauve. Still pretty but not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I bought this particular shade because I&#x27;d had it applied at a nail salon and really loved it. But, for some reason, the shade is very different from the salon&#x27;s, and I don&#x27;t really care for it. Unfortunately, I bought 2 bottles!</li>
            <li> I love my Gelish kit, and there are hundreds of colors to pick from. That being said, Samuri is not one of my favorites. I barely use it because it just seems kind of washed out next to the other more vibrant Gelish choices. I don&#x27;t find the picture to be an accurate depiction of the actual polish.</li>
            <li> This color is a beautiful shimmery light purple with some pinkish undertones. So very pretty! This color is NOT very well represented by the photo of the color, but the pictures provided by other customers shows it well. Covered well in 2 coats.</li>
            <li> I love purple but I don&#x27;t have a skin color/tone that works well with the color (Most of my makeups come in ivory/creams). Anyhow, this has just a hint of a mauve tone but it&#x27;s still a purple color. By far, my favorite Gelish color. AND, it wears well. Glamour Queen and Good Gossip both tend to peel but Samuri wears until you&#x27;re ready to take it off.</li>
            <li> *If you are new to Gelish or gel nails, need some tips and tricks, see this review:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VWRFDI073BON/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R3VWRFDI073BON&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;This is a sheer color, for sure. I am actually wearing Star Burst right now, and when I made a test nail of the \\&quot;Samuri\\&quot;, side by side you can see that Samuri is like a sheerer cousin to Star Burst. Tonally they are similar. It&#x27;s not wine, it&#x27;s purple. It&#x27;s not hot pink, it&#x27;s purple. Just so you know and are not surprised! For sheer Gelish polish, I have a method to cover tips so that you don&#x27;t get shine through; but for \\&quot;Samuri\\&quot; this method did not work well. Samuri is a color that shows everything, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By itself this isn&#x27;t going to be my cup of tea, but I already have plans to wear this as a top coat on top of some other colors. It appears that this will be a nice modifier for some other colors in my collection. If I had known it was this sheer I would have passed on it, but will make it work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used seller Payless Nail, and was completely pleased. It was full size product (no size was on the listing), shipped lightning fast, and wrapped very well.</li>
            <li> Gelish is great for keeping  your nails from breaking off.  it is a hard finish that is dry immediately after you give it the last wipe off after the finish coat.  it is hard to remove unless you keep it the full two weeks (and I&#x27;ve been knows to go 3 or 4 with the clear and very light ones since they blend with the skin tones.  you really do need to use the acetone to remove it but that drawback is far outweighed by the polish itself.</li>
            <li> Really love this color. Just enough shimmer and color while not being dark or bright.</li>
            <li> Gelish is the best gel nail brand, in my opinion.  This particular color is very unique and I get a lot of compliments on it.  It&#x27;s almost a purple color, with just the right amount of glitter.  It&#x27;s fast becoming one of my favorite nail polish colors.</li>
            <li> I love this Gelish color, it is my favorite. It is a pretty pinkish color with hints of gold and bit of redish tinge. Look up gelish swatches if you want to see what the colors will really look like on your nails because it is different from the color that it looks in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Loving the color. I didn&#x27;t want to start with anything to powerful when I began doing my own nails. This color is a nice neutral color for me. it&#x27;s a pale rose tint that didn&#x27;t draw a lot of attention to my first few attempts at doing my own nails. I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone to have in their line up of choices.</li>
