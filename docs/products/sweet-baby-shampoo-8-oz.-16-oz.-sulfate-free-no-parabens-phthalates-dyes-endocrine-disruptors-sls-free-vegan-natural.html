            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased the coconut before, and it smells buttery and delicious like coconut cake.</li>
            <li>Beautiful!</li>
            <li>I bought this in the tropical scent (I believe that was the name) it smells great!</li>
            <li>But, the best part about this wash is that it&#x27;s all-natural.  </li>
            <li>This kid&#x27;s shampoo is awesome.</li>
            <li>I like coconut the best.</li>
            <li>My hair is in the best condition it has ever been since I switched to this shampoo 6 months ago.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m impressed by the integrity of this company.</li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo!</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and even though it is Baby Shampoo</li>
            <li>and it smells wonderful (tropical).</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed by the care the owner exhibited for her customers.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll also try the pear to see which I like best.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who&#x27;s been on the hunt for organic baby shampoo knows the scents you&#x27;ll find out there are sometimes not so delicious.</li>
            <li>This one is delightful.</li>
            <li>We are SO happy we switched!</li>

            <li>and it is perfect for both naturally perfect wavy hair and super curly frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>But because i heard the coconut is more moisturizing which may work best for my daughters eczema.</li>
            <li>&amp; not because i don&#x27;t love the scent of the tropical one cause let me to tell you it smells amazing!!</li>

            <li>This smells so good....</li>
            <li>We get the Tropical Baby scent, and it smells SO good....</li>
            <li>The price is good for the quality of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>but since using this shampoo his hair smells really good after sweating.</li>
            <li>Both are good products</li>
            <li>but I really loved the unscented one.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li>The owner of the company took the time to write to me to explain how to get a good lather out of the product</li>
            <li>Whether you&#x27;re a Beautiful Baby or a Beautiful Babe, I recommend Sweet Baby Organics Shampoo for you.</li>
            <li>It feels very healthy and has a lot of shine.</li>
            <li>i tried their tropical baby(for myself), and am very satisfied with the product.</li>

            <li>I want the lotion I want more of everything!  </li>
            <li>We love Sweet Baby products and this shampoo is excellent.</li>
            <li>It just smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how amazing this shampoo smells and works.  </li>
            <li>great knowing that the product is free of harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>It was a pleasure to use, nice lather, and if you can believe the label, healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells so good, but it is not at all overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is gentle on your hair &amp;amp; smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I use this product for my baby and my own bubble bath.  </li>
            <li>The vendor is great too, very nice and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Very glad it is safer than most shampoos on the market, but results are nothing to brag about.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I found a shampoo that is sulfate and paraben free that I don&#x27;t like but love.</li>
            <li>This product is sweet smelling and very effective on both babies and adults.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite, and I love the smell!</li>
            <li>what more can I say! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Smells great, lathers well and goes on smoothly and easily.  </li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>Given the cost of the hair, this is very important to me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild and nice.</li>
            <li>After the latest string of disappointments, I decided on a whim to try this.  </li>
            <li>The best thing about it is that my scalp is healing, after using this product for only 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>and she was fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to how this shampoo works for babies because I don&#x27;t have one, but I love using it for myself.  </li>
            <li>Wish it was sold in more stores.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and it has a surprisingly good lather for being sulfate free.</li>
            <li>I am glad I tried this product</li>
            <li>Smells lovely.  </li>
            <li>Love the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>We absolutely love this baby shampoo.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>and my hair is shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I now realize how much better my hair and scalp feel with this shampoo...</li>
            <li>I just love this...</li>
            <li>It gives me great confidence that her company puts the same amount of care into her product and I feel good about using it on my baby.</li>
            <li>Most brands give him bumps or make him itchy.  </li>
            <li>We bought tropical baby and love the smell.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>need more words.  </li>
            <li>we love it.</li>
            <li>we want more of it.</li>
            <li>What a joy to find this new product line!  </li>
            <li>Not any more since we&#x27;ve switched to sweet baby!</li>
            <li>Happy to find a wash that&#x27;s free of all of the junk that still smells fresh and clean and like a baby.</li>
            <li>Please make the bubble gum scent available year around as it is my favorite.</li>
            <li>With all the great reviews and the fact that this shampoo is supposed to be natural</li>
            <li>Her hair is so soft and silky and smells great.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, it feels so good to use the safest, mildest product I could possibly use on my daughter and know that she&#x27;s not irritated any more!</li>
            <li>Super gentle and smells great.  </li>
            <li>What a relief this Sweet Baby Shampoo is!</li>
            <li>I use it to clean many things in my food prep area as well as my hair.</li>
            <li>My toddlers like tropical baby and angel baby (smells like really strong baby powder).  </li>
            <li>I love my Angel Baby shampoo by Sweet Baby Organics.  </li>
            <li>I ordered my first bottle in the 8-oz. size to make sure I would be able to use it without problems.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my very,very baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>and I still have tons of volume on my normally fine hair.</li>
            <li>Ok so first off I don&#x27;t like the smell of baby powder so now that I have a baby (supa cute 4month boy)</li>
            <li>We have tried many brands of baby wash/shampoo over the last 2 years and have found this one to be the best by far.  </li>
            <li>One of those spontaneous purchases that really paid off.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I declined the free bottle because the boys like a scented bath before bed time</li>
            <li>I look everywhere for products that smell more fresh or fruity.  </li>
            <li>It is so smooth and creamy, and cleans baby skin with no irritation.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s such a great product I hope the price doesn&#x27;t go up</li>
            <li>vacuum lol</li>
            <li>My hair has the healthy and shiny appearance that many sulfate free shampoo&#x27;s claim, and keeps getting better with regular use.</li>
            <li>This shampoo lathers up really nicely, gives my hair a soft and manageable texture, and best of all---I&#x27;m seeing little or no breakage now.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This shampoo is super gentle, doubles as a body wash, and smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>The unscented has a white flip top; angel baby has a gold flip top; and tropical baby has a silver flip top.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and body wash so much!</li>
            <li>Therefore I was pleased when after the first use...</li>
            <li>Even I use it because I love the scent so much!</li>
            <li>or I won&#x27;t be able to afford to buy it consistently.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s healthy and I love knowing that this company is supporting the needs of us who seek the most natural products for our family and our earth.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair fresh clean and no bad things in ingredients!  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, our whole family can use this shampoo/soap.  </li>
            <li>and I appreciate how clean my hair feels after using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried various natural/organic baby shampoos and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Aside from the packaging, the actual product is by far the best natural, organic, non-toxic, safe, effective and clean smelling shampoo and soap I could find (for my toddlers, myself and my very scent-sensitive husband).  </li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the higher price tag when you get this many pluses.</li>
            <li>I tried this product as a result of my ongoing search for a shampoo I can love, and is also gentle on/good for my hair.  </li>
            <li>After comparing the array of SLS-free products on Amazon and reading through all the customer feedback, I decided to order Sweet Baby Organics Shampoo in Angel Baby</li>
            <li>What we&#x27;ve learned is that many of these products really are not as they claim.  </li>
            <li>The vanilla scent is too sweet smelling for me.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use Sweet Baby Shampoo.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I discovered sweet baby.</li>
            <li>I got the tropical scent and love it just as much as the pear.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is very gentle, a lil goes a long way and it it smells great (tropical).</li>
            <li>My husband and I like the tropical baby scent (smells of mild coconut, mango and pineapple).  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;After switching to sulfate free shampoo, I&#x27;ve been experimenting with different brands looking for the &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34;factor, this was a spontaneous purchase.</li>
            <li>I have super oily hair/scalp and this shampoo is a miracle for me.</li>
            <li>I love that we can use this and feel good about what is or isn&#x27;t being absorbed into our little ones&#x27; skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using other all natural products and nothing really impressed me until i bought this.</li>
            <li>I got the tropical smell and it is absolutely divine!!</li>
            <li>My daughter calls it her angel shampoo and it convinced it must be what angels really smell like!!</li>
            <li>And, I love the natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>BUT the scent is mild, a little fruity and very nice.  </li>
            <li>The smell is lovely, I&#x27;ll give it that, but my nephew ended up with a huge, red rash on his belly after using it.</li>
            <li>I also love how truly natural this product is, many others claim to be natural and/or organic</li>
            <li>Better yet, it leaves my hair soft, shiny, and smelling of vanilla and babies.  </li>
            <li>Lathers ok &amp; leaves hair shiny &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>After my 4 year old toddlers dropped the bottle once, the flip top shattered; and now after about 3 months use (not allowing my kids to operate the flip tops or bottles themselves)</li>
            <li>It cleans well and leaves my extensions (and my hair) soft, healthy and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love that it&#x27;s all natural too.</li>
            <li>I bought the Tropical Baby scent, it smells just like fresh coconut.</li>
            <li>Smells just right</li>
            <li>Since it has better ingredients than many other shampoos, it&#x27;s the way to go!</li>
            <li>It lathers extremely well, smells great, leaves hair and skin soft, and one bottle lasts for months!</li>
            <li>and I am sure that the right shampoo is definitely a contributor to that fact.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers up just the right amount, and it leaves my hair soft and shiny and clean.  </li>
            <li>All three come in a white plastic bottle with a flip top.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, the product works great even on my long (waist length) hair.  </li>
            <li>The only thing to remember is there is not an anesthetic in this, so be sure not to get it in your baby&#x27;s eyes!&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li>I would love larger sizes with pumps!</li>
            <li>and I had to hurry back to Amazon and order more of this.</li>
            <li>Smooth, soft hair</li>
            <li>Stench is incredible and we think our son is allergic as he developed scabbiness on his head shortly after starting this.</li>
            <li>(make sure I use enough, also pouring the product into a washcloth first and then rubbing the cloth before soaping the baby).  </li>
            <li>I believe this is my first review on amazon</li>
            <li>Sweet Baby Organics is a relatively new company).  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling soft and clean, and the tropical scent is pleasant but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>The scent is heavenly and it rinses clean and leaves my kids&#x27; hair shiny and soft with no visible build-up or scalp irritation.</li>
            <li>Leaves it soft and perfectly clean.</li>
            <li>Wow, it is really special.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is chemical-free and effective; it leaves my thick hair clean, manageable, and frizz-free.</li>
            <li>We just ordered our second bottle and will not stray from sweet baby products!</li>
            <li>Does not dry out your hair since it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li>use the Sweet Pear Baby scent, it&#x27;s a nice subtle scent.  </li>
            <li>I was ready to give up on ever finding a shampoo I could use on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>The whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>The unscented smells really \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; but really has otherwise no scent</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot of the product.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I really like this gentle organic shampoo.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was contacted immediately by the company and offered a free, unscented bottle to try because another person had a similar experience.</li>
            <li>The coconut scent is not over powering and leaves hair soft, not greasy and smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this shampoo!</li>
            <li>I really dig the smell too.</li>
            <li>For an unscented, natural style product, this is my current favorite.</li>
            <li>Right away I noticed how soft my hair was, I didn&#x27;t even have to use a conditioner.  </li>
            <li>She took my concerns seriously and is currently looking into re-packaging (caps, bottles and seals) her products more effectively.  </li>
            <li>In my original review I wrote that the product didn&#x27;t lather very well and also that the smell didn&#x27;t linger that long.  </li>
            <li>I have been also trying to find a chem free shampoo for a long time especially since I&#x27;m trying to get pregnant.</li>
            <li>We have been searching high and low (doing a ton of research on bath products), trying multiple products and brands, mostly claimed \\&quot;safe\\&quot;, \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;organic\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>After discovering that I am highly allergic to sulphates, I became a faithful reader of labels.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably just stick with other sulfate free shampoos that I can pick up at the store, this one didn&#x27;t really blow me away for the price, etc...</li>
            <li>When I started looking for sulfate-free shampoos, I was surprised by how many had other problematic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I bought the tropical scent and my little kids seem to love it, too.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t rated too bad, but I wanted to find something that was rated the best it could be.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and gentle.</li>
            <li>The product my dermatologist prescribed didn&#x27;t lather worth a darn and left my hair parched and brittle.  </li>
            <li>And I love the fact it doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals in it!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>and wow!  It lathers so well</li>
            <li>(if tangly is a word) and this shampoo leaves her hair and skin so soft!</li>
            <li>I tried many other shampoos and they only aggravated the problem.</li>
            <li>The scent is AMAZING and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an African American adult that was looking for a sulfate free shampoo for my natural style hair....</li>
            <li>I ran out of my Sweet Baby Shampoo and bought a well known brand in the grocery store the other day</li>
            <li>It took me awhile to dial in how much I should use each time I wash my hair (I was initially using too little, so my hair would still feel greasy after washing), but I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and now only wash my hair 1-2 times each week, which is great.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to move away from sulfate ridden shampoos, and spent six months trying various cowashes, sulfate free shampoos, no-poo methods, even shampoo bars.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>The tropical scent smells coconuty, which surprised me because coconut is a separate scent....</li>
            <li>I switched from a very expense salon product that was making my scalp red and itchy.</li>
            <li>It lathers very well and it appears that the 8 oz bottle will last quite awhile.</li>
            <li>His scalp is moisturized and his hair is so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s now 9 months and we&#x27;ve been using sweet baby shampoo for the past 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>Yes, other products have done some things better, but I usually have one or two complaints.</li>
            <li>One bottle came with the seal missing in its center; a second bottle&#x27;s seal came off as soon as I opened the top; and the last one was sealed well.  </li>
            <li>My 3 year old son has very sensitive skin and other shampoo brands (which apparently contain harmful ingredients) caused skin problems for him.</li>
            <li>They have a adult version shampoo but believe it&#x27;s the same shampoo as this, just a different bottle in a larger size called Paradise Island.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, so it is well worth the cost.</li>

            <li> Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the coconut before, and it smells buttery and delicious like coconut cake.</li>
            <li> Beautiful!</li>
            <li> I bought this in the tropical scent (I believe that was the name) it smells great!</li>
            <li> But, the best part about this wash is that it&#x27;s all-natural.  </li>
            <li> This kid&#x27;s shampoo is awesome.</li>
            <li> I like coconut the best.</li>
            <li> My hair is in the best condition it has ever been since I switched to this shampoo 6 months ago.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m impressed by the integrity of this company.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo!</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and even though it is Baby Shampoo</li>
            <li> and it smells wonderful (tropical).</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed by the care the owner exhibited for her customers.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll also try the pear to see which I like best.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who&#x27;s been on the hunt for organic baby shampoo knows the scents you&#x27;ll find out there are sometimes not so delicious.</li>
            <li> This one is delightful.</li>
            <li> We are SO happy we switched!</li>
            <li> Beautiful product!  </li>

            <li> and it is perfect for both naturally perfect wavy hair and super curly frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> But because i heard the coconut is more moisturizing which may work best for my daughters eczema.</li>
            <li> &amp; not because i don&#x27;t love the scent of the tropical one cause let me to tell you it smells amazing!!</li>

            <li> This smells so good....</li>
            <li> We get the Tropical Baby scent, and it smells SO good....</li>
            <li> The price is good for the quality of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> but since using this shampoo his hair smells really good after sweating.</li>
            <li> Both are good products</li>
            <li> but I really loved the unscented one.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li> The owner of the company took the time to write to me to explain how to get a good lather out of the product</li>
            <li> Whether you&#x27;re a Beautiful Baby or a Beautiful Babe, I recommend Sweet Baby Organics Shampoo for you.</li>
            <li> It feels very healthy and has a lot of shine.</li>
            <li> i tried their tropical baby(for myself), and am very satisfied with the product.</li>

            <li> It just smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how amazing this shampoo smells and works.  </li>
            <li> great knowing that the product is free of harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> It was a pleasure to use, nice lather, and if you can believe the label, healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells so good, but it is not at all overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is gentle on your hair &amp;amp; smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I use this product for my baby and my own bubble bath.  </li>
            <li> The vendor is great too, very nice and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Very glad it is safer than most shampoos on the market, but results are nothing to brag about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found a shampoo that is sulfate and paraben free that I don&#x27;t like but love.</li>
            <li> This product is sweet smelling and very effective on both babies and adults.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite, and I love the smell!</li>
            <li> what more can I say! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Smells great, lathers well and goes on smoothly and easily.  </li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> Given the cost of the hair, this is very important to me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mild and nice.</li>
            <li> After the latest string of disappointments, I decided on a whim to try this.  </li>
            <li> The best thing about it is that my scalp is healing, after using this product for only 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> and she was fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to how this shampoo works for babies because I don&#x27;t have one, but I love using it for myself.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was sold in more stores.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and it has a surprisingly good lather for being sulfate free.</li>
            <li> I am glad I tried this product</li>
            <li> Smells lovely.  </li>
            <li> Love the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> We absolutely love this baby shampoo.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> and my hair is shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I now realize how much better my hair and scalp feel with this shampoo...</li>
            <li> I just love this...</li>
            <li> It gives me great confidence that her company puts the same amount of care into her product and I feel good about using it on my baby.</li>
            <li> Most brands give him bumps or make him itchy.  </li>
            <li> We bought tropical baby and love the smell.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> need more words.  </li>
            <li> we love it.</li>
            <li> we want more of it.</li>
            <li> What a joy to find this new product line!  </li>
            <li> Not any more since we&#x27;ve switched to sweet baby!</li>
            <li> Happy to find a wash that&#x27;s free of all of the junk that still smells fresh and clean and like a baby.</li>
            <li> Please make the bubble gum scent available year around as it is my favorite.</li>
            <li> With all the great reviews and the fact that this shampoo is supposed to be natural</li>
            <li> Her hair is so soft and silky and smells great.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, it feels so good to use the safest, mildest product I could possibly use on my daughter and know that she&#x27;s not irritated any more!</li>
            <li> Super gentle and smells great.  </li>
            <li> What a relief this Sweet Baby Shampoo is!</li>
            <li> I use it to clean many things in my food prep area as well as my hair.</li>
            <li> My toddlers like tropical baby and angel baby (smells like really strong baby powder).  </li>
            <li> I love my Angel Baby shampoo by Sweet Baby Organics.  </li>
            <li> I ordered my first bottle in the 8-oz. size to make sure I would be able to use it without problems.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my very,very baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> and I still have tons of volume on my normally fine hair.</li>
            <li> Ok so first off I don&#x27;t like the smell of baby powder so now that I have a baby (supa cute 4month boy)</li>
            <li> We have tried many brands of baby wash/shampoo over the last 2 years and have found this one to be the best by far.  </li>
            <li> One of those spontaneous purchases that really paid off.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I declined the free bottle because the boys like a scented bath before bed time</li>
            <li> I look everywhere for products that smell more fresh or fruity.  </li>
            <li> It is so smooth and creamy, and cleans baby skin with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s such a great product I hope the price doesn&#x27;t go up</li>
            <li> vacuum lol</li>
            <li> My hair has the healthy and shiny appearance that many sulfate free shampoo&#x27;s claim, and keeps getting better with regular use.</li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers up really nicely, gives my hair a soft and manageable texture, and best of all---I&#x27;m seeing little or no breakage now.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This shampoo is super gentle, doubles as a body wash, and smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> The unscented has a white flip top; angel baby has a gold flip top; and tropical baby has a silver flip top.  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and body wash so much!</li>
            <li> Therefore I was pleased when after the first use...</li>
            <li> Even I use it because I love the scent so much!</li>
            <li> or I won&#x27;t be able to afford to buy it consistently.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s healthy and I love knowing that this company is supporting the needs of us who seek the most natural products for our family and our earth.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair fresh clean and no bad things in ingredients!  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, our whole family can use this shampoo/soap.  </li>
            <li> and I appreciate how clean my hair feels after using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried various natural/organic baby shampoos and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Aside from the packaging, the actual product is by far the best natural, organic, non-toxic, safe, effective and clean smelling shampoo and soap I could find (for my toddlers, myself and my very scent-sensitive husband).  </li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the higher price tag when you get this many pluses.</li>
            <li> I tried this product as a result of my ongoing search for a shampoo I can love, and is also gentle on/good for my hair.  </li>
            <li> After comparing the array of SLS-free products on Amazon and reading through all the customer feedback, I decided to order Sweet Baby Organics Shampoo in Angel Baby</li>
            <li> What we&#x27;ve learned is that many of these products really are not as they claim.  </li>
            <li> The vanilla scent is too sweet smelling for me.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use Sweet Baby Shampoo.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I discovered sweet baby.</li>
            <li> I got the tropical scent and love it just as much as the pear.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very gentle, a lil goes a long way and it it smells great (tropical).</li>
            <li> My husband and I like the tropical baby scent (smells of mild coconut, mango and pineapple).  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;After switching to sulfate free shampoo, I&#x27;ve been experimenting with different brands looking for the &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34;factor, this was a spontaneous purchase.</li>
            <li> I have super oily hair/scalp and this shampoo is a miracle for me.</li>
            <li> I love that we can use this and feel good about what is or isn&#x27;t being absorbed into our little ones&#x27; skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using other all natural products and nothing really impressed me until i bought this.</li>
            <li> I got the tropical smell and it is absolutely divine!!</li>
            <li> My daughter calls it her angel shampoo and it convinced it must be what angels really smell like!!</li>
            <li> And, I love the natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> BUT the scent is mild, a little fruity and very nice.  </li>
            <li> The smell is lovely, I&#x27;ll give it that, but my nephew ended up with a huge, red rash on his belly after using it.</li>
            <li> I also love how truly natural this product is, many others claim to be natural and/or organic</li>
            <li> Better yet, it leaves my hair soft, shiny, and smelling of vanilla and babies.  </li>
            <li> Lathers ok &amp; leaves hair shiny &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> After my 4 year old toddlers dropped the bottle once, the flip top shattered; and now after about 3 months use (not allowing my kids to operate the flip tops or bottles themselves)</li>
            <li> It cleans well and leaves my extensions (and my hair) soft, healthy and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love that it&#x27;s all natural too.</li>
            <li> I bought the Tropical Baby scent, it smells just like fresh coconut.</li>
            <li> Smells just right</li>
            <li> Since it has better ingredients than many other shampoos, it&#x27;s the way to go!</li>
            <li> It lathers extremely well, smells great, leaves hair and skin soft, and one bottle lasts for months!</li>
            <li> and I am sure that the right shampoo is definitely a contributor to that fact.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers up just the right amount, and it leaves my hair soft and shiny and clean.  </li>
            <li> All three come in a white plastic bottle with a flip top.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, the product works great even on my long (waist length) hair.  </li>
            <li> The only thing to remember is there is not an anesthetic in this, so be sure not to get it in your baby&#x27;s eyes!&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li> I would love larger sizes with pumps!</li>
            <li> and I had to hurry back to Amazon and order more of this.</li>
            <li> Smooth, soft hair</li>
            <li> Stench is incredible and we think our son is allergic as he developed scabbiness on his head shortly after starting this.</li>
            <li> (make sure I use enough, also pouring the product into a washcloth first and then rubbing the cloth before soaping the baby).  </li>
            <li> I believe this is my first review on amazon</li>
            <li> Sweet Baby Organics is a relatively new company).  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling soft and clean, and the tropical scent is pleasant but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> The scent is heavenly and it rinses clean and leaves my kids&#x27; hair shiny and soft with no visible build-up or scalp irritation.</li>
            <li> Leaves it soft and perfectly clean.</li>
            <li> Wow, it is really special.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is chemical-free and effective; it leaves my thick hair clean, manageable, and frizz-free.</li>
            <li> We just ordered our second bottle and will not stray from sweet baby products!</li>
            <li> Does not dry out your hair since it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li> use the Sweet Pear Baby scent, it&#x27;s a nice subtle scent.  </li>
            <li> I was ready to give up on ever finding a shampoo I could use on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> The whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> The unscented smells really \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; but really has otherwise no scent</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot of the product.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I really like this gentle organic shampoo.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was contacted immediately by the company and offered a free, unscented bottle to try because another person had a similar experience.</li>
            <li> The coconut scent is not over powering and leaves hair soft, not greasy and smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I really dig the smell too.</li>
            <li> For an unscented, natural style product, this is my current favorite.</li>
            <li> Right away I noticed how soft my hair was, I didn&#x27;t even have to use a conditioner.  </li>
            <li> She took my concerns seriously and is currently looking into re-packaging (caps, bottles and seals) her products more effectively.  </li>
            <li> In my original review I wrote that the product didn&#x27;t lather very well and also that the smell didn&#x27;t linger that long.  </li>
            <li> I have been also trying to find a chem free shampoo for a long time especially since I&#x27;m trying to get pregnant.</li>
            <li> We have been searching high and low (doing a ton of research on bath products), trying multiple products and brands, mostly claimed \\&quot;safe\\&quot;, \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;organic\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> After discovering that I am highly allergic to sulphates, I became a faithful reader of labels.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably just stick with other sulfate free shampoos that I can pick up at the store, this one didn&#x27;t really blow me away for the price, etc...</li>
            <li> When I started looking for sulfate-free shampoos, I was surprised by how many had other problematic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I bought the tropical scent and my little kids seem to love it, too.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t rated too bad, but I wanted to find something that was rated the best it could be.</li>
            <li> It is so soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> The product my dermatologist prescribed didn&#x27;t lather worth a darn and left my hair parched and brittle.  </li>
            <li> And I love the fact it doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals in it!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> and wow!  It lathers so well</li>
            <li> (if tangly is a word) and this shampoo leaves her hair and skin so soft!</li>
            <li> I tried many other shampoos and they only aggravated the problem.</li>
            <li> The scent is AMAZING and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American adult that was looking for a sulfate free shampoo for my natural style hair....</li>
            <li> I ran out of my Sweet Baby Shampoo and bought a well known brand in the grocery store the other day</li>
            <li> It took me awhile to dial in how much I should use each time I wash my hair (I was initially using too little, so my hair would still feel greasy after washing), but I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and now only wash my hair 1-2 times each week, which is great.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to move away from sulfate ridden shampoos, and spent six months trying various cowashes, sulfate free shampoos, no-poo methods, even shampoo bars.  </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> The tropical scent smells coconuty, which surprised me because coconut is a separate scent....</li>
            <li> I switched from a very expense salon product that was making my scalp red and itchy.</li>
            <li> It lathers very well and it appears that the 8 oz bottle will last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> His scalp is moisturized and his hair is so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s now 9 months and we&#x27;ve been using sweet baby shampoo for the past 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Yes, other products have done some things better, but I usually have one or two complaints.</li>
            <li> One bottle came with the seal missing in its center; a second bottle&#x27;s seal came off as soon as I opened the top; and the last one was sealed well.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old son has very sensitive skin and other shampoo brands (which apparently contain harmful ingredients) caused skin problems for him.</li>
            <li> They have a adult version shampoo but believe it&#x27;s the same shampoo as this, just a different bottle in a larger size called Paradise Island.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so it is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> but in reality contain some pretty harsh ingredients that are definitely not natural or organic.</li>
            <li> It is definitely not tear free, but all that&#x27;s required is a little extra care around your little one&#x27;s eyes and all is well!</li>
            <li> It does not irritate my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin, and I don&#x27;t have to worry that I&#x27;m bathing her in chemicals like with other brands.</li>
            <li> I looked up every single ingredient in EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database (the actual product is not yet in their database--</li>
            <li> My Russian hair extensions are lasting extremely well</li>
            <li> strangely her hair hasn&#x27;t collected any fuzz since using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My son developed a small patch of cradle cap when he was a few months old.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather as well as traditional shampoos, but I can definitely get a little lather going</li>
            <li> definitely try the other scents as well.</li>
            <li> Oh, and I was worried about her eyes possibly being irritated based on some other reviews, but nope.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find anything that cleaned my hair and didn&#x27;t irritate my scalp HORRIBLY or dry my hair out, except for rye flour</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out their skin or irritate their eczema.</li>
            <li> I have used common, non-organic products without problems but you never know how a person will react to something new.</li>
            <li> Drugstore scalp shampoos drained my wallet, dried my hair AND my scalp, and left my hair reeking of tar.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any gross smell a few days after washing.</li>
            <li> , I only need to shampoo once; no more lather/rinse/repeat cycle for me, Baby.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a need to use a conditioner or any other product.  </li>
            <li> I like when they put no parabens and other chemicals not in this item.</li>
            <li> but it seems to work for a lot of other families.</li>
            <li> No problem, though, because a little bit goes a long way!!!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is thick, which means only a little is needed.  </li>
            <li> After just one use in the shower the label peeled and eventually shredded into a disasterous paper mess.  </li>
            <li> Then again if it did, it might not clean as well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really messy.  </li>
            <li> I have found others to be too harsh and drying on my baby boys skin.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell, the lather and the fact that there aren&#x27;t nasty chemicals in it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like something was irritating her down there.</li>
            <li> Wish it were tear-free, since it&#x27;s so hard to avoid the eye area every time on a wiggly toddler.</li>
            <li> I mean, she was a &amp;#34;crawling/walking&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Usually when my son&#x27;s head gets sweaty he just stinks</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d splurge and get this expensive shampoo/body wash for when my nephews visit.</li>
            <li> Fail.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Smell is bad, it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair always had terrible tangles in it after washing, even with using a spray in conditioner.  </li>

            <li> Has a great smell.  I use it to clean many things in my food prep area as well as my hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this product as a result of my ongoing search for a shampoo I can love, and is also gentle on/good for my hair.  After the latest string of disappointments, I decided on a whim to try this.  Wow, it is really special.  Right away I noticed how soft my hair was, I didn&#x27;t even have to use a conditioner.  It was a pleasure to use, nice lather, and if you can believe the label, healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, this is not just for babies, but next time I plan to try their grown-up version of shampoo, just to see what it&#x27;s like.</li>
            <li> This smells so good....I got the tropical scent! And I love the fact it doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals in it! A+</li>
            <li> Wow!  I love my Angel Baby shampoo by Sweet Baby Organics.  I needed a hypoallergenic shampoo after developing eczema on my scalp.  The product my dermatologist prescribed didn&#x27;t lather worth a darn and left my hair parched and brittle.  Drugstore scalp shampoos drained my wallet, dried my hair AND my scalp, and left my hair reeking of tar.  Turns out the ingredients in those shampoos were contributing to my misery.  After comparing the array of SLS-free products on Amazon and reading through all the customer feedback, I decided to order Sweet Baby Organics Shampoo in Angel Baby and wow!  It lathers so well, I only need to shampoo once; no more lather/rinse/repeat cycle for me, Baby.  Better yet, it leaves my hair soft, shiny, and smelling of vanilla and babies.  Whether you&#x27;re a Beautiful Baby or a Beautiful Babe, I recommend Sweet Baby Organics Shampoo for you.</li>
            <li> I was ready to give up on ever finding a shampoo I could use on my scalp.  After discovering that I am highly allergic to sulphates, I became a faithful reader of labels.  What a joy to find this new product line!  I ordered my first bottle in the 8-oz. size to make sure I would be able to use it without problems.  I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT!!!  I bought the Tropical Baby scent, which reminds me of Hawaii.  It smells so good, but it is not at all overwhelming.  The best thing about it is that my scalp is healing, after using this product for only 2 weeks.  The shampoo lathers up just the right amount, and it leaves my hair soft and shiny and clean.  I have already purchased another bottle in the 16-oz. size, and my husband is now using this shampoo, too!  TRY IT, YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Smell is bad, it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Very nice shampoo. Lathers ok &amp; leaves hair shiny &amp; soft. I use it on my very,very baby fine hair. Does not dry out your hair since it is sulfate free. I will buy it again</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!! The whole family uses it. No problem, though, because a little bit goes a long way!!! I got the tropical smell and it is absolutely divine!! My daughter calls it her angel shampoo and it convinced it must be what angels really smell like!! Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my kiddos.  I&#x27;ve purchased the coconut before, and it smells buttery and delicious like coconut cake. This time I decided to buy the Pear scent.  Beautiful! Smells a lot like pears, berries, and something else I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on...sparkles maybe? It just smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the tropical scent (I believe that was the name) it smells great! I haven&#x27;t noticed any gross smell a few days after washing. I would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I wanted to move away from sulfate ridden shampoos, and spent six months trying various cowashes, sulfate free shampoos, no-poo methods, even shampoo bars.  I couldn&#x27;t find anything that cleaned my hair and didn&#x27;t irritate my scalp HORRIBLY or dry my hair out, except for rye flour and it&#x27;s really messy.  This stuff is great.  Leaves my hair feeling soft and clean, and the tropical scent is pleasant but not overwhelming.  The only downside is that my scalp doesn&#x27;t like me skipping shampoo days so I do need to keep coconut oil treatments in my regimen as this doesn&#x27;t have tea tree oil or enough coconut oil to control my dermatitis.  Then again if it did, it might not clean as well.</li>
            <li> I tried all three scents: unscented, angel baby and tropical baby.  All three come in a white plastic bottle with a flip top.  The unscented has a white flip top; angel baby has a gold flip top; and tropical baby has a silver flip top.  The flip tops are quite flimsly.  After my 4 year old toddlers dropped the bottle once, the flip top shattered; and now after about 3 months use (not allowing my kids to operate the flip tops or bottles themselves) the hinges on the tops have come apart.  The label on the bottle is also not waterproof.  After just one use in the shower the label peeled and eventually shredded into a disasterous paper mess.  The biggest concern I had was the foil seal.  One bottle came with the seal missing in its center; a second bottle&#x27;s seal came off as soon as I opened the top; and the last one was sealed well.  I contacted the owner of the company and she was fantastic!  She took my concerns seriously and is currently looking into re-packaging (caps, bottles and seals) her products more effectively.  Aside from the packaging, the actual product is by far the best natural, organic, non-toxic, safe, effective and clean smelling shampoo and soap I could find (for my toddlers, myself and my very scent-sensitive husband).  Both my and my husband&#x27;s sides of the family are prone to skin sensitivities, allergies and cancer.  We have been searching high and low (doing a ton of research on bath products), trying multiple products and brands, mostly claimed \\&quot;safe\\&quot;, \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;organic\\&quot;.  What we&#x27;ve learned is that many of these products really are not as they claim.  I looked up every single ingredient in EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database (the actual product is not yet in their database--Sweet Baby Organics is a relatively new company).  There is nothing in this product that isn&#x27;t truly \\&quot;good\\&quot; for you.  Most importantly, our whole family can use this shampoo/soap.  My husband and I like the tropical baby scent (smells of mild coconut, mango and pineapple).  My toddlers like tropical baby and angel baby (smells like really strong baby powder).  The unscented smells really \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; but really has otherwise no scent (I like using it to wash my handwashables).  Lastly, the product works great even on my long (waist length) hair.  It leaves my hair soft and clean.  I don&#x27;t have a need to use a conditioner or any other product.  I also like that I can use this shampoo as a body wash.  It lathers well and I don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot of the product.</li>
            <li> Super gentle and smells great.  Happy to find a wash that&#x27;s free of all of the junk that still smells fresh and clean and like a baby.</li>
            <li> We have tried many brands of baby wash/shampoo over the last 2 years and have found this one to be the best by far.  We get the Tropical Baby scent, and it smells SO good....just enough hint of coconut. But, the best part about this wash is that it&#x27;s all-natural.  It does not irritate my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin, and I don&#x27;t have to worry that I&#x27;m bathing her in chemicals like with other brands. The only thing to remember is there is not an anesthetic in this, so be sure not to get it in your baby&#x27;s eyes!&lt;br /&gt;Buy this....you won&#x27;t regret it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and body wash so much! It is so soft and gentle. I have found others to be too harsh and drying on my baby boys skin.  He has never had a rash from this product.  We use the unscented one.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to how this shampoo works for babies because I don&#x27;t have one, but I love using it for myself.  When I started looking for sulfate-free shampoos, I was surprised by how many had other problematic ingredients.  I decided to give this one a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did!  It took me awhile to dial in how much I should use each time I wash my hair (I was initially using too little, so my hair would still feel greasy after washing), but I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and now only wash my hair 1-2 times each week, which is great.  I use it shampoo closer to the roots of my hair, and then condition the ends.  I really like this shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t lather as well as traditional shampoos, but I can definitely get a little lather going and I appreciate how clean my hair feels after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Sweet Pear Baby scent, it&#x27;s a nice subtle scent.  I quite like it!</li>
            <li> We love Sweet Baby products and this shampoo is excellent. The scent is heavenly and it rinses clean and leaves my kids&#x27; hair shiny and soft with no visible build-up or scalp irritation. I love that we can use this and feel good about what is or isn&#x27;t being absorbed into our little ones&#x27; skin. Really great stuff and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The price is good for the quality of this shampoo. This is my favorite, and I love the smell! Wish it was sold in more stores.</li>
            <li> This kid&#x27;s shampoo is awesome. It smells fantastic and it has a surprisingly good lather for being sulfate free. I will be ordering another bottle but this time for me instead of the kiddo&#x27;s. I am glad I tried this product and I plan to try one of each scent.</li>
            <li> The package was open when it arrived. No biggie. Things happen. As for the shampoo itself, it is alright. It makes my hair feel kind of dirty after washing. I&#x27;d probably just stick with other sulfate free shampoos that I can pick up at the store, this one didn&#x27;t really blow me away for the price, etc...</li>
            <li> I really like this gentle organic shampoo.  It makes baby&#x27;s hair shiny and manageable.  Smells lovely.  I like coconut the best.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo.  Especially the bubble gum scent &amp;amp; Tropical scent. The vanilla scent is too sweet smelling for me.  The shampoo is gentle on your hair &amp;amp; smells wonderful.  I color my hair and it does not strip my color out. My hair is in the best condition it has ever been since I switched to this shampoo 6 months ago. Also use as a body wash. Love love love it! Please make the bubble gum scent available year around as it is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Always looking for organic items. The product is good.this was given as a gift. I like when they put no parabens and other chemicals not in this item.</li>
            <li> I use this for myself as well as the baby. It cleans without stripping your hair. Leaves it soft and perfectly clean.</li>
            <li> We absolutely love this baby shampoo. My 3 year old son has very sensitive skin and other shampoo brands (which apparently contain harmful ingredients) caused skin problems for him. This shampoo is super gentle, doubles as a body wash, and smells AMAZING. My son smells like a pina colada! Absolutely worth the higher price tag when you get this many pluses.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a while for my hair extensions.  It cleans well and leaves my extensions (and my hair) soft, healthy and manageable.  My Russian hair extensions are lasting extremely well and I am sure that the right shampoo is definitely a contributor to that fact.  Given the cost of the hair, this is very important to me.  I will continue to use Sweet Baby Shampoo.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;After switching to sulfate free shampoo, I&#x27;ve been experimenting with different brands looking for the &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34;factor, this was a spontaneous purchase. Therefore I was pleased when after the first use...Wow. My hair has the healthy and shiny appearance that many sulfate free shampoo&#x27;s claim, and keeps getting better with regular use. One of those spontaneous purchases that really paid off.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> With all the great reviews and the fact that this shampoo is supposed to be natural I thought I&#x27;d splurge and get this expensive shampoo/body wash for when my nephews visit. The smell is lovely, I&#x27;ll give it that, but my nephew ended up with a huge, red rash on his belly after using it. He was even in tears because it hurt to touch. Maybe it&#x27;s just him but this product did not work for us and I will not be purchasing it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was contacted immediately by the company and offered a free, unscented bottle to try because another person had a similar experience. They believe it to be an allergic reaction to one of the fruit extracts. I have used common, non-organic products without problems but you never know how a person will react to something new. I appreciate the time and effort this company puts into its customer service so for that I give them 5 stars. The product didn&#x27;t work for us but it seems to work for a lot of other families. I declined the free bottle because the boys like a scented bath before bed time but I&#x27;m impressed by the integrity of this company.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how amazing this shampoo smells and works.  I use it on both of my kids who have very different hair and it is perfect for both naturally perfect wavy hair and super curly frizzy hair.  The smell is out of this world too and lasts for days.  Usually when my son&#x27;s head gets sweaty he just stinks but since using this shampoo his hair smells really good after sweating.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! It&#x27;s healthy and I love knowing that this company is supporting the needs of us who seek the most natural products for our family and our earth. The coconut scent is not over powering and leaves hair soft, not greasy and smelling fresh. Awesome for baby fine hair, doesn&#x27;t leave it all tangled. I also bought the coconut baby lotion. Household faves now! I would love larger sizes with pumps!</li>
            <li> I tried the tropical shampoo and the unscented one. Both are good products but I really loved the unscented one.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely try the other scents as well.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my baby and my own bubble bath.  The tropical scent smells coconuty, which surprised me because coconut is a separate scent....BUT the scent is mild, a little fruity and very nice.  The shampoo is thick, which means only a little is needed.  I&#x27;ve already ordered the pear to try.</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughter who has eczema and tangly curly hair...(if tangly is a word) and this shampoo leaves her hair and skin so soft! I absolutely love that it&#x27;s all natural too. I&#x27;ve tried using other all natural products and nothing really impressed me until i bought this. I bought the tropical baby scent but i think i&#x27;ll be trying the coconut next. &amp; not because i don&#x27;t love the scent of the tropical one cause let me to tell you it smells amazing!! But because i heard the coconut is more moisturizing which may work best for my daughters eczema. I will be trying their lotion as well. I only wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey but i guess you get what you pay for in this case.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair always had terrible tangles in it after washing, even with using a spray in conditioner.  Since we&#x27;ve switched to this shampoo we don&#x27;t even use conditioner!  Her hair is so soft and silky and smells great.  Definitely a fan!</li>
            <li> I love the smell, the lather and the fact that there aren&#x27;t nasty chemicals in it! We will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product. I bought the tropical scent and my little kids seem to love it, too. Doesn&#x27;t dry out their skin or irritate their eczema. And, I love the natural ingredients! Even I use it because I love the scent so much!</li>
            <li> Love! Smells sooooo good! Wish they made a matching conditioner .</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo! I have been looking for a shampoo without parabens, etc.. and found this on Amazon &amp; thought I would give it a try &amp; I love it! It smells wonderful and even though it is Baby Shampoo I use it and my hair looks and smells great. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is chemical-free and effective; it leaves my thick hair clean, manageable, and frizz-free. It feels very healthy and has a lot of shine.</li>
            <li> and my hair is shiny and healthy. All without all those nasty ingredients none of us need. I switched from a very expense salon product that was making my scalp red and itchy. What a relief this Sweet Baby Shampoo is! I am now updating my editing. I ran out of my Sweet Baby Shampoo and bought a well known brand in the grocery store the other day and I had to hurry back to Amazon and order more of this. I now realize how much better my hair and scalp feel with this shampoo...and I still have tons of volume on my normally fine hair. About 3 days a week I add an oil to my ends because I have a oily scalp, and I never need conditioner. I just love this...what more can I say! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I like this shampoo....I&#x27;m an African American adult that was looking for a sulfate free shampoo for my natural style hair....and I&#x27;ve found it. This shampoo lathers up really nicely, gives my hair a soft and manageable texture, and best of all---I&#x27;m seeing little or no breakage now.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This product is sweet smelling and very effective on both babies and adults. You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I have tried various natural/organic baby shampoos and this one is by far the best. It lathers extremely well, smells great, leaves hair and skin soft, and one bottle lasts for months! It is definitely not tear free, but all that&#x27;s required is a little extra care around your little one&#x27;s eyes and all is well! I also love how truly natural this product is, many others claim to be natural and/or organic but in reality contain some pretty harsh ingredients that are definitely not natural or organic. I would highly recommend this shampoo!</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo that I will ever use for my children from now on! Smooth, soft hair and it smells wonderful (tropical). Not to mention, my daughter has the kind of hair that collects fuzz - it washes out dirt magnificently! ANDDDDD strangely her hair hasn&#x27;t collected any fuzz since using this shampoo. Coincidence? No complaints there! I mean, she was a &amp;#34;crawling/walking&amp;#34; vacuum lol so I&#x27;m thankful</li>
            <li> Stench is incredible and we think our son is allergic as he developed scabbiness on his head shortly after starting this. We swapped back to California baby and it took several washes to get the smell out from the tropical baby scent. Fail.</li>
            <li> In my original review I wrote that the product didn&#x27;t lather very well and also that the smell didn&#x27;t linger that long.  The owner of the company took the time to write to me to explain how to get a good lather out of the product (make sure I use enough, also pouring the product into a washcloth first and then rubbing the cloth before soaping the baby).  She also wrote to me about how in order to meet the requirements for organics they need to control the amount of scent they put in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed by the care the owner exhibited for her customers.  It gives me great confidence that her company puts the same amount of care into her product and I feel good about using it on my baby.</li>
            <li> Ok so first off I don&#x27;t like the smell of baby powder so now that I have a baby (supa cute 4month boy) I look everywhere for products that smell more fresh or fruity.  Also since my husband is allergic to everything my lil man is allergic is close to everything... Most brands give him bumps or make him itchy.  This shampoo is very gentle, a lil goes a long way and it it smells great (tropical). I think I&#x27;ll also try the pear to see which I like best.  The vendor is great too, very nice and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so it is well worth the cost. It is so smooth and creamy, and cleans baby skin with no irritation. I really dig the smell too.</li>
            <li> Anyone who&#x27;s been on the hunt for organic baby shampoo knows the scents you&#x27;ll find out there are sometimes not so delicious. This one is delightful. I bought the Tropical Baby scent, it smells just like fresh coconut. It lathers very well and it appears that the 8 oz bottle will last quite awhile. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the Angel Baby scent when this one runs out!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for about 2 months now. I&#x27;m so happy I found a shampoo that is sulfate and paraben free that I don&#x27;t like but love. I have super oily hair/scalp and this shampoo is a miracle for me. I have been also trying to find a chem free shampoo for a long time especially since I&#x27;m trying to get pregnant. It smells great and lathers well too. Since it&#x27;s such a great product I hope the price doesn&#x27;t go up or I won&#x27;t be able to afford to buy it consistently. They have a adult version shampoo but believe it&#x27;s the same shampoo as this, just a different bottle in a larger size called Paradise Island.</li>
            <li> I believe this is my first review on amazon, that&#x27;s how much I love this stuff! We were using Burt&#x27;s bees shampoo and burt&#x27;s bees bubble bath for our daughter since birth. She&#x27;s now 9 months and we&#x27;ve been using sweet baby shampoo for the past 6 weeks. We are SO happy we switched! My daughter had always had a habit of scratching at her crotch during and after her baths while we were putting her pajamas on. It&#x27;s like something was irritating her down there. Not any more since we&#x27;ve switched to sweet baby! I wondered if there was an ingredient in Burt&#x27;s bees that was bothering her, so I looked on the environmental working group website that provides ratings of the health safety of ingredients in products. Burt&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t rated too bad, but I wanted to find something that was rated the best it could be. That&#x27;s when I discovered sweet baby. After reading the reviews on here, I was sold. We bought tropical baby and love the smell. It&#x27;s very mild and nice. We just ordered our second bottle and will not stray from sweet baby products! I&#x27;m actually using it on myself to shampoo my hair and it&#x27;s the softest it&#x27;s ever been! Most importantly, it feels so good to use the safest, mildest product I could possibly use on my daughter and know that she&#x27;s not irritated any more! Oh, and I was worried about her eyes possibly being irritated based on some other reviews, but nope. Not once!</li>
            <li> My son developed a small patch of cradle cap when he was a few months old. I tried many other shampoos and they only aggravated the problem. I tried this in the pear scent and it got rid of the flakes after several baths. His scalp is moisturized and his hair is so soft and shiny. The scent is AMAZING and a little goes a long way. I was only about halfway done with the bottle, but couldn&#x27;t resist buying another one. I got the tropical scent and love it just as much as the pear. They are both so fruity without any chemical smell. The tropical seems to linger longer than the pear though. I washed his hair 2 days ago and I can still smell it. None of us can stop sniffing his head. I also use it as a body wash and he has no issues with breakouts. LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a repeat customer. need i say more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ok. need more words.  we like it. we love it. we want more of it.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different shampoos over the years. For an unscented, natural style product, this is my current favorite. Yes, other products have done some things better, but I usually have one or two complaints. This works for me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo got rave reviews, though we just found it &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.  Very glad it is safer than most shampoos on the market, but results are nothing to brag about.</li>
            <li> I have used hundreds of Shampoo&#x27;s, nothing compare to these Shampoos and Body washes.  I want the lotion I want more of everything!  It leaves your hair fresh clean and no bad things in ingredients!  Made my scalp quit itching.  When they get this back I am buying it for my Dogs and friends.  You must try!  Beautiful product!  My Dog loves to smell my hair and so do they guys!&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE UPDATE; BUBBLE GUM IS AWFUL YUCK</li>
            <li> Smells great, lathers well and goes on smoothly and easily.  Wish it were tear-free, since it&#x27;s so hard to avoid the eye area every time on a wiggly toddler.</li>
            <li> i tried their tropical baby(for myself), and am very satisfied with the product. Smells just right and it makes me feel great knowing that the product is free of harmful chemicals. I will keep using this product for myself and my (future) babies.</li>
            <li> This smells great and gets the job done. Since it has better ingredients than many other shampoos, it&#x27;s the way to go! My kids have no issues with it either, will buy again.</li>
