            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>The adaptor took about a week to be delivered, but once it arrived it was a perfect fit and works fine.</li>
            <li>The Euro Plug adapter may come in handy yet.</li>
            <li>good as the original adapter.</li>
            <li>Love Amazon because you can find almost anything you want and ordering is so easy!</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t have to replace my Norelco.</li>
            <li>mine on vacation and would not have been able to use shaver again without a replacement AC Adapter.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>just works, can&#x27;t say any more.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find the cord so easily.</li>
            <li>i ordered this adapter and it works better than the original cord did.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>I  bought it, it works fine.  </li>
            <li>The cord is longer than the original.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m clean shaven again.</li>
            <li>A nice plus is that it also comes with a 2 round-pin adapter for overseas use and it does work on all international voltages (110V and 230V, 50/60Hz).  </li>

            <li>The power pack is a good fit and have not experienced any problems.</li>
            <li>Since it was considerably less costly than the Norelco replacement and much less than a new shaver, I considered this the best alternative.  </li>
            <li>The price is very competitive as well.</li>
            <li>thanks AMAZON you came thru again.</li>
            <li>Dog actually ate the original power adapter.</li>
            <li>Nice small adapter, I has not using my norelco shaver because my wife just trashed the adapter that came originally.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After it arrived, I found my old charger the next week!</li>

            <li> Ordered the HQRP AC adapter to replace the original Norelco unit that I left behind on a business trip.  Since it was considerably less costly than the Norelco replacement and much less than a new shaver, I considered this the best alternative.  It works well and is compact.  A nice plus is that it also comes with a 2 round-pin adapter for overseas use and it does work on all international voltages (110V and 230V, 50/60Hz).  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well my electric razor was out of batteries so I used this.  Now I can shave again.  What a miracle.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and lost the cord. Now I&#x27;m clean shaven again. I was glad to find the cord so easily.</li>
            <li> Lost the power cord of my Philips Norelco QT4070/41 Beard Trimmer 7300 during a move, and this unit works like a charm as a replacement. Glad I didn&#x27;t have to replace my Norelco.</li>
            <li> It works fine. The power pack is a good fit and have not experienced any problems. The price is very competitive as well. I would encourage others that need a power pack to buy it!</li>
            <li> Worked great. Love Amazon because you can find almost anything you want and ordering is so easy!</li>
            <li> Just the perfect replacement I needed.&lt;br /&gt;Lost mine on vacation and would not have been able to use shaver again without a replacement AC Adapter.&lt;br /&gt;As good as the original adapter.</li>
            <li> I have a shaver that uses this adapter that i have misplaced or lost in a move. i ordered this adapter and it works better than the original cord did. thanks AMAZON you came thru again.</li>
            <li> Dog actually ate the original power adapter. The razor obviously was of no use without the charger. The price was worth it.</li>
            <li> Great price and it works great. The cord is longer than the original.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item based on the picture displaying the correct end i needed. however, when it came in the mail, the end that should plug into the razor is not even close to the picture, and will not fit. not only that, but this order took a week longer than estimated to arrive. do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> The adaptor took about a week to be delivered, but once it arrived it was a perfect fit and works fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s defecrive for some reason it won&#x27;t charge the razor. I need to send it back.</li>
            <li> I have no memory of purchasing or being in the market for this product. Well, maybe I do vaguely. But my razor is charged, so I guess it worked.</li>
            <li> Nice small adapter, I has not using my norelco shaver because my wife just trashed the adapter that came originally.&lt;br /&gt;It just works, can&#x27;t say any more.</li>
            <li> This product was just what i was looking for.  Works great.  The Euro Plug adapter may come in handy yet.</li>
            <li> It is the correct cord for my Norelco electric shaver. It matched up! I plugged it in and it charges like a champ!</li>
            <li> I  bought it, it works fine.  It came when they said it would.  After it arrived, I found my old charger the next week!</li>
            <li> Replacement adapter for my electric razor (left old one behind in a hotel while traveling).  Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to, and at a cheaper cost than the OEM alternative.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t always get what you want,&lt;br /&gt;but sometimes you get what you neeeeed!&lt;br /&gt;six five four three two one</li>
            <li> We ordered this because we lost the cord that came with the Norelco.  Works great. Found our original cord the next day :)</li>
