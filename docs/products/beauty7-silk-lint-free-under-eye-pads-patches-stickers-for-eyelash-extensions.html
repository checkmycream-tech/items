            <li>Love these under eye pads for lash extensions..</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>I bought these thinking they would be better than just tape</li>
            <li>i really think that they work great at the end</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Work great good size I used to have to cut then to make a little wider</li>
            <li>The adhesive is strong so they stay put but not so strong that it hurts to remove them.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>The shape of the pads didn&#x27;t fit correctly, because of it, I got product transferring to the bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>There is no way one sticker is going to fit everyone..</li>
            <li>for the price it definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>if i couldn&#x27;t put them right</li>
            <li>they stick pretty good, be sure to pull off slowly so your not streching the undereye area!</li>
            <li>so i have to put them on my hand first and remove them</li>
            <li>The shape fits better on smaller eyes too.</li>
            <li>These work way better than the medical tape.</li>
            <li>for the price you cant beat them however they are pretty sticky for the tender skin under the eye.</li>
            <li>That wasn&#x27;t fun separating the top and bottom lashes from each other for me and for my client.</li>
            <li>Not exactly lint free, but for the price they&#x27;re cool.</li>
            <li>You need to cut them to fit all the different eye shapes!</li>
            <li>it is very sticky</li>
            <li>and it works very well.</li>
            <li>They have a good adhesive so they don&#x27;t move around during services, but especially of the client has dry/delicate skin, remove them slowly and/or apply eye cream before placing them.</li>
            <li>These are very convenient, well-shaped, and if you place them carefully, they do not need to be trimmed.</li>

            <li> are flat.  </li>
            <li> Now, I can apply lashes without my client&#x27;s eye lids sticking to the bottom lids, which is highly frustrating for any Make-Up Artist, so these are very helpful in the process of extension application!</li>
            <li> The eye pads were a little smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> The shape of the eye pad doesn&#x27;t contour to the curve of the eye, therefore it doesn&#x27;t hold all the bottom lashes down.  </li>
            <li> Not useful!</li>
            <li> Not comfortable to my clients at all.  </li>
            <li> I wasted a few sheets trying to peel off the pads.</li>
            <li> Looks like they were made specifically for eyes that are small</li>
            <li> There are several issues wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Way too sticky &amp; they&#x27;re too small.</li>
            <li> did not like it at all clients complained about the pain when pulling off the skin.</li>
            <li> and I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult removing the pads off the paper.</li>
            <li> If you get the pads off, the corners are not rounded, making it uncomfortable for the client.</li>
            <li> Horrible, will NOT ever buy again.</li>
            <li> Removing the pads was terrible.</li>

            <li> Cheaply made.  Not comfortable to my clients at all.  The shape of the eye pad doesn&#x27;t contour to the curve of the eye, therefore it doesn&#x27;t hold all the bottom lashes down.  After trying to cut them myself, I just threw them all away.</li>
            <li> I only received 10 pairs of these when there were supposed to be 100 pairs.  I ended up paying $2 per pair!!!</li>
            <li> The best stickers I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My clients and I love these. So much better &amp; easier than using breathable tape.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have an issue wit</li>
            <li> Love these under eye pads for lash extensions..</li>
            <li> did not like it at all clients complained about the pain when pulling off the skin.</li>
            <li> Love these.  they don&#x27;t stick to the under eye area causing pain to the client. No lint at all either.</li>
            <li> The eye pads were a little smaller than I expected.  Looks like they were made specifically for eyes that are small are flat.  I can still use them, but I have to improvise with tape.</li>
            <li> These stick to the clients skin like duct tape.  Horrible, will NOT ever buy again.</li>
            <li> You need to cut them to fit all the different eye shapes! they stick pretty good, be sure to pull off slowly so your not streching the undereye area!</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they would be better than just tape and I was wrong.  I felt like I was taking off layers of skin and wrinkles with the tape...</li>
            <li> Work great good size I used to have to cut then to make a little wider</li>
            <li> Not exactly lint free, but for the price they&#x27;re cool.</li>
            <li> for the price it definitely worth it. it is very sticky so i have to put them on my hand first and remove them i do this from two to three times so when i apply them and them remove them it won&#x27;t hurt my under eye skin. every eye is different so i couldn&#x27;t apply them to my eye same the picture however sometime if i couldn&#x27;t put them right i cut the edges and it works very well. even though i have to do all this before i start applying them i really think that they work great at the end and the price is very good  and much better than the others.</li>
            <li> Great for eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> If you order these be prepared.... it&#x27;s basically an overpriced sticker. Not to mention it takes forever to peel the paper off. Not useful!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother purchasing these pads.  There are several issues wrong with this product. 1st  It is difficult removing the pads off the paper. I wasted a few sheets trying to peel off the pads. 2nd. If you get the pads off, the corners are not rounded, making it uncomfortable for the client. One of my clients said it felt like needles. 3rd. Removing the pads was terrible. My medical tape came off easier than this product. 4th. The shape of the pads didn&#x27;t fit correctly, because of it, I got product transferring to the bottom lashes. That wasn&#x27;t fun separating the top and bottom lashes from each other for me and for my client. I&#x27;m going back to using my tape for now.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It does not pull on my clients skin at all.</li>
            <li> We could open , and they don&#x27;t stayed</li>
            <li> I have been doing lash extensions for about 7 years, and have used everything I could find as a barrier for the lower lashes. Medical Tape, Gel Patches, etc. These are very convenient, well-shaped, and if you place them carefully, they do not need to be trimmed. This goes for removal as well - don&#x27;t just yank them off. They have a good adhesive so they don&#x27;t move around during services, but especially of the client has dry/delicate skin, remove them slowly and/or apply eye cream before placing them. I&#x27;ve ordered them 3 times now, and this will make 4. Nice, convenient, sanitary (as opposed to re-usable silicon/plastic).</li>
            <li> Best eye pads ive found! The silk surface doesnt stick to the lash like the &amp;#34;lint free&amp;#34; pads ive tried. The adhesive is strong so they stay put but not so strong that it hurts to remove them. The shape fits better on smaller eyes too. My clients are happy! When my clients ate happy im happy :)</li>
            <li> Way too sticky &amp; they&#x27;re too small. When I have to rove them from my clients eyes it pulls out the bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> Definitely perfect for my clients. Now, I can apply lashes without my client&#x27;s eye lids sticking to the bottom lids, which is highly frustrating for any Make-Up Artist, so these are very helpful in the process of extension application!</li>
            <li> There is no way one sticker is going to fit everyone.. These work way better than the medical tape. I love them!</li>
            <li> I like these. for the price you cant beat them however they are pretty sticky for the tender skin under the eye.</li>
