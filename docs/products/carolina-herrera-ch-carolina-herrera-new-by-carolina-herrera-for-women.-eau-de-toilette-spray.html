            <li>I was very happy to have had the option to order the larger version of CH for such a great price!</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I love Carolina Herrera by Carolina Herrera, and</li>
            <li>in original packaging, nicely presented.</li>
            <li>Smells another thing but never the original fragrance!</li>
            <li>also love that it&#x27;s not one of the super trendy perfumes that everyone wears and can easily recognize.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich, and sensuous without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Then she tried some Chanels, she liked Burburry Brit, and Donna Karen Pure.  </li>
            <li>just what i expected, is get on time and is just beautiful and original botton line i love it</li>
            <li>the package and cover of the product were in very good conditions, the product fit as expected, no troubles at all</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this perfume for a gift to my wife and I finally found it for a great price.</li>
            <li>it was confirmed.</li>
            <li>(Don&#x27;t make fun of me!  </li>
            <li>Excellent perfume for the day or night, for a formal occasion or casual, can be for work or leave, very elegant yet cool ..</li>
            <li>por tan buen servicio rapidez y calidad en el servicio el producto es Original y de una fragancia exquisita lo recomiendo a todas las mujeres</li>
            <li>but nothing special.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain you&#x27;ll love it too!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>sure you will enjoy this classic.</li>
            <li>This is all a true story.    </li>
            <li>Really nice smell, last long and good price.</li>
            <li>worth the dollars</li>
            <li>ALSO, the first recommendation by a non-Gucci employee was this fragrance.    </li>
            <li>I LOVE 212 White and the VIP</li>
            <li>the best woman parfum ever, my gf totally loves it, ill buy it again for sure</li>
            <li>I had picked up the package, and rushed over to my mom&#x27;s house to create perfume-envy (My mom is an avid collector).</li>
            <li>the very idea of doing this wasn&#x27;t her bag in the first place, but seeing my interest, she decided to give it a shot.    </li>
            <li>She&#x27;d rather hit Aveda and get an earthy real organic kinda scent.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very unique.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Every effeminate person you know will be sneaking into your room/house at the oddest times to use this perfume; it&#x27;s really that enticing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really marvellous and there&#x27;s something about the smell that I cannot explain.</li>
            <li>My husband bought this for me here on Amazon and used 5 sprays and no one can smell it unless you get really really close.</li>
            <li>This is not the original one and neither it&#x27;s lasting that long as original does.</li>
            <li>The complexity of the scent encouraged return sniffs, which is exactly why I liked Versace Pour Homme (which I bought pour Moi a few weeks back).    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this perfume.  </li>
            <li>This fragance is so good that I&#x27;m addicted to it.</li>
            <li>If she douses herself in such a scent, she smells like the produce section of Whole Foods.    </li>
            <li>do I get my money back thanks</li>
            <li>perfume does not smell like your 100-yr old great-grandma,</li>
            <li>SO, IN A NUTSHELL, TWO GROWN ADULTS hit the perfume counters of a Macy&#x27;s and left with the exact same preference.  </li>
            <li>I usually equate that metalic smell with cheap perfumes.</li>
            <li>and she says it is soft, meaning that she has to use a lot for it to smell enough.</li>
            <li>My teenage son and young daughter are always leaning over and sniffing to inhale the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know exactly what it is but is smells grapefruity-with the citrusy sourness and unfortunately no sweet to balance it out.</li>

            <li> With the right chemistry you will smell like 1000 flowers just rub it hard on your skin, and wait for the flowers</li>
            <li> She also complains that it doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> It doesnt last long on cloths</li>
            <li> Since this one is not it was even more disappointing.</li>
            <li> The smell is not the same as the other one I baught from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Also Indian, that serious organized and rated for your forwarded the goods permitted according to the new regulations of the Venezuelan Government, which has created an uncertainty in my for the reception of the same.</li>
            <li> A Burburry (Summer?) got my attention, and the Juicy Peace and Love didn&#x27;t seem too bad either.  </li>
            <li> I come to this prestigious firm AMAZON, with the purpose that I review in this respect of the acquired or make me money back.</li>
            <li> Once she had forced the fourth Gucci on me a woman came out of nowhere and offered CH.    </li>
            <li> So I hit a Macy&#x27;s and asked for an Aveda like scent but a little warmer and stronger.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the type of husband to force a scent on a wife via a purchase, and so I begged her to steal a little time away from work and give CH a shot.  </li>
            <li> So my recommendation is that please don&#x27;t waste money buying it online from here and wasting your money on something you don&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li> I have encouraged her to get hers, but she&#x27;s too impatient.</li>
            <li> use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I wanna wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> I only complained that the Brit was &#x27;weak&#x27; and --</li>
            <li> This is not a original product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dead serious.</li>
            <li> but this one was even hard to give away.</li>
            <li> She was even a little confused of my interest in it.  </li>
            <li> was poorly packaged product which caused it to break and bounced all content, pro please i need to know if you will be sent another or</li>
            <li> Do not get the product that is buy: from the date that the purchase was made and will request the sent, the product never I was delivered to my destination, citing the customs agent, the Venezuelan customs were involved, which investigate and was false.</li>
            <li> The problem is -- for me -- those scents are so faint I never get to smell them.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my husband has no sense of smell....</li>
            <li> Today my Amazon order for this fragrance arrived and i&#x27;m really disappointed to smell it.</li>
            <li> but I was very disappointed in this scent.</li>

            <li> Very good product excellent 100% good quality came in good condition always try to qualify according to the purchasing conditions</li>
            <li> This is all a true story.    My wife doesn&#x27;t like perfume.  Too feminine.  She doesn&#x27;t want to allure smelling like bubblegum.  She&#x27;d rather hit Aveda and get an earthy real organic kinda scent.  The problem is -- for me -- those scents are so faint I never get to smell them.  If she douses herself in such a scent, she smells like the produce section of Whole Foods.    So I hit a Macy&#x27;s and asked for an Aveda like scent but a little warmer and stronger.  A lady at a Gucci counter wouldn&#x27;t show me anything but Gucci.  (Think of her as what a protologist spends all day looking at.)  Once she had forced the fourth Gucci on me a woman came out of nowhere and offered CH.    I liked it.  A lot.  But since I&#x27;m a critical consumer, I ditched Gucci-hole and roamed Macy&#x27;s with this lady.  She showed me ALL sorts of similar scents.  A Burburry (Summer?) got my attention, and the Juicy Peace and Love didn&#x27;t seem too bad either.  But after 25 minutes of this... CH ruled.  I asked for a sample to bring to my wife but they had none.    Okay.  I&#x27;m not the type of husband to force a scent on a wife via a purchase, and so I begged her to steal a little time away from work and give CH a shot.  Understand, the very idea of doing this wasn&#x27;t her bag in the first place, but seeing my interest, she decided to give it a shot.    In a different Macys she tried it.  Thought it was alright but nothing special.  She was even a little confused of my interest in it.  Then she tried some Chanels, she liked Burburry Brit, and Donna Karen Pure.  I was so happy she was willing to ditch Aveda I didn&#x27;t try to encourage her towards my preference.  I only complained that the Brit was &#x27;weak&#x27; and -- yet again -- she&#x27;s be wearing a scent no one would ever smell on her.    So she tried the CH again -- this time on the skin -- and asked me to take a whiff.  This scent softened and warmed immediately on her arm, and I kind of involuntarily swooned when I took a sniff.  (Don&#x27;t make fun of me!  LOL.  Ever go into a pizza parlor and roll your eyes in anticipation?  Same thing, except perfume.)    So my wife compared her Brit arm and her CH arm -- and favored the CH.  The complexity of the scent encouraged return sniffs, which is exactly why I liked Versace Pour Homme (which I bought pour Moi a few weeks back).    SO, IN A NUTSHELL, TWO GROWN ADULTS hit the perfume counters of a Macy&#x27;s and left with the exact same preference.  ALSO, the first recommendation by a non-Gucci employee was this fragrance.    That should tell you something.</li>
            <li> PRODUCTO DE BUENA CALIDAD, LLEGO EN BUEN ESTADO Y ES UN PERFUME QUE LES RECOMIENDO ES MUY BUENOOOO....  EL AROMA ATRAPA LA ATENSIÓN DE LAS PERSONAS POR DONDE PASAS LO RECOMIENDO 100%.</li>

            <li> I have been looking for this perfume for a gift to my wife and I finally found it for a great price.</li>
            <li> I have used this CH fragrance earlier as well and it use to smell amazing. Today my Amazon order for this fragrance arrived and i&#x27;m really disappointed to smell it. This is not the original one and neither it&#x27;s lasting that long as original does. So my recommendation is that please don&#x27;t waste money buying it online from here and wasting your money on something you don&#x27;t want.</li>

            <li> It was th eperfect gift to my fiance. She loved it and it was what she wanted. Very good product.</li>
            <li> I gave this gift of perfume for my girlfriend, and just loved it. It&#x27;s a great perfume, with excellent fixation, extending the skin per hour.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure you will enjoy this classic. Create a trademark.</li>
            <li> La fragancia es exquisita y duradera de tonos intensos y elegantes, el producto lleg&amp;oacute; en perfectas condiciones y en el tiempo estipulado, lo recomiendo.</li>
            <li> This is not a original product! Smells another thing but never the original fragrance! Don&#x27;t recommend this seller to anyone!</li>

            <li> EXCELENTE, BUEN PERFUME.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she says it is soft, meaning that she has to use a lot for it to smell enough. She also complains that it doesn&#x27;t last too long. But she loves how it smells.</li>
            <li> elegant and long-lasting perfume, I bought it for my mom and she really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Carolina Herrera perfumes...but this one does Not work for me. I realize we have to take personal body chemistry into consideration but I was very disappointed in this scent. Even sprayed in the air it doesn&#x27;t please me. Don&#x27;t know exactly what it is but is smells grapefruity-with the citrusy sourness and unfortunately no sweet to balance it out. It also finishes with a metalic odor that lingers. I noticed it 1st when I sprayed it in the air and when I spayed it on my skin it was confirmed. I usually equate that metalic smell with cheap perfumes. Since this one is not it was even more disappointing. I LOVE 212 White and the VIP but this one was even hard to give away.</li>
            <li> delicious fragrance, I recommend&lt;br /&gt;comes in original packaging, nicely presented. I&#x27;m happy because it&#x27;s one of my favorite fragrances!&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied</li>
            <li> was poorly packaged product which caused it to break and bounced all content, pro please i need to know if you will be sent another or do I get my money back thanks</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume for the day or night, for a formal occasion or casual, can be for work or leave, very elegant yet cool ..</li>
            <li> Do not get the product that is buy: from the date that the purchase was made and will request the sent, the product never I was delivered to my destination, citing the customs agent, the Venezuelan customs were involved, which investigate and was false. Subsequently the same customs agent Mr. Lorenzo Colina, telephone in Miami 2005070 (owner of the company that would bring Venezuela product - supplies and services LM), indicated that the problem was with the goods door to door, reason by which it was returned to the United States. Also Indian, that serious organized and rated for your forwarded the goods permitted according to the new regulations of the Venezuelan Government, which has created an uncertainty in my for the reception of the same. I come to this prestigious firm AMAZON, with the purpose that I review in this respect of the acquired or make me money back.</li>
            <li> This scent is so lovely, not a day goes by I don&#x27;t get numerous compliments.  My teenage son and young daughter are always leaning over and sniffing to inhale the fragrance.  Unfortunately, my husband has no sense of smell....so I have to rely on everyone else&#x27;s feedback.&lt;br /&gt;I love how it lingers and warms up throughout the day; I would bathe in this if it was appropriate!!!&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it&#x27;s not one of the super trendy perfumes that everyone wears and can easily recognize.  It&#x27;s very unique.&lt;br /&gt;I hope they never stop making this!!</li>
            <li> Carolina Herrera tiene una de las mejores lineas de perfumes tanto para damas como para caballeros por lo que representa un regalo que jamas lo dejara a uno mal con la persona que lo reciba. Igualmente para el uso personal de uno. Yo por ejemplo uso a diario Carolina Herrera para hombres (el clasico)</li>
            <li> really good product and just what i expected, is get on time and is just beautiful and original botton line i love it</li>
            <li> The smell is not the same as the other one I baught from Macy&#x27;s. It doesnt last long on cloths</li>
            <li> the best woman parfum ever, my gf totally loves it, ill buy it again for sure, carolina herrera has excelent taste</li>
            <li> With the right chemistry you will smell like 1000 flowers just rub it hard on your skin, and wait for the flowers</li>
            <li> the package and cover of the product were in very good conditions, the product fit as expected, no troubles at all</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE, SE PUEDE CONSIDERAR UNA BUENA OPCION DE COMPRA, EXCELENTE CALIDAD , BUEN PRECIO Y RESPONSABILIDAD EN TODAS LAS ETAPAS DE LA COMPRA</li>
            <li> It was for a gift and the person told me that it does not smell a lot, that it looks like water..</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m dead serious. Every effeminate person you know will be sneaking into your room/house at the oddest times to use this perfume; it&#x27;s really that enticing. First, it was my mom&#x27;s best friend. I had picked up the package, and rushed over to my mom&#x27;s house to create perfume-envy (My mom is an avid collector). As soon as I opened the cap and sprayed it once into the air, her best friend snatched it from me and proceeded to bathe herself in it like someone trying to fix a chronic BO. My mom now stops by my place to visit and \\&quot;see how I&#x27;m doing\\&quot;, but makes a beeline for the bedroom to use some of this. I have encouraged her to get hers, but she&#x27;s too impatient. I have basically run out of places to hide it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This perfume does not smell like your 100-yr old great-grandma, No! It&#x27;s rich, and sensuous without being overwhelming. It generates the aura of , \\&quot;Look at me, I am all woman\\&quot;. Or \\&quot;Sniff me\\&quot; if you&#x27;d prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In simple terms, \\&quot;I love Carolina Herrera by Carolina Herrera, and I&#x27;m certain you&#x27;ll love it too!\\&quot;</li>

            <li> This fragance is so good that I&#x27;m addicted to it. I wanna wear it everyday. It&#x27;s really marvellous and there&#x27;s something about the smell that I cannot explain.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this perfume.  I love it!!  Some people may not like it but also depends how it mixes with your body!!  It works well for me.  I always recommend people to try the perfume on them before they buy it online.</li>
            <li> Smells good, a new fragance for a beatifull girl, perfect gift. If you buy it, your girl smiles and accept the proposal.</li>
