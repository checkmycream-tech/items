            <li>Skindinavia setting mist is fantastic!</li>
            <li>This product dries within seconds and it has a wonderful hold that truly does last all</li>
            <li>I came across this product and fell in love.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>but i even love their origional better.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping great product</li>
            <li>THIS ONES SO MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li>Make up stays on way better and IN PLACE all day.</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and goes on pretty good without giving you that filmy look that hairspray gives you however since I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not as fine a spray as an aeresol, so to get a fine mist</li>
            <li>I still looked refreshed and polished ontop of liquid eyeliner and blush and a couple of fine layers of satin perfecting cream and pressed powder.  </li>
            <li>This little spray is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>In fact, as soon as I would spray a light mist</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use cheap makeup either.</li>
            <li>I still had a light sheen to my cheeks and forehead, but I&#x27;m of oily complexion</li>
            <li>This stuff is just fabulous.</li>
            <li>i know this product isnt the cheapest thing every but its beyonnd worth it!</li>
            <li>I do recommend it for special events as I believe it worked as designed and described.</li>
            <li>so I sprayed the skindinavia finishing spray on right after I got my make up done, and it was a life saver!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but after my husband and I danced all night on one of the most humid charleston nights and then took photo booth pictures</li>
            <li>Works better than expected, on a warm day when I&#x27;m sweaty</li>
            <li>This is such a great product I highly recommended it to any bride or anyone for that matter!</li>
            <li>Super bummed.</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a good setting spray to hold my make up all day long.</li>
            <li>The one time this past week I was in class, my makeup stayed on flawlessly the whole 8 hours</li>
            <li>I love makeup and have using many different brands of makeup setting sprays from high end to drug store and nothing beats the skindinavia one.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li>make sure you are holding it pretty far from your face</li>
            <li>I was amazed that despite pictures, a hot summer day, dancing, and lots of food, my makeup pretty much did not move all day!  </li>
            <li>I was pretty waterproof and set for a whole day of glam!</li>
            <li>None of us had to reapply any make up during the whole wedding!  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about my face melting off in hot humid Florida weather.</li>
            <li>Really works!  </li>
            <li>Ben Nye or Urban Decay work much better.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a matte finish, not sure the oily and humid variables are a good justification, but overall I&#x27;m satisfied .</li>
            <li>I continued to try it for a month.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s probably just water with a little chemical of some kind.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good setting spray that won&#x27;t leave my face looking oily, sticky, and/or dull.</li>
            <li>(very busy dialysis clinic-14 hour day) and my makeup stayed!!</li>
            <li>it really keeps my makeup in place.</li>
            <li>The finish on this spray maintains the same look and feel I like, and has fantastic all day hold.  </li>
            <li>My make up stayed on during the whole ceremony and reception.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin, very oily in the T zone.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this for my wedding and when I really need staying power.</li>
            <li>This product has a new permanent place in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a 17 year old high school student).</li>
            <li>I just got married last month!</li>
            <li>I did not find this to be any better than the no more shine spray.</li>
            <li>And no more of that &amp;#34;I look so much better when I leave the house at 9 am...</li>
            <li>so i have to say this is by far one of my live or die</li>
            <li>and I see a clear difference on how well this product works in keeping my makeup on.</li>
            <li>Still left my face VERY oily</li>
            <li>You will look natural.</li>
            <li>FYI, I live in a very dry desert with little to no humidity, so I cannot vouch for the products performance in more humid climates.</li>
            <li>Apart from a little flush in my cheeks from dancing, I pretty much looked the same day&#x27;s end as I did at 9am...</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone in Florida or a place where sweat is a major problem with your makeup.</li>
            <li>a lot of people use Urban Decay&#x27;s all nighter spray which is also actually made by Skindinavia, but i have to say the actual Skindinavia products are better and im not sure why maybe its just the bridal one?</li>
            <li>I typically use only powder foundation as I have very oily skin.  </li>

            <li> I was cautious not to overdo it on the makeup but applied the finishing spray after and everything stayed put all day long, even through the humidity.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the product did not arrive as quickly as I had expected, so I did not get to use it for my engagement photo session.  </li>
            <li> Despite that disappointing tidbit, the product itself is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s to be expected.  </li>

            <li> Less touch ups.</li>
            <li> i can go to a bar or club with this on my makeup and all my friends will look like a smeared mess when we leave</li>
            <li> I do not use it all the time as it seems a little drying.</li>
            <li> My makeup lasted when I was heavily sweating in a club/bar.</li>
            <li> (I use covergirl outlast 3-1 everyday, or smashbox studio skin).</li>
            <li> have not tried it in any before any strenuous exercise, so I am not sure how it will hold up in heat and sweat.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Some have complained about it leaving their face wet/dewey, however that is just for a few seconds until it soaks in</li>
            <li> past week, we&#x27;ve had lots of closings for school.</li>
            <li> My make up usually melts off thru out the day, so I&#x27;ve turns to setting  sprays and primers.</li>
            <li> I am new to makeup but after previously using Nyx beige eyeshadow base &amp; having my eye makeup blur with my oily eyelids after a few hours</li>

            <li> Works better than expected, on a warm day when I&#x27;m sweaty it really keeps my makeup in place. One day, I forgot to put it on and realized how much it actually held my makeup in place.</li>
            <li> This is the only makeup finishing spray that will help my makeup last.  I love makeup and have using many different brands of makeup setting sprays from high end to drug store and nothing beats the skindinavia one.  It leaves my skin looking so healthy.  The spray stops your face from looking over-powdered and brings back life into your face after applying your makeup.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the product did not arrive as quickly as I had expected, so I did not get to use it for my engagement photo session.  Despite that disappointing tidbit, the product itself is fantastic.  I typically use only powder foundation as I have very oily skin.  The finish on this spray maintains the same look and feel I like, and has fantastic all day hold.  FYI, I live in a very dry desert with little to no humidity, so I cannot vouch for the products performance in more humid climates.</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all!!! In fact, as soon as I would spray a light mist my eyeliner would run. I don&#x27;t use cheap makeup either. I continued to try it for a month.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s probably just water with a little chemical of some kind. I got taken.</li>
            <li> Still left my face VERY oily</li>
            <li> My makeup guru friend recommended this along with the skindinavia primer since she&#x27;s a pageant girl and knows how to keep makeup on all day.  I was amazed that despite pictures, a hot summer day, dancing, and lots of food, my makeup pretty much did not move all day!  Apart from a little flush in my cheeks from dancing, I pretty much looked the same day&#x27;s end as I did at 9am...which is TOTALLY what I was going for.  This little spray is wonderful.  make sure you are holding it pretty far from your face, it&#x27;s not as fine a spray as an aeresol, so to get a fine mist i would say you should probably hold it 10-12 inches away.  I used a smashbox luminizing (bronzing) primer over the spray skindinavia primer, then with foundation, powder, and then finally this finishing spray.  I was pretty waterproof and set for a whole day of glam!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  I am extremely oily and have tried everything and this is the ONLY thing that works.  My oily friends please buy this amazing product!</li>
            <li> I just got married last month! I had a beautiful wedding but I was worried my make up was going to melt off because we had 90 degree weather and it was an outdoor wedding! I was worried my eyeliner might smudge from the heat so I sprayed the skindinavia finishing spray on right after I got my make up done, and it was a life saver! My make up stayed on during the whole ceremony and reception.  My bridesmaids used it too and also loved it! None of us had to reapply any make up during the whole wedding!  This is such a great product I highly recommended it to any bride or anyone for that matter! It works great!</li>
            <li> I heard Skindinavia: Bridal was amazing and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. I took it on vacation to the Caribbean and even though the weather was 90+ degrees, my makeup stayed perfectly in place. This product has a new permanent place in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading a ton of reviews from a ton of products like this one. I even asked questions to people that had bough it before.&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed my face in T shape and X shape to ensure Ii covered every bit. I looked like I had just ran a marathon. But , when it dries it is perfect. You will look natural. The makeup stayed on for the entire office work day.&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried it in any before any strenuous exercise, so I am not sure how it will hold up in heat and sweat.&lt;br /&gt;I advice you to cover your hair before applying it.</li>
            <li> I have always been a biggest fan of this product sure it does what it say but it&#x27;s a bit pricy.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff.  It was wedding season and my friend introduced me to this.  Never used a finishing soar before so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but after my husband and I danced all night on one of the most humid charleston nights and then took photo booth pictures I still looked refreshed and polished ontop of liquid eyeliner and blush and a couple of fine layers of satin perfecting cream and pressed powder.  I still had a light sheen to my cheeks and forehead, but I&#x27;m of oily complexion so that&#x27;s to be expected.  If you&#x27;re looking for a matte finish, not sure the oily and humid variables are a good justification, but overall I&#x27;m satisfied .</li>
            <li> I am new to makeup but after previously using Nyx beige eyeshadow base &amp; having my eye makeup blur with my oily eyelids after a few hours my sister who models told me to try this.  The spray comes out as a mist and not as droplets which is good.  I haven&#x27;t used it with foundation but I am optimistic</li>
            <li> I love this product. My makeup lasted when I was heavily sweating in a club/bar. I am so happy I got this product. My face looked so good by the end of the night and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about my face melting off in hot humid Florida weather. I would recommend this to anyone in Florida or a place where sweat is a major problem with your makeup. Best setting spray I&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for 2 years and i do love it! Some have complained about it leaving their face wet/dewey, however that is just for a few seconds until it soaks in and then it doesn&#x27;t affect the look of your makeup at all--my fav brand</li>
            <li> I did not find this to be any better than the no more shine spray. In fact I like that better than the bridal finish, and I get more for the price compared to the bridal finish spray.</li>
            <li> Really works!  Used at work (very busy dialysis clinic-14 hour day) and my makeup stayed!! amazing!!</li>
            <li> I love this spray! I have combination skin, very oily in the T zone. I&#x27;m also prone to breakous very easily. And this product does magic. The product keeps my makeup on all day and I use it daily. It doesn&#x27;t break me out and control oil on my skin very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it one and off for for testing purposes and I see a clear difference on how well this product works in keeping my makeup on. Will be buying again for sure.</li>
            <li> Not the best setting spray I&#x27;ve used. Felt like I was just putting water on my face and didn&#x27;t help keep my makeup on. Ben Nye or Urban Decay work much better.</li>
            <li> Used it over my makeup walking around town in 80+ degree/high humidity conditions and it not only protected my makeup it stopped my face from perspiring entirely.  Essential product in my makeup kit from now on. Skindinavia setting mist is fantastic!</li>
            <li> It a wonderful and excellent</li>
            <li> This stuff is just fabulous. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good setting spray that won&#x27;t leave my face looking oily, sticky, and/or dull. This product dries within seconds and it has a wonderful hold that truly does last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a good setting spray to hold my make up all day long. I came across this product and fell in love. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it, and I knew it was a great buy because of the price and reviews. Plus, it&#x27;s for BRIDES! Which means it&#x27;s reliable and is meant to withstand sweat and smearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This past week, we&#x27;ve had lots of closings for school. (I&#x27;m a 17 year old high school student). Just my luck, ever time there&#x27;s a school closing, it&#x27;s announced after I finish perfecting my make up.  So I normally take a few selfies(not going to waste all my effort I put into my face!), and then head right back to bed. (Recently I&#x27;ve been staying up late. Hard to get back on schedule after winter break). I sleep in a decent amount of hours, wake up, and guess what&#x27;s still on my face in perfect condition? That&#x27;s right. My make up. The one time this past week I was in class, my makeup stayed on flawlessly the whole 8 hours and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product. Defiantly a must buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for about 2 days but it does not keep my make up on whatsoever. If applied at 8 in the am, my makeup is rubbing off by 12. It smells good and goes on pretty good without giving you that filmy look that hairspray gives you however since I have sensitive skin I thought I would try this to minimize breakouts but it does not seem to by getting the job done as described. Probably will try a different brand next time. Super bummed.</li>
            <li> Performs as it says it will.</li>
            <li> okay so i have to say this is by far one of my live or die must have beauty products! i dont really write reviews for products but this is the best. i know this product isnt the cheapest thing every but its beyonnd worth it! i can go to a bar or club with this on my makeup and all my friends will look like a smeared mess when we leave but my make up is still flawless. a lot of people use Urban Decay&#x27;s all nighter spray which is also actually made by Skindinavia, but i have to say the actual Skindinavia products are better and im not sure why maybe its just the bridal one? i dont know but i even love their origional better. also check out their primer spray its also great!</li>
            <li> I just attended a summer wedding and was worried about my makeup holding up - UNTIL I found Skindinavia&#x27;s bridal makeup finishing spray! I was cautious not to overdo it on the makeup but applied the finishing spray after and everything stayed put all day long, even through the humidity. Definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great product</li>
            <li> Seems to work as advertised.  I haven&#x27;t used another finishing spray so I have nothing to compare it to.  It does make my face appear smoother.</li>
            <li> so happy with this product..love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 20 with oily skin, blackheads, occasional (monthly) break out. My make up usually melts off thru out the day, so I&#x27;ve turns to setting  sprays and primers. This spray has replaced my urban decay sprays.. THIS ONES SO MUCH BETTER. Make up stays on way better and IN PLACE all day. (I use covergirl outlast 3-1 everyday, or smashbox studio skin). Less touch ups. And no more of that &amp;#34;I look so much better when I leave the house at 9 am... But look like greasy death by 2 pm&amp;#34;. Definitely repurchasing</li>
            <li> Makes your makeup look flawless, even if you are in the heat! My favorite product in my makeup bag!</li>
            <li> I work 12 hr shifts. Sometimes I&#x27;ll have a break to take a cat nap in my car.......no need to reapply, this product is amazing!</li>
            <li> I used this for my wedding and when I really need staying power. I do not use it all the time as it seems a little drying. I do recommend it for special events as I believe it worked as designed and described.</li>
