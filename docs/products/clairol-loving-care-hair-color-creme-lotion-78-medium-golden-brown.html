            <li>: Stay away from the Clairol Beautiful Collection it leaves a waxy, sticky residue in my hair.</li>
            <li>I was so happy when this showed up at Amazon-</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the hair color - I&#x27;ve been using it for many years</li>
            <li>This product was great, but CoSaMo has a product that is better and way inexpensive compared to this!  </li>
            <li>product is exactly as good as on ads.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>I have not found a good replacement since it was discontinued</li>
            <li>I have been using Clairol Loving Care hair color for 52 years.  </li>
            <li>Unfortuately Clairol has not considered people with allergies when they decided to discontinue the Loving Care product line.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it here.</li>
            <li>Just received my Loving Care hair color...</li>
            <li>I ordered as many as I can; the items came in good condition: no leaks, containers were not damaged nor dented.</li>
            <li>$35.00 for a bottle of Loving Care?  </li>
            <li>The Loving Care did</li>
            <li>It lasts about 6 to 12 shampoos just like the Loving Care semi permanent color.</li>
            <li>It has no ammonia and no peroxide just like Clairol Loving Care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was told about this product that is just like Clairol Loving Care [...]</li>
            <li>so I have to look for a product like Loving Care.</li>
            <li>Due to sensitive EYES, CLAIROL LOVING CREAM LOTION is truley the..... best best best!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and good for my hair.</li>
            <li>We are buying Loving Care through Amazon because most stores in our area have sold out of their product.  </li>
            <li>Love Your Color hair dye is PPD, ammonia, and peroxide FREE and makes your hair feel amazing!  </li>
            <li>The supply of &#x27;Loving Care&#x27; colours available online is diminishing , so eventually I shall have to grey-old gracefully .</li>
            <li>I ordered this product for my mother, and she is completely satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>Wish we could get more.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff because it is ammonia and peroxide free… I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything else like it.</li>
            <li>I would not have bought it if Amazon did not offer an excellent credit if I open a credit card account with them.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Clairol has a professional Semi permanent Hair Color that is available at many Beauty Supply stores called the Beautiful Collection.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m extremely allergic to peroxide, so it worked beautifully!</li>
            <li>&#x27;Loving Care&#x27; was the most gentle hair-colouring product on the market .</li>
            <li>I am going to try Clairol Beautiful Collection in the future for an upcoming wedding.  </li>
            <li>It seems that Clairol has seen fit to discontinue this product.  </li>
            <li>However no longer available.  </li>
            <li>wish it was still available.  </li>
            <li>The Beautiful Collection colors are often on sale at Sally&#x27;s and other beauty supply stores for $4.99 to $5.99 a bottle! :))</li>
            <li>funny how that is!!</li>
            <li>The only product that she has been able to use has been Loving Care.  </li>
            <li>The price is also very affordable and not outrageous.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;highlights\\&quot; of light brown to golden brown as it starts to fade.</li>
            <li>Clairol Loving Care Natural Instincts #78 Medium Golden Brown.  </li>
            <li>and the vendor was quick and helpful in getting it returned.</li>
            <li>I remember Loving Care from commercials from when I was younger....</li>
            <li>medium golden brown...</li>
            <li>Have to redo every three weeks, but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>What product/color replaced 78 Medium Golden Brown</li>
            <li>Since it is a professional product not too many women are aware of it.</li>
            <li>then more recently to a medium golden brown:</li>
            <li>Is it possible to order more, as my sister tells she can no longer find it online.</li>
            <li>I hope I will be able to purchase more at the same affordable price in the future.</li>
            <li>Do NOT pay for this old product when you can get a new bottle of Love Your Color.  </li>
            <li>The only ones to profit by Clairol discontinuing Loving Care is the professional salons.  </li>
            <li>I began with a light auburn which I used for about ten years.  </li>
            <li>Claroil discounted it and my wife really likes the way it works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very allergic to all permanent haircolor</li>
            <li>even if it was in a much inflated price.</li>
            <li>am very disapointed with the fact that this product is not in sale anymore in Canada.</li>
            <li>The Honey Brown is exactly the same color as the Medium Golden Brown #78.</li>
            <li>All the other brands and hair color variations are more complicated to use and have many more chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I used to have naturally black hair which has now turned mostly gray.</li>
            <li>The main reasons I like this product are 1)</li>
            <li>Leaves hair looking very natural with no frizz and adds lots of body.  </li>
            <li>safely]through Amazon , and look as young as I feel !</li>
            <li>The color is soft and very natural and covers the gray.  </li>
            <li>It is less harmful to one&#x27;s hair than many other products because it contains no ammonia and no peroxide.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> When I get to open the other bottles, they already spilled even though they&#x27;re &amp;#34;sealed&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> they dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, out of desperation, before I found out about it I paid over $1500 for two years worth of Loving Care from a seller on ebay :((</li>
            <li> I have always been satisfied with the results, and feel badly now that no store in my area carries this product.  </li>
            <li> Amazon prices vary widely.</li>
            <li> The product was what I expected.  </li>
            <li> This particular product has become very hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> My wife was a cosmotologist early in her career, bur was forced to give up the profession due to allergies to hair dyes.  </li>
            <li> Attempts to use other products have been unsuccessful.  </li>
            <li> I have never had any problems, other then I use to pay around $8.00.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what I will do next, maybe we should all call CLAIROL.!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands</li>
            <li> Then I switched to a medium dark brown and</li>
            <li> I needed Dark Brown.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was told by Clairol that they discontinued making this particular type and shade of haircolor.</li>
            <li> It is not as harsh as permanent or even semi-permanent.  </li>
            <li> It is one of the few hair coloring products that doesn&#x27;t cause scalp itching (allergic reaction?)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Clairol has discontinued it , and replaced it with a colorant which is longer-lasting , but leaves the hair in need of daily conditioner .  </li>
            <li> I only rid bit was not do expensive!</li>
            <li> Now I am stuck with 96 bottles of 3 year old hair color! :(</li>
            <li> It was quite similar to ones I used in the past, but differed by two ingredients and these were evidently bad for me.</li>
            <li> and I was stupid enough to buy this!</li>
            <li> and very disappointed when the order arrived that there was only one bottle of hair color in the package.  </li>
            <li> sorry they don&#x27;t make this anymove--now, if you can get it, it&#x27;s prohibitively expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Clairol has discontinued it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to buy any.</li>
            <li> It makes the hair look dirty and separated.</li>
            <li> It is way too expensive!</li>
            <li> Sad to say it&#x27;s over $50.00 now!  </li>
            <li> Too bad it is not sold in the stores anymore.  </li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> It is awful!</li>

            <li> sorry they don&#x27;t make this anymove--now, if you can get it, it&#x27;s prohibitively expensive. so.....</li>
            <li> Bought it for my sister who is allergic to peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;The product is exactly as good as on ads.&lt;br /&gt;Very recommended to anybody who is allergic to peroxide..</li>
            <li> This temporary hair color works for me.  It is not as harsh as permanent or even semi-permanent.  The color is soft and very natural and covers the gray.  Too bad it is not sold in the stores anymore.  Amazon prices vary widely.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to hair colour, and this is the only product that works!!  I remember Loving Care from commercials from when I was younger....funny how that is!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Clairol Loving Care hair color for 52 years.  I began with a light auburn which I used for about ten years.  Then I switched to a medium dark brown and then more recently to a medium golden brown: Clairol Loving Care Natural Instincts #78 Medium Golden Brown.  The main reasons I like this product are 1) it is simple to use, 2) it has no peroxide, and 3) it has no ammonia.  These last two chemicals I feel are harmful to your hair over a long period of time.  I have always been satisfied with the results, and feel badly now that no store in my area carries this product.  All the other brands and hair color variations are more complicated to use and have many more chemicals.  I do wish Clairol would not discontinue this product!</li>

            <li> &#x27;Loving Care&#x27; was the most gentle hair-colouring product on the market . Unfortunately Clairol has discontinued it , and replaced it with a colorant which is longer-lasting , but leaves the hair in need of daily conditioner .  The supply of &#x27;Loving Care&#x27; colours available online is diminishing , so eventually I shall have to grey-old gracefully . Until then,thankfully , I can still buy it [safely]through Amazon , and look as young as I feel !</li>
            <li> This particular product has become very hard to find in the stores. I was thrilled to find it here. It is one of the few hair coloring products that doesn&#x27;t cause scalp itching (allergic reaction?) for me.</li>
            <li> I bought about 300 of these from various people for my wife.  It is the only dye that does not cause her skin to scale and hurt.</li>
            <li> A year ago I purchased this for my mother, and received three tubes for the price she now paid for one.  It is way too expensive!</li>
            <li> Just received my Loving Care hair color...medium golden brown...and very disappointed when the order arrived that there was only one bottle of hair color in the package.  I paid the same price last year for this product and received 3 bottles in the same package.  I guess since it is scarce they are uping the price and only giving you one bottle.  I&#x27;ll continue to purchase it only because it is the only place you can get this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my mother, and she is completely satisfied with it.  Is it possible to order more, as my sister tells she can no longer find it online.</li>
            <li> The product was what I expected.  Actually was sent a 2nd order (different material, same vendor) and the vendor was quick and helpful in getting it returned.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere. Claroil discounted it and my wife really likes the way it works. Wish we could get more.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff because it is ammonia and peroxide free… I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything else like it.</li>
            <li> Just what she wanted, the color was perfect</li>
            <li> I ordered one box and you can notice that the product has already expired because it didn&#x27;t even last for a week! When I get to open the other bottles, they already spilled even though they&#x27;re &amp;#34;sealed&amp;#34;. Don&#x27;t buy this because it has been off the market for a long time and I was stupid enough to buy this! Will NEVER recommend this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very allergic to all permanent haircolor and this is the only brand that I know of in existence that works on me. The price is also very affordable and not outrageous. The color is perfect for me- I used to have naturally black hair which has now turned mostly gray. I tried using darker colors but my hair turned rainbow color when the haircolor started fading out! This shade (#78) is perfect- gives my hair \\&quot;highlights\\&quot; of light brown to golden brown as it starts to fade. People had made comment on it and women had asked me what shade I use. Unfortunately I was told by Clairol that they discontinued making this particular type and shade of haircolor. I was so happy when this showed up at Amazon- even if it was in a much inflated price. I would not have bought it if Amazon did not offer an excellent credit if I open a credit card account with them. I ordered as many as I can; the items came in good condition: no leaks, containers were not damaged nor dented. The shipment arrived on time. I hope I will be able to purchase more at the same affordable price in the future.</li>
            <li> I needed Dark Brown. This didn&#x27;t cover all my gray. Since it&#x27;s not being made anymore I&#x27;m afraid to buy any.</li>
            <li> The product pictured is not the one I received.  The formula of the UK version is different, although we are told it is not.</li>
            <li> This product was great, but CoSaMo has a product that is better and way inexpensive compared to this!  Love Your Color hair dye is PPD, ammonia, and peroxide FREE and makes your hair feel amazing!  Do NOT pay for this old product when you can get a new bottle of Love Your Color.  Here is their website and you can find it here on Amazon too. [...]</li>
            <li> Due to sensitive EYES, CLAIROL LOVING CREAM LOTION is truley the..... best best best! I have never had any problems, other then I use to pay around $8.00.  Sad to say it&#x27;s over $50.00 now!  Not sure what I will do next, maybe we should all call CLAIROL.!!!</li>
            <li> Great product!  It is less harmful to one&#x27;s hair than many other products because it contains no ammonia and no peroxide.  Unfortunately Clairol has discontinued it.</li>
            <li> Are you kidding me?  $35.00 for a bottle of Loving Care?  Yup, I used it for decades. don&#x27;t know why Clairol decided to take it off the market.  It was a great inbetween permanent hair color -- just to get by.  The only ones to profit by Clairol discontinuing Loving Care is the professional salons.  Now I go every four weeks instead of six weeks for color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has no company come up with a semi-permanent hair color (no amonia, no peroxide) to replace the demand for same in the market?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the hair color - I&#x27;ve been using it for many years &amp;I plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  However no longer available.  I am going to try Clairol Beautiful Collection in the future for an upcoming wedding.  We will see??? Hopefully I am not allergic to the newer product!!!!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years.  Can no longer get it locally anywhere so am dependent on Amazon for it.  Have to redo every three weeks, but it&#x27;s worth it.  Leaves hair looking very natural with no frizz and adds lots of body.  It does wash out though after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I loved it and I&#x27;m extremely allergic to peroxide, so it worked beautifully! I only rid bit was not do expensive!</li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to this product. It was quite similar to ones I used in the past, but differed by two ingredients and these were evidently bad for me.</li>
            <li> What product/color replaced 78 Medium Golden Brown I have tried other brands but they do not give my hair the same feel or look as a matter of fact they dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how these sellers get away with this.... selling these hair colors that were discontinued 3 years ago by Clairol for $46 a bottle! They must be spoiled by now anyway just hanging around for three years in some warehouse or storage unit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clairol has a professional Semi permanent Hair Color that is available at many Beauty Supply stores called the Beautiful Collection. It comes in 3oz bottles just like The Loving Care did and it comes in array of colors. The Honey Brown is exactly the same color as the Medium Golden Brown #78. It lasts about 6 to 12 shampoos just like the Loving Care semi permanent color. Since it is a professional product not too many women are aware of it. It has no ammonia and no peroxide just like Clairol Loving Care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourselves a favor and save your money. The Beautiful Collection colors are often on sale at Sally&#x27;s and other beauty supply stores for $4.99 to $5.99 a bottle! :))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Stay away from the Clairol Beautiful Collection it leaves a waxy, sticky residue in my hair. It is awful! It is damaging to the hair to just comb through it. The waxiness lasts even after several shampoos, at which time all the color is gone anyway. It makes the hair look dirty and separated. It looks horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told about this product that is just like Clairol Loving Care [...] I read the reviews and the women are raving about it.Unfortunately, out of desperation, before I found out about it I paid over $1500 for two years worth of Loving Care from a seller on ebay :(( Now I am stuck with 96 bottles of 3 year old hair color! :( I wish I had known!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it here for 5.99 a bottle. it&#x27;s bigger then Clairol&#x27;s was too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> wish it was still available.  I have not found a good replacement since it was discontinued</li>
            <li> I am allergic to peroxyde so I have to look for a product like Loving Care. It is easy to use and good for my hair. The color is great.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disapointed with the fact that this product is not in sale anymore in Canada.</li>
