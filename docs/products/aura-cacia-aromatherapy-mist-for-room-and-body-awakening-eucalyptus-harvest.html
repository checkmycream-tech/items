            <li>This is nice stuff.</li>
            <li>but it is so nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaeels ok but the body cream smells way better!</li>
            <li>I still love the fragrance of patchouli and in this spray it&#x27;s lightened with orange, so it&#x27;s not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>The better of the two sprays with patchouli.  </li>
            <li>It takes more sprays though to freshen up the room and can be a bit costly.</li>
            <li>100% essential oils, no animal testing and delicious fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I also love the body cream that Aura Cacia makes.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and now I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is lovely and subtle.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>A lovely scent.</li>
            <li>the orange is much more prominent.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this scent because the orange brightens up the earthiness of the patchouli.  </li>
            <li>I love the Patchouli smell and people ask me what I am wearing.</li>
            <li>I have people follow me to for the smell. :)</li>
            <li>My favorite scent of all time.  </li>
            <li>I love patchouli, but the orange overpowered it.</li>
            <li>and I love them both, in fact I rebuy them again and again.  </li>
            <li>I love this mist spray.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to buy more.</li>
            <li>I use it all the time and love it.</li>
            <li>the orange takes the patchouli to a new level.. great as an body spray in a pinch..</li>
            <li>Most people compliment me and say that they smell my light hippy foot print</li>
            <li>I love have an aroma that not only smells great but is safe to breathe.</li>
            <li>I got it to use as a body spray, and though it does smell good, it doesn&#x27;t really soak into the skin and the scent is gone within 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lovely true patchouli scent and</li>
            <li>The aroma is wonderful for a little pick me up.</li>
            <li>Such a great smell.</li>
            <li>and I first used it as a room freshener, but then after getting some scent on my clothes I had walked outside and said I smell really good!</li>
            <li>I love patchouli, and the addition of sweet orange kind of lightens up the overall fragrance.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I have two other sprays from this company and love them both.  </li>
            <li>so just a 2 second spray makes the house smell good.</li>
            <li>Smells good and definitely &amp;#34;clears the space out&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The Aura Cacia sweet orange and patchouli body wash and body butter smell heavenly and I always get compliments when I use them.</li>
            <li>smells good but smell doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>It is a very soothing and lovely combination of fragrances.</li>
            <li>It is made of pure essential oils and has a great smell.</li>
            <li>I use this product mainly  because I love the patchouli scent (if it&#x27;s not over done).</li>
            <li>love the scent but requires frequent reapplications</li>
            <li>Looks nice enough to leave out for guests.</li>
            <li>The patchouli that is anathema to some is nicely subdued -- though obvious.</li>
            <li>love it ; from an old hippie.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a perfumey scent, per se, but definitely freshens nicely.</li>
            <li>So after my friend left I went on a mission to purchase a bottle for my own.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was hoping for</li>
            <li>Love this spray with my entire soul.</li>
            <li>and it is evident when you spray it.</li>
            <li>and this does exactly that.</li>
            <li>Nice and not to over powering like some other products.</li>
            <li>They are made with essential oils, but are distributed so evenly that they always spray out as a fine mist.  </li>
            <li>Much nicer than some overpowering room sprays</li>
            <li>I am dissapointed by how much water is in this spray.</li>
            <li>The container is stainless steel</li>
            <li>well it really came as massage cream i also had to contact the seller buy email just to have them send it out.</li>
            <li>The patchouli in this, because its mixed with the sweet orange, doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you like some forms of patchouli do.  </li>
            <li>It does not linger for any particular amount of time</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance--it just doesn&#x27;t last long in a room--maybe our ceilings are too high</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re younger it will likely remind you of some older, but cool,  relatives.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance, but the way it was packaged was not ok.</li>
            <li>So shoot me for being an old hippie!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice if you love patchouli - possibly a bit overwhelming if you only like patchouli somewhat - and definitely not for those who hate it.</li>
            <li>It takes care of the smell right away, and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>I only wish the scent would stick around a little bit better.</li>
            <li>Bottle came completely dented and leaking.</li>
            <li>three star rate is a direct result of receiving my spray with a dent in the can.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this at a store near me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all Aura Cacia mists and oils, especially this one.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the essential oil scent much more than artificial scents.</li>
            <li>You can barely smell the orange at all.</li>
            <li>So, far it&#x27;s gotten only compliments.</li>
            <li>I frequently have to open it up, fish the tube part out, and push it back together.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get a whole lot in the little bottle, so if you are on a budget, then just use it once in a while.  </li>

            <li> The other one &#x27;Chill Pill&#x27; adds mint to the mix and is reminiscent of the way &#x27;Sen-Sen&#x27; tasted.  </li>
            <li> Cost and aggravation not worth sending back.</li>
            <li> Not a real Patchouli smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this smell however rating perfumes and other odors is like rating food.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the evening to wind down and relax.</li>
            <li> Was sent an old, stale smelling product.</li>
            <li> it cause a lot of people who choose Patchouli pile it on like crazy and its overwhelming and annoying.</li>
            <li> I hate typical air fresheners that smell so fake and have who-knows-what kind of crap in them.</li>
            <li> You know those people in the subway car that sit or stand next to you and they smell like a bad mixture of spices?</li>
            <li> False adveristing....</li>
            <li> When used as a room and body spray it smells really bad like pepper.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad one,</li>
            <li> My husband got sick to his stomach.</li>
            <li> I do not care for the smell of Patchouli whatever that is : (</li>
            <li> It smelled horrible.</li>

The spray lasts for 2 - 3 hours, enough time to gain the relaxing benefit. I use this product mainly  because I love the patchouli scent (if it&#x27;s not over done).</li>
            <li> I enjoy the essential oil scent much more than artificial scents. It takes more sprays though to freshen up the room and can be a bit costly.</li>
            <li> SMELLS GREAT. LUV IT?</li>
            <li> Love this scent! It&#x27;s great for refreshing the air or mellowing your mood. I have bought this one before and will continue to use it. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a Boomer it will bring back some memories maybe. If you&#x27;re younger it will likely remind you of some older, but cool,  relatives.</li>
            <li> I love this spray because I can use it as a body mist OR a room freshener!  100% essential oils, no animal testing and delicious fragrance.  I also love the body cream that Aura Cacia makes.</li>
            <li> Great scent&lt;br /&gt;since it is based in essential oils does not have a chemical&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is subtel and by no means over powering with just 2-3 squirts</li>
            <li> You have to like patchouli then you will like this fragrance. The orange fragrance is so wnderful with patchouli. Much nicer than some overpowering room sprays</li>
            <li> Smells good and definitely &amp;#34;clears the space out&amp;#34;. It has a relaxing effect on me. You have to shake it every time . Essential oils and water won&#x27;t stay mixed.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell, and delivery was exactly add promises.  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My yoga instructor brought this to class one day and I just had to have it. I love it, great for relaxation.</li>
            <li> love the scent but requires frequent reapplications</li>
            <li> Love this spray with my entire soul. I use it as an after poop spray.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!  smells great.. reminds me of the 70&#x27;s..the orange takes the patchouli to a new level.. great as an body spray in a pinch..</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and now I&#x27;m out. I will definitely keep this at my house. GREAT stuff!</li>
            <li> I love patchouli, and the addition of sweet orange kind of lightens up the overall fragrance. This is nice stuff.</li>
            <li> I am dissapointed by how much water is in this spray. I thought it would be mostly essential and carrier oils, but the number 1 ingrediant is water and it is evident when you spray it. I got it to use as a body spray, and though it does smell good, it doesn&#x27;t really soak into the skin and the scent is gone within 30 minutes. The patchouli is definitely the dominant scent, which I was hoping for, but I was also hoping the orange would mellow out the patchouli so it wouldn&#x27;t be so pungent. You can barely smell the orange at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this smell however rating perfumes and other odors is like rating food.  It&#x27;s a matter of taste.  For me, this smell reminds me of RAID.  To be fair, I have two other sprays from this company and love them both.  I just don&#x27;t care for this mist.  I sprayed some into the air after it arrived and I still can&#x27;t get away from the odor.</li>
            <li> My best friend gave me a bottle of this room spray and it&#x27;s now a staple in my home.  Lovely true patchouli scent and it wafts through my home without assaulting your senses.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I hate typical air fresheners that smell so fake and have who-knows-what kind of crap in them. We use this in the room that has our cats&#x27; litter boxes in it, and spritz a couple times after scooping. It takes care of the smell right away, and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance--it just doesn&#x27;t last long in a room--maybe our ceilings are too high :-0  But great fragrance!</li>
            <li> Smelling it from the bottle it smells like orange oil.  When used as a room and body spray it smells really bad like pepper. You know those people in the subway car that sit or stand next to you and they smell like a bad mixture of spices? If you want to achieve that scent then this is the spray for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hankered for putting a smidge of patchouli back in my life now that I&#x27;m all grown up LOL and this does exactly that. It brings back memories without making me smell like I just walked out of a Phish concert.</li>
            <li> Nice and not to over powering like some other products. It works well for me cause i shower on the reg and apply one or two sprays just to mellow out the air around me. Most people compliment me and say that they smell my light hippy foot print and they dig it cause a lot of people who choose Patchouli pile it on like crazy and its overwhelming and annoying.</li>
            <li> THE SMELL. So good. I just got it today and I cannot stop spraying it. So good. If you like patchouli, this stuff is for you.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that you fall head over heals for! The fragrance is lovely and subtle.&lt;br /&gt;My three star rate is a direct result of receiving my spray with a dent in the can. Otherwise this is a five star product!</li>
            <li> Amazing smell and it lasts for hundreds of spritzes.  The container is stainless steel and so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it breaking if you drop it.  Looks nice enough to leave out for guests.</li>
            <li> A lovely scent. It does not persist as long as I might like but it is so nice. The patchouli that is anathema to some is nicely subdued -- though obvious. So, far it&#x27;s gotten only compliments.</li>
            <li> love it ; from an old hippie.</li>
            <li> The Aura Cacia sweet orange and patchouli body wash and body butter smell heavenly and I always get compliments when I use them. In those products, the patchouli is not as noticeable - the orange is much more prominent. In this spray, the patchouli is definitely the dominant scent. It&#x27;s nice if you love patchouli - possibly a bit overwhelming if you only like patchouli somewhat - and definitely not for those who hate it.</li>
            <li> Love it. This spray is used by our Naturopathic doctor in her office. It is made of pure essential oils and has a great smell. I love have an aroma that not only smells great but is safe to breathe. I use it in the evening to wind down and relax. You can also use it as a body spray or on your bedding. I also purchased the Invigorating Ginger &amp; Mint scent for use at the office for helping to keep my focus throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The combination of orange with the patchouli keeps this from smelling like a &#x27;hippie perfurme&#x27;.  It is great on the body or use around the home.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this scent because the orange brightens up the earthiness of the patchouli.  I use it around my house, especially after cooking.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this product on Amazon.  I couldn&#x27;t find this at a store near me. I love the Patchouli smell and people ask me what I am wearing. I spray/mist this all the time.</li>
            <li> I have gotten this several times and will get it again. I have people follow me to for the smell. :)</li>
            <li> Love it!!! It&#x27;s my favorite!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite scent of all time.  The patchouli in this, because its mixed with the sweet orange, doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you like some forms of patchouli do.  Complimented often.  Love this!!!</li>
            <li> I use this on occasion and it&#x27;s a wonderful spritz of aromatherapy.  You don&#x27;t get a whole lot in the little bottle, so if you are on a budget, then just use it once in a while.  It&#x27;s not a perfumey scent, per se, but definitely freshens nicely.</li>
            <li> smells good but smell doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> It smelled horrible. My husband got sick to his stomach. I love patchouli, but the orange overpowered it.</li>
            <li> I cannot get enough of this mist!  I have purchased a couple different scents by Aura Cacia and I love them both, in fact I rebuy them again and again.  They are made with essential oils, but are distributed so evenly that they always spray out as a fine mist.  I use mine as a room air freshener, a body mist and also in my car and closet.</li>
            <li> I do not care for the smell of Patchouli whatever that is : (</li>
            <li> Great spray to eliminate odors</li>
            <li> An exceptional body spray; an excellent room fragrance as well. I highly recommend all Aura Cacia mists and oils, especially this one.</li>
            <li> This is a great smell!  We love it!  And, you can smell it hours later.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> i had ordered what i thought was going to be a body mister so i could use it as a perfume well it really came as massage cream i also had to contact the seller buy email just to have them send it out. so i waited so long im just going to keep it because it smells good on me any ways. it should be listed as a cream by the seller !!!</li>
            <li> Such a great smell. Perfect balance between patchouli and orange zest smells. My only gripe about it is spray nozzle. The tube keeps falling off the bottom of it (inside the bottle). I frequently have to open it up, fish the tube part out, and push it back together. Maybe I just got a bad one, don&#x27;t know. Would be 5/5 if not for the faulty spray nozzle.</li>
            <li> I love this mist spray. It smells delightful. I spray on me and in the air. It does not linger for any particular amount of time but I just adore it anyway.  In addition to this I spray my yoga mat with it. I also use the bath salts and body cream in this scent and it all smells so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to buy more. It is a very soothing and lovely combination of fragrances.</li>
            <li> Amazing smell!! Love it!</li>
            <li> Was sent an old, stale smelling product. Cost and aggravation not worth sending back. I simply will NOT purchase again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last. Smells like lemon. Not a real Patchouli smell. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I really love this scent! I A friend that was staying with me brought a bottle and left in bathroom and I first used it as a room freshener, but then after getting some scent on my clothes I had walked outside and said I smell really good! So after my friend left I went on a mission to purchase a bottle for my own. I use it all the time and love it.</li>
            <li> This smells really great. It lasts a long time. The only thing that confuses me is, how can it be both a room spray AND a body spray? I use it on my body.</li>
