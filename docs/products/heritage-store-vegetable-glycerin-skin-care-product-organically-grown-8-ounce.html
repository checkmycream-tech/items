    <ol>
            <li> I wish I could leave it on my face for at least a few minutes,but my skin is so sensitive.I feel a warm sensation after the application and I noticed a difference in my face almost immediately. I will continue to use it thank you!</li>
            <li> We use this organic veg glycerin in place of body lotion. &amp;#34;If you can&#x27;t eat it or drink it, it shouldn&#x27;t go on your skin.&amp;#34; This glycerin helps the skin hold onto its moisture all day, instead of having to apply and reapply lotion constantly.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> I love this! Use it in my home remedies!</li>
            <li> I use this on my 4bm low porosity, natural hair and it is amazing!!!!! It only takes a little to go a long way!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for vaping.  I bought it because it is the organic version of what is available at my local grocery stores.  (They only carry the non-organic)</li>
            <li> Very good for DIY face lotion. It&#x27;s good for your skin. If you have oily skin do not add too much! My skin loves this one.</li>
            <li> This glycerin gave me some type of reaction. Woke up with puffy eyes. Not sure what vegetable this glycerin comes from or how it&#x27;s extracted. I do suffer from various allergies, so maybe it&#x27;s just not for me in particular. May be made in a facility that manufactures other things that I cannot tolerate. Added to my homemade facial serum. I think I will stick to jojoba, hemp and other oils to put on my face instead.</li>
            <li> No where on the packaging does it state what company it is registered organic through...I bought only because it was organic and now I don&#x27;t believe that it actually is.</li>
            <li> Perfectly satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Never ordered or received American card or Expelled</li>
            <li> I have used this before for making my own toothpaste and it works good. I bought better baking soda from frontier coop this time so I hope my next toothpaste is more consistant. It does not really have flavor, just a bit sweet. Im not sure if this is food grade or not, but that is what I intend on using it.</li>
            <li> I add this to my leave in conditioner and it really helps keep my hair hydrated! I will be ordering more when I run out!</li>
            <li> Used in natural hair moisturizing spritzer. Well packaged.</li>
            <li> Love this glycerin. I hate the idea of glycerin that comes from rendering plants (they use dead animals!) This vegetable glycerin makes my skin nice and soft and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try out a Vitamin C serum recipe I found on Pinterest.&lt;br /&gt;Had never used or tried Glycerin prior to this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked as intended...but:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) I&#x27;m not 100% convinced it&#x27;s &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; ((or necessary)) for your skin&lt;br /&gt;2.) It&#x27;s def sticky and somewhat sweet&lt;br /&gt;3.) It came as advertised and seems to be a reputable brand//company&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary:&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again (purpose specific) but wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for topical applications to the face. :)</li>

            <li> Product works well, it doesn&#x27;t have a smell or anything off about it.  The only thing was that it sorta leaked when it arrived but other than that I had no issues.</li>
            <li> Soothing skin product.  Helps keep skin moist and clear. It can be sticky, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting this product directly on your skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this to make home made spa products only used it once so far but seems to be good product.</li>
            <li> Great product worked great in making homemade shampoo</li>
