    <ol>
            <li>I figured this would be the perfect strength, since I was not using on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I  am very happy with my results...</li>
            <li>Impressive!</li>
            <li>Also EXCELLENT customer service by Dermalure</li>
            <li>Now that I have got that out of the way lets talk about using this awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>, it is marvelous!  </li>
            <li>very good product, meets expectations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done 3 peels so far,approximately 1 week between each application, and my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years !</li>
            <li>YOU WILL GET BEAUTIFUL RESULTS...</li>
            <li>real easy!</li>
            <li>Works great and does what it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
            <li>And I am by no means experienced in acid peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>(lol)</li>
            <li>However, with that said---this product is GREAT.</li>
            <li>FYI, that is a great product</li>
            <li>and i was really happy with that......</li>
            <li>It gave me great coverage and frosting ...</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>The product works great if it is applied correctly.</li>
            <li>My skin peeled and it looked great</li>
            <li>and I was happy.</li>
            <li>Then I noticed that all the areas that were peeled and was looking great gradually got darker and darker each day.</li>
            <li>Happy with the results after a month.</li>
            <li>Great product and value for money.....</li>
            <li>No need to find anything else this worked great for me.  </li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>Even after two weeks, I still experienced flaking and redness.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten some beautiful results with this product-just as good as peels that cost up to $300 in a dermatologists office.</li>
            <li>amazing product!</li>
            <li>i love love it!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Nice!</li>
            <li>Ok, so I bought this based on some of the excellent reviews.</li>
            <li>THe most amazing peel out there!!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t visibly peel from this, but something good is going on...</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;you can add up to 5 layers&amp;#34; With that said its good to get the acid neutralizer from Dermalure</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s it, enjoy this awesome product!!!!!</li>
            <li>REALLY REALLY STRONG PEEL!!</li>
            <li>if you have more skin products on Amazon because I&#x27;m not going to buy anything for my skin that is not created by Dermalure, Thank you and have a wonderful weekend! :)</li>
            <li>This is really powerful TCA (great quality!)  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase of 50% TCA chemical peel from dermagevity at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>The delivery was quicker than anticipated, and I could ask for nothing more!</li>
            <li>but I am pleased to say that 90% of the tattoo is gone, and just in time for spring!  </li>
            <li>This peel is very effective and it is strong.</li>
            <li>Amazing results</li>
            <li>This peel is amazing.</li>
            <li>sometimes I now fantasize about giving strangers TCA peels to see how amazing they&#x27;d look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>honestly, I haven&#x27;t even used this yet</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>and it really was great!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with how everything looks.</li>
            <li>(I own an online jewelry company</li>
            <li>leave the baking soda paste on while I wait for shower to warm up</li>
            <li>so listen to me at your own risk...</li>
            <li>I made my own salves with vaseline and emu oil.  </li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;m very fair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong</li>
            <li>this is very strong and could do permanent damage.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very strong so use caution</li>
            <li>Beginners beware, it is very strong.</li>
            <li>Very very strong.... WILL BURN THE SKIN .  </li>
            <li>Wooooweeee this is strong stuff!</li>
            <li>For myself, I do not use the peel full strength, I dilute it to 20-25% strength-- 20-25% is strong in itself for my skin, but this strength works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good for spot treating, frosted really quickly.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving it on more than 3 mins (you can up to 5)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I have always been pleased with products from Dermalure.  </li>
            <li>I will be extremely satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>i so so love this ......</li>
            <li>-I thought for sure this would do it.</li>
            <li>My lines from nose to mouth-and lines mouth to chin are better on one side-</li>
            <li>IF done correctly LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now decided that a cover up tattoo will be better.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m actually quite impressed.</li>
            <li>If you decideto do a TCA peel make sure you follow the enclosed directions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad a friend of mine turned me onto this.</li>
            <li>You will not be able to go out for couple weeks.</li>
            <li>Gladly I did not leave on any longer.  </li>
            <li>just so you know shipping was great and fast.</li>
            <li>I was able to use this under my eyes with no pain at all or sting</li>
            <li>remember you can always add more</li>
            <li>anything more than that will burn your skin..</li>
            <li>only for the experienced users!!!</li>
            <li>I will do better in about 2 weeks</li>
            <li>please recommend your favorite brand ....</li>
            <li>Also like others have said make sure you have done these before using a 50%.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and I am SO glad I did.</li>
            <li>the 1st one i diluted this solution to 25% and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-frosted within like 20 seconds; applied 2 more layers at 1 minute and 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;--at</li>
            <li>At the most, I was hopeful that increased application time would lead to even BETTER results.</li>
            <li>Sunday, i woke up and overnight the scab seemed like 70% better.</li>
            <li>ok so I&#x27;ve seen some stuff about how rinsing with water will neutralize TCA...</li>
            <li>scars-definitely better; still work to be done</li>
            <li>but I think was more like 37.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will update this in another week or two, because this may have significantly improved my stretch mark appearance, and after trying about 5 products or methods to treat mine to no effect, it would be nice to pass it along.</li>
            <li>so I was excited!</li>
            <li>i was happy with the progress, but it appeared that the peeling was basically a kind of \\&quot;initial</li>
            <li>make sure you read ALL steps and follow them, my first time using this i was able to have my body freckles peel off... literally!</li>
            <li>before peel clean skin off with rubbing alcohol, it will be able to peel more efficiently&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it helps the pain and healing process go faster and more smoothly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with these results so far.  </li>
            <li>It is absolutely NOT for use by home users who would be best served by 10-20% glycolic acid.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect TCA product without additives you may see in other TCA type products.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been a pretty process ( lots of peeling, rednes, and more pain than the tattoo itself!)</li>
            <li>thoughtI could easily tolerate this one.</li>
            <li>This will burn through skin very quickly.</li>
            <li>the review is mostly for the 2nd time, since almost all of the reviews talk about what I experienced the 1st time, i&#x27;m not going to go into it out of consideration for your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Strong, i just waiting to see my results</li>
            <li>Too strong</li>
            <li>and I see a difference already just hope its not too strong since I&#x27;m doing this at home</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t know that this peel was as strong as it is.</li>
            <li>It is VERYYYYYYYYY (Xs100000) STRONG .</li>
            <li>ITS STRONG.</li>
            <li>So TCA is definitely strong acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but yooo this thing is strong as hell</li>
            <li>This was way too strong and I wouldn&#x27;t recomend it.  </li>
            <li>I am fair and not thick skinned.</li>
            <li>Just feels good to revel new skin.</li>
            <li>I have had three TCA peels done by a licensed esthetician with wonderful results and little downtime (swelling, redness, peeling)</li>
            <li>but this seems to have smooth the level of the marks as well.</li>
            <li>in all, I wish I went to a dermatologist after doing it myself, since it was basically my second peel ever, but I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Great product for facial peels.  </li>
            <li>Hope you enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Great care must be used with this product as this is the REAL DEAL--and is very concentrated.</li>
            <li>It does hurt, so have it ready!!!</li>
            <li>pH scale for Acids range from 1-14, 1 being super strong acids (like stomach</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE REAL DEAL AND VERY STRONG PEEL ,SO USE WITH CAUTION AND HAVE ATLEAST 2 WEEKS OFF IF DONE ON FACE.</li>
            <li>It will give a super skin peel as good as any professional peel.</li>
            <li>OK, first, read the instructions twice.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m pretty sure the coloring is better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The idea that I&#x27;d done major damage was becoming much more real, but I had a flicker of hope that this process was nothing more than a better, deeper peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t do more than one layer (gets pretty intense if you apply more, but again can go up to 5)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>This is the kind of peel that I really think is best suited to those who have either had a peel from a physician&#x27;s office and know what to expect, or have used slightly less potent peels and want to take it to the next level.  </li>
            <li>I have had great results with this but would echo others noting this is absolutely not for beginners.</li>
            <li>Ok fast forward.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Chef/Caterer by profession and have a gig Wednesday night and really hopeful my face will look much, much better by then.</li>
            <li>Please make Sure to do a spot where no one can see before doing your whole face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;so, even though i&#x27;m a prime example of why people warn you NOT to do peels like this at home, my skin ended up looking great due to the increased depth of the peel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After applying the peel, my skin quickly went into the healing process.</li>
            <li>You can rarely find such good quality products online</li>
            <li>Wash your face with a mild cleanser.</li>
            <li>much weaker solution (10%), or even better a weaker acid such as glycolic (Glytone Ultra Heel and Elbow cream at 30% glycolic acid is a great and safe way to start) to understand how your individual skin type reacts to treatment.  </li>
            <li>i honestly don&#x27;t know if they helped that much, and were getting super intense around day 12</li>
            <li>I think if your smart you won&#x27;t keep putting more on the sensitive area&#x27;s that don&#x27;t need more the one coat.</li>
            <li>I think after one or two more peel they will be completely gone!!</li>
            <li>This company has great products that come with detailed instructions, plus a note at the beginning :For Professional Use Only, followed by a liability statement.</li>
            <li>This is a very highly concentrated acid used for strong chemical peels.  </li>
            <li>Anyone else have this happen??I made sure the peel was brand new and</li>
            <li>The product is really strong and really should be handle with care</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t recommend to anyone who hasn&#x27;t experienced peels before or done lots of research to mess with this stuff.</li>
            <li>This product does EXACTLY what it is intended to do!</li>
            <li>This is my own personal research and experience.</li>
            <li>i am hoping that i won&#x27;t have to do too much peels before they go away, but i love that it peels that fast....</li>
            <li>do not apply  directly on your face unless you are sure what you are doing.</li>
            <li>I figure that my acne scarring will be completely gone in a couple of months after a couple more applications.</li>
            <li>I just love this product.i have used several uses and it gets my blemishes off and makes my skin smooth</li>
            <li>and when you look like complete shiz...you will heal and you will love the results...</li>
            <li>I use a much gentler peel on my face, but this stuff is very powerful.</li>
            <li>sure what this particular brand&#x27;s pH is (even though it&#x27;s probably on the bottle or something) but anything under 3 is gonna be intense.</li>
            <li>Some area&#x27;s frosted right away</li>
            <li>It was deliver right on time.</li>
            <li>I figured right away</li>
            <li>and i was right.</li>
            <li>I use this product for the first time last week, it is highly effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure that the overnight healing was a combination of the natural progression of the scabbing, plus the Bio-Oil.</li>
            <li>so this would be my fresh new face!!!</li>
            <li>very strong peel will leave scars if not used properly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong however just add equal amount of water to get a 25% .</li>
            <li>my skin was getting crinkling and peeling, and within eight to ten days my skin was recovering from the peeling, still peeling any leftover skin and the new skin was revealing itself and coming together--showing up brightly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fading really nicely but takes a long time.</li>
            <li>My first application went well, the only thing is there was one area that frosted more quickly than the rest of my skin on my face, and penetrated a bit deeper.</li>
            <li>If to many people find out that they could do the same exact thing at home for a fraction of the price, spas would lose millions!</li>
            <li>Please be very cautious and take it off in less than 30 seconds if you are not used to this kind of strong peels.</li>
            <li>I have used 2 bottles of the TCA peel for removal of a small, but bright , red rose tattoo on my ankle.</li>
            <li>The pain was VERY intense.</li>
            <li>go out in the sun without SPF of 30+ or higher.</li>
            <li>I will probably do a second peel in another 2-3 months if the color evens out, otherwise I will see a dermatologist to get more peace of mind with the color</li>
            <li>The paste can be applied with a Q-Tip to hot spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>.....the first time i used it.....</li>
            <li>At first it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li>Follow an exact protocol and err on the side of caution.  </li>
            <li>The skin also has to regenerate itself over time to fill the holes and get a smoother look so it will only get better.</li>
            <li>The results from the first application were staggering.</li>
            <li>I warm others, be careful when considering to buy and use this stuff</li>
            <li>You should prep your face first and use a calming creame after.</li>
            <li>I also used hyaluronic acid serum in my regular lotion and some aquaphor on top</li>
            <li>I observed Blowdryer Speed to be dependent on whether I was in the mood to have hot air blasts</li>
            <li>noticed I DEFINITELY had wayyyy more peeling, and it&#x27;d start to ramp up like 3-4 hours after blow drying with heat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first 25% TCA took 6 days to heal and 50% was about 14 days exactly</li>
            <li>You must not wash, or apply creams in the first 48 hours..</li>
            <li>Please anyonme who is thining of using 30% or higher</li>
            <li>read how it&#x27;s super important to \\&quot;defat facial</li>
            <li>I will update in the need few days how this went so far it&#x27;s going great</li>
            <li>Did the job, but be careful with it as its very strong</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t leave it on for very long at first (maybe a minute) and make sure you have a buffering solution on hand.  </li>
            <li>thanks so much!</li>
            <li>then take a cotton swab and put some TCA on the swab, gently touch your face, GENTLY!</li>
            <li>This product is the first TCA I&#x27;ve ever purchased that really seems spot on in the accuracy of its claims.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, for me, it took about ten days to heal (light scabs, and most noticeably, the skin above my lip did swell).</li>
            <li>Very useful product, thw warts turn white right away, I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>applied the acid with a q tip only applying to the stretch marks lines, I basically have 4 streaks on each side, so it was easy to isolate the marks.</li>
            <li>The price is certainly right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, how it works is the more layers you put on the deeper the peel, if you have acne pits you may want to hit that area with more layers, again add a little at a time, do NOT just soak your entire face with TCA</li>
            <li>The instructions that come with it aren&#x27;t very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although at this point, I am confident the pink color will reduce as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works very well for me</li>
            <li>But about ready to do it again?</li>
            <li>I must say I was very relieved when I found out</li>
            <li>This turn out to be very costly and the discomfort</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about chemicals</li>
            <li>I peeled the skin off before it was ready, but</li>
            <li>I never peeled this much with glycolic acid.</li>
            <li>/the glycolic reviews said the burning was intense and was not for me/</li>
            <li>This is the real stuff</li>
            <li>if you apply too much it will scar then.</li>
            <li>This product really will make your skin smoother and gets out the craters in your face.</li>
            <li>You run the real risk of burning yourself if you don&#x27;t understand how these compounds work.  </li>
            <li>and this is Much stronger than a V peel at a salon.</li>
            <li>and you have to be instantly ready with plenty of water</li>
            <li>Since you can dilute the 50% TCA to 25%, I figured it might be helpful for someone who wants to reduce this product&#x27;s concentration to 25%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it felt like Satan had sneezed in my face for that whole time.</li>
            <li>i used aquaphor, eucerin cream, neosporin, emu oil, tri derma fast healing cream, etc.</li>
            <li>(I had my baking soda ready this time...</li>
            <li>-Saturday night-pretty much DONE PEELING (day 4)&lt;br /</li>
            <li>then you can wash sparingly and apply as much ointment as you like.</li>
            <li>I have been very blessed to find this peel.</li>
            <li>I did an even coat on my whole face and in the problem areas sdid 2 or 3 layers.</li>
            <li>The company is truthful when it states for Professional Use Only.</li>
            <li>WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO HEAR FROM ANYONE WHO TRIES THE TECHNIQUE I DESCRIBE IN MY 3RD PEEL EXPERIENCE</li>
            <li>The places that frosted right after on coat with the sensitive area&#x27;s my cheeks and my temples.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- make sure you squeeze the excess off the Q-tip/cotton pad before applying&lt;br /&gt;- apply the antibacterial for the first 2 days, for the remain days moisturize your skin daily if you can do it multiple times a day</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and arrived early.  </li>
            <li>Has taken a full month of scabs on my tattoo and all it did was lighten then a tiny bit.</li>
            <li>I would also strongly recommend using it on very limited areas</li>
            <li>I used baking soda for a neutralizer, I mixed it with water once and splashed it on my face and this quickly stopped the peels reaction.</li>
            <li>they said mixing a teaspoon of white vinegar was a good \\&quot;debriding agent\\&quot; after a TCA peel (a debriding agent means it helps loosen and get rid of dead skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so be careful it is strong.</li>
            <li>If you misuse this you will run a high risk of chemical burns and even skin scars.</li>
            <li>your airbrush tan with blowdryer on high heat for about 20-30 min</li>
            <li>I decided to buy a higher % with lower PH and dilute it instead of constantly buying a new bottle of a higher strength.  </li>
            <li>if you remember to add as little as you can at a time you will really enjoy the results!</li>
            <li>This product, marketed at 50%, is not as strong as all my other purchased peels or TCAs labeled 20%, 25%, or 30%.</li>
            <li>I typing this right after I apply this to my face which is burning a little not bad at all no pain at all.</li>
            <li>Better to get no or a small effect initially because you washed it off too quickly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a peel that was strong enough for the body and finally I&#x27;ve met my match.</li>
            <li>i walked downstairs to quickly look at the reviews here on Amazon to see if the intense pain was common, and the wind on my face from walking quickly intensified the pain.</li>
            <li>I am now on my third week after the peel, the areas treated is still a light pink, but the red/purple stretch marks I was treating are also pink, and blend into my skin tone MUCH better.</li>
            <li>I was a little scared at first when I did the full 50% but only did one coat and didn&#x27;t need to use baking soda or any thing to naturalize the sting stopped with in five mins and you can feel it tighting right away</li>
            <li>After frosting I left it on for another minute, then decided to neutralize considering it was my first TCA peel and did not want to damage my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do not waste you money on this!</li>
            <li>I bought the 50% and diluted it to 25% because I was worried it may be a little too strong.  </li>
            <li>This is strong stuff, especially if you choose to layer it in a single use.</li>
            <li>It was actually very mild for me and was able to leave it on for 15 mins or so without any crazy burning.</li>
            <li>I am going to use it only for spot treatments and not to cover large areas any longer.</li>
            <li>Because this is an intense peel, I would definitely do a test patch prior to using it on a large area of the face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- have a bowl of ice water and some type of pad, I personally used face wash pad with soft/rough side (use soft side,obviously) ready to pat the ice water on.</li>
            <li>The product description was clear.</li>
            <li>My marks started to clear up, even tho</li>
            <li>and use clear, sparkly nail polish to protect the skin around them).  </li>
            <li>My only concern is the pinkish color, but even if they stay pink, it is better than purple and red.</li>
            <li>One word of caution---either dilute it, or get a lower concentration, when using it on soft skin areas.</li>
            <li>I had totally unexpected results.  </li>
            <li>See above about having paste ready.  </li>
            <li>The face results were totally unexpected.  </li>
            <li>Should be a professional to use this product.</li>
            <li>I know they say professional use</li>
            <li>I have lost so much of the pigmentation in my skin it will take months gain for the pigmentation to back.  </li>
            <li>it is much shallower and smaller in diameter.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted at 50% medical grade peel, and I did not have that experience with this product.</li>
            <li>Baking soda and water completely neutrilizes itt.</li>
            <li>My skin experience darkened pigment in 2 areas; one of which was completely \\&quot;peelable\\</li>
            <li>but I have old skin on my hands but not my face</li>
            <li>I have had peels done professionally but not a TCA.</li>
            <li>Only thing is it cannot be used very often</li>
            <li>I know is my baking soda paste stops the stinging completely, which my brain interprets as&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;ACID.</li>
            <li>they either have some kind of agenda or they lack the simple common sense to use this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Water has a NEUTRAL pH-7, right smack dab in the middle of the pH scale, neither acidic nor basic..</li>
            <li>sure I&#x27;d have heavy duty shedding!!</li>
            <li>Do not go in applying the peel too excitedly without following the instructions carefully.</li>
            <li>Marks such as sun spots light wrinkles and rough spots go away!</li>
            <li>Product is exactly what I expected and shipped professionally packed.</li>
            <li>but I plan to use it full strength again and use baking soda to neutralize after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then I run cool water on face for a few minutes...</li>
            <li>It fixed the burning, softened the texture completely, and the white disappeared.</li>
            <li>I honestly should have purchased no more than a 35% solution, perhaps less.</li>
            <li>My skin surface is rough in certain places.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I started to notice a difference in pore size, \\&quot;depth\\&quot;, and general clogged-ness around my nose.</li>
            <li>I have purchased several professional grade peels and TCAs.</li>
            <li>I only had in on for 20 seconds before getting it completely removed with water and neutralizer.  </li>
            <li>It did not burn so much in this area, but did not really peel or create darkening.  </li>
            <li>I also used it while healing from my 1st TCA peel, and I only took about 6 days to completely recover from that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>get too comfortable, and get sloppy with the solutions application, this is a powerful solution and you should go in being careful each time.</li>
            <li>In the first three days my skin looked like it received a slight tan, then from four to seven days</li>
            <li>It burns a lot more than the other peels I have done in the past</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a straight mathematical matchup with the pH values; I&#x27;m just kickin info that might help you NOT look like a Crusty Hose Beast for 2 weeks straight like I did.  </li>
            <li>This acid can be used for spot treatment to remove various lesions but is too concentrated for treatment of broad areas.</li>
            <li>(a little goes a long, long way, so it&#x27;s cheap) and just repeat than to over do it and get prolonged redness or damage.  </li>
            <li>apparently the results are more typical of deep peels but don&#x27;t have the usual drawbacks of increased downtime like, say, 50% TCA on</li>
            <li>I have used this product for 3 months on some deep wrinkles around my neck but never saw any results, maybe this works on fine lines and other minor skin conditions, but I would try a higher dose with dilution for some of the serious conditions.</li>
            <li>I believe the skin is still recovering from the acid peel, since I got some acid on my normal skin during the peel, and that spot is pink as well (absent the stretch</li>
            <li>A real TCA solution, not a watered down version.</li>
            <li>The rest of my forehead is still a slight shade darkened, which is barely noticeable or only noticeable to my eye or someone looking very closely.  </li>
            <li>On my arms, I had little pain with the application and the spots were obviously lightened with the first application.</li>
            <li>I wanted to be very aggressive(*of coarse careful too!!)</li>
            <li>; peeling like crazy; spent free time googling TCA peels and true crime articles&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I have deep ice pick scars on my right cheek, it causes my skin to look very uneven an bumpy.</li>
            <li>definitely more shallow and the dark pigmentation</li>
            <li>the good out weigh the bad.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s it, enjoy this awesome product!!!!!</li>
            <li> REALLY REALLY STRONG PEEL!!</li>
            <li> if you have more skin products on Amazon because I&#x27;m not going to buy anything for my skin that is not created by Dermalure, Thank you and have a wonderful weekend! :)</li>
            <li> This is really powerful TCA (great quality!)  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase of 50% TCA chemical peel from dermagevity at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> The delivery was quicker than anticipated, and I could ask for nothing more!</li>
            <li> but I am pleased to say that 90% of the tattoo is gone, and just in time for spring!  </li>
            <li> This peel is very effective and it is strong.</li>
            <li> Amazing results</li>
            <li> This peel is amazing.</li>
            <li> sometimes I now fantasize about giving strangers TCA peels to see how amazing they&#x27;d look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> honestly, I haven&#x27;t even used this yet</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> and it really was great!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with how everything looks.</li>
            <li> (I own an online jewelry company</li>
            <li> leave the baking soda paste on while I wait for shower to warm up</li>
            <li> so listen to me at your own risk...</li>
            <li> I made my own salves with vaseline and emu oil.  </li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m very fair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong</li>
            <li> this is very strong and could do permanent damage.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very strong so use caution</li>
            <li> Beginners beware, it is very strong.</li>
            <li> Very very strong.... WILL BURN THE SKIN .  </li>
            <li> Wooooweeee this is strong stuff!</li>
            <li> For myself, I do not use the peel full strength, I dilute it to 20-25% strength-- 20-25% is strong in itself for my skin, but this strength works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good for spot treating, frosted really quickly.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving it on more than 3 mins (you can up to 5)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I have always been pleased with products from Dermalure.  </li>
            <li> I will be extremely satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> i so so love this ......</li>
            <li> -I thought for sure this would do it.</li>
            <li> My lines from nose to mouth-and lines mouth to chin are better on one side-</li>
            <li> IF done correctly LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now decided that a cover up tattoo will be better.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m actually quite impressed.</li>
            <li> If you decideto do a TCA peel make sure you follow the enclosed directions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad a friend of mine turned me onto this.</li>
            <li> You will not be able to go out for couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Gladly I did not leave on any longer.  </li>
            <li> just so you know shipping was great and fast.</li>
            <li> I was able to use this under my eyes with no pain at all or sting</li>
            <li> remember you can always add more</li>
            <li> anything more than that will burn your skin..</li>
            <li> only for the experienced users!!!</li>
            <li> I will do better in about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> please recommend your favorite brand ....</li>
            <li> Also like others have said make sure you have done these before using a 50%.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and I am SO glad I did.</li>
            <li> the 1st one i diluted this solution to 25% and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-frosted within like 20 seconds; applied 2 more layers at 1 minute and 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;--at</li>
            <li> At the most, I was hopeful that increased application time would lead to even BETTER results.</li>
            <li> Sunday, i woke up and overnight the scab seemed like 70% better.</li>
            <li> ok so I&#x27;ve seen some stuff about how rinsing with water will neutralize TCA...</li>
            <li> scars-definitely better; still work to be done</li>
            <li> but I think was more like 37.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will update this in another week or two, because this may have significantly improved my stretch mark appearance, and after trying about 5 products or methods to treat mine to no effect, it would be nice to pass it along.</li>
            <li> so I was excited!</li>
            <li> i was happy with the progress, but it appeared that the peeling was basically a kind of \\&quot;initial</li>
            <li> make sure you read ALL steps and follow them, my first time using this i was able to have my body freckles peel off... literally!</li>
            <li> before peel clean skin off with rubbing alcohol, it will be able to peel more efficiently&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it helps the pain and healing process go faster and more smoothly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with these results so far.  </li>
            <li> It is absolutely NOT for use by home users who would be best served by 10-20% glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect TCA product without additives you may see in other TCA type products.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been a pretty process ( lots of peeling, rednes, and more pain than the tattoo itself!)</li>
            <li> thoughtI could easily tolerate this one.</li>
            <li> This will burn through skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> the review is mostly for the 2nd time, since almost all of the reviews talk about what I experienced the 1st time, i&#x27;m not going to go into it out of consideration for your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Strong, i just waiting to see my results</li>
            <li> Too strong</li>
            <li> and I see a difference already just hope its not too strong since I&#x27;m doing this at home</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t know that this peel was as strong as it is.</li>
            <li> It is VERYYYYYYYYY (Xs100000) STRONG .</li>
            <li> ITS STRONG.</li>
            <li> So TCA is definitely strong acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but yooo this thing is strong as hell</li>
            <li> This was way too strong and I wouldn&#x27;t recomend it.  </li>
            <li> I am fair and not thick skinned.</li>
            <li> Just feels good to revel new skin.</li>
            <li> I have had three TCA peels done by a licensed esthetician with wonderful results and little downtime (swelling, redness, peeling)</li>
            <li> but this seems to have smooth the level of the marks as well.</li>
            <li> in all, I wish I went to a dermatologist after doing it myself, since it was basically my second peel ever, but I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Great product for facial peels.  </li>
            <li> Hope you enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Great care must be used with this product as this is the REAL DEAL--and is very concentrated.</li>
            <li> It does hurt, so have it ready!!!</li>
            <li> pH scale for Acids range from 1-14, 1 being super strong acids (like stomach</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE REAL DEAL AND VERY STRONG PEEL ,SO USE WITH CAUTION AND HAVE ATLEAST 2 WEEKS OFF IF DONE ON FACE.</li>
            <li> It will give a super skin peel as good as any professional peel.</li>
            <li> OK, first, read the instructions twice.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m pretty sure the coloring is better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The idea that I&#x27;d done major damage was becoming much more real, but I had a flicker of hope that this process was nothing more than a better, deeper peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t do more than one layer (gets pretty intense if you apply more, but again can go up to 5)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> This is the kind of peel that I really think is best suited to those who have either had a peel from a physician&#x27;s office and know what to expect, or have used slightly less potent peels and want to take it to the next level.  </li>
            <li> I have had great results with this but would echo others noting this is absolutely not for beginners.</li>
            <li> Ok fast forward.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Chef/Caterer by profession and have a gig Wednesday night and really hopeful my face will look much, much better by then.</li>
            <li> Please make Sure to do a spot where no one can see before doing your whole face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;so, even though i&#x27;m a prime example of why people warn you NOT to do peels like this at home, my skin ended up looking great due to the increased depth of the peel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After applying the peel, my skin quickly went into the healing process.</li>
            <li> You can rarely find such good quality products online</li>
            <li> Wash your face with a mild cleanser.</li>
            <li> much weaker solution (10%), or even better a weaker acid such as glycolic (Glytone Ultra Heel and Elbow cream at 30% glycolic acid is a great and safe way to start) to understand how your individual skin type reacts to treatment.  </li>
            <li> i honestly don&#x27;t know if they helped that much, and were getting super intense around day 12</li>
            <li> I think if your smart you won&#x27;t keep putting more on the sensitive area&#x27;s that don&#x27;t need more the one coat.</li>
            <li> I think after one or two more peel they will be completely gone!!</li>
            <li> This company has great products that come with detailed instructions, plus a note at the beginning :For Professional Use Only, followed by a liability statement.</li>
            <li> This is a very highly concentrated acid used for strong chemical peels.  </li>
            <li> Anyone else have this happen??I made sure the peel was brand new and</li>
            <li> The product is really strong and really should be handle with care</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t recommend to anyone who hasn&#x27;t experienced peels before or done lots of research to mess with this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product does EXACTLY what it is intended to do!</li>
            <li> This is my own personal research and experience.</li>
            <li> i am hoping that i won&#x27;t have to do too much peels before they go away, but i love that it peels that fast....</li>
            <li> do not apply  directly on your face unless you are sure what you are doing.</li>
            <li> I figure that my acne scarring will be completely gone in a couple of months after a couple more applications.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.i have used several uses and it gets my blemishes off and makes my skin smooth</li>
            <li> and when you look like complete shiz...you will heal and you will love the results...</li>
            <li> I use a much gentler peel on my face, but this stuff is very powerful.</li>
            <li> sure what this particular brand&#x27;s pH is (even though it&#x27;s probably on the bottle or something) but anything under 3 is gonna be intense.</li>
            <li> Some area&#x27;s frosted right away</li>
            <li> It was deliver right on time.</li>
            <li> I figured right away</li>
            <li> and i was right.</li>
            <li> I use this product for the first time last week, it is highly effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure that the overnight healing was a combination of the natural progression of the scabbing, plus the Bio-Oil.</li>
            <li> so this would be my fresh new face!!!</li>
            <li> very strong peel will leave scars if not used properly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong however just add equal amount of water to get a 25% .</li>
            <li> my skin was getting crinkling and peeling, and within eight to ten days my skin was recovering from the peeling, still peeling any leftover skin and the new skin was revealing itself and coming together--showing up brightly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fading really nicely but takes a long time.</li>
            <li> My first application went well, the only thing is there was one area that frosted more quickly than the rest of my skin on my face, and penetrated a bit deeper.</li>
            <li> If to many people find out that they could do the same exact thing at home for a fraction of the price, spas would lose millions!</li>
            <li> Please be very cautious and take it off in less than 30 seconds if you are not used to this kind of strong peels.</li>
            <li> I have used 2 bottles of the TCA peel for removal of a small, but bright , red rose tattoo on my ankle.</li>
            <li> The pain was VERY intense.</li>
            <li> go out in the sun without SPF of 30+ or higher.</li>
            <li> I will probably do a second peel in another 2-3 months if the color evens out, otherwise I will see a dermatologist to get more peace of mind with the color</li>
            <li> The paste can be applied with a Q-Tip to hot spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> .....the first time i used it.....</li>
            <li> At first it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> Follow an exact protocol and err on the side of caution.  </li>
            <li> The skin also has to regenerate itself over time to fill the holes and get a smoother look so it will only get better.</li>
            <li> The results from the first application were staggering.</li>
            <li> I warm others, be careful when considering to buy and use this stuff</li>
            <li> You should prep your face first and use a calming creame after.</li>
            <li> I also used hyaluronic acid serum in my regular lotion and some aquaphor on top</li>
            <li> I observed Blowdryer Speed to be dependent on whether I was in the mood to have hot air blasts</li>
            <li> noticed I DEFINITELY had wayyyy more peeling, and it&#x27;d start to ramp up like 3-4 hours after blow drying with heat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first 25% TCA took 6 days to heal and 50% was about 14 days exactly</li>
            <li> You must not wash, or apply creams in the first 48 hours..</li>
            <li> Please anyonme who is thining of using 30% or higher</li>
            <li> read how it&#x27;s super important to \\&quot;defat facial</li>
            <li> I will update in the need few days how this went so far it&#x27;s going great</li>
            <li> Did the job, but be careful with it as its very strong</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave it on for very long at first (maybe a minute) and make sure you have a buffering solution on hand.  </li>
            <li> thanks so much!</li>
            <li> then take a cotton swab and put some TCA on the swab, gently touch your face, GENTLY!</li>
            <li> This product is the first TCA I&#x27;ve ever purchased that really seems spot on in the accuracy of its claims.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, for me, it took about ten days to heal (light scabs, and most noticeably, the skin above my lip did swell).</li>
            <li> Very useful product, thw warts turn white right away, I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> applied the acid with a q tip only applying to the stretch marks lines, I basically have 4 streaks on each side, so it was easy to isolate the marks.</li>
            <li> The price is certainly right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , how it works is the more layers you put on the deeper the peel, if you have acne pits you may want to hit that area with more layers, again add a little at a time, do NOT just soak your entire face with TCA</li>
            <li> The instructions that come with it aren&#x27;t very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although at this point, I am confident the pink color will reduce as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works very well for me</li>
            <li> But about ready to do it again?</li>
            <li> I must say I was very relieved when I found out</li>
            <li> This turn out to be very costly and the discomfort</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about chemicals</li>
            <li> I peeled the skin off before it was ready, but</li>
            <li> I never peeled this much with glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> /the glycolic reviews said the burning was intense and was not for me/</li>
            <li> This is the real stuff</li>
            <li> if you apply too much it will scar then.</li>
            <li> This product really will make your skin smoother and gets out the craters in your face.</li>
            <li> You run the real risk of burning yourself if you don&#x27;t understand how these compounds work.  </li>
            <li> and this is Much stronger than a V peel at a salon.</li>
            <li> and you have to be instantly ready with plenty of water</li>
            <li> Since you can dilute the 50% TCA to 25%, I figured it might be helpful for someone who wants to reduce this product&#x27;s concentration to 25%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it felt like Satan had sneezed in my face for that whole time.</li>
            <li> i used aquaphor, eucerin cream, neosporin, emu oil, tri derma fast healing cream, etc.</li>
            <li> (I had my baking soda ready this time...</li>
            <li> -Saturday night-pretty much DONE PEELING (day 4)&lt;br /</li>
            <li> then you can wash sparingly and apply as much ointment as you like.</li>
            <li> I have been very blessed to find this peel.</li>
            <li> I did an even coat on my whole face and in the problem areas sdid 2 or 3 layers.</li>
            <li> The company is truthful when it states for Professional Use Only.</li>
            <li> WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO HEAR FROM ANYONE WHO TRIES THE TECHNIQUE I DESCRIBE IN MY 3RD PEEL EXPERIENCE</li>
            <li> The places that frosted right after on coat with the sensitive area&#x27;s my cheeks and my temples.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- make sure you squeeze the excess off the Q-tip/cotton pad before applying&lt;br /&gt;- apply the antibacterial for the first 2 days, for the remain days moisturize your skin daily if you can do it multiple times a day</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and arrived early.  </li>
            <li> Has taken a full month of scabs on my tattoo and all it did was lighten then a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> I would also strongly recommend using it on very limited areas</li>
            <li> I used baking soda for a neutralizer, I mixed it with water once and splashed it on my face and this quickly stopped the peels reaction.</li>
            <li> they said mixing a teaspoon of white vinegar was a good \\&quot;debriding agent\\&quot; after a TCA peel (a debriding agent means it helps loosen and get rid of dead skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so be careful it is strong.</li>
            <li> If you misuse this you will run a high risk of chemical burns and even skin scars.</li>
            <li> your airbrush tan with blowdryer on high heat for about 20-30 min</li>
            <li> I decided to buy a higher % with lower PH and dilute it instead of constantly buying a new bottle of a higher strength.  </li>
            <li> if you remember to add as little as you can at a time you will really enjoy the results!</li>
            <li> This product, marketed at 50%, is not as strong as all my other purchased peels or TCAs labeled 20%, 25%, or 30%.</li>
            <li> I typing this right after I apply this to my face which is burning a little not bad at all no pain at all.</li>
            <li> Better to get no or a small effect initially because you washed it off too quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a peel that was strong enough for the body and finally I&#x27;ve met my match.</li>
            <li> i walked downstairs to quickly look at the reviews here on Amazon to see if the intense pain was common, and the wind on my face from walking quickly intensified the pain.</li>
            <li> I am now on my third week after the peel, the areas treated is still a light pink, but the red/purple stretch marks I was treating are also pink, and blend into my skin tone MUCH better.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared at first when I did the full 50% but only did one coat and didn&#x27;t need to use baking soda or any thing to naturalize the sting stopped with in five mins and you can feel it tighting right away</li>
            <li> After frosting I left it on for another minute, then decided to neutralize considering it was my first TCA peel and did not want to damage my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not waste you money on this!</li>
            <li> I bought the 50% and diluted it to 25% because I was worried it may be a little too strong.  </li>
            <li> This is strong stuff, especially if you choose to layer it in a single use.</li>
            <li> It was actually very mild for me and was able to leave it on for 15 mins or so without any crazy burning.</li>
            <li> I am going to use it only for spot treatments and not to cover large areas any longer.</li>
            <li> Because this is an intense peel, I would definitely do a test patch prior to using it on a large area of the face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- have a bowl of ice water and some type of pad, I personally used face wash pad with soft/rough side (use soft side,obviously) ready to pat the ice water on.</li>
            <li> The product description was clear.</li>
            <li> My marks started to clear up, even tho</li>
            <li> and use clear, sparkly nail polish to protect the skin around them).  </li>
            <li> My only concern is the pinkish color, but even if they stay pink, it is better than purple and red.</li>
            <li> One word of caution---either dilute it, or get a lower concentration, when using it on soft skin areas.</li>
            <li> I had totally unexpected results.  </li>
            <li> See above about having paste ready.  </li>
            <li> The face results were totally unexpected.  </li>
            <li> Should be a professional to use this product.</li>
            <li> I know they say professional use</li>
            <li> I have lost so much of the pigmentation in my skin it will take months gain for the pigmentation to back.  </li>
            <li> it is much shallower and smaller in diameter.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted at 50% medical grade peel, and I did not have that experience with this product.</li>
            <li> Baking soda and water completely neutrilizes itt.</li>
            <li> My skin experience darkened pigment in 2 areas; one of which was completely \\&quot;peelable\\</li>
            <li> but I have old skin on my hands but not my face</li>
            <li> I have had peels done professionally but not a TCA.</li>
            <li> Only thing is it cannot be used very often</li>
            <li> I know is my baking soda paste stops the stinging completely, which my brain interprets as&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;ACID.</li>
            <li> they either have some kind of agenda or they lack the simple common sense to use this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Water has a NEUTRAL pH-7, right smack dab in the middle of the pH scale, neither acidic nor basic..</li>
            <li> sure I&#x27;d have heavy duty shedding!!</li>
            <li> Do not go in applying the peel too excitedly without following the instructions carefully.</li>
            <li> Marks such as sun spots light wrinkles and rough spots go away!</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what I expected and shipped professionally packed.</li>
            <li> but I plan to use it full strength again and use baking soda to neutralize after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then I run cool water on face for a few minutes...</li>
            <li> It fixed the burning, softened the texture completely, and the white disappeared.</li>
            <li> I honestly should have purchased no more than a 35% solution, perhaps less.</li>
            <li> My skin surface is rough in certain places.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I started to notice a difference in pore size, \\&quot;depth\\&quot;, and general clogged-ness around my nose.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several professional grade peels and TCAs.</li>
            <li> I only had in on for 20 seconds before getting it completely removed with water and neutralizer.  </li>
            <li> It did not burn so much in this area, but did not really peel or create darkening.  </li>
            <li> I also used it while healing from my 1st TCA peel, and I only took about 6 days to completely recover from that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> get too comfortable, and get sloppy with the solutions application, this is a powerful solution and you should go in being careful each time.</li>
            <li> In the first three days my skin looked like it received a slight tan, then from four to seven days</li>
            <li> It burns a lot more than the other peels I have done in the past</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a straight mathematical matchup with the pH values; I&#x27;m just kickin info that might help you NOT look like a Crusty Hose Beast for 2 weeks straight like I did.  </li>
            <li> This acid can be used for spot treatment to remove various lesions but is too concentrated for treatment of broad areas.</li>
            <li> (a little goes a long, long way, so it&#x27;s cheap) and just repeat than to over do it and get prolonged redness or damage.  </li>
            <li> apparently the results are more typical of deep peels but don&#x27;t have the usual drawbacks of increased downtime like, say, 50% TCA on</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 3 months on some deep wrinkles around my neck but never saw any results, maybe this works on fine lines and other minor skin conditions, but I would try a higher dose with dilution for some of the serious conditions.</li>
            <li> I believe the skin is still recovering from the acid peel, since I got some acid on my normal skin during the peel, and that spot is pink as well (absent the stretch</li>
            <li> A real TCA solution, not a watered down version.</li>
            <li> The rest of my forehead is still a slight shade darkened, which is barely noticeable or only noticeable to my eye or someone looking very closely.  </li>
            <li> On my arms, I had little pain with the application and the spots were obviously lightened with the first application.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be very aggressive(*of coarse careful too!!)</li>
            <li> ; peeling like crazy; spent free time googling TCA peels and true crime articles&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I have deep ice pick scars on my right cheek, it causes my skin to look very uneven an bumpy.</li>
            <li> definitely more shallow and the dark pigmentation</li>
            <li> the good out weigh the bad.</li>
            <li> &quot; so my entire face was was hard and white for about 12 minutes (it could&#x27;ve been anywhere from 10-15 min, but i stopped my timer and kinda lost my perception of exact</li>
            <li> I DEFINITELY won&#x27;t leave it on that long next time</li>
            <li> I am a Black woman but a darn near White person in skin tone.</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this product works, but you really need to try out small area&#x27;s on your body to see how it works in each area.</li>
            <li> they usually have seems much lighter.</li>
            <li> You read abt my nightmare with 50% TCA being left on too long bc</li>
            <li> I put 50% on one of my hands today after cleaning it and getting it ready to apply than I diluted it by half and did my other hand.</li>
            <li> i was certain i&#x27;d done permanent damage, and was pretty mad at myself for being impatient, haha.</li>
            <li> My only advice is don&#x27;t pick wait until the dry skin falls out.</li>
            <li> I have used TCS 25 few times before but this was definitely much stronger than I expected.</li>
            <li> This thing stung very badly, I had to neutralize it with baking soda and water, even afterward it still stung, but my results so far are good.</li>
            <li> but I know it&#x27;s not a normal pore) and used this in a TCA Cross method to try and get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> and I turned just a little dark in certain areas but</li>
            <li> I did the other hand with 25 % and had to put three layers on it to get the same as the 50 % which I applied only one layer.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this stuff, at first you dont think it is doing anything, then the slight burn, but the next few days you see skin dryed darker and peeling.</li>
            <li> as long as you know what your doing it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> If you take off the dead skin too early, you can get an infection, scar, and healing time can take months....</li>
            <li> I figured it&#x27;d be the same with TCA peels since it initiates a prolonged chemical reaction; i.e. denaturation-which is a fancy word for causes the break down of proteins in our facial skin cells.</li>
            <li> P.S by a little at a time I mean barely touch your face with the TCA on the cotton swab, you don&#x27;t need much of this product to work, you will be surprised at how little</li>
            <li> the next week, I went through another phase of peeling that I think was due to accidentally leaving it on too long.</li>
            <li> then rinse with cold water, pat dry and leave your face alone, yes, for 48 hours! :)</li>
            <li> With one or two spots that were darker, which I just believe was due to the peel going deeper from the extra layer.</li>
            <li> (It actually peeled off sooner than the other skin)</li>
            <li> Then I started using it every other day BEFORE washing my face, leaving it on for only about 60 seconds, and then rinsing and then cleansing.</li>
            <li> (so take care on follow-up peels, you don&#x27;t need to leave it on for very long).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d spray the solution on the gauze every 2-3 minutes when the fabric seemed dry.</li>
            <li> week prior I used a heavy exfoliating towel on the area, and immediately prior I used rubbing alcohol on the area.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other side started peeling around day 12 and the skin beneath was the same color pink.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for dark skin people it has been 2 weeks since I used this product and my skin is totally discolored.  </li>
            <li> I will also say that my stretch marks were by no means severe, just around 7 maybe 1/8 inch wide 3 inch long marks.</li>
            <li> No infection present and no major concerns, though I am taking a two day round of Cortisone tablets to reduce the swelling quicker and some ointment.</li>
            <li> My face felt extremely tight and very red but didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I did the Aquaphor/gauze routine twice a day and left it on for at least 4 hours each time, overall probably</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not ready to give up.</li>
            <li> So please... be careful.</li>
            <li> It works just as expected - I&#x27;ve used it off and on to kill pre-cancer skin cells.</li>
            <li> I will use the product until it is empty, but I will not purchase the product again.</li>
            <li> so please be careful and follow directions.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t reapply it in the frosted area&#x27;s only in the area that didn&#x27;t frost wait a few minutes after each layer to give it time to frost over.</li>
            <li> but that is expected since it is stronger.</li>
            <li> This was to harsh on myself, I should have gotten a lesser %</li>
            <li> Although the skin was \\&quot;raised\\&quot;, the scabs were much softer and the flaking was dramatically decreased.</li>
            <li> Destroying that upper layer with the TCA acid is literally what makes us peel</li>
            <li> (DISCLAIMER: I&#x27;m kind of retarded</li>
            <li> Plain baking soda mixed with water into a paste works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious if other people try it what their outcomes are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acne</li>
            <li> Way past any sunburn I have ever had, but the pain and throbbing were similar to sunburn.</li>
            <li> But the other side still had not peeled, and it was the side I triple layered during the peel, so that concerned me a bit, but I just kept on with the Aquaphor for another week.</li>
            <li> Handle it with extreme care.</li>
            <li> I feel the need to review this product for other consumers.  </li>
            <li> Be careful this can burn your skin and leave it dark.</li>
            <li> The price beat every other place I could find.</li>
            <li> I had experience with Lactic Acid 85% and Glycolic-Lactic Acid Peel 35% in other areas of my skin.</li>
            <li> Not exactly scientific but</li>
            <li> /&gt;-i put this on full strength-i&#x27;m sick of having icepick acne scars and my skin is pretty tough due to tons of treatments over the years</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this much less expensive option than going to a spa for your facial peel needs.</li>
            <li> I applied with q-tip, but be very careful not for it to get on other areas not desired to peel or fade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve not used this before be very very careful -</li>
            <li> must be very careful while applying it.</li>
            <li> Be very careful.</li>
            <li> I went from major frosting to serious swelling and after 36 hours decided to have a dermatologist</li>
            <li> No heavy thick peels as I had thought!</li>
            <li> It turned out my skin was healing and the dark color will eventually rise to the surface and eventually peel like the other skin.</li>
            <li> the texture and appearance was hard, white and flaky.</li>
            <li> I just want to be objective and not leap to conclusions about what helped, but it&#x27;s hard for me not to feel that Bio-Oil is a holy grail of post-peel treatment.</li>
            <li> Kinda hard to say since I&#x27;m still really red,</li>
            <li> I had several huge, horrible \\&quot;scabs\\&quot; along my entire jawline, my nose, and my cheeks.</li>
            <li> After a day the spot looked like a dark, dye stain mark.  </li>
            <li> just say really think before you buy this expensive self injuring liquid.</li>
            <li> NOT FOR DARK SKIN PEOPLE-&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you want ur dark spots to get darker then used this product..</li>
            <li> MUST BUY if you have permanent scars or dark spots.</li>
            <li> My face turned dark red/brown and leathery for about 3-4 days before peeling.</li>
            <li> I water this down 50% before applying to my clients.</li>
            <li> My down time was so shorty bc</li>
            <li> I diluted this product down to what i thought was around 30%</li>
            <li> ever be careful !!</li>
            <li> Still, I am hoping that slightly darker shade will peel off/resolve by the end of the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ended up diluting it in half so 25%.</li>
            <li> On my neck I had little pain, but the liquid would run down into areas that didn&#x27;t need help.  </li>
            <li> This did get rid of them, but man, you won&#x27;t want to wear a tight collar for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> it was a little darker and wider.  </li>
            <li> I have icepick scars and little saucer looking scars and its been 6 days since the peel</li>
            <li> I got a little over zealous in my attempt to do at home chemical peel.  </li>
            <li> I purchase this product from Dermalure Skincare Professionals after trying other companies over the past few years.</li>
            <li> Works for very dark areas that you want to peel off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m letting people out there know a few things I wish I knew.</li>
            <li> Will update in a few days.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try on a few stretch marks I had on my shoulders from puberty and lifting, they always bothered me for some reason</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d applied that time with a paper towel and that gave an uneven peel, so i decided to do it again.</li>
            <li> they reminded me of dried up coral reef  or something like that</li>
            <li> i washed my poor scabby, cracking, red, flaky skin and applied the Bio-Oil and called it a night.</li>
            <li> : For some reason I always do TCA peels on a bit of a whim if I realize I can fanaggle a few days off</li>
            <li> &gt;cut the development time by a few hours at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> still but all the dead skin had basically fallen off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you rated this with a one star or two star because you had scarring or bad result, you didn&#x27;t use it right.</li>
            <li> I have a small black tattoo on my stomach, and a small star on my wrist that I&#x27;m wanting to get rid of.</li>
            <li> skin was incredibly raw and everything burned.</li>
            <li> but my skin (which is very sensitive) bad a dark burn mark that I am dealing with.</li>
            <li> does work for belmishes and small skin lesions.</li>
            <li> I am trying to reduce the redness of some stretch marks on my hips from excessive weight gain.</li>
            <li> Needless to say all the hype on here definitely scared me.</li>
            <li> Not sure what thats about.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re going to have to try a small area on your body to see what happens.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what to do as I followed all to a tee.</li>
            <li> Omg most awful thing you can do to your skin.</li>
            <li> Im so lazy.</li>
            <li> (im not sure</li>
            <li> but I could only let it be on my skin for a mere 5 seconds.</li>
            <li> it has been peeled in the past</li>
            <li> I suffered from chemical burns on my arm and face, this should be illegal to sell to the public</li>
            <li> Not sure what the heck is going on.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had tca peels in past.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i realized within a few clicks that BAKING SODA was what i needed!</li>
            <li> (sorry if i&#x27;m graphic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product to remove a small tattoo.</li>
            <li> Just tried it not sure of the results yet since its to soon</li>
            <li> Just be very careful with it!!!  </li>
            <li> You suggesting this be taken off the market because your stupid ass didn&#x27;t research it first</li>
            <li> It was definintely sped up by the Bio-Oil at the least, and it has continued to heal my skin during the past week.</li>
            <li> Laying down hurts, laying on my stomach is of course out of the question, even with antibiotic ointment on, the cracking, bleeding, peeling skin is really not happy, but again, can&#x27;t blame it since its ACID.</li>
            <li> after a minute or so as the acid sinks in it burns like crazy, but I knew it would hurt pretty bad since acid and all.</li>
            <li> The applications hardly hurt at all.  </li>
            <li> -i did the peel late Saturday night, and didn&#x27;t start to peel until Wednesday night.</li>
            <li> so the Bio-Oil was here late Saturday afternoon (14 day mark).</li>
            <li> I am slowly applying lighter coating each time to make the marks lighter.</li>
            <li> I quickly applied the solution with a cotton ball, HOLY CRAP!</li>
            <li> it didnt bother me as bad as the initial contact but still hurt like nothing else.</li>
            <li> I thought I gave myself chemical burns, since the areas were throbbing and painful to the touch, and I will clarify LOBSTER red.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t take it, but I will continue on my stomach despite the pain because thats the only way to get rid of the ugly</li>
            <li> i still had major frosting all over my face, and it seemed that the stupid neutralizer+water rinsing was making it \\&quot;harden.\\</li>
            <li> You will lose thick layers of skin at a time!</li>
            <li> i used this only on my body though, using it on face would be too hard for me because it is SO painful!</li>
            <li> you will not like it and you will be in unnecessary pain.</li>
            <li> Also, its leaving a really dark nasty scar.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not continuing this on my wrist in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the neutralizer was awful and weak and totally didn&#x27;t neutralize me.</li>
            <li> so at least I learned how to tackle that-but really confused that I didn&#x27;t shed like a snake!!</li>
            <li> My advice is to be real careful and expect to look terrible for at least 3 days.</li>
            <li> I mean 4 layers of 50%!!  </li>
            <li> What did I do wrong?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking scary at the moment.</li>
            <li> It was scary to go through</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t be afraid it stops on</li>
            <li> the stupid scabs seemed to be getting worse in terms of cracking, but since that was a change in something i was hopeful it might be a sign of progress.</li>
            <li> With that being said, I figured my skin was very tough and the tca peel would not burn as bad as people said.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s absolutely false!!  </li>
            <li> So bad I can&#x27;t leave the house.</li>
            <li> Extremely painful.</li>
            <li> -horrifically ugly</li>
            <li> I felt sick to my stomach and felt a panic attack coming on.</li>
            <li> I was so sick of worrying about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is stupid.</li>
            <li> AWFUL!</li>
            <li> it still burned my face, the results were awful.  </li>
            <li> I have horrible burns on my face day 4 of my treatment.</li>
            <li> This one burnt my face terribly on both my cheeks.</li>
            <li> At the worst, I feared I&#x27;d permanently disfigured</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Be careful with this stuff, at first you dont think it is doing anything, then the slight burn, but the next few days you see skin dryed darker and peeling. I applied with q-tip, but be very careful not for it to get on other areas not desired to peel or fade.&lt;br /&gt;It does work for belmishes and small skin lesions.</li>
            <li> Works great and does what it&#x27;s suppose to. It&#x27;s very strong and I don&#x27;t recommend to anyone who hasn&#x27;t experienced peels before or done lots of research to mess with this stuff. as long as you know what your doing it gets the job done.The instructions that come with it aren&#x27;t very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving it on more than 3 mins (you can up to 5)&lt;br /&gt;- wouldn&#x27;t do more than one layer (gets pretty intense if you apply more, but again can go up to 5)&lt;br /&gt;- wear gloves&lt;br /&gt;- do not apply antibacterial lotion until a couple hours after.. up to 24 hours as it can make the peel possibly go deeper&lt;br /&gt;- make sure you squeeze the excess off the Q-tip/cotton pad before applying&lt;br /&gt;- apply the antibacterial for the first 2 days, for the remain days moisturize your skin daily if you can do it multiple times a day, it helps the pain and healing process go faster and more smoothly&lt;br /&gt;- before peel clean skin off with rubbing alcohol, it will be able to peel more efficiently&lt;br /&gt;- DO NOT! pick the peeling off! you WILL scar.&lt;br /&gt;- DO NOT! go out in the sun without SPF of 30+ or higher. I wouldn&#x27;t go out period.&lt;br /&gt;- have a bowl of ice water and some type of pad, I personally used face wash pad with soft/rough side (use soft side,obviously) ready to pat the ice water on. if the water doesn&#x27;t stop the pain enough for you get baking soda and water create a paste and put it on the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am NOT a dermatologist at all. This is my own personal research and experience. I&#x27;m letting people out there know a few things I wish I knew.</li>
            <li> Have used peels for years and know risks  and benefits of peels.  You must know how to use 50% TCA, NOT for the novice!!!.  I have always been pleased with products from Dermalure.  A solid company.</li>
            <li> Works for what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know how to use it, who can tell me? thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I will start off with the fact that I have only done one glycolic acid peel prior to trying this. And I am by no means experienced in acid peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, the glycolic peel I tried did nothing for me, did not even peel. I am trying to reduce the redness of some stretch marks on my hips from excessive weight gain. S I figured this would be the perfect strength, since I was not using on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week prior I used a heavy exfoliating towel on the area, and immediately prior I used rubbing alcohol on the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the acid with a q tip only applying to the stretch marks lines, I basically have 4 streaks on each side, so it was easy to isolate the marks. I did not feel anything after about 2 minutes so I applied a second layer and after another 2 minutes I frosted on the areas. After frosting I left it on for another minute, then decided to neutralize considering it was my first TCA peel and did not want to damage my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say 30 minutes after neutralizing the acid, the areas I peeled were lobster red, at this point I freaked out. I thought I gave myself chemical burns, since the areas were throbbing and painful to the touch, and I will clarify LOBSTER red. Way past any sunburn I have ever had, but the pain and throbbing were similar to sunburn. I applied Aquaphor over the areas generously and gauze pads over to keep it from getting all over the place. I did the Aquaphor/gauze routine twice a day and left it on for at least 4 hours each time, overall probably 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The redness subsided in about 3 days (I probably should of written this sooner, my times might be a day off, but I was still freaking out at the time)  The pain lasted maybe 3 days as well, and 5 days after the peel I started to peel on one side. I did not pick or even touch the areas peeling, only slathered them with Aquaphor. At this point I still thought I damaged my skin since the redness prior was so severe, and was considering calling my dermatologist daily to admit my stupidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But like I said, one side started peeling in about 5-6 days, and the skin beneath was pinkish in tone. Which is where I started thinking that I did not damage my skin. But the other side still had not peeled, and it was the side I triple layered during the peel, so that concerned me a bit, but I just kept on with the Aquaphor for another week. The other side started peeling around day 12 and the skin beneath was the same color pink. With one or two spots that were darker, which I just believe was due to the peel going deeper from the extra layer. I am now on my third week after the peel, the areas treated is still a light pink, but the red/purple stretch marks I was treating are also pink, and blend into my skin tone MUCH better. I believe the skin is still recovering from the acid peel, since I got some acid on my normal skin during the peel, and that spot is pink as well (absent the stretch mark).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this in another week or two, because this may have significantly improved my stretch mark appearance, and after trying about 5 products or methods to treat mine to no effect, it would be nice to pass it along. I will also say that my stretch marks were by no means severe, just around 7 maybe 1/8 inch wide 3 inch long marks. I only intended to reduce the color difference (turn them white) but this seems to have smooth the level of the marks as well. My only concern is the pinkish color, but even if they stay pink, it is better than purple and red. Although at this point, I am confident the pink color will reduce as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I wish I went to a dermatologist after doing it myself, since it was basically my second peel ever, but I am happy with the results. I will probably do a second peel in another 2-3 months if the color evens out, otherwise I will see a dermatologist to get more peace of mind with the color differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit - 1 month after&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Definitely relieved, the redness drastically reduced, the stretch marks are basically the same color as they were pre peel, but I believe that they will fade further (since the spot I applied the TCA to without stretch marks is still the same color as the stretch marks I applied the acid to)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Will do another edit in another month, if the redness goes away I have a feeling I will be extremely satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Exactly as described and arrived early.  I would order from them again.</li>
            <li> This did what I needed it to do. Proceed with caution using this. This should only be used as a spot treatment, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Works for very dark areas that you want to peel off.</li>
            <li> very strong peel will leave scars if not used properly. Works very well for me</li>
            <li> I saw all the reviews on here so I decided to give this a try. I have deep ice pick scars on my right cheek, it causes my skin to look very uneven an bumpy. I just got this in the mail today and decided to go ahead and try it. Needless to say all the hype on here definitely scared me. I felt sick to my stomach and felt a panic attack coming on. (lol) I put Vaseline on my eyebrows and lips, diluted the TCA. (1 tsp TCA- 1tsp water&#x3D;25% solution). I quickly applied the solution with a cotton ball, HOLY CRAP! The pain was VERY intense. I think it says maximum 5 Mins, I barely left it on for two. I used baking soda as a neutralizer. My face did freeze but just in some spots? hmm. Not sure what thats about. I used the blow dryer over my face for 20 mins (I heard the heat accelerates healing time), and now it just looks like a sunburn. Still stinging and burning quite a bit. I would definitely do it again tho. Will update in a few days.</li>
            <li> Strong, i just waiting to see my results</li>
            <li> Great care must be used with this product as this is the REAL DEAL--and is very concentrated. Know what you are doing when using this product. However, with that said---this product is GREAT. It will give a super skin peel as good as any professional peel. One word of caution---either dilute it, or get a lower concentration, when using it on soft skin areas.</li>
            <li> OK, first, read the instructions twice. Second, mix a bowl of baking powder and water to make a paste.  They say not to use water with this product.  That is an understatement. If you have to get this off your face, water just spreads the acid around. And soap doesn&#x27;t help. The paste can be applied with a Q-Tip to hot spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to get rid of brown spots.  I&#x27;ve used it on my arms, hands, neck and face.  I had totally unexpected results.  You&#x27;re going to have to try a small area on your body to see what happens.  On my arms, I had little pain with the application and the spots were obviously lightened with the first application. On my hands, it hurt like the devil, and it took two applications to start to see lightening.  On my neck I had little pain, but the liquid would run down into areas that didn&#x27;t need help.  See above about having paste ready.  The neck had a couple of things doctors would call skin tags that I used. This did get rid of them, but man, you won&#x27;t want to wear a tight collar for 2 weeks. The face results were totally unexpected.  First, I&#x27;m very fair.  The applications hardly hurt at all.  But that was a problem because I actually burned myself in 3 spots.  17 days after application, and I still have red spots where the burns are healing.  It won&#x27;t leave scars, but that was not the desired results.  I used a lot of Bio Oil to help me heal.  FYI, that is a great product too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this product works, but you really need to try out small area&#x27;s on your body to see how it works in each area.</li>
            <li> i so so love this ......i bought this to get rid of stretch marks and it is doing just that.....the first time i used it..... within 3 days the skin where the stretch marks are at started to peel and i was really happy with that......i am hoping that i won&#x27;t have to do too much peels before they go away, but i love that it peels that fast....i love love it!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I followed instructions and gave myself 4 layers-each one 2-3 minutes.Had prepped well-thought I&#x27;d die before I was done but,not.I peeled about 2-3 days after so I was excited! Then nothing and nothing since! No heavy thick peels as I had thought! Was that it??? Its about 2weeks now! I thought&lt;br /&gt;for sure I&#x27;d have heavy duty shedding!! My skin surface is rough in certain places.Mine was for wrinkles.I&#x27;m not ready to give up.But about ready to do it again? Should I have gotten a peel booster? I mean 4 layers of 50%!!  Not sure what to do as I followed all to a tee.I haven&#x27;t done a ton of peels&lt;br /&gt;I wanted this one to get rid of wriinkles.Has Anyone else had this problem? I read the reviews-I thought for sure this would do it.I keep reading&lt;br /&gt;Monica&#x27;s trials and errors.I wanted to be very aggressive(*of coarse careful too!!) so this would be my fresh new face!!! It definately is not that yet-&lt;br /&gt;my face blew up like a red balloon for several days.What did I do wrong? Anyone else have this happen??I made sure the peel was brand new and well within the date of expiration.I am fair and not thick skinned.My lines from nose to mouth-and lines mouth to chin are better on one side-so at least I learned how to tackle that-but really confused that I didn&#x27;t shed like a snake!! Anyone else??? Thank&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> This peel is very effective and it is strong. Do not go in applying the peel too excitedly without following the instructions carefully. For myself, I do not use the peel full strength, I dilute it to 20-25% strength-- 20-25% is strong in itself for my skin, but this strength works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying the peel, my skin quickly went into the healing process. In the first three days my skin looked like it received a slight tan, then from four to seven days my skin was getting crinkling and peeling, and within eight to ten days my skin was recovering from the peeling, still peeling any leftover skin and the new skin was revealing itself and coming together--showing up brightly. I used baking soda for a neutralizer, I mixed it with water once and splashed it on my face and this quickly stopped the peels reaction. Another time I just made the baking soda as a paste and put it on my face--either way you use the baking soda, it will neutralize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: My first application went well, the only thing is there was one area that frosted more quickly than the rest of my skin on my face, and penetrated a bit deeper. After a day the spot looked like a dark, dye stain mark.  It turned out my skin was healing and the dark color will eventually rise to the surface and eventually peel like the other skin. (It actually peeled off sooner than the other skin) In result that area came out even smoother. After this application situation did not happen again, because I used a different brush applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get too comfortable, and get sloppy with the solutions application, this is a powerful solution and you should go in being careful each time.</li>
            <li> amazing product! i used this only on my body though, using it on face would be too hard for me because it is SO painful! make sure you read ALL steps and follow them, my first time using this i was able to have my body freckles peel off... literally! Amazing results IF done correctly LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Very useful product, thw warts turn white right away, I really recommend it. You can rarely find such good quality products online</li>
            <li> Omg most awful thing you can do to your skin. Has taken a full month of scabs on my tattoo and all it did was lighten then a tiny bit. Do not waste you money on this! I&#x27;ve now decided that a cover up tattoo will be better.</li>
            <li> I have used TCS 25 few times before but this was definitely much stronger than I expected. I have followed the directions to the dot but my skin (which is very sensitive) bad a dark burn mark that I am dealing with. I am slowly applying lighter coating each time to make the marks lighter. Please be very cautious and take it off in less than 30 seconds if you are not used to this kind of strong peels. I am going to use it only for spot treatments and not to cover large areas any longer.</li>
            <li> honestly, I haven&#x27;t even used this yet and I bought it awhile ago!! Im so lazy. I think you do get alot of product for your money here though.</li>
            <li> Initially I used this as a standard peel - once a month. I&#x27;d cleanse, put it on, wait til it stung, rinse. Then I started using it every other day BEFORE washing my face, leaving it on for only about 60 seconds, and then rinsing and then cleansing. That&#x27;s when I started to notice a difference in pore size, \\&quot;depth\\&quot;, and general clogged-ness around my nose. I don&#x27;t visibly peel from this, but something good is going on... and I almost NEVER get results from any skin product. So I&#x27;m actually quite impressed. Recommended. This is just MY experience, of course!None of what I just described is how this product is \\&quot;supposed\\&quot; to be used. So please... be careful.</li>
            <li> This product is what it says it is. If you rated this with a one star or two star because you had scarring or bad result, you didn&#x27;t use it right. Don&#x27;t blame the makers of this product for your ignorance. This is not an over the counter, throw it on face peel. The product description was clear. You suggesting this be taken off the market because your stupid ass didn&#x27;t research it first is stupid. I  am very happy with my results...but I understand it.</li>
            <li> I have a small black tattoo on my stomach, and a small star on my wrist that I&#x27;m wanting to get rid of. I bought this, tiny bottle, cleaned the areas. I diluted the acid to 25% and applied it with q-tips.&lt;br /&gt;OWW. At first it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. I put 2 layers on. after a minute or so as the acid sinks in it burns like crazy, but I knew it would hurt pretty bad since acid and all. It feels like fire inside of you.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a week since I did this. I have been in almost constant pain since. Showering hurts, bending my wrist gives me shooting pain all up my arm. Laying down hurts, laying on my stomach is of course out of the question, even with antibiotic ointment on, the cracking, bleeding, peeling skin is really not happy, but again, can&#x27;t blame it since its ACID. Also, its leaving a really dark nasty scar.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not continuing this on my wrist in a few weeks. I can&#x27;t take it, but I will continue on my stomach despite the pain because thats the only way to get rid of the ugly ink.&lt;br /&gt;I just say really think before you buy this expensive self injuring liquid.</li>
            <li> AWFUL! Do NOT PURCHASE!</li>
            <li> Let us know if you have more skin products on Amazon because I&#x27;m not going to buy anything for my skin that is not created by Dermalure, Thank you and have a wonderful weekend! :)</li>
            <li> Not for home use. Should be a professional to use this product. I water this down 50% before applying to my clients.</li>
            <li> Impressive! But this product!!!</li>
            <li> This is a perfect TCA product without additives you may see in other TCA type products. It works just as expected - I&#x27;ve used it off and on to kill pre-cancer skin cells. If you&#x27;ve not used this before be very very careful - this is very strong and could do permanent damage. I would never put it on my skin in a spot bigger than a Q-tip head. Handle it with extreme care. I like the manufacture as well - I&#x27;ve used others.</li>
            <li> Burned my skin. Too strong</li>
            <li> Just used it yesterday and I see a difference already just hope its not too strong since I&#x27;m doing this at home I know they say professional use</li>
            <li> NOT FOR DARK SKIN PEOPLE-&lt;br /&gt;I wished someone had warned me about the risk of using this product.  I brought his product and dilute the product to a third of the strength (2 TSP of TCA to 6 TSP of water) it still burned my face, the results were awful.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for dark skin people it has been 2 weeks since I used this product and my skin is totally discolored.  I have lost so much of the pigmentation in my skin it will take months gain for the pigmentation to back.  I have to use lots of make up to cover up the discoloration.  I saw dermatologist and they were amazed you can actual buy this product online, the doctor called all of her partners to come and look at my face.  I have to see the dermatologist ever two weeks for monitoring.  I must say I was very relieved when I found out my face wasn’t scared and eventually I will gain the pigmentation back but it will be quiet a journey.  This turn out to be very costly and the discomfort one can’t put a price on that experience.  This is one of the dummies decisions I have made in my life and I am a senior manager in a fortune 500 company.&lt;br /&gt;  .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with these results so far.  I feel the need to review this product for other consumers.  I had an ice pick scar or dilated pore (im not sure which but I know it&#x27;s not a normal pore) and used this in a TCA Cross method to try and get rid of it.  It stung when I used it.  And the area around it was red.  It took three dips of a toothpick into the TCA and the scar finally frosted a tiny bit.  I went to bed.  No moisturizer on the treatment area.  But on the surrounding skin.  The next day it looked the same.  Day 2 it was a little darker and wider.  Day 3 it started shrinking.  Day 4 it is much shallower and smaller in diameter.  It&#x27;s starting to peel.  Will update the review in a week.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy a higher % with lower PH and dilute it instead of constantly buying a new bottle of a higher strength.  This is really powerful TCA (great quality!)  Just be very careful with it!!!  I used 1tsp of the TCA and 1tsp distilled water to make a 25% solution.  It gave me great coverage and frosting ... bye bye sun damage and acne scars!!! I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Product works well. Too well, actually. I don&#x27;t know much about chemicals and I didn&#x27;t know that this peel was as strong as it is. It definitely does its job.</li>
            <li> must be very careful while applying it. use on a spot(arm) for testing . do not apply  directly on your face unless you are sure what you are doing. if used properly it can make miracles!!! NOTE: THIS IS THE REAL DEAL AND VERY STRONG PEEL ,SO USE WITH CAUTION AND HAVE ATLEAST 2 WEEKS OFF IF DONE ON FACE.</li>
            <li> very good product, meets expectations. Also EXCELLENT customer service by Dermalure</li>
            <li> Be careful this can burn your skin and leave it dark. My completion is like that of Drya Michelle&#x27;s so i mix this with water so it doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> My marks started to clear up, even tho I peeled the skin off before it was ready, but im doing it over correct and will wait until it peels on it&#x27;s own. Great product</li>
            <li> I have had great results with this but would echo others noting this is absolutely not for beginners. Follow an exact protocol and err on the side of caution.  Better to get no or a small effect initially because you washed it off too quickly (a little goes a long, long way, so it&#x27;s cheap) and just repeat than to over do it and get prolonged redness or damage.  I would also strongly recommend using it on very limited areas only (I use it to get rid of individual sun spots, etc. and use clear, sparkly nail polish to protect the skin around them).  This is my personal opinion and experience only, and is not medical advice or based on the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very strong so use caution</li>
            <li> If you want ur dark spots to get darker then used this product..</li>
            <li> Wooooweeee this is strong stuff! I didn&#x27;t ever hurt myself but I could only let it be on my skin for a mere 5 seconds. It would still get to soak in some and I always peel a couple days later. Just feels good to revel new skin. Marks such as sun spots light wrinkles and rough spots go away! Nice!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 3 months on some deep wrinkles around my neck but never saw any results, maybe this works on fine lines and other minor skin conditions, but I would try a higher dose with dilution for some of the serious conditions.</li>
            <li> This peel is amazing. Beginners beware, it is very strong. I have been doing glycolic peels for years, 50% for thee last year, so I thoughtI could easily tolerate this one. Well, after 4 minutes I had to remove it. My face and neck were very red but not burnt. I waited 24 hours before washing my face as per the directions. My face felt extremely tight and very red but didn&#x27;t hurt. Over the next couple of days the skin came off in sheets. I never peeled this much with glycolic acid. I&#x27;ve done 3 peels so far,approximately 1 week between each application, and my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years ! If you decideto do a TCA peel make sure you follow the enclosed directions.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase of 50% TCA chemical peel from dermagevity at Amazon.com. The price beat every other place I could find. The product works great if it is applied correctly. I&#x27;m so glad a friend of mine turned me onto this. The delivery was quicker than anticipated, and I could ask for nothing more!</li>
            <li> I peeled the outer layer of skin. You will not be able to go out for couple weeks. Dont expect it to get rid of your acne scars since mine didnt go away.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several professional grade peels and TCAs. This product, marketed at 50%, is not as strong as all my other purchased peels or TCAs labeled 20%, 25%, or 30%. I really wanted at 50% medical grade peel, and I did not have that experience with this product. I will use the product until it is empty, but I will not purchase the product again.</li>
            <li> I used the 70% glycolic peel I ordered from here before I started with this to get my skin used to the process. It was actually very mild for me and was able to leave it on for 15 mins or so without any crazy burning. With that being said, I figured my skin was very tough and the tca peel would not burn as bad as people said. /the glycolic reviews said the burning was intense and was not for me/ Let me tell you. I put the peel on and it frosted EVERYWHERE within 10 seconds.  I was actually doing somewhat of a hopping dance the entire time it was on. As soon as the peel touched my face it was instant pain im not gonna lie. The longer it sat it didnt bother me as bad as the initial contact but still hurt like nothing else. Baking soda and water completely neutrilizes itt. Not necessary to spend money on something you can get for a buck. Ok fast forward. I have icepick scars and little saucer looking scars and its been 6 days since the peel and I would say 25-30% improvement. The skin also has to regenerate itself over time to fill the holes and get a smoother look so it will only get better. My down time was so shorty bc I blowdried it several times a day and kept it moisturized. MUST BUY if you have permanent scars or dark spots. It is VERYYYYYYYYY (Xs100000) STRONG . so please be careful and follow directions.  I would suggest only putting it in problem areas.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to use on my acne scars and for some scarring on my arms. My face turned dark red/brown and leathery for about 3-4 days before peeling. The results from the first application were staggering. I figure that my acne scarring will be completely gone in a couple of months after a couple more applications.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product from Dermalure Skincare Professionals after trying other companies over the past few years. This company has great products that come with detailed instructions, plus a note at the beginning :For Professional Use Only, followed by a liability statement. Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My story: I have had three TCA peels done by a licensed esthetician with wonderful results and little downtime (swelling, redness, peeling) I also been on a nightly regime of Retin-A 0.1% for two years. Living in a bit of a remote area with a 3 hour drive one way to have a professional peel, I decided to do it myself. I honestly should have purchased no more than a 35% solution, perhaps less. The company is truthful when it states for Professional Use Only. I went from major frosting to serious swelling and after 36 hours decided to have a dermatologist have a look at me. No infection present and no major concerns, though I am taking a two day round of Cortisone tablets to reduce the swelling quicker and some ointment. I&#x27;m a Chef/Caterer by profession and have a gig Wednesday night and really hopeful my face will look much, much better by then. I&#x27;m looking scary at the moment. Hope that this will be helpful to someone.</li>
            <li> This product definitely works to peel your skin in an instant.  I had experience with Lactic Acid 85% and Glycolic-Lactic Acid Peel 35% in other areas of my skin. I mistakenly applied this product on my fore-head undiluted.  The chemical immediately began to burn.  I only had in on for 20 seconds before getting it completely removed with water and neutralizer.  Even after getting it off, it still felt like the product was on.  Gladly I did not leave on any longer.  My skin experience darkened pigment in 2 areas; one of which was completely \\&quot;peelable\\&quot; the next day (today).  The rest of my forehead is still a slight shade darkened, which is barely noticeable or only noticeable to my eye or someone looking very closely.  Still, I am hoping that slightly darker shade will peel off/resolve by the end of the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. I applied this to my knees for scars the week before.  It did not burn so much in this area, but did not really peel or create darkening.  I only allowed it in this area for 1 min. Thus, product will vary with skin type.</li>
            <li> this peel works well, I DO NOT recommend it for those who have not had a peel before!! I use this product for the first time last week, it is highly effective. Please read ALL of the instructions prior to use!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a peel that was strong enough for the body and finally I&#x27;ve met my match. This thing stung very badly, I had to neutralize it with baking soda and water, even afterward it still stung, but my results so far are good.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what I expected and shipped professionally packed. I have no complaints except for the price charged, they could have thrown in a transfer bottle for mixing.</li>
            <li> This is the real stuff so be careful it is strong. I got this a while back but never used it until today just so you know shipping was great and fast. I put 50% on one of my hands today after cleaning it and getting it ready to apply than I diluted it by half and did my other hand. I was a little scared at first when I did the full 50% but only did one coat and didn&#x27;t need to use baking soda or any thing to naturalize the sting stopped with in five mins and you can feel it tighting right away so don&#x27;t be afraid it stops on it&#x27;s own. I did the other hand with 25 % and had to put three layers on it to get the same as the 50 % which I applied only one layer. I also applied 25 % on my face and did not use a naturalize the stinging stop just like it did on my hands. Some area&#x27;s frosted right away so I didn&#x27;t reapply it in the frosted area&#x27;s only in the area that didn&#x27;t frost wait a few minutes after each layer to give it time to frost over. I was able to use this under my eyes with no pain at all or sting I also did below my eye brows with no problem just don&#x27;t get this in your eye. The places that frosted right after on coat with the sensitive area&#x27;s my cheeks and my temples. I typing this right after I apply this to my face which is burning a little not bad at all no pain at all. I think if your smart you won&#x27;t keep putting more on the sensitive area&#x27;s that don&#x27;t need more the one coat. I will update in the need few days how this went so far it&#x27;s going great but I have old skin on my hands but not my face it has been peeled in the past so I don&#x27;t need a deep peel on my face.</li>
            <li> Not for beginners but it works well.</li>
            <li> REALLY REALLY STRONG PEEL!! Took me almost 3 weeks to heel and I am a veteran in peels.</li>
            <li> This product does EXACTLY what it is intended to do! chemical peel! I highly recommend using this much less expensive option than going to a spa for your facial peel needs. This product is NOT intended for people that lack commons sense! You will see some reviews that would have you believe you shouldn&#x27;t try this! they either have some kind of agenda or they lack the simple common sense to use this product. If to many people find out that they could do the same exact thing at home for a fraction of the price, spas would lose millions! I will NEVER go to a spa again, and there is NO need to go to an over priced cosmetic surgeon to get your facial peels. Now that I have got that out of the way lets talk about using this awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use:&lt;br /&gt;The product comes with simple to use directions! real easy! Wash your face with a mild cleanser. then take a cotton swab and put some TCA on the swab, gently touch your face, GENTLY! remember you can always add more, how it works is the more layers you put on the deeper the peel, if you have acne pits you may want to hit that area with more layers, again add a little at a time, do NOT just soak your entire face with TCA you will not like it and you will be in unnecessary pain. if you remember to add as little as you can at a time you will really enjoy the results! P.S by a little at a time I mean barely touch your face with the TCA on the cotton swab, you don&#x27;t need much of this product to work, you will be surprised at how little you need!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acid Neutralizer: you do NOT need to neutralize a TCA peel, it will stop burning after about 2 or three minutes, then you can add another layer for a deeper peel. &amp;#34;you can add up to 5 layers&amp;#34; With that said its good to get the acid neutralizer from Dermalure just incase you need to stop it quick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it, enjoy this awesome product!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very highly concentrated acid used for strong chemical peels.  It is absolutely NOT for use by home users who would be best served by 10-20% glycolic acid. This acid can be used for spot treatment to remove various lesions but is too concentrated for treatment of broad areas. For a non health care person, see this as a \\&quot;Compound W\\&quot; type acid but 5-10X stonger.  If you misuse this you will run a high risk of chemical burns and even skin scars. Professionals only.&lt;br /&gt;Peter J. Stanton, DC, MS, DABCO</li>
            <li> Beware, don&#x27;t do this at home! I suffered from chemical burns on my arm and face, this should be illegal to sell to the public</li>
            <li> I have used 2 bottles of the TCA peel for removal of a small, but bright , red rose tattoo on my ankle. It hasn&#x27;t been a pretty process ( lots of peeling, rednes, and more pain than the tattoo itself!) but I am pleased to say that 90% of the tattoo is gone, and just in time for spring!  This is strong stuff, especially if you choose to layer it in a single use. I use a much gentler peel on my face, but this stuff is very powerful. Use with caution, but it does get the job done!</li>
            <li> It was deliver right on time. The product is really strong and really should be handle with care but I knew what I was buying.</li>
            <li> ITS STRONG. JUST DO 1 layer. anything more than that will burn your skin.. I ended up diluting it in half so 25%.</li>
            <li> only for the experienced users!!!</li>
            <li> Ok, so I bought this based on some of the excellent reviews. I have had peels done professionally but not a TCA. I have also done the Jesner peel at home but I was not getting the results I needed. I bought the 50% and diluted it to 25% because I was worried it may be a little too strong.  It burns a lot more than the other peels I have done in the past but that is expected since it is stronger. It got red, frosted and all of that stuff. I did everything I was instructed to do. My skin peeled and it looked great and I was happy. Then I noticed that all the areas that were peeled and was looking great gradually got darker and darker each day. Not sure what the heck is going on. This is not supposed to be happening. I am a Black woman but a darn near White person in skin tone. I warm others, be careful when considering to buy and use this stuff, you may get an undesired result at the end.</li>
            <li> Be very careful. This will burn through skin very quickly. Only do once for 1 minute wait several days to see how it affects your skin. I have horrible burns on my face day 4 of my treatment. So bad I can&#x27;t leave the house. Extremely painful.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.i have used several uses and it gets my blemishes off and makes my skin smooth id recommend for use to anyone</li>
            <li> It hurts like hell. i peeled my legs and arms. Happy with the results after a month. My only advice is don&#x27;t pick wait until the dry skin falls out. if you apply too much it will scar then.</li>
            <li> Very very strong.... WILL BURN THE SKIN .  BUT ONCE YOU LEARN YOUR SKIN ..YOU WILL GET BEAUTIFUL RESULTS... IT WORKS !! ... BUT AGAIN.. IT WILL BURN.. THIS STUFF IS LIKE FIRE !</li>
            <li> This product really will make your skin smoother and gets out the craters in your face. My advice is to be real careful and expect to look terrible for at least 3 days. You should prep your face first and use a calming creame after. I didn&#x27;t do that and I turned just a little dark in certain areas but the good out weigh the bad. I will do better in about 2 weeks Im going for it all over again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong however just add equal amount of water to get a 25% . Great product and value for money.....please recommend your favorite brand ....</li>
            <li> Great product for facial peels.  No need to find anything else this worked great for me.  Hope you enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Good for spot treating, frosted really quickly. I haven&#x27;t used it over my entire face yet, but will definitely be diluting it before I do.</li>
            <li> Finally!  A real TCA solution, not a watered down version. I have gotten some beautiful results with this product-just as good as peels that cost up to $300 in a dermatologists office. I frosted almost immediately the second time I used it (so take care on follow-up peels, you don&#x27;t need to leave it on for very long). The price is certainly right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is NOT a solution for beginners.  You run the real risk of burning yourself if you don&#x27;t understand how these compounds work.  Start with much weaker solution (10%), or even better a weaker acid such as glycolic (Glytone Ultra Heel and Elbow cream at 30% glycolic acid is a great and safe way to start) to understand how your individual skin type reacts to treatment.  Don&#x27;t leave it on for very long at first (maybe a minute) and make sure you have a buffering solution on hand.  Plain baking soda mixed with water into a paste works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy peeling!</li>
            <li> Did the job, but be careful with it as its very strong</li>
            <li> This was to harsh on myself, I should have gotten a lesser %</li>
            <li> I bought this to try on a few stretch marks I had on my shoulders from puberty and lifting, they always bothered me for some reason cuz I figured only women got them but anyways, it worked got some peeling and it DRAMATICALLY REDUCED THE APPEARANCE OF THEM ! I think after one or two more peel they will be completely gone!! I also used hyaluronic acid serum in my regular lotion and some aquaphor on top and it really was great!!!</li>
            <li> Please make Sure to do a spot where no one can see before doing your whole face. Also like others have said make sure you have done these before using a 50%. I had only done one Once before and this is Much stronger than a V peel at a salon.</li>
            <li> The TCA peel instantly took years off my face!!  Only thing is it cannot be used very often and you have to be instantly ready with plenty of water the second you feel the acid sting your face.  But, who cares?, it is marvelous!  Thank you</li>
            <li> It works great. I read the reviews and I am SO glad I did. I made a baking soda mixture to neutralize it.</li>
            <li> It burnt my face! They shouldn&#x27;t sell anything plastic surgeon grade on Amazon for clients. I followed all the instructions and I&#x27;ve had tca peels in past. This one burnt my face terribly on both my cheeks.</li>
            <li> *****UPDATE****:&lt;br /&gt;I added my 3rd TCA peel experience at the bottom. Since you can dilute the 50% TCA to 25%, I figured it might be helpful for someone who wants to reduce this product&#x27;s concentration to 25%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I BELIEVE HEAT (BLOWDRYER) MIGHT SPEED HEALING TIME-WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO HEAR FROM ANYONE WHO TRIES THE TECHNIQUE I DESCRIBE IN MY 3RD PEEL EXPERIENCE AT THE BOTTOM (confirming or disconfirming evidence welcome)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is my 2nd peel. the 1st one i diluted this solution to 25% and was pleased with the results. i&#x27;d applied that time with a paper towel and that gave an uneven peel, so i decided to do it again. the review is mostly for the 2nd time, since almost all of the reviews talk about what I experienced the 1st time, i&#x27;m not going to go into it out of consideration for your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-i put this on full strength-i&#x27;m sick of having icepick acne scars and my skin is pretty tough due to tons of treatments over the years&lt;br /&gt;-frosted within like 20 seconds; applied 2 more layers at 1 minute and 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;--at 3 min, i used a neutralizer i bought on here and rinsing with water...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD. IDEA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the neutralizer was awful and weak and totally didn&#x27;t neutralize me. i still had major frosting all over my face, and it seemed that the stupid neutralizer+water rinsing was making it \\&quot;harden.\\&quot; so my entire face was was hard and white for about 12 minutes (it could&#x27;ve been anywhere from 10-15 min, but i stopped my timer and kinda lost my perception of exact timing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also, it felt like Satan had sneezed in my face for that whole time. i walked downstairs to quickly look at the reviews here on Amazon to see if the intense pain was common, and the wind on my face from walking quickly intensified the pain. ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i realized within a few clicks that BAKING SODA was what i needed! everything finally neutralized with baking soda. It fixed the burning, softened the texture completely, and the white disappeared. my face was red, but i knew it had neutralized. I figured right away this was gonna suck and i was right. At the most, I was hopeful that increased application time would lead to even BETTER results. At the worst, I feared I&#x27;d permanently disfigured myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;next day my cheeks were all swollen and puffy (that lasted about 5 days UGH). it seemed like it took forever for me to peel-i did the peel late Saturday night, and didn&#x27;t start to peel until Wednesday night. i was happy with the progress, but it appeared that the peeling was basically a kind of \\&quot;initial phase\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come Saturday-the 1 week mark-MOST of my face was done with the \\&quot;typical\\&quot; peeling you get with a TCA peel above 25% or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the next week, I went through another phase of peeling that I think was due to accidentally leaving it on too long. I had several huge, horrible \\&quot;scabs\\&quot; along my entire jawline, my nose, and my cheeks. the texture and appearance was hard, white and flaky. they reminded me of dried up coral reef  or something like that (sorry if i&#x27;m graphic but i want to explain this to someone who might be trippin about like i was during the 2 week period).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;needless to say, i was FREAKING OUT about it. i used aquaphor, eucerin cream, neosporin, emu oil, tri derma fast healing cream, etc. on day 7 or day 8, I even tried these vinegar soaks i&#x27;d read about on some plastic surgeon&#x27;s website (it was advice on TCA peel after-care). they said mixing a teaspoon of white vinegar was a good \\&quot;debriding agent\\&quot; after a TCA peel (a debriding agent means it helps loosen and get rid of dead skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the solution in a spray bottle, and I&#x27;d fasten some facial gauze I bought on Amazon with headbands. I&#x27;d spray the solution on the gauze every 2-3 minutes when the fabric seemed dry. I&#x27;d do this for about 10 minutes and then rinse. the scabs seemed to loosen somewhat afterwards. i honestly don&#x27;t know if they helped that much, and were getting super intense around day 12 so  I stopped them bc it was hurting like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin was incredibly raw and everything burned. NOTHING seemed to be helping and i was despondent. the stupid scabs seemed to be getting worse in terms of cracking, but since that was a change in something i was hopeful it might be a sign of progress. The idea that I&#x27;d done major damage was becoming much more real, but I had a flicker of hope that this process was nothing more than a better, deeper peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on day 13, Friday, i made an appointment for monday to see a dermatologist. i was certain i&#x27;d done permanent damage, and was pretty mad at myself for being impatient, haha. That day I also ordered some Bio-Oil here on Amazon out of panicked hope that maybe it&#x27;d help (overnight shipping). so the Bio-Oil was here late Saturday afternoon (14 day mark). i washed my poor scabby, cracking, red, flaky skin and applied the Bio-Oil and called it a night. I was so sick of worrying about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Sunday, i woke up and overnight the scab seemed like 70% better. Although the skin was \\&quot;raised\\&quot;, the scabs were much softer and the flaking was dramatically decreased. I was ecstatic, but still reserved...i  canceled the appt after things seemed to be improving into Sunday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure that the overnight healing was a combination of the natural progression of the scabbing, plus the Bio-Oil. It was definintely sped up by the Bio-Oil at the least, and it has continued to heal my skin during the past week. I just want to be objective and not leap to conclusions about what helped, but it&#x27;s hard for me not to feel that Bio-Oil is a holy grail of post-peel treatment. I also used it while healing from my 1st TCA peel, and I only took about 6 days to completely recover from that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m writing this on Day 20-I&#x27;m still RED as a tomato, but the scab is 100% gone. I can&#x27;t wait to use this peel again in a month or two to continue the process of getting of them. I&#x27;m thrilled with how everything looks. My acne scars look WAY better-they&#x27;re definitely more shallow and the dark pigmentation they usually have seems much lighter. Kinda hard to say since I&#x27;m still really red, but i&#x27;m pretty sure the coloring is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think what happened is that leaving it on for 10-15 minutes (versus the 3 min i&#x27;d planned) gave me an ultra deep peel that extended the downtime by an extra week. I DEFINITELY won&#x27;t leave it on that long next time but I plan to use it full strength again and use baking soda to neutralize after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so, even though i&#x27;m a prime example of why people warn you NOT to do peels like this at home, my skin ended up looking great due to the increased depth of the peel. JUST USE BAKING SODA AND BIO OIL!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*******UPDATE:******&lt;br /&gt;3RD TCA PEEL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so I&#x27;m rounding out my 3rd TCA peel. Given the nightmare that 50% TCA gave me I decided to use the 25% strength. (I had my baking soda ready this time...lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEDNESDAY NIGHT&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: For some reason I always do TCA peels on a bit of a whim if I realize I can fanaggle a few days off (I own an online jewelry company so it&#x27;s not hard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-washed face&gt;removed oil with 99% isopropyl alcohol&lt;br /&gt; *gonna add acetone before alcohol to prep next time...read how it&#x27;s super important to \\&quot;defat facial oils\\&quot; for an even peel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Vaseline on brows lips etc&lt;br /&gt;-set iPhone timer (stopwatch function if you&#x27;re curious)&lt;br /&gt;-applied 1st layer with gauze, KINDA frosted around 45 sec&lt;br /&gt;-2nd-3rd layers&lt;br /&gt;*mega frosting (yay)&lt;br /&gt;* \\&quot;OMG Satan sneezed in my face\\&quot; feeling around 2:30&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Neutralization at 4:00 min: Ultra  Scientific Technique:&lt;br /&gt;-Pour baking soda in palm&lt;br /&gt;-Add enough water to make a paste&lt;br /&gt;- Slather on face&lt;br /&gt;-Kinda massage around a little&lt;br /&gt;-Rinse&lt;br /&gt;-Repeat steps til it stops hurting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I leave the baking soda paste on while I wait for shower to warm up then I run cool water on face for a few minutes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIDENOTE/RANT: ok so I&#x27;ve seen some stuff about how rinsing with water will neutralize TCA...That&#x27;s absolutely false!!  (DISCLAIMER: I&#x27;m kind of retarded so listen to me at your own risk...that&#x27;s my experience though)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pH scale for Acids range from 1-14, 1 being super strong acids (like stomach acid)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TCA is ACIDIC with a pH-1.9-2.3&lt;br /&gt;-not sure what this particular brand&#x27;s pH is (even though it&#x27;s probably on the bottle or something) but anything under 3 is gonna be intense. So TCA is definitely strong acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baking soda is BASIC with pH 8-9 range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water has a NEUTRAL pH-7, right smack dab in the middle of the pH scale, neither acidic nor basic.. I won&#x27;t get into WHY water won&#x27;t neutralize you like baking soda but the pH values speak for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a straight mathematical matchup with the pH values; I&#x27;m just kickin info that might help you NOT look like a Crusty Hose Beast for 2 weeks straight like I did.  You read abt my nightmare with 50% TCA being left on too long bc I mistakenly thought water + Amazon purchased neutralizer would work...I finally neutralizing with baking soda.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m fussy about properly neutralizing these things v&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I know is my baking soda paste stops the stinging completely, which my brain interprets as&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;ACID. STOP. GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;FOLLOW. DIRECTIONS. GOOD.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slathered bio-oil &amp; eucerin repair cream on after all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remembered learning that HEAT catalyzes the majority of chemical reactions. A catalyst simply speeds up the rate of a reaction-it doesn&#x27;t change what the reaction will eventually become anyways.&lt;br /&gt;Another practical application of heat as a catalyst is with self tanner:&lt;br /&gt;-hit your airbrush tan with blowdryer on high heat for about 20-30 min&gt;cut the development time by a few hours at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;heat won&#x27;t change the way the tanningsolution will look once the reaction completes; it&#x27;s just faster.  I figured it&#x27;d be the same with TCA peels since it initiates a prolonged chemical reaction; i.e. denaturation-which is a fancy word for causes the break down of proteins in our facial skin cells. Destroying that upper layer with the TCA acid is literally what makes us peel and i figured heat MIGHT speed up the healing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I hit my face with the \\&quot;Maximum Heat Set\\&quot; blowdryer...kinda had a looser approach to the speed setting. I observed Blowdryer Speed to be dependent on whether I was in the mood to have hot air blasts cause my eyelids to flap occasionally or not. Not exactly scientific but whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To avoid crusting I applied the heat as I was wearing my trusty bio oil + eucerin mix. I&#x27;d sit there and read for 25-60 min, jump in the shower and run water on my face. I did this 3-4 times a day (we&#x27;re just sitting at home anyways for downtime).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you know what? IT WORKED!  It definitely sped up healing for me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed I DEFINITELY had wayyyy more peeling, and it&#x27;d start to ramp up like 3-4 hours after blow drying with heat.&lt;br /&gt;  -Thursday I was already starting to peel (Day 1 if Wednesday was Day 0).&lt;br /&gt;  -Friday-horrifically ugly; peeling like crazy; spent free time googling TCA peels and true crime articles&lt;br /&gt;  -Saturday night-pretty much DONE PEELING (day 4)&lt;br /&gt;  -Still red as hell still but all the dead skin had basically fallen off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the heat + shower sped up the healing time by 1-2 days.  My first 25% TCA took 6 days to heal and 50% was about 14 days exactly (ugh). This time it was 4 days...I&#x27;m curious if other people try it what their outcomes are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acne scars-definitely better; still work to be done&lt;br /&gt;Tone, elasticity, smoothness blah blah: All awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In public sometimes I now fantasize about giving strangers TCA peels to see how amazing they&#x27;d look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanna try the jessners+ TCA combo peel next time...apparently the results are more typical of deep peels but don&#x27;t have the usual drawbacks of increased downtime like, say, 50% TCA on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takeaway: use bio oil, heat &amp; baking soda</li>
            <li> THe most amazing peel out there!!! You will lose thick layers of skin at a time! You must not wash, or apply creams in the first 48 hours.. trust me.. then you can wash sparingly and apply as much ointment as you like. Stay moisturized... let your skin come off by itself.. I didnt once and you can tell! I have a streak, it will go away though... I have been very blessed to find this peel. Do not get scared when your face turns white and purple...and when you look like complete shiz...you will heal and you will love the results...Just DO NOT WASH for 48 hours. It is imperative for your healing process...If you take off the dead skin too early, you can get an infection, scar, and healing time can take months.... Also buy the acid neatralizer to stop the peel when you cant take the pain anymore...for me, its seems like seconds... It does hurt, so have it ready!!! then rinse with cold water, pat dry and leave your face alone, yes, for 48 hours! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product to remove a small tattoo. It&#x27;s fading really nicely but takes a long time. Never a problem with amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Just tried it not sure of the results yet since its to soon but yooo this thing is strong as hell I ran to the fan and had my face cooling for 10 minutes this is at the strongest thing ever be careful !!</li>
            <li> This product is the first TCA I&#x27;ve ever purchased that really seems spot on in the accuracy of its claims.  Because this is an intense peel, I would definitely do a test patch prior to using it on a large area of the face.  Additionally, for me, it took about ten days to heal (light scabs, and most noticeably, the skin above my lip did swell). Even after two weeks, I still experienced flaking and redness.  This is the kind of peel that I really think is best suited to those who have either had a peel from a physician&#x27;s office and know what to expect, or have used slightly less potent peels and want to take it to the next level.  I would not recommend this as an introductory peel.</li>
            <li> I got a little over zealous in my attempt to do at home chemical peel.  I diluted this product down to what i thought was around 30% but I think was more like 37.  I took only one week of work origionally but ended up having to take two.  I did an even coat on my whole face and in the problem areas sdid 2 or 3 layers. This was way too strong and I wouldn&#x27;t recomend it.  It was scary to go through and I am still on the mend.  I would suggest a lower dilution or outright strength when doing a TCA peel ior just getting it done professionall. What i didnt know was that there are specifica products out there for post peel mostuizing which I would of used had I know it.  I made my own salves with vaseline and emu oil.  Please anyonme who is thining of using 30% or higher tca DONT DO IT!</li>
