            <li>therefore I know I can use it with confidence , also the quality of this one is superior than the ones I ordered in the past.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of natural products, particularly if they&#x27;re multi-use.</li>
            <li>From fine lines, to acne scars, as well as aged sun spots, rosehip oil is fast absorbing and can improve your skin issues significantly.</li>
            <li>and she said it is higher quality than the one she normally buys for a much higher price.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week or so, but I can already see a significant improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture and tone.</li>
            <li>This particular oil has done so much to improve the health of my skin.  </li>
            <li>, rose hip oil offers several benefits when applied externally.</li>

            <li>I ordered this oil as a sample for review and evaluation and so far I really like it!</li>

            <li>My original problem, old acne scare, I don&#x27;t see any difference yet but its only two weeks, I am hopeful that over time its gets lighter.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>really make your skin soft</li>
            <li>My skin became real soft.</li>
            <li>burn like I normally get.</li>
            <li>It has been a success in my use with essential oil</li>
            <li>I love Rosehip oil, i was mad when i lost my first bottle, no idea where i left it and was extremely happy when i was able to get my hands on another one, this bad boy leaves my skin feeling baby skin soft, i love the smell.</li>
            <li>The oil can penetrate deeper in the skin due to the vitamin A, vitamin A improves the skin&#x27;s moisture levels and reduces wrinkles and fine lines.</li>

            <li>I live in Arizona</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for new products for my skin</li>
            <li>I am fairly new to oils.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get any real scent, just a mild sweetness that reminds me of fresh-pressed olive oil, so it won&#x27;t stand out from your other body scents like some beauty products do.</li>
            <li>With its vital fatty acids, it hydrates and tightens skin leaving you looking refreshing.  </li>
            <li>The essential fatty acids in rose hip seed oil can help reduce scarring and promote skin regeneration.</li>
            <li>Fast service&lt;br /&gt;Packaged for ready use with dropper and regular cap.</li>
            <li>1/4 of a capsule of a 1000 mg vitamin C tablet, &amp; 1/2 dropper of this rose hip oil (was using an expensive organic rose hip oil previously).</li>
            <li>The oil seems to be making the incision site very soft and pliable.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive to everything including food and seems to always be inflamed in some way.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>Using it too much or during hot weather when you are more likely to sweat and have oilier skin seems to cause break outs (at least for me).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to just reiterate what another reviewer posted because I feel the exact same way about this product.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the oil or not, I have similar problem on the back of my leg, they are much bigger.  </li>
            <li>and it is absolutely natural and organic!</li>
            <li>This has been useful for my dry cracked skin and for some of my scars and stretch marks.</li>
            <li>And this comes in a huge 4 oz bottle that will last for a very long time, so</li>
            <li>Simply massage pure Rosehip oil into the scalp, leave it on for 30 minutes, then shampoo and see the difference</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never see or smelt a pure essential oil that had like no smell</li>
            <li>% pure cold-pressed rosehip seed oil should have the following qualities among others:&lt;br /&gt;-deep orange/amber color</li>
            <li>BUT, 100% pure cold-pressed rosehip seed oil should have the following qualities among others:&lt;br /&gt;-deep orange/amber color</li>
            <li>The one I ordered from somewhere else said it was pure, but when it arrived the label said it was mixed with vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li>Many other Rosehip oil review said dark color and scent is real Rosehip oil</li>
            <li>Clear and odorless.</li>
            <li>It is a clear oil with no fragrance.  </li>
            <li>it has made my skin healthier and soft</li>
            <li>my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>you’ve never considered a one ingredient moisturizer for yourself from head-to-toe, you will be surprised with everything rosehip oil can do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Skinology Beauty Solutions offers a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always conscious of what I use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve completely rid my face cleansing routine of chemical-ridden products.</li>
            <li>My hands don&#x27;t look old where they once did.</li>
            <li>But I am amazed at the difference in my 57 year old skin after one week using this.</li>
            <li>Just a few drops will do the work, because is so dense, and it feels so smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li>but I wanted something natural and this is it.</li>
            <li>I have some bug bites and old scars</li>
            <li>and so far it has worked just as advertised.</li>
            <li>The benefits far outweigh any temporary dislike of the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>was looking for something to help diminish old acne scare</li>
            <li>This is an all natural product so there are no side affects unless you are allergic to rosehips.</li>
            <li>just used it a few times and my face is so smooth</li>
            <li>Not to mention that it is all natural and organic without any added chemicals or alcohol-pure rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was taught at a young age to get a handle on this aging thing ASAP.</li>
            <li>I apply at night and wake up with soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I strongly believe this oil is not authentic simple because it has none of the characteristics of real rosehip.  </li>
            <li>I specifically bought it for my extremely dry cuticles and because the reviews were more positive than negative</li>
            <li>So far I love the product and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>When I was given a free sample of this for me to try out, I was not sure what to use it for, so I googled it.  </li>
            <li>Last but not least, I added some to my conditioner for a deeper conditioning session.</li>
            <li>I left it on my hair/head for about an hour then took a shower with my normal shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It is 100% pure certified organic cold pressed rose hip seed oil.</li>
            <li>I mixed a couple of drops of this &amp; pure emu oil into my big chest piece after spraying it with a water/collidal silver mixture, as it was having difficulty healing and within 3 days it was healed.</li>
            <li>I am new to using essential oils</li>
            <li>Tonight my very curly hair was dry &amp; frizzy from the humidity.</li>
            <li>My fingers get super dry from washing bottles every day and my feet are just dry from life.</li>
            <li>Nourishing oil for dry skin - It is rich in  rich in the essential fatty acids, simply apply to dry and cracked skin to nourish and rehydrate it.</li>
            <li>This specific oil is harvested in Chile, in small batches, and bottled in the US in the advanced FDA approved facility.</li>
            <li>Leave for about an hour and then wash thoroughly; you’ll be left with soft, revitalized</li>
            <li>It left my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I have locs and only use natural oils</li>
            <li>My skin is now extra soft and my self confidence is thru the roof.</li>
            <li>I´m a fan (I guess) of oils and extracts, and so far had bought several of them...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this oil for nearly two weeks now and initially it caused me to break out, I think because my skin wasn&#x27;t used to being oily.  </li>
            <li>So far, my complexion likes the RHO.&lt;br /&gt;Basically, you can use this - externally - anywhere on your body.  </li>
            <li>I have heard a lot of back and forth about the scent but for me I can barely smell it and it&#x27;s similar to olive oil smell only much weaker.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;ll be one more shot of my &#x27;secret&#x27; skin-saving ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was easily absorbed into the very dry shafts of my hair and equally dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I did notice later on throughout the day that my chin which has a touch of acne (thanks hormones) was really dry.</li>
            <li>Even if you’ve suffered from skin conditions like Psoriasis, Dermatitis or the more common Eczema, it moisturizes and heals those dry, flaky spots and helps aid your skin in healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bio Oil worked more for me then this product did, but it was not a complete failure.</li>
            <li>My only complaint has been that it is really oily, but  suppose that cannot be avoided and I&#x27;m sure using less will help keep the extra oily feeling away.</li>
            <li>It’s brimming with natural nutrients and vitamins and can be used both externally and taken internally.</li>
            <li>The first time I put it on my skin tingled a little.</li>
            <li>It is very large considering you only need a few drops per use</li>
            <li>, I tried it in my hair and wow what a difference , my dry scalp is now moisturized and not flaky</li>
            <li>I can grow my nails, but they are very weak and always break, and of course always at the most inopportune moments when I don&#x27;t have nail clippers or a nail file to correct the issue.  </li>
            <li>I keep looking at my body because its hard to believe most of my stretch marks are gone after a few applications.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for new products for my skin</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to oils.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get any real scent, just a mild sweetness that reminds me of fresh-pressed olive oil, so it won&#x27;t stand out from your other body scents like some beauty products do.</li>
            <li> With its vital fatty acids, it hydrates and tightens skin leaving you looking refreshing.  </li>
            <li> The essential fatty acids in rose hip seed oil can help reduce scarring and promote skin regeneration.</li>
            <li> Fast service&lt;br /&gt;Packaged for ready use with dropper and regular cap.</li>
            <li> 1/4 of a capsule of a 1000 mg vitamin C tablet, &amp; 1/2 dropper of this rose hip oil (was using an expensive organic rose hip oil previously).</li>
            <li> The oil seems to be making the incision site very soft and pliable.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive to everything including food and seems to always be inflamed in some way.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> Using it too much or during hot weather when you are more likely to sweat and have oilier skin seems to cause break outs (at least for me).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to just reiterate what another reviewer posted because I feel the exact same way about this product.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the oil or not, I have similar problem on the back of my leg, they are much bigger.  </li>
            <li> and it is absolutely natural and organic!</li>
            <li> This has been useful for my dry cracked skin and for some of my scars and stretch marks.</li>
            <li> And this comes in a huge 4 oz bottle that will last for a very long time, so</li>
            <li> Simply massage pure Rosehip oil into the scalp, leave it on for 30 minutes, then shampoo and see the difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never see or smelt a pure essential oil that had like no smell</li>
            <li> % pure cold-pressed rosehip seed oil should have the following qualities among others:&lt;br /&gt;-deep orange/amber color</li>
            <li> BUT, 100% pure cold-pressed rosehip seed oil should have the following qualities among others:&lt;br /&gt;-deep orange/amber color</li>
            <li> The one I ordered from somewhere else said it was pure, but when it arrived the label said it was mixed with vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> Many other Rosehip oil review said dark color and scent is real Rosehip oil</li>
            <li> Clear and odorless.</li>
            <li> It is a clear oil with no fragrance.  </li>
            <li> it has made my skin healthier and soft</li>
            <li> my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> you’ve never considered a one ingredient moisturizer for yourself from head-to-toe, you will be surprised with everything rosehip oil can do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Skinology Beauty Solutions offers a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always conscious of what I use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve completely rid my face cleansing routine of chemical-ridden products.</li>
            <li> My hands don&#x27;t look old where they once did.</li>
            <li> But I am amazed at the difference in my 57 year old skin after one week using this.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops will do the work, because is so dense, and it feels so smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li> but I wanted something natural and this is it.</li>
            <li> I have some bug bites and old scars</li>
            <li> and so far it has worked just as advertised.</li>
            <li> The benefits far outweigh any temporary dislike of the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> was looking for something to help diminish old acne scare</li>
            <li> This is an all natural product so there are no side affects unless you are allergic to rosehips.</li>
            <li> just used it a few times and my face is so smooth</li>
            <li> Not to mention that it is all natural and organic without any added chemicals or alcohol-pure rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was taught at a young age to get a handle on this aging thing ASAP.</li>
            <li> I apply at night and wake up with soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I strongly believe this oil is not authentic simple because it has none of the characteristics of real rosehip.  </li>
            <li> I specifically bought it for my extremely dry cuticles and because the reviews were more positive than negative</li>
            <li> So far I love the product and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> When I was given a free sample of this for me to try out, I was not sure what to use it for, so I googled it.  </li>
            <li> Last but not least, I added some to my conditioner for a deeper conditioning session.</li>
            <li> I left it on my hair/head for about an hour then took a shower with my normal shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It is 100% pure certified organic cold pressed rose hip seed oil.</li>
            <li> I mixed a couple of drops of this &amp; pure emu oil into my big chest piece after spraying it with a water/collidal silver mixture, as it was having difficulty healing and within 3 days it was healed.</li>
            <li> I am new to using essential oils</li>
            <li> Tonight my very curly hair was dry &amp; frizzy from the humidity.</li>
            <li> My fingers get super dry from washing bottles every day and my feet are just dry from life.</li>
            <li> Nourishing oil for dry skin - It is rich in  rich in the essential fatty acids, simply apply to dry and cracked skin to nourish and rehydrate it.</li>
            <li> This specific oil is harvested in Chile, in small batches, and bottled in the US in the advanced FDA approved facility.</li>
            <li> Leave for about an hour and then wash thoroughly; you’ll be left with soft, revitalized</li>
            <li> It left my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I have locs and only use natural oils</li>
            <li> My skin is now extra soft and my self confidence is thru the roof.</li>
            <li> I´m a fan (I guess) of oils and extracts, and so far had bought several of them...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for nearly two weeks now and initially it caused me to break out, I think because my skin wasn&#x27;t used to being oily.  </li>
            <li> So far, my complexion likes the RHO.&lt;br /&gt;Basically, you can use this - externally - anywhere on your body.  </li>
            <li> I have heard a lot of back and forth about the scent but for me I can barely smell it and it&#x27;s similar to olive oil smell only much weaker.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;ll be one more shot of my &#x27;secret&#x27; skin-saving ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was easily absorbed into the very dry shafts of my hair and equally dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I did notice later on throughout the day that my chin which has a touch of acne (thanks hormones) was really dry.</li>
            <li> Even if you’ve suffered from skin conditions like Psoriasis, Dermatitis or the more common Eczema, it moisturizes and heals those dry, flaky spots and helps aid your skin in healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bio Oil worked more for me then this product did, but it was not a complete failure.</li>
            <li> My only complaint has been that it is really oily, but  suppose that cannot be avoided and I&#x27;m sure using less will help keep the extra oily feeling away.</li>
            <li> It’s brimming with natural nutrients and vitamins and can be used both externally and taken internally.</li>
            <li> The first time I put it on my skin tingled a little.</li>
            <li> It is very large considering you only need a few drops per use</li>
            <li> , I tried it in my hair and wow what a difference , my dry scalp is now moisturized and not flaky</li>
            <li> I can grow my nails, but they are very weak and always break, and of course always at the most inopportune moments when I don&#x27;t have nail clippers or a nail file to correct the issue.  </li>
            <li> I keep looking at my body because its hard to believe most of my stretch marks are gone after a few applications.</li>
            <li> I was SO amazed when I managed to go the whole next day without having to mentally tell myself not to scratch my head!!!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend adding a few drops to mix it with a high quality moisturizer; that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve done and let them try and it moisturizes and hydrates their skin</li>
            <li> This one so far has made my skin feel noticably softer and my hair, I can&#x27;t say enough if I use it on wet hair and then blow dry!</li>
            <li> I have some hard acne bumps on my neck and chest, they were gone first week.  </li>
            <li> the next morning his scalp wasn&#x27;t dry the hair left shinny.</li>
            <li> I have actually been using a different oil to help with some skin issues like dry cracking heels and fingers.</li>
            <li> I was very cautious, used a small amount as to not make it look greasy.</li>
            <li> oz bottle that will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a couple times, but I cannot wait to see the long term benefits of using it.</li>
            <li> One four ounce bottle looks like it can last a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s organic and goes a long way - will never buy regular lotions again!</li>
            <li> ( I mean both, color itself is not a matter ) that is rancid be aware of that.</li>
            <li> I live in an extreme climate where the weather in the winter is always below zero leaving my skin rough and dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;-nearly clear, with a very slight yellow tint (it&#x27;s clearer than vegetable oil!)  </li>
            <li> this will last me a very long time!</li>
            <li> My cuticles are healthier and happier than they have been in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased very expensive PURE rosehip oil from Whole Foods &amp; other natural food stores and know what it&#x27;s supposed to look, feel, smell like.  </li>
            <li> The oil itself is lighter in color and thinner than another more expensive product that I previously purchased.</li>
            <li> This will last quite a long time!!!!</li>
            <li> Our Rosehip oil is also proven to help with dandruff and other similar scalp conditions.</li>
            <li> Dandruff  - Rosehip oil is proven to help with dandruff and other similar scalp conditions.</li>
            <li> Will be using in combination with other oils for various uses.  </li>
            <li> and I use everywhere that might feel dry.</li>
            <li> I realized how dry&amp; thirsty my skin is.</li>
            <li> It can be used for skin issues, dry scalp, added to soaps and lotions and</li>
            <li> dry skin to dandruff-</li>
            <li> I suffer from eczema and psoriasis and generally dry skin.  </li>
            <li> : to combat dry hair (just apply to dry ends)&lt;br</li>
            <li> : apply it to dry and cracked skin to nourish and moisturize it&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suffer from eczema and dry cracked skin and was referred to rosehip oil by a friend who suggested I give it</li>
            <li> After about a week of using it, my skin is no longer cracked and dry.</li>
            <li> I prefer using it on my dry itchy scalp to moisturize and nourish my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I can see the biggest improvement in my feet and heels, which are extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> In the winter time I always get dry skin.</li>
            <li> It only takes a few drops that last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> Massage in slightly warmed up Rosehip oil before you wash your hair and it will bring back the shine to permed, colored or dull hair: you will be left with soft, revitalized hair.</li>
            <li> Facial moisturizer including anti-aging, dark circles and helps rosacea?</li>
            <li> /&gt;( mine are dark yellow color with fishy smell)</li>
            <li> They were so soft &amp; subtle the next day.</li>
            <li> I usually buy my rosehip from the local health food store and spend a lot of $$ for a tiny bottle.  </li>
            <li> and this has actually helped make me LESS oily..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks now and it has dramatically cleared up previous acne scars.</li>
            <li> I have that weird scalp that is both oily and super flaky/itchy.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair</li>
            <li> but not anymore , my scalp was very dry and itchy again not anymore</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel like I have to put ISO much around my eyes to make them look less tired and younger.  </li>
            <li> Spray a little Rosehip oil mixed with water on your skin to rehydrate and lock in the moisture.</li>
            <li> but it seems almost like the stretch marks are starting to shrink a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Once it dried my hair was so soft and a little bit shinier.</li>
            <li> Each bottle is free of parabens, artificial ingredients and fragrance oils.</li>
            <li> The glass dropper was not in the bottle but wrapped separately and it was crushed when it arrived.</li>
            <li> - Just put a few drops of the oil on some cotton wool and dab the affected areas several times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10.</li>
            <li> As with every essential oil it says to do a test patch, but again like I mentioned I&#x27;m impatient.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m noticing that my dandruff slowly gone from when I started using this.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The oils is not thick but not to thin</li>
            <li> Or try adding only one or two drops of it to your usual skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using it a lot more often during the cold months!</li>
            <li> I usually have to reaply lotion on my feet especially, not with this.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of skincare blogs that recommended using this (sometime in combination with other oils, like argan) as a nighttime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It almost seemed like cooking or some other oil that has no scent ,definetly not rosehip ,</li>
            <li> So here&#x27;s what the other reviewer wrote that I wholeheartedly agree with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used it on my face daily for the past two weeks, and my skin is brighter with a noticeable improvement in skin tone and in wrinkles around the eyes, mouth, and even my neck.</li>
            <li> , I will use this rosehip in the bath and the other for facials, therapeutic massage and healing</li>
            <li> my face feel itchy and got small red dot.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> A few of my family members have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> oil color is dark and smell like fishy</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to make other items with it!</li>
            <li> I used it on my face for dark spots and I can see a slight difference.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brand of Rosehip Oil because it is cold pressed and a great value, but I am somewhat disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty weary of trying oils from brands that I&#x27;m not familiar with due to a previous bad experience</li>
            <li> Dull hair - Massage in slightly warmed up Rosehip oil before you wash your hair and it will bring back the shine to permed, colored or dull hair.</li>
            <li> I add a little to my lotion</li>
            <li> I do recommend this oil for anyone that needs a little help with your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  had weird dry patches on my scalp for the last couple of years - almost like cradle-cap.  </li>
            <li> (Did I mention I&#x27;m also an impatient person)</li>
            <li> It has been used for centuries to treat a wide range of common skin problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I still get a few pimples here and there, but that&#x27;s just a monthly problem.</li>
            <li> and I no longer waste money on a pedicure because there&#x27;s no need.</li>
            <li> I´d been using it for only one week, once a day in the night, after my cleansing routine, and the thin lines on my forehead and around the eyes, had disappeared.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Without having confidence in what this oil may be adulterated with, I&#x27;m not comfortable risking it on my skin or scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this on my face by putting a few drops on a cotton ball and then massaging it into my skin.  </li>
            <li> I can feel the rough spaces being smoothed out already and my skin sucks it in.</li>
            <li> So when I use this I use a few drops under each eye.</li>
            <li> I will update my review in a few months, but after having it for a week, here goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a few drops and my skin feels softer and not greasy</li>
            <li> my scalp and body were notably less itchy after this!</li>
            <li> But even if it were 100% rosehip seed oil but heavily processed, it should still retain at least a little color, thickness, and scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels like it works just the same as Shave Secret oil which is in a very small plastic package.  </li>
            <li> Large bottle and does not have bad smell.</li>
            <li> Seeing how expensive it is and the various formulation I have hesitated....for months!!!</li>
            <li> UNBELIEVABLE.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the dropper was not packaged properly.</li>
            <li> It just takes repetitive use.</li>
            <li> its size and price are both unbelievable @</li>
            <li> This oil keeps them from scarring as badly as they normally would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I did not suffer from any negative reactions after application.</li>
            <li> I had ordered 2 brands of organic Rosehip oil - giving 2 stars since this is at least oil, there is no color, no scent.  </li>
            <li> Thick.</li>
            <li> I also use as base mix for other essential oils and apply after every bath.</li>
            <li> not sure how that works, but it does!</li>
            <li> Dry hair - Make bad hair days</li>
            <li> Dropper came broken.</li>
            <li> Using rosephip oil was truly a game changer for me.</li>
            <li> I opened the package to find the dropper broken into three pieces.</li>
            <li> I continued it through the week, and I haven&#x27;t broken a nail yet, which is so not the norm for</li>
            <li> I apply a thin layer of this all-natural oil at night to help keep wrinkles at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really does not have a nasty smell infact its faint.</li>
            <li> At 4 ounces a bottle, you can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my skin didn&#x27;t react well to the rosehip oil, and it caused some irritation and cystic acne.</li>
            <li> There are no fillers, parabens, chemicals, artificial ingredients, no preservatives or fragrances used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid of dropping and shattering in bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li> and maybe I am crazy</li>
            <li> The dropper is terrible; hard to control because it drips like crazy even with the smallest amount of oil in it.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this oil.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After receiving this item I jumped for joy. It is a great product to have around your house for your nails and skin. I use this on my nails daily just by ribbing it on the nail and in the cuticles. My nails grow and the cuticles get stronger. The oils is not thick but not to thin it is perfect. It really does not have a nasty smell infact its faint. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product, but I can say I really love it.  I had surgery a month ago and began using the oil on the surgical site after two weeks, to reduce scarring.  The oil seems to be making the incision site very soft and pliable.  The site is healing nicely.  I also use it on my face.  It penetrates my skin and doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of it looking oily.  Rose hip oil is supposed to be good for preventing scarring and for aging skin, so I will be using it for the long run.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the oil and the price is great.  However, they do need to improve their packaging.  The glass dropper was not in the bottle but wrapped separately and it was crushed when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Great size bottle of rosehip oil! I&#x27;m pretty weary of trying oils from brands that I&#x27;m not familiar with due to a previous bad experience but I could not pass up the chance to try this bottle of rosehip oil since I was out of my regular bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle from Skinology feels just like my regular rosehip oil. It&#x27;s a high quality organic rose hip oil that has no smell. It absorbs into the skin nicely and doesn&#x27;t make you feel oily. The bottle is a really nice size and comes with a glass dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally use it on my face after a shower and I add a couple of drops to my bentonite clay face mask to help keep my skin moisturized. I&#x27;ve actually stopped using lotion on my face because that feels more greasy than this does! I have yet to try it in my hair but I&#x27;ve heard good things. My boyfriend has been stealing some of my oil when his eczema acts up and it&#x27;s been helping him quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>

            <li> So far I love the product and a little goes a long way! I have a feeling this will last me a very long time! I add a little to my lotion and it really hydrates my skin in a non greasy way. Look forward to see what difference it makes for my skin over more time!</li>
            <li> I usually buy my rosehip from the local health food store and spend a lot of $$ for a tiny bottle.  I was given a chance to review this at a great price.  This is a really large bottle and same great quality.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am using this oil as a shaving oil.  It feels like it works just the same as Shave Secret oil which is in a very small plastic package.  The only thing I would change is the bottle should be plastic not glass I&#x27;m afraid of dropping and shattering in bathroom sink.  It leaves skin smooth and there is never any soap residue left by ears.</li>
            <li> I really like this rosehip oil. I thought it was going to have a smell, but it doesn&#x27;t at all. Once applied, it absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave your face greasy. At 4 ounces a bottle, you can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> I love Rosehip oil, i was mad when i lost my first bottle, no idea where i left it and was extremely happy when i was able to get my hands on another one, this bad boy leaves my skin feeling baby skin soft, i love the smell. the packaged came very well packed and delivery was on time, i use this item on my face, hair, and skin</li>
            <li> So far so good. Great price. Very nice to get dropper included.</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer for my son&#x27;s face as well as mine.</li>
            <li> This is a BIG bottle and works WONDERS on the skin! I starting using this when it CAME in! I love the way it feels on my skin and I use everywhere that might feel dry. It works great as a cuticle moisturizer too. My daughter loves this for her feet after working at the barn and her hands too! I will have to buy her one soon! It only takes a few drops that last quite awhile. We use this every day! Product arrived on time and intact. A discount was given for my review.</li>
            <li> I used this rosehip oil on my skin and my hair. It is good moisturizer and keeps my skin hydrated. I also liked it kn my hair. I applied it on my hair at nigt and then washed it the next day. I also applied it in my hair as a conditioner. It left my hair shiny and soft. This oil has lot of uses. I also used it to give an oil massage to my toddler. I use a variety of oils on day to day basis and I am glad to have this one in my collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample received for evaluation and review</li>
            <li> I love using oils for health and beauty and can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t try rosehip sooner! It&#x27;s a godsend for winter dryness. I put a few drops in a warm bath and mixed a few more drops in my shampoo...my scalp and body were notably less itchy after this! I&#x27;ll be using it a lot more often during the cold months! Plus, the bottle is huge and I expect I&#x27;ll be getting lots of use from it! I received the oil for testing purposes and all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> One of my friends is an essential oil expert and months ago she recommended rose hip oil to me for my stretch marks. Seeing how expensive it is and the various formulation I have hesitated....for months!!! Well, I decided to purchase this rose hip oil for review during a promotional period and I was ecstatic to see that it is 100% rose hip oil. The oil left my skin feeling soft and smooth.... I used it on my face for dark spots and I can see a slight difference. I also add a drop to my lotion for some added benefits. There are also many other amazing vitamin ingredients to assist with the healing properties of rose hip oil. This was a nice huge size of oil!! This will last quite a long time!!!! I&#x27;m excited to see continued results!!!</li>
            <li> Great size and price for this product. I love this as a natural moisturizer for my face at night. Really happy with this product for sure.</li>
            <li> Great Product and service!!!</li>
            <li> I have never used Rosehip Oil before, but was familiar with all of the benefits it came with.I use it on my face, hair,nails and body. It absorbs nicely and does not leave my face feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I have been trying out more natural products for my family. I saw this was offered and I jumped on it right away. Of course I&#x27;m a procrastinator and didn&#x27;t even look up and find ways I was going to test it. So it shows up today and I can&#x27;t even use it right away. (Did I mention I&#x27;m also an impatient person) So I go to my go to app (Pinterest) to learn all about it quickly so I can use it. And of course Pinterest is having issues. So off to Google I go. Websites galore. So I start my quick research. Found what I needed and went off to use. As with every essential oil it says to do a test patch, but again like I mentioned I&#x27;m impatient. Helps lighten stretch marks? Don&#x27;t mind if I do.  Facial moisturizer including anti-aging, dark circles and helps rosacea? All that also?  Yeah I&#x27;ll put the recommended 3-4 drops on my face thank you very much.  I didn&#x27;t notice a smell at all when I opened it or when I was using it.  I rubbed it on my face and after 5 mins it didn&#x27;t feel oily at all.  I did notice later on throughout the day that my chin which has a touch of acne (thanks hormones) was really dry. But the rest of my face was still smooth and not as shiny. This morning I put it in my hair mixed with coconut oil that had sat in the fridge all night. I microwaved it to warm it up and put that in my hair. I did notice more of a rose smell after it say all night. Gave it about an hour and went and took a shower. Once it dried my hair was so soft and a little bit shinier. I highly enjoyed this oil.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to store yours in a cool dark place. I live in Arizona so I decided the refrigerator was the best place for mine.</li>
            <li> I really like this. No smell like I was looking for. And it&#x27;s so smooth!!! I used this on my hands, legs and feet and it kept my feet and legs from ash. I usually have to reaply lotion on my feet especially, not with this. I must say I&#x27;m so happy with it. Thank u.&lt;br /&gt;I received this during a promo period for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I only try this in my scalp because I have problem with dandruff. So far, I&#x27;m noticing that my dandruff slowly gone from when I started using this. I massage it in my scalp before showering. It helps my hair and scalp moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li> I received the order on time and in good condition.  The product has no odor and the price is good, too.  Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Do you have a medicine cabinet full of moisturizers? We do. In fact my girls have turned one of the extra bedrooms into their &amp;#34;ready&amp;#34; room. No kidding when I say this room has more stock than most retail stores! Anything you need can be found in their ready room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my makeup drawer is different. I only like to keep the products that I am currently using close at hand. Today you would see one bottle on the counter top. I was asked to give rosehip oil a spin and I am pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their 4 ounce bottle is full of unrefined, pure certified organic rosehip oil.  The best part; there are no harmful chemicals typically found in traditional moisturizers. Each bottle is free of parabens, artificial ingredients and fragrance oils. This specific oil is harvested in Chile, in small batches, and bottled in the US in the advanced FDA approved facility. You’re getting a quality,  premium oil never tested on animals and cruelty-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’ve never considered a one ingredient moisturizer for yourself from head-to-toe, you will be surprised with everything rosehip oil can do. With its vital fatty acids, it hydrates and tightens skin leaving you looking refreshing.  It has been used for centuries to treat a wide range of common skin problems. From fine lines, to acne scars, as well as aged sun spots, rosehip oil is fast absorbing and can improve your skin issues significantly. Even if you’ve suffered from skin conditions like Psoriasis, Dermatitis or the more common Eczema, it moisturizes and heals those dry, flaky spots and helps aid your skin in healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skinology Beauty Solutions offers a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee. Their main priority is you, and they want you to be satisfied regarding any of their products, and will make sure that all of your needs are fulfilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest giving this product a run.

            <li> Got this free or discounted.....&lt;br /&gt;Love the way this makes my face feel and look. I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. I have locs and only use natural oils</li>
            <li> Started using this on my face &amp; lips and I saw an immediate reaction. It seemed as if it helped with the inflammation on my face. My skin is very sensitive to everything including food and seems to always be inflamed in some way. I realized how dry&amp; thirsty my skin is. It absorbed right away. It got on my lips by accident which was a great thing. They were so soft &amp; subtle the next day. I use it on my lips regularly now. Tonight my very curly hair was dry &amp; frizzy from the humidity. I thought why not try it....I was very cautious, used a small amount as to not make it look greasy. It worked great. Absorbed right away, calmed down the frizz and gave my hair a nice shine. This is a good product and you do not need to use a lot.</li>
            <li> Dropper came broken. Other than that, perfect.</li>
            <li> I have been using over a week, I love it..I stopped using face creams, moisturizers..... organic rosehip oil is perfect for my skin and sculp...  THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have I have included Skinology Rosehip Oil in my daily beauty regimen!</li>
            <li> I am in love! I have a couple different kinds of oils but rosehip oil is my favorite! I have been using this as my nightly moisturizer since I have gotten it. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy and I have even noticed that acne scarring and even popped pimples are starting to disappear in just a week. This is a great oil- the only ingredient is organic rosehip oil. My favorite addition I think is the dropper that comes with it as well. I was given this product discounted so I can give my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. It absorbs so quick. It cleared up my skin in under a week. The bottle will last awhile too. Feels much better than the expensive name brand moisturizer I was using for years. I wish I had known about this sooner.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about how FABULOUS rosehip oil is for beauty. Using rosephip oil was truly a game changer for me. I never thought you could use oil on your face and not have your face oily or breaking out. But this rosehip oil does neither. I use it at night before bed after cleansing and toning as a moisturizer. It is really awesome how the oil absorbs into my skin almost instantaneously, leaving my skin feeling like a million bucks. It&#x27;s also great at softening cuticles, and strengthening nails. Last but not least, I added some to my conditioner for a deeper conditioning session. I would say this oil is nothing short of being the perfect beauty oil. It&#x27;s a bonus that this rosehip oil is organic. The best part is that a little goes a long way, so this bottle will last a good long while. I received this wonderful oil at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> RoseHip oil is a favorite for sure! It can be used for skin issues, dry scalp, added to soaps and lotions and so much more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skinology Beauty&#x27;s rose hip oil has met all of our expectations. The scent is lovely, processing is safe and allows the oil to maintain its benefits and the price is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From dry skin to dandruff- this oil has so many helpful uses its a must have!! Reviewing this has been my pleasure, all experiences and opinions are my own</li>
            <li> I read a lot of skincare blogs that recommended using this (sometime in combination with other oils, like argan) as a nighttime moisturizer. I wanted to give it a try and I&#x27;m glad i did! This stuff is magic! A little goes a long way. I have combo/oily skin and this has actually helped make me LESS oily..not sure how that works, but it does!</li>
            <li> I had no idea how many uses there are for Rosehip Oil.  I am just getting into essential oils, and so I am learning all of the wonderful benefits that these oils provide.  Upon receiving this, I noticed that Rosehip is used to combat one of my biggest problems, brittle nails.  I can grow my nails, but they are very weak and always break, and of course always at the most inopportune moments when I don&#x27;t have nail clippers or a nail file to correct the issue.  So I started using the rosehip oil, and massaging it into my cuticles every night before bed.  I cannot believe the difference that it has made in my nails.  They are stronger and beautiful, now I can start doing nail art, which has always been something that interested me.  And this comes in a huge 4 oz bottle that will last for a very long time, so it is a great value as well. I was provided a sample for review and I did not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.</li>
            <li> This bottle is huge! I love that it comes with a dropper so that you can really control how much you use and there is no waste. I am new to using essential oils and I was happy to buy this Rosehip oil at a promotional price and share my honest and unbiased opinion about the product here with you. The product arrived quickly and undamaged. It comes nicely packaged in it&#x27;s own box if you order other items at the same time.  I have used this product as a shaving oil and added to my skin moisturizer and I must say it has worked really quite well on all occasions. I added about 3 drops to my shaving gel and my legs did not suffer from any razor burn like I normally get. When I added this to my skin moisturizer it felt great! I live in an extreme climate where the weather in the winter is always below zero leaving my skin rough and dry and I know that the addition of this essential oil to my regular moisturizing products is going to make the world of difference to my skin! Overall I am loving this product and I would highly recommend this to my friends!</li>
            <li> This oil has quickly become a favorite go to for many of my homemade products. It&#x27;s such a versatile product that I can use in my soaps, body lotions, creams for my face. I can count on it to help protect my skin from aging, dryness, scars... whatever &#x27;problem&#x27; I need to address, it seems rosehip is the oil to add.&lt;br /&gt;It makes so much sense, too. Rosehip is full of anti-oxidants and vitamins that ate really beneficial to the skin. It also works great for your nails.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually going to try making my own lotion for sun protection this year, using rosehip. It&#x27;s known to help with sun damage so I&#x27;m going to add it in, of course, it&#x27;s already in my moisturizer for daily use so it&#x27;ll be one more shot of my &#x27;secret&#x27; skin-saving ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;I also like this company. I made sure that, when this was offered for review, I checked the company out and how they made and processed their oils before signing up to review it. High quality oils are very important in making products. You don&#x27;t want just any oil in the products you&#x27;re using on your body. My skin is very sensitive so I&#x27;m always conscious of what I use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to use this and to find more ways to use it. My file does homemade/handmade Christmas gifts because there&#x27;s so many of us. This is going to be a key ingredient in many of the products they&#x27;ll be getting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way it makes my skin feel so oily. I have noticed no improvement whatsoever using this product.</li>
            <li> UNBELIEVABLE. it is unbelievable that a product this awesome was available to me and i had no idea of its existence. I keep looking at my body because its hard to believe most of my stretch marks are gone after a few applications. My body was covered in marks from the birth of my daughter 27 years ago. My skin is now extra soft and my self confidence is thru the roof. THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH FOR THIS AMAZING PRODUCT. I AM NOW YOUR UNOFFICIAL SPOKESPERSON. I ALREADY HAVE ANOTHER ON ORDER. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU</li>
            <li> I LOVE this oil. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and I can honestly say that it&#x27;s improved my skin tone and texture. As with all products, you have to be patient with seeing results. I&#x27;m so glad I continued using this religiously at nighttime before bed because I can certainly see a difference. My blemishes are much lighter and my pores have reduced. I still get a few pimples here and there, but that&#x27;s just a monthly problem. This oil keeps them from scarring as badly as they normally would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a quick heads up about adding this to my beauty routine: I&#x27;ve also started drinking A LOT more water and I&#x27;ve completely rid my face cleansing routine of chemical-ridden products. I have actually started using this rosehip oil for the oil cleansing method. It has really done wonders for my skin. I am definitely purchasing more as soon as I run out!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  Love this oil! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for Rosacea. My boyfriend has it and it&#x27;s worked wonders on his skin tone. I find it to be so much more though. We like our Sunday night baths. It&#x27;s amazing to shave with. The beauty of it is that wherever you use it, it finds a way to make it work. I use it in my hair, my scalp and nails. My hands don&#x27;t look old where they once did. I love the dropper it comes with because you can use it everywhere. I use it on my feet to scale off my heels and I no longer waste money on a pedicure because there&#x27;s no need. It&#x27;s a multipurpose oil that&#x27;s not an oil. I don&#x27;t know how else to explain it. It&#x27;s a cure ALL. Just use it on everything! I feel honored to have been given the opportunity to purchase it for testing and evaluation as a consumer to review for you. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Great results on diminishing skin scars.</li>
            <li> I love the size of this bottle. The eyedropper is ideal as an applicator.  From the internet, I learned it t has been used for generations by the Andean Indians of Chile who recognized years ago that Rosehip oil had exceptional healing skin care and hair care benefits. It’s brimming with natural nutrients and vitamins and can be used both externally and taken internally. I have been using it on a surgery scar and it is diminishing the depth and moisturizing nicely.  I highly recommend this product for hair, nails, and to make your skin glow.</li>
            <li> It was a surprise how large this bottle is. I love essential oils, and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this purchase.  The Skinology rosehip oil is 100% organic. This means no harmful additives are in the oil.  I plan to used this oil to make homemade soap, but there is 100s of uses for it. It is good for your skin, hair, and nails. Some people add a drop of rosehip oil to their shampoo to make their hair look more healthy.  I also liked that a glass dropper was included with this purchase, it makes dispenses the oil so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;*I purchased this product at a reduced price in return for an honest and unbiased opinion. I received no compensation and my review was based on my experience and opinion of the rosehip oil alone.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day and my skin is becoming so soft and the hyper pigmentation I have is lightening up!!</li>
            <li> I have been using it at night with my moisturizer and it has a nice feeling, doesn&#x27;t smell, it is good.</li>
            <li> Love this product it perfect just I ordered!!!!!</li>
            <li> really make your skin soft</li>
            <li> Great Rosehip Oil ! Works perfectly for my dry itchy skin, especially during winter when my psoriasis is out of control. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have been an Amazon customer for years and have never written a review. But I am amazed at the difference in my 57 year old skin after one week using this. Skin texture, wrinkles, lines, have all been improved. Better than any $100 skin cream I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> Worked great in my DIY deoderant. Can&#x27;t wait to make other items with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for new products for my skin and this is a great addition to my collection. Ropehip oil is amazing for your hair and skin, as well as a bunch of other great uses. It&#x27;s really one of those wonderful oils that works wonders for lots of different things. This is a huge 4 fl. oz bottle that will last you a long time. Definitely worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I had a different brand of rosehip oil and it was oranger and smelled more rancid. I bought this stuff to replace it with and its a much better oil! Clear and odorless. Like the dropper best. So far, great product!</li>
            <li> Nice oil, has no odor at all. I use it on and around my eyelids. Comes with a dropper.</li>
            <li> Works great for itching on the scalp. Makes the itch go away.</li>
            <li> I am loving this oil!! My skin is so smooth and has helped my excema flare up tremendously!</li>
            <li> good product,doesn&#x27;t have smell ,clear ,didn&#x27;t make my skin oily or sting my skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely happy with this product. I´m a fan (I guess) of oils and extracts, and so far had bought several of them... Squalane, argan, hyalurinic acid, jojoba, vitamin c, and now I found this one!! The best one of them all until now. Just a few drops will do the work, because is so dense, and it feels so smooth on my skin. I´d been using it for only one week, once a day in the night, after my cleansing routine, and the thin lines on my forehead and around the eyes, had disappeared. A great buy and discovery!!</li>
            <li> i love this oil because it doesn&#x27;t stain!!! I will definitely buy it again!!</li>
            <li> This makes my skin glow! I really love it. The first time I put it on my skin tingled a little. It felt really good. Refreshing. But it through me off. That&#x27;s never happened to me before so I was a bit put off by it. But the more I use it the more I like the feeling. I have used a lot of skin care products but I wanted something natural and this is it. I would definitely. Get this again or get it for friends and loved ones.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:3da29ec309092651a79e279f46a515e0]]For facial skin care, rose hip oil offers several benefits when applied externally. The anti-aging benefit from using rose hip oil on your face are amazing due to the antioxidants and the oil&#x27;s ability to penetrate into deeper layers of skin. The vitamin C antioxidants stimulate collagen production. The oil can penetrate deeper in the skin due to the vitamin A, vitamin A improves the skin&#x27;s moisture levels and reduces wrinkles and fine lines. The essential fatty acids in rose hip seed oil can help reduce scarring and promote skin regeneration. The oil comes in a dark glass bottle with is great for storage, and a dropper is included. The bottle is sealed when delivered and a dropper is included.</li>
            <li> My primary objective with wanting to try this product was to improve the state of my cuticles.  What I got was so much more than that.  I suffer from eczema and psoriasis and generally dry skin.  This particular oil has done so much to improve the health of my skin.  My cuticles are healthier and happier than they have been in a long time.  The skin around my stretch marks on my abdomen is not as shiny and maybe I am crazy but it seems almost like the stretch marks are starting to shrink a little bit.  Overall, I am very pleased with this product and look forward to receiving continued benefits from this oil over the coming months.</li>
            <li> Love this carrier rosehip oil. Large bottle and does not have bad smell. I use it as make-up remover and it does the job well, plus not breaking me out. I also use as base mix for other essential oils and apply after every bath. I have some bug bites and old scars and I notice some fading away by using this oil. Love it!</li>
            <li> Received it and just started using it on my face. It is a a lot lighter, almost clear, and thinner than the other rose hip oil I have used. Will update after I have used it more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for nearly two weeks now and initially it caused me to break out, I think because my skin wasn&#x27;t used to being oily.  I kept using it despite the break outs and it really toned out my skin and faded acne scars.  My skin feels very soft and has a nice glow, no more breakouts since.  I would recommend using it when your skin feels drier, like during winter months or after a hot shower to replenish stripped oils.  Using it too much or during hot weather when you are more likely to sweat and have oilier skin seems to cause break outs (at least for me).  It is very large considering you only need a few drops per use so I can see this lasting up to year if you use it once or twice a week as I do.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It&#x27;s a very generous supply, which is nice in terms of reordering.  Makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li> This oil made an almost instant difference in my skin and hair.  It was easily absorbed into the very dry shafts of my hair and equally dry skin.  It is surprisingly light!  More updates later.......</li>
            <li> I ordered this brand of Rosehip Oil because it is cold pressed and a great value, but I am somewhat disappointed in it. The dropper is terrible; hard to control because it drips like crazy even with the smallest amount of oil in it. The oil itself is lighter in color and thinner than another more expensive product that I previously purchased. It&#x27;s an ok product, but I probably will not buy it again. I&#x27;ll continue my search for the best all around product and value.</li>
            <li> This is a very good and versatile product. I love the ways it goes into my skin and use it especially under a gel for a  counductive device.</li>
            <li> So far I love how it makes my skin feel.  Will be using in combination with other oils for various uses.  Looking forward to seeing results on scars.  Plan to use with tea tree oil to reduce acne and scarring.</li>
            <li> Great product thank you.</li>
            <li> This oil can be used both externally and internally.  When I was given a free sample of this for me to try out, I was not sure what to use it for, so I googled it.  Here are some of it&#x27;s applications:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1: to combat dry hair (just apply to dry ends)&lt;br /&gt;2: apply it to dry and cracked skin to nourish and moisturize it&lt;br /&gt;3: use on scar tissue to speed up healing process&lt;br /&gt;4: prevent dandruff (massage into scalp)&lt;br /&gt;5: nourish brittle nails&lt;br /&gt;6: Use as a pre-shave treatment to protect skin from damage caused by shaving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very pleasant and not over bearing.</li>
            <li> wonderful stuff! thanks</li>
            <li> It is a clear oil with no fragrance.  I am used to an orange tinted oil that smells like rose hips.  But it seems to be working fine on my skin.  Good shipping and delivery.</li>
            <li> Perfect - thanks for the PDF info too!</li>
            <li> I like it. Thick. I have learned not to apply where my skin gets clogged.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this rosehip oil. It has been a success in my use with essential oil</li>
            <li> Wonderful. My skin became real soft.</li>
            <li> My sister in law is in from Spain and staying with us for a month. She forgot to bring this and so I looked online and found this great deal. It arrived very promptly and she said it is higher quality than the one she normally buys for a much higher price. We were very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great packaging and fast shipping. Unfortunately, my skin didn&#x27;t react well to the rosehip oil, and it caused some irritation and cystic acne. It had nothing to do with the quality of the product, my skin just did not agree with it.</li>
            <li> Rosehip Oil has so many benefits, so I had to purchase a bottle for myself! Unfortunately, the dropper was not packaged properly. I opened the package to find the dropper broken into three pieces. For now I am using the Rosehip Oil with cotton pads. Hope your shipment arrives nice and unbroken!</li>
            <li> after 3 days od use my face started to break out.</li>
            <li> Very nice and soothing and no smell</li>
            <li> I have severe eczema and thought this product would help. It smelled good and was oily but it didn&#x27;t hydrate my skin like I thought it would. Bio Oil worked more for me then this product did, but it was not a complete failure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never see or smelt a pure essential oil that had like no smell It almost seemed like cooking or some other oil that has no scent ,definetly not rosehip ,</li>
            <li> Love the product and quick delivery. Will buy again when finish using</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried Rosehip Oil.  (I had heard about it on Dr Oz.)  I didn&#x27;t know  if it would smell like roses. It doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve  had weird dry patches on my scalp for the last couple of years - almost like cradle-cap.  The Rosehip Oill is  helping them.&lt;br /&gt;Normally when I use any oil - Aragan, Coconut, Grapefruit Seed - on my face, I get bumps.  So far, my complexion likes the RHO.&lt;br /&gt;Basically, you can use this - externally - anywhere on your body.  It absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> I use several of their products as bases when making essential oils face products. I am still the ginuea pig and haven&#x27;t had others try them but I am very satisfied with all aspects of their product from quality to timely delivery.</li>
            <li> this is great for my hair and one of the herbs that I purchased for healing the adrenal glands, will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to have a rose scent and it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Awesome would buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m torn on how to review the Skinology Rosehip Seed Oil.  It came nicely packaged, and absorbs quickly into my skin without feeling greasy.  If it is indeed 100% pure and cold-pressed, great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% pure cold-pressed rosehip seed oil should have the following qualities among others:&lt;br /&gt;-deep orange/amber color&lt;br /&gt;-thick oil&lt;br /&gt;-fragrant scent (that some describe as rosy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the Skinology oil I received is:&lt;br /&gt;-nearly clear, with a very slight yellow tint (it&#x27;s clearer than vegetable oil!)  I can&#x27;t post an external link on Amazon for what color it should be, but if you search Google Images it&#x27;s easy to find examples.&lt;br /&gt;-runny (same consistency as vegetable oil)&lt;br /&gt;-no discernable scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am concerned that this oil is diluted with something else.  If just one of the above were lacking, I would write it off as difference in processing technique or something.  But even if it were 100% rosehip seed oil but heavily processed, it should still retain at least a little color, thickness, and scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without having confidence in what this oil may be adulterated with, I&#x27;m not comfortable risking it on my skin or scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I am including a photo with this review of the color of the rosehip oil I received.  As you can see from comparing it to photos of quality pure oil, this does not look right!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product in exchange for testing, inspecting and reviewing it.  I received no other compensation for my review and always give my honest and unbiased opinion of each product.  I welcome your questions &amp; comments on my experience.</li>
            <li> works okay!  It just takes repetitive use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE it! I mixed a couple of drops of this &amp; pure emu oil into my big chest piece after spraying it with a water/collidal silver mixture, as it was having difficulty healing and within 3 days it was healed. Now I use my rosehip oil on my face &amp; tattoo&#x27;s as well. I will be a repeat customer for sure!</li>
            <li> I strongly believe this oil is not authentic simple because it has none of the characteristics of real rosehip.  I am trying to locate customer service so they could honor their money back guaranteed.  I will never purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. Is great for my face.</li>
            <li> I got this oil complimentary to review and I was pretty excited about it! I have heard great things about Rosehip Oil and I have been wanting to try some for quite some time. So far I have used this as a moisturizer and it really does moisturize! I ended up using way too much and had to wipe a lot off of my skin, but my skin has never been smoother. I want to use this stuff everywhere I can! My only complaint has been that it is really oily, but  suppose that cannot be avoided and I&#x27;m sure using less will help keep the extra oily feeling away. I have only used this a couple times, but I cannot wait to see the long term benefits of using it. It does smell really good and so far it has worked just as advertised.I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I suffer from eczema and dry cracked skin and was referred to rosehip oil by a friend who suggested I give it try to see if it would help me. There are many practical uses for rosehip oil. You can also use this for your hair as well aromatherapy as well. One four ounce bottle looks like it can last a long time. It comes with a dropper, which makes it a lot more convenient to apply. It&#x27;s also a lot more hygienic. I like how this rosehip oil by Skinology is 100% pure and organic so there are no harmful chemicals or parabens involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell takes some time to get used to but it is not unpleasant. I did not suffer from any negative reactions after application. It applies on like a very light oil and my dry skin seems to soak it up like a sponge. This has been useful for my dry cracked skin and for some of my scars and stretch marks. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of natural products, particularly if they&#x27;re multi-use. This Rosehip Oil was both, so I decided to give it a full testing run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try it on my hair. I didn&#x27;t not have a great result as a full conditioner, as I have an oily scalp already, but it worked beautifully as a frizz smoother for my dry, split ends, and it really gave a lasting smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nails: I posted before and after pics here. One application, and my dry, flaky cuticles and nails felt smooth and healthier. I continued it through the week, and I haven&#x27;t broken a nail yet, which is so not the norm for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feet: Again, before and after here, and again, one application. I rubbed a decent amount on the area, pulled my sock over it, and went about my business. As you see, nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no irritation at all, no matter where I put it, including my face. I don&#x27;t get any real scent, just a mild sweetness that reminds me of fresh-pressed olive oil, so it won&#x27;t stand out from your other body scents like some beauty products do. All in all, I say the claims are on task, and this is a great natural product. It&#x27;s a nice sized bottle, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount for testing and review purposes. My opinions and love for natural products are my own.</li>
            <li> Doing great for my 2 yr old SEVERE ezcema!</li>
            <li> I am so happy to try this Av&amp;iacute;an&#x27; Botanicals Rosehip Organic oil..This can be used for hair therapy too..My husband has dandruff issues so we tried this to his scalp and hair, we left it in over night. the next morning his scalp wasn&#x27;t dry the hair left shinny. It comes in a easy pump bottle, has a beautiful rose smile to it. I received this Rosehip oil for testing in exchange to my honest and unbiased opinion and this opinion is solely mine</li>
            <li> Great Rosehip Oil! Easy to apply, quickly absorbed into my damaged skin and I started seeing results right away. My skin is nourished and pleasant to the touch and the oil has a great smell which is very important . Thank you Skinology!</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this oil. I specifically bought it for my extremely dry cuticles and because the reviews were more positive than negative I decided to try it. It just doesn&#x27;t work for me. There is no odor so that&#x27;s nice and after the initial application even though oily that eventually absorbs into the skin to where there is no oily residue. I guess I&#x27;ll just have to keep looking.</li>
            <li> After hearing all wonderful reviews about the huge demand on all natural oils for skin I was excited to try this Organic Rosehip Oil from Skinology. I like the size of the bottle - 4 ounces of pure unrefined rosehip seed oil. It has multiple skincare uses but my absolute favorite is to put it on my face to hydrate and heal my sun damaged skin. Also can be used for stretch marks, acne and scars. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to just reiterate what another reviewer posted because I feel the exact same way about this product.  I have purchased very expensive PURE rosehip oil from Whole Foods &amp; other natural food stores and know what it&#x27;s supposed to look, feel, smell like.  This is not even close.  So here&#x27;s what the other reviewer wrote that I wholeheartedly agree with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...absorbs quickly into my skin without feeling greasy. If it is indeed 100% pure and cold-pressed, great.  BUT, 100% pure cold-pressed rosehip seed oil should have the following qualities among others:&lt;br /&gt;-deep orange/amber color&lt;br /&gt;-thick oil&lt;br /&gt;-fragrant scent (that some describe as rosy)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve determined that rosehip oil is a cheap but very effective alternative to potentially harmful chemical filled facial serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While its benefits are endless, I primarily use it to fight fine lines without using potentially harmful anti-aging products. I apply a thin layer of this all-natural oil at night to help keep wrinkles at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip oil is also known for its healing properties, it&#x27;s high dosage of vitamin A, it&#x27;s ability to lighten imperfections like acne scarring and sun spots,  and it&#x27;s hydration. My skin has improved leaps and bounds since using rosehip oil. The scent did take a bit of getting used to. I can best describe it as &#x27;earthy&#x27;. The benefits far outweigh any temporary dislike of the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*discount given for reviewing purposes</li>
            <li> This oil is great. I rub it in on my face and chest morning and night, my skin hasn&#x27;t look this good in years!</li>
            <li> I love this oil.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something to help diminish old acne scare, I read the reviewed and figured I give it a try.  I only been using this for two weeks regularly day and night, I apply all over my face, neck and chest.  I have some hard acne bumps on my neck and chest, they were gone first week.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the oil or not, I have similar problem on the back of my leg, they are much bigger.  I started applying to them twice a day as well and they seem to be getting thinner and I think it should disappear soon.  My original problem, old acne scare, I don&#x27;t see any difference yet but its only two weeks, I am hopeful that over time its gets lighter.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said just love this oil and can&#x27;t get enough of it, I have to see if it come&#x27;s in a bigger bottle, since I apply all over.</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil as a sample for review and evaluation and so far I really like it! I have heard a lot of back and forth about the scent but for me I can barely smell it and it&#x27;s similar to olive oil smell only much weaker. I don&#x27;t smell anything at all after it&#x27;s applied to my skin and I love they way it feels once it has absorbs. I love that this oil is organic and comes with a dropper. I use this on my face by putting a few drops on a cotton ball and then massaging it into my skin.  It gives me a deeper hydration and nice healthy glow. Overall I am very pleased with this oil and have had no issues with it.</li>
            <li> Such a great essential oil and perfect for dry skin. A few of my family members have extremely dry skin and I have let them try this out and they love it. I would recommend adding a few drops to mix it with a high quality moisturizer; that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve done and let them try and it moisturizes and hydrates their skin especially the stubborn areas (knees, elbows, bottom of feet, and bum). This serves as a great helper in moisturizing dry skin. This is an all natural product so there are no side affects unless you are allergic to rosehips. I received a complimentary sample for testing and reviewing purposes and this is a great essential oil with great benefits; truly recommend it.</li>
            <li> excellent price for pure rosehip oil!</li>
            <li> I have actually been using a different oil to help with some skin issues like dry cracking heels and fingers. I have heard that Rosehip Oil is great for skin pigmentation issues which my 3 year old has. Well she has white blotches throughout her body. So when I was offered this Organic Rosehip Oil from Skinology for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion and thoughts about it, I had to order a bottle. I started using it on my daughter immediately and I have been using it on myself as well. My fingers get super dry from washing bottles every day and my feet are just dry from life. After about a week of using it, my skin is no longer cracked and dry. And my daughter&#x27;s skin is looking really good! Her blotches are starting to blend which is awesome! If you&#x27;re looking for a great skin care product, I highly recommend this Organic Rosehip Oil from Skinology!</li>
            <li> Great oil. Fast service&lt;br /&gt;Packaged for ready use with dropper and regular cap.</li>
            <li> This oil is great quality and very moisturizing! I got my order got to me super fast! I am very pleased!!!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of essential oils. I use them a lot.I love that when I used the Rosehip oil it absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy. It leaves my skin feeling smooth.  Rosehip oil also is great for wrinkles and minimizing therm.. It had not bad odor which i also love. Its organic and thats a plus for me. I like that it has a dropper which is pretty handy, Most of my essential oils don;t bring a dropper.  I was given the opportunity to test this product out complimentary and share my experiences and feedback. I would buy it again because it is a good essential oil to have because of its benefits. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> wow is this stuff great.  just used it a few times and my face is so smooth&lt;br /&gt;will be buying again&lt;br /&gt;and fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;happy customer</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I have used it on my face daily for the past two weeks, and my skin is brighter with a noticeable improvement in skin tone and in wrinkles around the eyes, mouth, and even my neck. I have already recommended it...you have to try it to  believe it. The 4 oz bottle is a great buy.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary Rosehip oil for a purpose of giving my honest opinion about it. I am using it for 5 days already and like the fact that it makes my skin moist and glowing. Not to mention that it is all natural and organic without any added chemicals or alcohol-pure rosehip oil. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week or so, but I can already see a significant improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture and tone. Definitely a fan!</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try this product and share my honest opinion.First of all, it doesnt have a strong smell as I thought , but this oil has a nice aroma.The size of the bottle is huge - 4 ounces of pure natural quality moisturizer! I prefer using it on my dry itchy scalp to moisturize and nourish my dry skin. Very satisfied with the product and will purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this!! So far, and I&#x27;ve been using it about a week, it&#x27;s been amazing! I&#x27;ve used a lot of oils for various ap plications so when given the chance to try this one at no cost, I figured why not. This one so far has made my skin feel noticably softer and my hair, I can&#x27;t say enough if I use it on wet hair and then blow dry! A lot of products leave my hair looking oily which I don&#x27;t like, but this one doesn&#x27;t so far it&#x27;s seems to absorb in pretty good, and leave it soft without the oily look. This is one I&#x27;ll definitely one I&#x27;ll keep using.</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is just one of the amazing skin treatments I use daily , this is a generous size jar that comes with a dropper. I did order t through a promotion to try it and share my honest and unbiased opinion. This oil is organic therefore I know I can use it with confidence , also the quality of this one is superior than the ones I ordered in the past.I do use it to minimize my fine lines and have been getting some great results after a few weeks of continuous use.Rosehip is very popular in South America where I come from, this is a great ne, buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> I really have seen a difference in my skin, even after a just a few uses. I apply it on my face, elbows, and feet. I can feel the rough spaces being smoothed out already and my skin sucks it in. I can see the biggest improvement in my feet and heels, which are extremely dry.  I like that this product is organic and  pure. I was happy to receive this during a promotional period to sample and review. Will definitely buy again from this seller. Good, pure and wholesome products are hard to find these days.....</li>
            <li> Using it with Essential Oils for face serum. Works great.</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil is perfect for making facial creams and their is a large volume of oil in this bottle.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> lovely high-quality product! I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks now and it has dramatically cleared up previous acne scars. very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I like all kinds of natural skincare products but oils are my favorite!!! Absolutely in love with this Rosehip oil from Skinology! Great for my cracked skin and cuticles and it is absolutely natural and organic!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for what I think are laugh lines and crows feet.. So I found this for a promotional price In exchange for a honest and non paid review. So when I use this I use a few drops under each eye. After using this for about a week or so I have seen a huge difference. One of the things I have noticed is when I put on my eye makeup. My makeup goes on smoother and I don&#x27;t feel like I have to put ISO much around my eyes to make them look less tired and younger.  And this has been wonderful. Folks if you have lines that need smoothed please try this it is affordable, and it is so gentle on the skin.i have fallen in love with this type of oil...</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and service</li>
            <li> I was excited to see the many wonderful reviews on this product bc its size and price are both unbelievable @ first glance. I will update my review in a few months, but after having it for a week, here goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this organic rose hip oil in two days. It&#x27;s a massive size glass bottle (4 ml) and was packaged properly to ensure safe delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m adding this to my vitamin C facial serum that I use every day and once a week with my micro needling tool. I mix a tablespoon of organic coconut oil (unrefined) 1/4 of a capsule of a 1000 mg vitamin C tablet, &amp; 1/2 dropper of this rose hip oil (was using an expensive organic rose hip oil previously). This oil is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. The consistency of the oil is amazing. BTW, this Vitamin C/Rose Hip Serum recipe is terrific if you are interested in brightening your complexion, reverse-aging or prevention, etc. I use it nightly and after 10-15 min, pat off excess (on neck, as well)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was taught at a young age to get a handle on this aging thing ASAP. I&#x27;m 37 &amp; get mistaken for my 16 stepson &amp; 13 year-old son&#x27;s sister, rather than mom! I search for the purest of products and this rose hip oil is bar far the best that I&#x27;ve found. I will definitely repurchase @ this price and quantity.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, packaged neatly. Great product which I have been using on my skin and hair for a couple of weeks so far.</li>
            <li> Started using for skincare.  Rosehip &amp; essential oils plus Jojoba - results within day - skin is smoother, pores are smaller and I can use it during the day because it absorbs so quickly and completely.  Love this oil!&lt;br /&gt;I put about two drops (3 drops @ night) on damp hands, distribute, then apply to moist face.  It&#x27;s organic and goes a long way - will never buy regular lotions again!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin really smooth! I like to put it in after a shower.</li>
            <li> I ordered a different brand of rosehip before but couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.  This rosehip works just as well and there&#x27;s no scent.  Great for use on the face.</li>
            <li> Rosehip Oil is a pure and lovely oil to use in a daily skin care regime.  This one meets all expectation.</li>
            <li> I had ordered 2 brands of organic Rosehip oil - giving 2 stars since this is at least oil, there is no color, no scent.  The other organic brand is a beautiful texture, color, and mild scent  - seems and feels to be more authentic and higher quality.  GIven this big difference, I will use this rosehip in the bath and the other for facials, therapeutic massage and healing</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, seems to be good quality</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to oils. I have been testing different oils and I have decided there are a lot of benefits from then. When I was offered the chance to review Rosehip Oil for my unbiased opinion I was so excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil has many different uses. It is good for a shine on your hair, your skin and your cuticles. In the winter time I always get dry skin. so I am using this for that purpose also and it is helping greatly.It absorbs into my skin without leaving that greasy feeling ( which I dislike).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil also helps with acne scars,stretch marks and age spots&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great oil for your skin and hair. I do recommend this oil for anyone that needs a little help with your skin.</li>
            <li> I have that weird scalp that is both oily and super flaky/itchy. I do not have eczema but I think it is something pretty close. I have been trying to find something to help with the itching and flaking for a while now – pills, shampoos, conditioners, everything except essential oils. When I got this bottle of Rosehip Oil, I read through the directions quickly and went to warming it up and putting it in my hair and on my scalp. Oh my gosh, this almost immediately stopped the itching! I left it on my hair/head for about an hour then took a shower with my normal shampoo and conditioner. I was SO amazed when I managed to go the whole next day without having to mentally tell myself not to scratch my head!!!! This essential oil is absolutely amazing! Not only did it help with the itching and flaking, but my hair looks FABULOUS! This was the perfect timing for this to come in because I have interviews this week. I was given a chance to test and give my honest opinion on this product during a promotion.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this oil!! Is actually drying out my acne! Will definitely purchase from Skinology again.</li>
            <li> lovely oil.&lt;br /&gt;I just received this and thought I would try a bit on my hands as I work in clay and my hands are really rough.&lt;br /&gt;Just a few drops and my skin feels softer and not greasy either.&lt;br /&gt;I just goes into my skin instantly buffering the roughness...amazing.&lt;br /&gt;A very, very light scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this rosehip oil to replace a rosehip oil I ordered from somewhere else. The one I ordered from somewhere else said it was pure, but when it arrived the label said it was mixed with vitamin E oil. This one is pure and it has done wonders for my skin. I do mix it with lavender, frankincense, and lemon essential oils. I use this as my carrier oil. Several people have commented on how good my skin looks. I am 44. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It comes with glass dropper and secure cap which oil stay fresh and not spilled.&lt;br /&gt;If oil color is dark and smell like fishy ( I mean both, color itself is not a matter ) that is rancid be aware of that. Many other Rosehip oil review said dark color and scent is real Rosehip oil but I don&#x27;t think so. once you put on your face You will figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I been apply rancid Rosehip oil before&lt;br /&gt;( mine are dark yellow color with fishy smell) my face feel itchy and got small red dot.&lt;br /&gt;This Rosehip oil is so good. I apply at night and wake up with soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;I purchase more for present.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product -- highly recommend.</li>
