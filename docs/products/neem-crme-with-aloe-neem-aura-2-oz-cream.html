    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very nice herbal cream, and</li>
            <li>But dR. Oz said Neem is good.</li>
            <li>It works really good</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this!</li>
            <li>I love it !</li>
            <li>but im sure it was good stuff</li>
            <li>This is a great therapeutic cream and the best neem cream I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other ones.  </li>
            <li>The Aura cream is safe and can be used repeatedly unlike benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>This cream is okay.</li>
            <li>I will return even if it costs me more.  </li>
            <li>I have found hat neem is okay</li>
            <li>okay, the oil has a scent that I just cannot get used to.</li>
            <li>And its still much better than using prescription creams.</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product for my very dry  problematic skin, like elbows, heels, etc.</li>
            <li>I find the smell to strong for me... almost like a tar odor.</li>
            <li>But it goes on smooth and is hydrating.</li>
            <li>I guess it would help me if I used it more, but since I didn&#x27;t had any instant results after trying it and it &amp;#34;tightened&amp;#34; my skin I don&#x27;t have a desire to use it any more.....</li>
            <li>Although from other things I&#x27;ve heard, that smell is better then Neem smells on it own.</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell, not really of neem but lemony kind of...</li>
            <li>This one has a nice smell but is still a high quality cream that contains a high level of neem.  </li>
            <li>Everyone is different, but for me this works the best compared to the jillion other products i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>but the smell disipates pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>please get my name right</li>
            <li>Neem Aura Naturals has been my first line of defense.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really thick, but rubs in great.</li>
            <li>Just bought 4 more as I use it daily on foot.</li>
            <li>I was diagnosed with &amp;#34;rosacea&amp;#34; that was really a demodex mite problem.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used zinc soap and a battery-powered brush along with benzoyl  peroxide on really stubborn spots.  </li>
            <li>Too much Dr Oz</li>
            <li>AND IT WORKS REALLY</li>
            <li>My face was becoming covered in red inflamed areas but is now clear.  </li>
            <li>I actually got my money back from the original company</li>
            <li>The cream seems to be as advertised, but I have only used it a few times and feel I should use it more times to really rate the cream as how well I like it.</li>
            <li>Takes time to clear up</li>
            <li>I have used this once, so far I think it will do what it says.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell.</li>
            <li>Neem is a natural insect repellent and has worked wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>Healed open wounds, blisters, and dry skin fast.</li>
            <li>This product was not good for my skin, it didn&#x27;t feel comfortable wearing it...</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great therapeutic cream and the best neem cream I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other ones.  This one has a nice smell but is still a high quality cream that contains a high level of neem.  I was diagnosed with &amp;#34;rosacea&amp;#34; that was really a demodex mite problem.  Neem is a natural insect repellent and has worked wonderfully.  My face was becoming covered in red inflamed areas but is now clear.  Neem Aura Naturals has been my first line of defense.  I&#x27;ve also used zinc soap and a battery-powered brush along with benzoyl  peroxide on really stubborn spots.  The Aura cream is safe and can be used repeatedly unlike benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this! It has definitely improved the feel of my skin and does not leave it greasy. I also experience less breakouts. I will purchase it again</li>
            <li> Very nice herbal cream, and indeed &amp;#34;little goes a long way&amp;#34; ... use just a small drop and it reaches a big portion of skin. I love it !</li>
            <li> I use need oil  for just about every cut, bruise,  diaper rash, etc and it is ah-mazing! This cream is okay. It has a strong smell, not really of neem but lemony kind of... but the smell disipates pretty quickly. I used it on my face and didn&#x27;t  seem to notice any difference. It&#x27;s really thick, but rubs in great. It also isn&#x27;t  greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This has the funkiest smell - almost like citrus furniture polish. But it goes on smooth and is hydrating. My nose may not like it, but my skin does.</li>
            <li> I have had an issue with one foot having a rash and bumps forming on bottom of my foot Been to two foot doctors with no results. I also have a growth between my toe that looks wart like. Neither doctors helped. Heard of neem and did not know what it was for but I bought one. Works wonders. Just bought 4 more as I use it daily on foot. Takes time to clear up but hey it works.</li>
            <li> This product was not good for my skin, it didn&#x27;t feel comfortable wearing it... I guess it would help me if I used it more, but since I didn&#x27;t had any instant results after trying it and it &amp;#34;tightened&amp;#34; my skin I don&#x27;t have a desire to use it any more.....</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my hands and it can get really awful sometimes. I rub this in all the cracks and breaks in my skin and by the next day they are healing. Everyone is different, but for me this works the best compared to the jillion other products i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Just received the product today and although it may be a good product, I am prevented from reading the ingredient list because some IDIOT pasted a paper label over them that cannot be removed!  VERY UNHAPPY as I bought this to help with a skin allergy.  However, this might make it worse and I have no way of knowing!  BAD BAD BAD I will return even if it costs me more.  This is unacceptable.</li>
            <li> I find the smell to strong for me... almost like a tar odor. I was disappointed. But dR. Oz said Neem is good.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for my very dry  problematic skin, like elbows, heels, etc. This is&lt;br /&gt;ultimately moisturizing, soothing and healing.</li>
            <li> i can not use this product the smell is awful.and my name is zayna not emma.  please get my name right</li>
            <li> I use this cream all the time. It works really good I like the way it makes my skin feel. Would recommend it, as a matter of fact I already have.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing, concentrated, a little goes a long way. Healed open wounds, blisters, and dry skin fast. Non greasy. A pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> I have used this once, so far I think it will do what it says. Waiting on my face crème.</li>
            <li> Too much Dr Oz and I thought this would be a miracle.  I have found hat neem is okay but not a miracle, for me, anyway.  This cream at least smells okay, the oil has a scent that I just cannot get used to.</li>
            <li> I like the product it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores as my face is prone to breakouts only downside it does have a smell to it.</li>
            <li> it starts to peel off in little pieces not a big fan</li>
            <li> Works quite well on my eczema but smells like pine cleaner. Although from other things I&#x27;ve heard, that smell is better then Neem smells on it own. And its still much better than using prescription creams.</li>
            <li> I have had a rash for several months.  It itches very badly.  A friend just told me that it looks like hives.  I was suggested to use Neem and since I have tried just about everything else, I decided to try it.  After 2 days I have noticed a difference.  I no longer itch and the redness has gone.  I feel like I am healing.</li>
            <li> Its ok. Too early to tell.</li>
            <li> I have miss placed it but im sure it was good stuff</li>
            <li> HAVE USED THIS FOR ABOUT A YEAR FOR VARIOUS SKIN BREAKOUTS AND IT WORKS REALLY WELL!</li>
            <li> It took a very long time for this product to arrive.  I actually got my money back from the original company I ordered it from through Amazon.  I ordered it through someone else and they were backordered, but finally received it.  I used it last night for the 1st time and I&#x27;m not sure yet on how I over all feel about it, but I can tell you that it is not motivating to keep using it when it smells like a cross between an onion and tree bark on your face.</li>
            <li> The cream seems to be as advertised, but I have only used it a few times and feel I should use it more times to really rate the cream as how well I like it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it daily for a facial moisturizer and also apply it to hands, arms, and legs.</li>
