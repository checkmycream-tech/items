            <li>Great hairspray!</li>
            <li>reviews were good, so I tried this out!</li>
            <li>The hold is medium, great for fly a ways.</li>
            <li>This one she has not had a problem with at all which is great for me because now I don&#x27;t have to keep fixing her hair.</li>
            <li>I am happy to find this hair spray after searching periodically over literally decades.</li>

            <li>This spray is perfect for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Works well and smells good</li>
            <li>This spray does a good job of staying with you.</li>
            <li>Not as good as I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>it smells lovely and holds beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I really love this line of products!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this hair spray!  </li>
            <li>Finally found the best I have used and it is a great one.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and will definately but again!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for two years and love it.</li>
            <li>I love the pump spray instead of aerosol.</li>
            <li>I Love It.</li>
            <li>To me, this is a coating and doesn&#x27;t work with your hair, it lays on top of it.  </li>
            <li>A light spray is all you need!  </li>
            <li>Excellent product overall!</li>
            <li>Love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ll keep looking for something better...</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>It might be better if it came in a can which can provide a finer mist.</li>
            <li>Scent is too strong for me.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it has a 12-hour hold (like a really strong hold would do), but I think for an 8-hour work-day it should work fine,</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and can&#x27;t find a balance in using this.</li>
            <li>Although it takes a little longer to set, the holding power is great!</li>
            <li>Provides a light hold.  </li>
            <li>If you like a medium hold hair spray that is good enough for daytime use or for use before going out in the evening this is fine.</li>
            <li>Actually, I think the scent itself is really nice and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price for such a good product.  </li>
            <li>It definitely does what it says it does - it&#x27;s a good medium hold.</li>
            <li>Not bad for a hair spray.</li>
            <li>It has a mild citrus scent which doesn&#x27;t stay like the others do.  </li>
            <li>I have alot of curly hair, but each hair is fine, so its really frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I like a more natural hold.  </li>
            <li>But I could see it being useful if you wanted to freeze a style in place.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job as a light styling spray which is exactly what I wanted, no sticky at all, would not recommend if you need something for extra holds or an up do but great for everyday use to hold down friz and keep your hair in place.</li>
            <li>I like this even better than my initial review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this hairspray for a few months, and I think it does a pretty good job of holding my hair into place when I need it too.  </li>
            <li>Just be careful not to squirt too much or your hair gets kind of soggy.</li>
            <li>This hair spray has fabulous natural ingredients, provides body and texture and nice hold without being stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly a healthier alternative.</li>
            <li>This is a nice pleasant natural citrus type scent not a heavy perfume or chemical fake smell.</li>
            <li>Smells great but a waste of money since it doesn&#x27;t actually hold your hair, even when putting a lot on.</li>
            <li>Very acceptable aroma.</li>
            <li>Thanks for shipping it in a way  that didn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li>This spray really holds my hair.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t purchase this particular product again as it does nothing to hold my short fine hair.</li>
            <li>It gives a medium hold that does not weigh down the hair, and has a light, fresh scent that does not linger.  </li>
            <li>Decent hold, a little sticky if you live in a humid area, but otherwise a nice (healthier) alternative to hair spray.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this hairspray because I&#x27;m looking for a natural alternative with a good EWG rating, but this one is no good for me.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for something natural to hold curls/waves decently and control fly-aways, this is your hair spray!</li>
            <li>I really like this natural hairspray product.  </li>
            <li>This spray is okay but goes on too stiff for my preference.  </li>
            <li>It also seems to weigh down my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I especially appreciate that the formula does not leave the hair sticky to the touch, unlike many other hair sprays.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many but this one holds all day especially for a medium hold and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li>Soft natural results.    </li>
            <li>Besides, it contains alcohol, which is not what I wanted in a natural hair spray.</li>
            <li>My old review was 5 stars and lengthy as to</li>
            <li>This is the natural version of Paul Mitchell&#x27;s freeze and shine hairspray.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really have much hold at all, but doesn&#x27;t ry out my hair like other hair sprays.  </li>
            <li>with strong hold sprays in the past I didn&#x27;t need pins even, they&#x27;re so strong).&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to be as advanced or tough as mainstream brands of hair spray, but I definitely believe that it works and is worth it.  </li>
            <li>It helps hold your style and handles fly-aways, but it&#x27;s also flexible so your hair doesn&#x27;t feel super stiff.</li>
            <li>If I spray just a little, it makes my hair kind of stiff and unmovable, and if I spray too much, it looks wet first, and then slightly oily/dirty.</li>
            <li>Too little spray and my hair won&#x27;t stay put but spraying more weighs my hair down and makes it crunchy...hate that.</li>
            <li>This is a must buy if you&#x27;re looking for a natural hairspray this actually works.</li>
            <li>Bring back the old spray bottle.</li>
            <li>I really like this hair spray because unlike other hair sprays this one does not leave my hair feeling itchy where its been sprayed.</li>
            <li>I like my other hairspray, Giovanni, much better, but it has a higher EWG rating unfortunately.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s more than I want to pay when half of it is wasted!</li>

            <li> that&#x27;s more than I want to pay when half of it is wasted!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this organic hair spray, but I found it made my hair very stiff, sticky and weighed it down.  </li>
            <li> This is the only hair spray I will use on my daughter now, she use to have the same problem with other hair sprays, they would cause her to want to itch her head</li>
            <li> Holds very well, for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Have to put a towel around my shoulders and wash my face and neck with washcloth after spraying my hair,&lt;br /&gt; as it is such a wet spray, not a fine mist.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little less toxic than regular hairsprays.</li>
            <li> Holds hair in place, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This hairspray just weighed it down, it felt gunky.</li>
            <li> When You pump it,there&#x27;s a lot of excess that runs down the bottle.</li>
            <li> Maybe you like a slightly greasy look to your locks after styling?</li>
            <li> The floor and walls do get a little sticky.</li>
            <li> But for me its too messy.</li>
            <li> It does fade after a few minutes regardless.</li>
            <li> I do a few squirts to hold my bangs, and that&#x27;s all it takes.</li>
            <li> It holds well without being stiff or crunchy.</li>
            <li> so I use both--wash hair--apply small amount of gel--dry--use curling iron--spray.</li>
            <li> Sadly going back to my toxic spray can.</li>
            <li> It is not sticky and hard like sprays I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> The bottle itself lasts for at least a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I HATE the new spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Not good if you are straightening curly hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a harsh, artificial smell, which I like.  </li>
            <li> This is annoying and wastes a lot of the hairspray.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> It had no hold and caused terrible dandruff.</li>
            <li> Holds your hair without a horrible smell and is non-aerosol.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Decent hold, a little sticky if you live in a humid area, but otherwise a nice (healthier) alternative to hair spray.</li>
            <li> Works well and smells good and it&#x27;s a little less toxic than regular hairsprays.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two years and love it. I need a hairspray that holds in place not one that makes your hair like cement or a plastic sculpture. If you like a medium hold hair spray that is good enough for daytime use or for use before going out in the evening this is fine. If you want one that can sculpt and harden your hair into a helmet this is not going to be enough. This is considered a medium hold spray. I love the pump spray instead of aerosol. This is a nice pleasant natural citrus type scent not a heavy perfume or chemical fake smell. I rate this 5 stars &#x3D; I Love It.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair spray because unlike other hair sprays this one does not leave my hair feeling itchy where its been sprayed. The hold is medium, great for fly a ways. This is the only hair spray I will use on my daughter now, she use to have the same problem with other hair sprays, they would cause her to want to itch her head and then her hair would get messed up. This one she has not had a problem with at all which is great for me because now I don&#x27;t have to keep fixing her hair.</li>
            <li> This is a must buy if you&#x27;re looking for a natural hairspray this actually works. I have tried so many but this one holds all day especially for a medium hold and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> Not good if you are straightening curly hair. Once you spray, the hair frizzes up.</li>
            <li> It had no hold and caused terrible dandruff.</li>
            <li> I really love this line of products! This spray does a good job of staying with you. It smells wonderful and helps against humidity.  I have fine hair and will definately but again!</li>
            <li> To me, this is a coating and doesn&#x27;t work with your hair, it lays on top of it.  I like a more natural hold.  But I could see it being useful if you wanted to freeze a style in place.  I still like the ingredients, and am going to keep working with it.</li>
            <li> I like the pump instead of the spray type.  It holds very well if not put on heavily.  A light spray is all you need!  The floor and walls do get a little sticky.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price for such a good product.  I will definitely buy this again..  It  holds your hair in place without stiffness.  Eleanor Lucas</li>
            <li> I am happy to find this hair spray after searching periodically over literally decades. I just recently decided to try again. All the chemicals and perfumes and/or alcohol in the others was finally unacceptable to me. This hair spray has fabulous natural ingredients, provides body and texture and nice hold without being stiff or sticky. It has a mild citrus scent which doesn&#x27;t stay like the others do.  I have since discovered the Andalou sunflower and citrus gel so I use both--wash hair--apply small amount of gel--dry--use curling iron--spray. Soft natural results.    Edit 8 14 14  If it&#x27;s possible I like this even better than my initial review. I hope this company never sells out to any of the mega-corps because they&#x27;ll ruin it.</li>
            <li> Does a great job as a light styling spray which is exactly what I wanted, no sticky at all, would not recommend if you need something for extra holds or an up do but great for everyday use to hold down friz and keep your hair in place.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an all-natural (no gross, cancer-causing chemicals) hair spray that would help me style my hair without worrying about poisoning my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews were good, so I tried this out! It definitely does what it says it does - it&#x27;s a good medium hold. It helps hold your style and handles fly-aways, but it&#x27;s also flexible so your hair doesn&#x27;t feel super stiff. I wouldn&#x27;t say it has a 12-hour hold (like a really strong hold would do), but I think for an 8-hour work-day it should work fine, which is what a medium hold should do. Since it&#x27;s only a medium hold, you still need pins and stuff to hold up chunks of your hair (with strong hold sprays in the past I didn&#x27;t need pins even, they&#x27;re so strong).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something natural to hold curls/waves decently and control fly-aways, this is your hair spray!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hairspray for a few months, and I think it does a pretty good job of holding my hair into place when I need it too.  It doesn&#x27;t have a harsh, artificial smell, which I like.  Actually, I think the scent itself is really nice and refreshing.  It&#x27;s not going to be as advanced or tough as mainstream brands of hair spray, but I definitely believe that it works and is worth it.  It&#x27;s certainly a healthier alternative.</li>
            <li> I really like this natural hairspray product.  it smells lovely and holds beautifully.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Provides a light hold.  Smells orangish but a processed orange scent.  It meets my needs but will probably not order again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really have much hold at all, but doesn&#x27;t ry out my hair like other hair sprays.  I won&#x27;t purchase this particular product again as it does nothing to hold my short fine hair.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this hairspray because I&#x27;m looking for a natural alternative with a good EWG rating, but this one is no good for me.  I have alot of curly hair, but each hair is fine, so its really frizzy.  This hairspray just weighed it down, it felt gunky. I like my other hairspray, Giovanni, much better, but it has a higher EWG rating unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Works and smell great!</li>
            <li> Holds hair in place, a little goes a long way. Rita</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn on my scalp. It is not sticky and hard like sprays I have used in the past. Very acceptable aroma. Finally found the best I have used and it is a great one.</li>
            <li> This spray is perfect for fine hair. It gives a medium hold that does not weigh down the hair, and has a light, fresh scent that does not linger.  I especially appreciate that the formula does not leave the hair sticky to the touch, unlike many other hair sprays.  Excellent product overall!</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray. It holds well without being stiff or crunchy. It scores low on the EWG list as well!</li>
            <li> Smells great but a waste of money since it doesn&#x27;t actually hold your hair, even when putting a lot on.</li>
            <li> Great product! Excellent packing....Thanks for shipping it in a way  that didn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this organic hair spray, but I found it made my hair very stiff, sticky and weighed it down.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I hoped it would be. I have fine hair and can&#x27;t find a balance in using this. Too little spray and my hair won&#x27;t stay put but spraying more weighs my hair down and makes it crunchy...hate that.</li>
            <li> This spray really holds my hair. But for me its too messy. Have to put a towel around my shoulders and wash my face and neck with washcloth after spraying my hair,&lt;br /&gt; as it is such a wet spray, not a fine mist.  Sadly going back to my toxic spray can.</li>
            <li> If I spray just a little, it makes my hair kind of stiff and unmovable, and if I spray too much, it looks wet first, and then slightly oily/dirty. It also seems to weigh down my fine hair. Besides, it contains alcohol, which is not what I wanted in a natural hair spray. So, I&#x27;ll keep looking for something better...</li>
            <li> Scent is too strong for me.</li>
            <li> My old review was 5 stars and lengthy as to it&#x27;s formula. I HATE the new spray bottle. When You pump it,there&#x27;s a lot of excess that runs down the bottle. This is annoying and wastes a lot of the hairspray. At  $8.00 a bottle that&#x27;s more than I want to pay when half of it is wasted! Bring back the old spray bottle. Thinking of looking for another hairspray.</li>
            <li> Excellent product without any toxic chemicals.  Works great and smells very nice...like tangerines.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;.  This is the only hairspray I can use without having a reaction.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Holds my hair in place without making it crunchy or sticky. The bottle itself lasts for at least a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Not bad for a hair spray. Just be careful not to squirt too much or your hair gets kind of soggy. I like the smell okay. It does fade after a few minutes regardless. I do a few squirts to hold my bangs, and that&#x27;s all it takes.</li>
            <li> Holds very well, for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Love this hair spray!  Holds your hair without a horrible smell and is non-aerosol.  Listed as a &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; (low hazard) on www.ewg.org.</li>
            <li> This spray is okay but goes on too stiff for my preference.  It might be better if it came in a can which can provide a finer mist.</li>
            <li> This is the natural version of Paul Mitchell&#x27;s freeze and shine hairspray. Although it takes a little longer to set, the holding power is great! Great hairspray!</li>
            <li> Are you looking for a hairspray that just gets your hair wet but offers zero hold? Maybe you like a slightly greasy look to your locks after styling? Look no further than Andalou Naturals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it smells like lemon and garbage.</li>
