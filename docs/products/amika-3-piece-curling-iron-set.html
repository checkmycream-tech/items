            <li>I liked the product while it lasted.</li>
            <li>: Looks nice    Found it on Amazon cheaper</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey but its worth every penny, if you want the best you only shop for the best.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!!! :)</li>
            <li>Fantastic easy to use loved</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I love how tw wands are interchangeable.</li>
            <li>I the wands leaves your hair silky smooth!</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite medium barrel (The 1 inch?)</li>
            <li>I am totally in love with this product as it does the job.</li>
            <li>When sold in stores it&#x27;s easily $250 and up.</li>
            <li>Super convenient!</li>
            <li>This is very easy to use, though you won&#x27;t think so the first time you try it.  </li>
            <li>It gets super hot and curls very easily.</li>
            <li>Girlfriend will be excited    </li>
            <li>However, when I received the item it came in the original package, as I have seen this product in stores</li>
            <li>Good thing about Amika is its long curling shaft - 6 1/2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The middle sized barrel is my favorite!</li>
            <li>easy - quick - save with gloves - professional</li>
            <li>It is beautiful to look at and well made, but in my course thick hair; it didn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li>it had gorgeous hair and compliments  all the time; however,  after a year and a half of use it broke does not heat up just continually flashes in error message not durable at all for the price</li>
            <li>The curls are nice, but there is a difference making me question if this one is a fake; its still a good curler though.</li>
            <li>Having the three different barrels is really nice but this curling iron is just decent.</li>
            <li>recommendation is to give this several try within the 30 day return window to make sure you did not receive a defective item.</li>
            <li>Amika also gives shiny pretty curls.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll burn yourself the first couple of times but you&#x27;ll survive.  </li>
            <li>When I use my friends amika curler that she got from sephora, I notice it produces different (better) curls than this one.</li>
            <li>You get so many different looks with just three rods!</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>looks huge, i didnt expect it to be this big</li>
            <li>There just isn&#x27;t a way to get enough pull to smooth the hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not having much luck, although the other two barrels work perfectly fine...</li>
            <li>it seems to have a short somewhere because an error sign began appearing pretty soon after I purchased it.</li>
            <li>and it last the whole day</li>
            <li>I became busy and didn&#x27;t use this for quite a while.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if I should contact Amika directly to see if they might replace the barrel for me...</li>
            <li>so my old curling iron took me about 45 minutes to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>The longer barrel helps so much for my long hair too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, in July after minimal use, it started acting funny.  </li>
            <li>I was a little optimistic about purchasing this item in fear of it not being a real Amika product.</li>

            <li> long.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> the curl would not hold very long.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY curling iron EVER to make my thick coarse long hair hold a curl.  </li>
            <li> I gave it to my hair stylist because it does work for other types of hair.  </li>
            <li> I got so used to using Amika curling wand that I had to return the other brand.</li>
            <li> A few hours later my curls would be limp.</li>
            <li> I found out hard way that other known brand curling wand may have a shorter curling shaft such as 5 &amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not worth $135.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and thought that probably my hair will look a little frizzy and dry because of the extensive heat, on the contrary</li>
            <li> I tried it out a few times and no matter what I did (hair spray etc.)</li>
            <li> Initially I tried a few times and gave it up due to its difficult learning curve.</li>
            <li> My hare is thin, and long  </li>
            <li> After a several months, I got frustrated using clip curling iron and opened this item back again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, since I waited too long, I cannot return the product to Amazon or ask for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I read a few reviews stating it&#x27;s fake etc.</li>
            <li> , I was not happy about that, I did not try it so I cant say anything about functionality, i had to return.</li>
            <li> The packaging inside was broken, the pamphlets were faded, and the warning labels on the curling iron were faded as well, so it appeared to be used.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately i&#x27;m well  past my return/replace items date, so this makes me sad..</li>
            <li> The set DOES come with the heat resistant glove but it is annoying to use because the fingers are so long on it!  </li>
            <li> Still Expensive    </li>
            <li> Needless to say it stopped working in August.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Which is outrageous!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I absolutely love this curling iron!! It is a bit pricey but its worth every penny, if you want the best you only shop for the best. Works wonders with my hair.Super convenient! Totally recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the reviews, and it came wonderful. I have very thin hair and thought that probably my hair will look a little frizzy and dry because of the extensive heat, on the contrary I got an extremely beautiful curly silky hair and it last the whole day and it only took me 20 minutes to do it. I definetely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I liked the product while it lasted. I purchased this product a year ago and only used it twice. It gave beautiful, long-lasting curls and waves both times. I became busy and didn&#x27;t use this for quite a while. Recently, in preparation for my engagement shoot, I took out the product and wanted to use it again. However, once I plugged the wand in, it started heating up and in about 3 seconds, it displayed a blanking &amp;#34;Err&amp;#34; message and stopped heating up. I tried all three barrels and three different outlets in my house. I also tried resetting the product as well, but nothing helped. Unfortunately, since I waited too long, I cannot return the product to Amazon or ask for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is to give this several try within the 30 day return window to make sure you did not receive a defective item.</li>
            <li> My hare is thin, and long  and I used to curl it with the straigthner It would only burn my hair.The Amika is perfect for my hair it curls it with ut burning it and the curls last all day I would defenetely recomend it.</li>
            <li> I just recently bought my girlfriend this product, and its all ive heard for the last week. She tested one in our local mall and loves it.   Pros: Looks nice    Found it on Amazon cheaper then local sale    Girlfriend will be excited    Supposed to save 10% with this review  Cons:  Still Expensive    Cheaper shipping the day after i ordered it</li>
            <li> The product would receive 5 stars if it worked the way it did when I initially received it in April.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, in July after minimal use, it started acting funny.  It would heat up and would  add some curls and then it would just shut off. The on button had to be constantly pressed for it work.  Needless to say it stopped working in August.  I am now stuck with a product that will not turn on and it is after the 90 days for me to return it.  Is there a warranty on the product?  Can I return it?  I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The best from the best!  what can i say.... easy - quick - save with gloves - professional - that&#x27;s all</li>
            <li> It is beautiful to look at and well made, but in my course thick hair; it didn&#x27;t work at all.  I tried it several times and had to give up and go back to a standard curling iron or a straightening iron.  I wanted it to do spiral curls.  I gave it to my hair stylist because it does work for other types of hair.  I would not recommend it though, for ethnic hair or hair that tends to be frizzy.  There just isn&#x27;t a way to get enough pull to smooth the hair.</li>
            <li> This was bought about a year ago.  Initially I tried a few times and gave it up due to its difficult learning curve. Instead of returning it, I kept in a box just in case.  After a several months, I got frustrated using clip curling iron and opened this item back again. After a several trial, I mastered the technique.  This is an amazing curling tool!  The barrels are about 18mm, 24mm, and 31mm.  Good thing about Amika is its long curling shaft - 6 1/2&amp;#34; long. I found out hard way that other known brand curling wand may have a shorter curling shaft such as 5 &amp;#34;  It was too short to curl my medium-long hair around it. I got so used to using Amika curling wand that I had to return the other brand. Ths longer shaft just makes the curling job a lot easier! Amika also gives shiny pretty curls.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY curling iron EVER to make my thick coarse long hair hold a curl.  I would definitely recommend using this with Redken Spray Starch.  I curled my hair yesterday morning at 9am.  It is 1pm the next day and I still have perfect hair.  This thing is ridiculously awesome.  You have to literally wash out the curls to make them go away.  The set DOES come with the heat resistant glove but it is annoying to use because the fingers are so long on it!  Just don&#x27;t use it...you&#x27;ll burn yourself the first couple of times but you&#x27;ll survive.  :)  This is very easy to use, though you won&#x27;t think so the first time you try it.  The second and third times get to be a piece of cake.</li>
            <li> Fantastic easy to use loved it had gorgeous hair and compliments  all the time; however,  after a year and a half of use it broke does not heat up just continually flashes in error message not durable at all for the price</li>
            <li> When I use my friends amika curler that she got from sephora, I notice it produces different (better) curls than this one. The curls are nice, but there is a difference making me question if this one is a fake; its still a good curler though.</li>
            <li> looks huge, i didnt expect it to be this big, It arrived as if it was used and  return, I was not happy about that, I did not try it so I cant say anything about functionality, i had to return.</li>
            <li> Having the three different barrels is really nice but this curling iron is just decent. I tried it out a few times and no matter what I did (hair spray etc.) the curl would not hold very long. A few hours later my curls would be limp. It&#x27;s certainly not worth $135.</li>
            <li> The product works quite well. The packaging inside was broken, the pamphlets were faded, and the warning labels on the curling iron were faded as well, so it appeared to be used.</li>
            <li> Schade für so ein Teueres Gerät hätte noch ein Reisestecker für Europa dabei sein können, dann war auch die Rechnung nicht an der Verpackung so das man extra zum Zollamt fahren musste um die Ware abzuholen und zu bezahlen. Ansonten ist es ein Geschenk gewesen und die Empfängerin ist glücklich.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is great! You get so many different looks with just three rods! It gets super hot and curls very easily. Definitely recommend wearing the glove, because I burnt myself a couple times... Definitely worth the money!!! :)</li>
            <li> I love how tw wands are interchangeable. The sleekness I the wands leaves your hair silky smooth! Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> The middle sized barrel is my favorite! Best curling wand I&#x27;ve ever used and I love it. The curls are amazing. The longer barrel helps so much for my long hair too!</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife and she loves it</li>
            <li> There is no clip to hold the hair and you have to use a glove. My hairdresser had it and after she used it on me i had to have it that night. Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> While I do think this wand is fantastic, I think I unfortunately got one with a defect... Don&#x27;t get me wrong, IT&#x27;S FANTASTIC but I&#x27;ve had an issue with the interchangeable wands.. My favorite medium barrel (The 1 inch?) it seems to have a short somewhere because an error sign began appearing pretty soon after I purchased it. A girlfriend of mine fooled around with it and had it working for me again... She did something with a wire, I have no idea.. but basically, the medium barrel wasn&#x27;t connecting properly and she got it working again. A year later it is now giving me the error sign again and I&#x27;m not having much luck, although the other two barrels work perfectly fine... Unfortunately i&#x27;m well  past my return/replace items date, so this makes me sad.. I&#x27;m wondering if I should contact Amika directly to see if they might replace the barrel for me... hmmmm....</li>
            <li> I was a little optimistic about purchasing this item in fear of it not being a real Amika product. As I read a few reviews stating it&#x27;s fake etc. However, when I received the item it came in the original package, as I have seen this product in stores and it&#x27;s the same box. When sold in stores it&#x27;s easily $250 and up. Which is outrageous! So when I saw that this one was $117 for 3 different curling pieces, I knew I had to have it. I am totally in love with this product as it does the job. I have long hair so my old curling iron took me about 45 minutes to curl my hair. As this one I wake up and in 10 - 15 minutes my hair is done. Nothing is more easier or perfect than this product!</li>
